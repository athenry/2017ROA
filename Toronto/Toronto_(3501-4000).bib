Abstract = {{Vancomycin resistance in Gram-positive bacteria is due to production of
   cell-wall precursors ending in D-Ala-D-Lac or D-Ala-D-Ser, to which
   vancomycin exhibits low binding affinities, and to the elimination of
   the high-affinity precursors ending in D-Ala-D-Ala. Depletion of the
   susceptible high-affinity precursors is catalyzed by the zinc-dependent
   D,D-peptidases VanX and VanY acting on dipeptide (D-Ala-D-Ala) or
   pentapeptide (UDP-MurNac-L-Ala-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala), respectively.
   Some of the vancomycin resistance operons encode VanXY
   D,D-carboxypeptidase, which hydrolyzes both di- and pentapeptide. The
   molecular basis for the diverse specificity of Van D,D-peptidases
   remains unknown. We present the crystal structures of VanXY(C) and
   VanXY(G) in apo and transition state analog-bound forms and of VanXY(C)
   in complex with the D-Ala-D-Ala substrate and D-Ala product. Structural
   and biochemical analysis identified the molecular determinants of VanXY
   dual specificity. VanXY residues 110-115 form a mobile cap over the
   catalytic site, whose flexibility is involved in the switch between di-
   and pentapeptide hydrolysis. Structure-based alignment of the Van
   D,D-peptidases showed that VanY enzymes lack this element, which
   promotes binding of the penta-rather than that of the dipeptide. The
   structures also highlight the molecular basis for selection of
   D-Ala-ending precursors over the modified resistance targets. These
   results illustrate the remarkable adaptability of the D,D-peptidase fold
   in response to antibiotic pressure via evolution of specific structural
   elements that confer hydrolytic activity against vancomycin-susceptible
   peptidoglycan precursors.}},

Title = {{Online transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic control of an onscreen
   keyboard}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{Brain-computer interface(BCI) systems exploit brain activity for
   generating a control command and may be used by individuals with severe
   motor disabilities as an alternative means of communication. An emerging
   brain monitoring modality for BCI development is transcranial Doppler
   ultrasonography (TCD), which facilitates the tracking of cerebral blood
   flow velocities associated with mental tasks. However, TCD-BCI studies
   to date have exclusively been offline. The feasibility of a TCD-based
   BCI system hinges on its online performance. In this paper, an online
   TCD-BCI system was implemented, bilaterally tracking blood flow
   velocities in the middle cerebral arteries for system-paced control of a
   scanning keyboard. Target letters or words were selected by repetitively
   rehearsing the spelling while imagining the writing of the intended
   word, a left-lateralized task. Undesired letters or words were bypassed
   by performing visual tracking, a non-lateralized task. The keyboard
   scanning period was 15 s. With 10 able-bodied right-handed young adults,
   the two mental tasks were differentiated online using a Naive Bayes
   classification algorithm and a set of time-domain, user-dependent
   features. The system achieved an average specificity and sensitivity of
   81.44 +/- 8.35 and 82.30 +/- 7.39\%, respectively. The level of
   agreement between the intended and machine-predicted selections was
   moderate(k = 0.60). The average information transfer rate was 0.87
   bits/min with an average throughput of 0.31 +/- 0.12 character/min.
   These findings suggest that an online TCD-BCI can achieve reasonable
   accuracies with an intuitive language task, but with modest throughput.
   Future interface and signal classification enhancements are required to
   improve communication rate.}},

   Measurements and discrete element predictions}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{123-135}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{Both the local impact and bulk How velocities within a tub vibratory
   finisher were predicted using discrete element modeling (DEM) and
   compared to the measured values for spherical steel media. The
   sensitivities of the predicted impact velocities to uncertainties in the
   contact coefficients (friction, restitution and rolling friction) were
   studied, beginning with an analytical model of two body collision. The
   sensitivity analysis was then extended to a simplified DE model of the
   flow within the vibratory finisher consisting of a single layer of
   particles moving between parallel sheets of glass It was observed that
   the impact and bulk flow velocities were relatively insensitive to
   uncertainties in the coefficients of friction and restitution. These
   coefficients were measured for the particle particle and the particle
   wall interactions for the steel media and tub wall using a linear
   tribometer and a laser displacement sensor. Several DE models with
   different numbers of particle layers between the glass partitions were
   compared, and it was concluded that the predicted impact and bulk flow
   velocities were dependent on the number of layers in the model.
   Consequently, the final DE model mimicked the key aspects of the
   experimental setup, including the submerged laser displacement sensor
   used to make the measurements of bulk flow and impact velocity. Another
   investigation showed that a reduced shear modulus could be used in the
   model to decrease run times without significantly affecting either the
   bulk flow or impact velocities. The DE method predictions of both impact
   velocity and bulk flow velocity were in reasonable agreement with the
   experimental measurements at points within the vibrationally-fluidized
   bed, with maximum differences of 20\% and 30\%, respectively. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The xylan-binding module Clostridium thermocellum CBM22A was
   successfully fused to a gluco-oligosaccharide oxidase, GOOX-VN, from
   Sarocladium strictum via a short TP linker, allowing the fused protein

   the N-terminal of GOOX-VN increased catalytic activity on mono-and
   oligo-saccharides by 2-3 fold while not affecting binding affinity to
   these substrates. Notably, both GOOX-VN and its CBM fusion also showed
   oxidation of xylo-oligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization
   greater than six. Whereas fusion to CtCBM22A did not alter the
   thermostability of GOOX-VN or reduce substrate inhibition,
   CtCBM22A\_GOOX-VN could be immobilized to insoluble oat spelt xylan
   while retaining wild-type activity. QCM-D analysis showed that the fused

Abstract = {{Organohalide respiration, mediated by Dehalococcoides mccartyi, is a
   useful bioremediation process that transforms ground water pollutants
   and known human carcinogens such as trichloroethene and vinyl chloride
   into benign ethenes. Successful application of this process depends on
   the fundamental understanding of the respiration and metabolism of D.
   mccartyi. Reductive dehalogenases, encoded by rdhA genes of these
   anaerobic bacteria, exclusively catalyze organohalide respiration and
   drive metabolism. To better elucidate D. mccartyi metabolism and
   physiology, we analyzed available transcriptomic data for a pure isolate
   (Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain 195) and a mixed microbial consortium
   (KB-1) using the previously developed pan-genome-scale reconstructed
   metabolic network of D. mccartyi. The transcriptomic data, together with
   available proteomic data helped confirm transcription and expression of
   the majority genes in D. mccartyi genomes. A composite genome of two
   highly similar D. mccartyi strains (KB-1 Dhc) from the KB-1 metagenome
   sequence was constructed, and operon prediction was conducted for this
   composite genome and other single genomes. This operon analysis,
   together with the quality threshold clustering analysis of
   transcriptomic data helped generate experimentally testable hypotheses
   regarding the function of a number of hypothetical proteins and the
   poorly understood mechanism of energy conservation in D. mccartyi. We
   also identified functionally enriched important clusters (13 for strain
   195 and 11 for KB-1 Dhc) of co-expressed metabolic genes using
   information from the reconstructed metabolic network. This analysis
   highlighted some metabolic genes and processes, including lipid
   metabolism, energy metabolism, and transport that potentially play
   important roles in organohalide respiration. Overall, this study shows
   the importance of an organism's metabolic reconstruction in analyzing
   various ``omics{''} data to obtain improved understanding of the
   metabolism and physiology of the organism.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Nonfibrillar amyloid oligomers are cytotoxic and may act
   through physical disruption of cell membranes. Results: Cytotoxic
   oligomers of the amyloid peptide PrP(106-126) disrupt membranes through
   distinct mechanisms, depending on lipid composition. Conclusion:
   Cytotoxicity of PrP(106-126) oligomers can occur through at least two
   different physical processes. Significance: Mechanisms for the membrane
   disruption of amyloid oligomers are proposed, providing new insight into
   their cytotoxicity.
   The formation of fibrillar aggregates has long been associated with
   neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases.
   Although fibrils are still considered important to the pathology of
   these disorders, it is now widely understood that smaller amyloid
   oligomers are the toxic entities along the misfolding pathway. One
   characteristic shared by the majority of amyloid oligomers is the
   ability to disrupt membranes, a commonality proposed to be responsible
   for their toxicity, although the mechanisms linking this to cell death
   are poorly understood. Here, we describe the physical basis for the
   cytotoxicity of oligomers formed by the prion protein (PrP)-derived
   amyloid peptide PrP(106-126). We show that oligomers of this peptide
   kill several mammalian cells lines, as well as mouse cerebellar
   organotypic cultures, and we also show that they exhibit antimicrobial
   activity. Physical perturbation of model membranes mimicking bacterial
   or mammalian cells was investigated using atomic force microscopy,
   polarized total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, and NMR
   spectroscopy. Disruption of anionic membranes proceeds through a carpet
   or detergent model as proposed for other antimicrobial peptides. By
   contrast, when added to zwitterionic membranes containing
   cholesterol-rich ordered domains, PrP(106-126) oligomers induce a loss
   of domain separation and decreased membrane disorder. Loss of raft-like
   domains may lead to activation of apoptotic pathways, resulting in cell
   death. This work sheds new light on the physical mechanisms of amyloid
   cytotoxicity and is the first to clearly show membrane type-specific
   modes of action for a cytotoxic peptide.}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Bounded geometries introduce a fundamental problem in calculating the
   image force barrier lowering of metal-wrapped semiconductor systems. In
   bounded geometries, the derivation of the barrier lowering requires
   calculating the reference energy of the system, when the charge is at
   the geometry center. In the following, we formulate and rigorously solve
   this problem; this allows combining the image force electrostatic
   potential with the band diagram of the bounded geometry. The suggested
   approach is applied to spheres as well as cylinders. Furthermore,
   although the expressions governing cylindrical systems are complex and
   can only be evaluated numerically, we present analytical approximations
   for the solution, which allow easy implementation in calculated band
   diagrams. The results are further used to calculate the image force
   barrier lowering of metal-wrapped cylindrical nanowires; calculations
   show that although the image force potential is stronger than that of
   planar systems, taking the complete band-structure into account results
   in a weaker effect of barrier lowering. Moreover, when considering small
   diameter nanowires, we find that the electrostatic effects of the image
   force exceed the barrier region, and influence the electronic properties
   of the nanowire core. This study is of interest to the nanowire
   community, and in particular for the analysis of nanowire I-V
   measurements where wrapped or omega-shaped metallic contacts are used.}},

Abstract = {{While the heightened tumor accumulation of systemically administered
   nanomedicines relative to conventional chemotherapeutic agents has been
   well established, corresponding improvements in therapeutic efficacy
   have often been incommensurate. This observation may be attributed to
   the limited exposure of cancer cells to therapy due to the heterogeneous
   intratumoral distribution and poor interstitial penetration of
   nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems. In the present work, the
   spatio-temporal distribution of block copolymer micelles (BCMs) of
   different sizes was evaluated in multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS)
   and tumor xenografts originating from human cervical (HeLa) and colon
   (HT29) cancer cells using image-based, computational techniques. Micelle
   penetration was found to depend on nanoparticle size, time as well as
   tumor and spheroid cell line. Moreover, spheroids demonstrated the
   capacity to predict relative trends in nanoparticle interstitial
   transport in tumor xenografts. Overall, techniques are presented for the
   assessment of nanoparticle distribution in spheroids and xenografts and
   used to evaluate the influence of micelle size and cell-line specific
   tissue properties on micelle interstitial penetration. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Month = {{APR 9}},
Abstract = {{Experiments and three-dimensional direct numerical simulations were
   performed to investigate the effects of physical parameters on the
   repulsion or attraction force affecting the motion of a particle
   oscillating near a solid wall of a fluid cell under microgravity. The
   following physical parameters were investigated: fluid cell amplitude,
   fluid and particle densities, angular frequency of the cell vibration,
   initial distance between the particle centroid and the closest cell
   wall, particle radius, and dynamic viscosity. Based on the simulations,
   a nondimensional relation was developed to relate those physical
   parameters to the repulsion or attraction force affecting the particle.
   The relation shows that the repulsion or attraction force is increased
   by the increase in the cell vibration amplitude and frequency and also
   the force direction would change from attraction to repulsion above a
   threshold fluid viscosity. Relations to other physical parameters were
   also studied and are reported. This paper follows our previous work on
   the physical mechanism of observed repulsion force on a particle in a

   was designed as both a good ligand and host matrix. Codeposition of
   CPPyC and copper iodide (Cul) gives luminescent films with

   copper(1) complex Cu2I2(CPPyC)(4) is formed in the thin film,
   characterized by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. A series of simple,
   highly efficient green-emitting OLEDs were demonstrated by using the
   codeposited film as an emissive layer. A device comprised of only CPPyC
   and Cul gave an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 12.6\% (42.3 cd/A)

Abstract = {{A computational model utilizing grid and finite difference methods were
   developed to simulate focused ultrasound functional neurosurgery
   interventions. The model couples the propagation of ultrasound in fluids
   (soft tissues) and solids (skull) with acoustic and visco-elastic wave
   equations. The computational model was applied to simulate clinical
   focused ultrasound functional neurosurgery treatments performed in
   patients suffering from therapy resistant chronic neuropathic pain.
   Datasets of five patients were used to derive the treatment geometry.
   Eight sonications performed in the treatments were then simulated with
   the developed model. Computations were performed by driving the
   simulated phased array ultrasound transducer with the acoustic
   parameters used in the treatments. Resulting focal temperatures and size
   of the thermal foci were compared quantitatively, in addition to
   qualitative inspection of the simulated pressure and temperature fields.
   This study found that the computational model and the simulation
   parameters predicted an average of 24 +/- 13\% lower focal temperature
   elevations than observed in the treatments. The size of the simulated
   thermal focus was found to be 40 +/- 13\% smaller in the
   anterior-posterior direction and 22 +/- 14\% smaller in the
   inferior-superior direction than in the treatments. The location of the
   simulated thermal focus was off from the prescribed target by 0.3 +/-
   0.1mm, while the peak focal temperature elevation observed in the
   measurements was off by 1.6 +/- 0.6mm. Although the results of the
   simulations suggest that there could be some inaccuracies in either the
   tissue parameters used, or in the simulation methods, the simulations
   were able to predict the focal spot locations and temperature elevations
   adequately for initial treatment planning performed to assess, for
   example, the feasibility of sonication. The accuracy of the simulations
   could be improved if more precise ultrasound tissue properties
   (especially of the skull bone) could be obtained.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, ethyl cellulose (EC) was treated with three different
   trimethoxysilane coupling agents. Various characterization techniques
   were employed to evaluate silane modification of EC compound.
   Microencapsulated phase change materials based on linseed oil (LO) core
   and un-treated and silane-treated EC shell materials with ratio of LO to
   EC (70:30) were prepared by solvent evaporation method. Morphology and
   shape of microcapsules were studied using optical microscopy and
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray
   analyzer (EDAX). The size distribution of microcapsules was evaluated
   using a particle size analyzer.
   Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR) analyses revealed chemical interactions between EC and three
   different types of trimethoxysilane. Chemical bond (Si-O-C) was formed
   by the reaction between Si-OH and the hydroxyl group of EC. The
   thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) showed 6-12 wt\% silane grafting on
   the EC compound. Microcapsules with a uniform spherical shape 5-35 mu m
   in diameter and 0.5-2.0 mu m in shell thickness were successfully
   prepared using either un-treated or silane-treated EC. SEM micrographs
   of the fractured surface of acrylic coating containing LO filled
   EC-microcapsules showed matrix structure for microcapsules, as results
   of silane treatment of EC shell material.
   The pre-silanized EC-microcapsules can improve mechanical properties of
   water-based self-healing coatings, due to better compatibility of

Abstract = {{Stochastic honeycombs are a cellular polymer fabricated through a simple
   melt-stretching process. In this study, five polypropylenes (PP) with
   varying rheological properties were used to fabricate stochastic
   honeycombs over a range of densities. Rheology tests were performed to
   determine the melt behavior, while micro-CT scans were used as a
   nondestructive characterization technique to determine the internal
   architecture. The sandwich structure consists of parallel skins
   separated by a network of interconnected webs. The cross-sectional area
   decreased from unit area at the skins to a plateau over the middle third
   of the honeycomb height where the cross-sectional area and total edge
   length of the webs were relatively constant. The rheological properties
   of the polymer were found to determine the web length per unit area,
   while the starting areal density of the polymer controlled the
   mid-height cross-sectional area. Other features, such as archways and
   buttresses, act as secondary structures that support the webs. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{In this study, a highly porous and interconnected foam structure was
   fabricated using compression molding combined with particulate-leaching
   technique. The foamed structures were fabricated with polylactide (PLA)
   and polyethylene glycol (PEG) with salt as the particulate. The pore
   size of the foam structure is controlled by the particulates size and
   higher interconnectivity is achieved by the co-continuous blending
   morphology of the PLA matrix with the water-soluble PEG. PLA is a fully
   bio-based thermoplastic polymer and is derived from renewable resources,
   such as cornstarch or sugarcanes. PEG is also fully biodegradable
   polymer produced from ethylene. Fabricated foams were characterized for
   cellular, acoustic, and mechanical properties. The acoustic performance
   of the foams was studied by measuring the normal incident absorption
   coefficient in accordance with the ASTM E1050 standard. The results show
   open porosity as high as 88\% was achieved and the effect of
   water-soluble polymer on cellular properties and acoustic and mechanical
   performance of the foams was studied. As a result of the secondary
   porous structure formed into cell walls by water soluble polymer, the
   overall absorption of fabricated PLA foams was increased to above 90\%
   while the average absorption of the foams remained unchanged. In
   addition, the resulting acoustic foams are benign and environmentally

Abstract = {{This work is to investigate the effectiveness of the surface treatment
   technique of fiber impregnation in polymer solution in improving
   compatibility of natural fibers with matrix. Hemp and sisal fibers were
   treated through polymer coating in comparison to acetylation,
   alkalization/acetylation, and silanization. Different analytical
   techniques were employed to examine effect of surface treatment,
   including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in nitrogen and
   air. FTIR showed acetylation combined with alkalization led to the
   highest hemicellulose and lignin removal among all treated fibers for
   both fibers, while polymer coating led to an increase at peak around
   1,736 cm(-1) due to the carbonyl group. SEM micrographs of treated
   fibers showed cleaner surfaces due to removal of waxy substances and
   lignin during treatments. Thermal stability of treated fibers increased
   based on TGA results except for the alkalized/acetylated fiber.
   Acetylated fibers had the lowest moisture content, thus demonstrating
   that acetylation is an effective technique to reduce the hydrophilic
   tendency of natural fibers. In comparison, polymer coating was not as
   effective as other treatment methods.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Retail stores contain a wide range of products that can emit a variety
   of indoor pollutants. Among these chemicals, phthalate esters and
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are two important categories,
   because they are extensively used as additives in consumer products and
   associated with serious health concerns. This study measured six
   phthalate and 14 PBDE compounds inside of 12 retail stores in Texas and
   Pennsylvania, U.S. Phthalates and PBDEs were widely found in the retail
   environment, indicating that they are ubiquitous indoor air pollutants.
   DEP. DnBP, and DEHP were the most abundant phthalates, with DnBP showing
   the highest concentration (0.23 +/- 0.36 mu g m(-3)). PBDEs were
   dominated by BDE-28, -99, and -209, having concentrations as high as
   0.85 +/- 1.99 ng m(-3) (BDE-99). The levels of phthalates and PBDEs
   measured in this study are comparable to concentrations found in
   previous investigations of residential buildings, with phthalates
   showing lower concentrations and PBDEs exhibiting higher concentrations
   in retail stores. The potential co-occurrence of phthalates was not as
   strong as that of PBDEs, suggesting that phthalates might have more
   diverse sources. Whole building emission rates were calculated and
   showed similar patterns of variations as indoor air concentrations,
   suggestion the diversity of indoor sources of phthalates and PBDEs in
   retail environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{50}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Basis functions for solving partial differential equations of vector
   fields using the finite element method are presented. The basis
   functions are a combination of cubic Hermite splines and second-order
   Lagrange interpolation polynomials and allow the divergence to be set as
   a constraint. The basis functions are tested on 3-D resonant cavities
   and there are no spurious modes. There is good agreement with analytical
   solutions in cases where they exist and with calculations using edge
   elements in other cases. The method is extended to solve problems with
   singularities at edges and corners. For perfect conductors, this
   includes mesh refinement in the neighborhood of the edge or corner. For
   dielectrics, constraints are derived so that the flux of the field is
   zero through a closed surface that contains the edge or corner. The
   method is used to solve problems using the electric and magnetic field
   formulations. Through a change of variables, the method is applied to
   problems in cylindrical coordinates.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{One of the core problems in intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
   treatment planning is the fluence map optimization (FMO) problem, which
   determines a fluence map (or profile) for each beam used in the delivery
   of treatment. Radiation therapy is administered in multiple so-called
   daily fractions to allow for healthy tissue to recover from damage
   caused by the treatment. Before the advent of IMRT, the treatment was
   designed to ensure a constant dose to cells in the target (the areas in
   the patient where cancerous cells are present or suspected). In the
   presence of multiple targets with different prescribed doses, this
   design meant that treatment had to be delivered in a sequence of unequal
   fractions, one per prescription dose level. For example, in case of two
   targets treatment would consist of an initial plan aimed at treating
   both targets to a lower total dose, followed by a so-called boost plan
   aimed at delivering the additional dose at the target with higher
   prescribed dose. In contrast, IMRT treatment plans are often delivered
   with equal treatment plan for each fraction, which means that the dose
   per fraction cannot be the same for all targets. The important problem
   of restoring traditional fractionation to IMRT treatments has not yet
   received much attention in the literature. In this paper we propose a
   new optimization model that explicitly restores fractionation into the
   FMO problem, yielding an optimal set of fluence maps for each fraction.
   We illustrate the capabilities of our approach on clinical head-and-neck
   cancer cases.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to compare the tensile strength of slip knots
   with that of 3-1-1 knots using 10-0 nylon sutures.
   METHODS: In vitro, destructive materials testing was used. By adhering
   to the American Standard for Testing and Materials standards for testing
   of suture materials, slip knots were compared with 3-1-1 knots using
   10-0 nylon suture material. Tensile testing was performed on each knot
   type using the Instron Microtester (Model 5848 Norwood, MA). Scanning
   electron microscopy was used to analyze all sutures tested to failure.
   The main outcome measure was the maximum load (newtons) or ultimate
   tensile strength before which each knot failed by breakage or by
   unraveling.
   RESULTS: The mean force resulting in failure by breakage of the 3-1-1
   knot and slip knot was 0.71 and 0.64 N, respectively (P = 0.048). The
   mean force resulting in failure by the unraveling of the 3-1-1 knot and
   slip knot was 0.48 and 0.37 N, respectively (P = 0.022).
   CONCLUSIONS: In 10-0 nylon sutures, the 3-1-1 knot has a statistically
   significant greater tensile strength than the slip knot has in
   conditions wherein they fail by either breakage or unraveling}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing interest in bubble-mediated focused ultrasound
   (FUS) interventions in the brain. However, current technology lacks the
   ability to spatially monitor the interaction of the microbubbles with

   offer a means for spatially monitoring microbubble emissions that relate

   transcranial therapy array to create a device capable of both delivering
   therapy and monitoring the process via passive imaging of bubble clouds.
   A 128-element receiver array was constructed and characterized for
   varying bubble concentrations and source spacings. Initial in vivo
   feasibility testing was performed. The system was found to be capable of
   monitoring bubble emissions down to single bubble events through an ex
   vivo human skull. The lateral resolution of the system was found to be
   between 1.25 and 2 mm and the axial resolution between 2 and 3.5 mm,
   comparable to the resolution of MRI-based temperature monitoring during
   thermal FUS treatments in the brain. The results of initial in vivo
   experiments show that bubble activity can be mapped starting at pressure
   levels below the threshold for blood-brain barrier disruption. This
   study presents a feasible solution for imaging bubble activity during
   cavitation-mediated FUS treatments in the brain.}},

   explain the pattern are discussed, and a simplified analytical approach

Abstract = {{Processed nerve allografts are increasingly used as off the shelf nerve
   replacements for surgically bridging nerve gaps. Benchmarking the
   regenerative capacity of a commercially available human-derived nerve or
   xenograft in a rat nerve injury model would provide a convenient
   platform for future studies seeking to modify the processed nerve graft.
   Human and rat processed nerve grafts were used to bridge a 14 mm defect
   in a Sprague-Dawley rat sciatic nerve. Reversed autografts served as a
   positive control group. Twelve weeks following surgery, the distal nerve
   stumps were retrograde labeled and harvested for histology and
   histomorphometry. The cross-sectional areas of the human- and
   rat-derived processed nerve grafts were similar. Neuron counts and
   myelinated axon counts following use of the human-derived processed
   xenografts were decreased compared with those obtained from both the
   rat-derived processed nerve allografts and the autografts; the
   rat-derived processed nerve allografts were statistically equivalent to
   autografts. Measures of nerve fiber diameter and myelination revealed
   inferior axon regeneration maturity in both processed nerve grafts
   compared with autografts. Processed xenografts showed significantly
   reduced regeneration compared with autografts or processed allografts
   indicating that cross-species immunological reactions are important
   considerations in this rat model. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Abstract = {{Background: Kinetic data provide important information about the
   mobility performance of individuals with lower limb impairments and
   their assistive devices; however, there is limited understanding of this
   in real-life environments. Objective: To evaluate the effect of
   real-life irregular surfaces on forces and moments in knee-ankle-foot
   orthoses. Methods: In this case series study, a load cell was used to
   measure the forces and moments at the knee joint of knee-ankle-foot
   orthoses of individuals with unilateral muscle weakness as a result of
   poliomyelitis while walking on different ground surfaces and at
   different speeds. Results: Significantly higher shear forces and
   external peak knee flexion moments were found when walking on irregular
   surfaces. In individual cases, certain irregular ground conditions
   elicited large increases in peak flexion moments (>50\%) when compared
   to walking on smooth level ground. Forces and moments were significantly
   higher at faster walking speeds. Conclusions: Higher external peak knee
   flexion moments during the stance phase suggest that greater demands for
   support and stability are placed on individuals and their assistive
   devices when negotiating real-life ground surfaces. Clinical relevance
   This study demonstrates that walking on irregular surfaces alters the
   loads placed on knee-ankle-foot orthoses and that the requirements for
   knee stabilization increase. This has important clinical implications on
   the design, prescription, and use of such devices given the structural
   and functional demands placed on them.}},

Title = {{Comparison of upscaled models for multistage mass discharge from DNAPL
   source zones}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{3187-3205}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Analytical upscaled models that can describe the depletion of dense
   nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) and the associated mass discharge are
   a practical alternative to computationally demanding and data-intensive
   multiphase numerical simulators. A major shortcoming of most existing
   upscaled models is that they cannot reproduce the nonmonotonic,
   multistage effluent concentrations often observed in experiments and
   numerical simulations. Upscaled models that can produce multistage
   concentrations either require calibration, which increases the cost of
   applying them in the field, or use dual-domain conceptual models that
   may not apply for spatially complex source zones. In this study, a new
   upscaled model is presented that can describe the nonmonotonic,
   multistage average concentrations emanating from complex DNAPL source
   zones. This is achieved by explicitly considering the temporal evolution
   of three source zone parameters, namely source zone projected area, the
   average of local-scale DNAPL saturations, and the average of local-scale
   aqueous relative permeability, without using empirical parameters. The
   model is evaluated for two real and twelve hypothetical centimeter-scale
   complex source zones. The proposed model captures the temporal
   variations in concentrations better than an empirical model and a
   dual-domain ganglia-to-pool ratio model. The results provide evidence
   that effluent concentrations downgradient of DNAPL source zones are
   controlled by the evolution of the aforementioned macroscopic
   parameters. This knowledge can be useful for the interpretation of field
   observations of effluent concentrations downstream of DNAPL source
   zones, and for the development of predictive upscaled models. Advances
   in DNAPL characterization techniques are needed to quantify these
   macroscopic parameters that can be used to guide DNAPL remediation

Abstract = {{Numerous methods for available bandwidth estimation have been developed
   for wireline networks, and their effectiveness is well-documented.
   However, most methods fail to predict bandwidth availability reliably in
   a wireless setting. It is accepted that the increased variability of
   wireless channel conditions makes bandwidth estimation more difficult.
   However, a (satisfactory) explanation why these methods are failing is
   missing. This paper seeks to provide insights into the problem of
   bandwidth estimation in wireless networks or, more broadly, in networks
   with random service. We express bandwidth availability in terms of
   bounding functions with a defined violation probability. Exploiting
   properties of a stochastic min-plus linear system theory, the task of
   bandwidth estimation is formulated as inferring an unknown bounding
   function from measurements of probing traffic. We present derivations
   showing that simply using the expected value of the available bandwidth
   in networks with random service leads to a systematic overestimation of
   the traffic departures. Furthermore, we show that in a multihop setting
   with random service at each node, available bandwidth estimates requires
   observations over (in principle infinitely) long time periods. We
   propose a new estimation method for random service that is based on
   iterative constant-rate probes that take advantage of statistical
   methods. We show how our estimation method can be realized to achieve
   both good accuracy and confidence levels. We evaluate our method for
   wired single-and multihop networks, as well as for wireless networks.}},

Abstract = {{The study of nuclear mechanical properties can provide insights into
   nuclear dynamics and its role in cellular mechanotransduction. While
   several methods have been developed to characterize nuclear mechanical
   properties, direct intracellular probing of the nucleus in situ is
   challenging. Here, a modified AFM (atomic force microscopy) needle
   penetration technique is demonstrated to mechanically characterize cell
   nuclei in situ. Cytoplasmic and nuclear stiffness were determined based
   on two different segments on the AFM indentation curves and were
   correlated with simultaneous confocal Z-stack microscopy
   reconstructions. On the basis of direct intracellular measurement, we
   show that the isolated nuclei from fibroblast-like cells exhibited
   significantly lower Young's moduli than intact nuclei in situ. We also
   show that there is in situ nucleus softening in the highly metastatic
   bladder cancer cell line 124 when compared to its less metastatic
   counterpart RT4. This technique has potential to become a reliable
   quantitative measurement tool for intracellular mechanics studies.}},

Abstract = {{Despite decades of search for anticancer drugs targeting solid tumors,
   this group of diseases remains largely incurable, especially if in
   advanced, metastatic stage. In this review, we draw comparison between
   reprogramming and carcinogenesis, as well as between stem cells (SCs)
   and cancer stem cells (CSCs), focusing on changing garniture of adhesion
   molecules. Furthermore, we elaborate on the role of adhesion molecules
   in the regulation of (cancer) SCs division (symmetric or asymmetric),
   and in evolving interactions between CSCs and extracellular matrix.
   Among other aspects, we analyze the role and changes of expression of
   key adhesion molecules as cancer progresses and metastases develop.
   Here, the role of cadherins, integrins, as well as selected
   transcription factors like Twist and Snail is highlighted, not only in
   the regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition but also in the
   avoidance of anoikis. Finally, we briefly discuss recent developments
   and new strategies targeting CSCs, which focus on adhesion molecules or
   targeting tumor vasculature.Adhesion molecules are key participants in
   the metastatic process. Hereby, we illustrate the interconnections
   between stemness maintenance and the evolving role of cell adhesion

Abstract = {{Background
   Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems allow for medical
   order management in a clinical setting. Use of a CPOE has been shown to
   significantly improve chemotherapy safety by reducing the number of
   prescribing errors. Usability of these systems has been identified as a
   critical factor in their successful adoption. However, there is a
   paucity of literature investigating the usability of CPOE for
   chemotherapy and describing the experiences of cancer care providers in
   implementing and using a CPOE system.
   Methods
   A mixed-methods study, including a national survey and a workshop, was
   conducted to determine the current status of CPOE adoption in Canadian
   oncology institutions, to identify and prioritize knowledge gaps in CPOE
   usability and adoption, and to establish a research agenda to bridge
   those gaps. Survey respondents were representatives of cancer care
   providers from each Canadian province. The workshop participants were
   oncology clinicians, human factors engineers, patient safety
   researchers, policymakers, and hospital administrators from across
   Canada, with participation from the United States.
   Results
   A variety of issues related to implementing and using a CPOE for
   chemotherapy were identified. The major issues concerned the need for
   better understanding of current practices of chemotherapy ordering,
   preparation, and administration; a lack of system selection and
   procurement guidance; a lack of implementation and maintenance guidance;
   poor CPOE usability and workflow support; and other CPOE system design
   issues. An additional three research themes for addressing the existing
   challenges and advancing successful adoption of CPOE for chemotherapy
   were identified:
   The need to investigate variances in workflows and practices in
   chemotherapy ordering and administration
   The need to develop best-practice CPOE procurement and implementation
   guidance specifically for chemotherapy
   The need to measure the effects of CPOE implementation in medical
   oncology
   Conclusions
   Addressing the existing challenges in CPOE usability and adoption for
   chemotherapy, and accelerating successful migration to CPOE by cancer
   care providers requires future research focusing on workflow variations,
   chemotherapy-specific CPOE procurement needs, and implementation
   guidance needs.}},

Abstract = {{New blue and blue-green phosphorescent C<\^{}>N chelate Pt(II) compounds
   that contain a dimesitylboryl-functionalized phenyl-1,2,3-triazole

   ancillary ligands, namely acetylacetonato (acac), picolinate (pic) and
   pyridyl-1,2,4-triazolyl (pytrz), on phosphorescence quantum efficiency
   and excimer emission is examined. Pt(II) compounds with a p-Bptrz ligand
   consistently emit a blue-green color with an emission wavelength=
   490-500 nm while those with a m-Bptrz ligand emit a blue color with (em)
   = 450-460 nm and a quantum efficiency as high as 0.97. In addition to
   the blue monomer emission peak, Pt(m-Bptrz)(pytrz) compounds display an
   excimer emission peak at approximate to 550 nm in a solid matrix whose
   intensity is dependent on the substituent group on pytrz and the doping
   concentration. As a result of the monomer and excimer emission, bright
   white phosphorescence is observed for several members of
   Pt(m-Bptrz)(pytrz) compounds. Intramolecular CHN hydrogen bonds are
   found to play an important role in the high stability and high
   phosphorescent quantum efficiency of Pt(m-Bptrz)(pytrz) compounds.
   Single-dopant blue and white electrophosphorescent devices using
   Pt(m-Bptrz)(CF3-pytrz-Me) or Pt(m-Bptrz)(t-Bu-pytrz-Me) as the emitter

Abstract = {{Microbubbles (MBs) are currently used as ultrasound (US) contrast agents
   and as delivery vehicles for site-specific US-triggered drug and gene
   delivery. Multimodal US-based imaging methods have been applied
   preclinically to assess and validate the effectiveness and fate of MBs
   in imaging and therapy. Here we present the first intrinsically trimodal
   MBs by incorporating a dense concentration of porphyrin molecules within
   a MB shell, enabled by the use of a single porphyrin-lipid component.
   These MBs possess US, photoacoustic, and fluorescence properties that
   are demonstrated in solution and in a mouse tumor xenograft model. They
   also have potential to be extended to other imaging modalities such as
   magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear imaging.}},

   distribution}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Quantum key distribution promises unconditionally secure communications.
   However, as practical devices tend to deviate from their specifications,
   the security of some practical systems is no longer valid. In
   particular, an adversary can exploit imperfect detectors to learn a
   large part of the secret key, even though the security proof claims
   otherwise. Recently, a practical approach-measurement-device-independent
   quantum key distribution-has been proposed to solve this problem.
   However, so far its security has only been fully proven under the
   assumption that the legitimate users of the system have unlimited
   resources. Here we fill this gap and provide a rigorous security proof
   against general attacks in the finite-key regime. This is obtained by
   applying large deviation theory, specifically the Chernoff bound, to
   perform parameter estimation. For the first time we demonstrate the
   feasibility of long-distance implementations of
   measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution within a
   reasonable time frame of signal transmission.}},

Abstract = {{Modular tissue engineering is a method of building vascularized
   tissue-engineered constructs. Submillimeter-sized collagen pieces
   (modules) coated with a layer of endothelial cells (EC; vascular
   component), and with embedded functional cells, are self-assembled into
   a larger, three-dimensional tissue. In this study, we examined the use
   of developmental endothelial locus-1 (Del-1), an extracellular matrix
   protein with proangiogenic properties, as a means of tipping the
   angiogenic balance in human umbilical vein endothelial cells
   incorporated in modular tissue-engineered constructs. The motivation was
   to enhance the vascularization of these constructs upon transplantation
   in vivo, in this case, without the use of exogenous mesenchymal stromal
   cells. EC were transduced using a lentiviral construct to overexpress
   Del-1. The Del-1 EC formed more sprouts in a fibrin gel sprouting assay
   in vitro compared with eGFP (control) transduced EC, as expected. Del-1
   EC had a distinct profile of gene expression (upregulation of matrix
   metalloproteinase-9 {[}MMP-9], urokinase-type plasminogen activator
   {[}uPA/PLAU], vascular endothelial growth factor {[}VEGF-A], and
   intercellular adhesion molecule-1 {[}ICAM-1]; downregulation of
   angiopoietin-2 {[}Ang2]), also supporting the notion of ``tipping the
   angiogenic balance{''}. On the other hand, contrary to our expectations,
   when Del-1 EC-coated modules were implanted subcutaneously in a severe
   combined immunodeficient/beige animal model, the proangiogenic effect of
   Del-1 was less remarkable. There was only a small increase in the number
   of blood vessels formed in Del-1 implants compared with the eGFP
   implants, and only few blood vessels formed at the implant site in both
   cases. This was presumed due to limited EC survival after
   transplantation. We speculate that if we could improve EC survival in
   our study (for example, by adding other prosurvival factors or
   supporting cells), we would see a greater Del-1-induced angiogenic
   benefit in vivo as a consequence of increased Del-1 secretion by a
   higher number of surviving cells.}},

Abstract = {{We used a combination of strategies to stimulate the vascularization of
   tissue-engineered constructs in vivo including a modular approach to
   build larger tissues from individual building blocks ({''}modules{''})
   mixed together. Each building block included vascular cells by design;
   modules were submillimeter-sized collagen gels with an outer layer of
   endothelial cells (ECs), and with embedded adipose-derived mesenchymal
   stromal cells (adMSCs) to support EC survival and blood vessel
   maturation in vivo. We transduced the ECs that coat the modules with a
   lentiviral construct to overexpress the angiogenic extracellular matrix
   (ECM) protein Developmental endothelial locus-1 (Del-1). Upon injection
   of modules in a subcutaneous SCID/Bg mouse model, there was an increase
   in the number of blood vessels for implants with ECs transduced to
   overexpress Del-1 compared with control implants (with enhanced green
   fluorescent protein {[}eGFP]-transduced ECs) over the 21-day duration of
   the study. The greatest difference between Del-1 and eGFP implants and
   the highest number of blood vessels were observed 7 days after
   transplantation. The day-7 Del-1 implants also had increased SMA+
   staining compared with control, suggesting increased blood vessel
   maturation through recruitment of SMA+ smooth muscle cells or pericytes
   to stabilize the newly formed blood vessels. Perfusion studies
   (microcomputed tomography, ultrasound imaging, and systemic injection of
   fluorescent UEA-1 or dextran) showed that some of the newly formed blood
   vessels (both donor derived and host derived, in both Del-1 and eGFP
   implants) were perfused and connected to the host vasculature as early
   as 7 days after transplantation, and at later time points as well.
   Nevertheless, perfusion of the implants was limited in some cases,
   suggesting that further improvements are necessary to normalize the
   vasculature at the implant site.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of pullout tests are developed to
   determine the effect of the different parameters influencing the
   interfacial shear strength (ISS) of carbon nanotube-reinforced metallic
   matrices. Unlike earlier works, the current study focuses on the effect
   of the cell size, cell geometry, and the potential functions adopted in
   the MD simulations. The basic MD cell was created in two steps. The
   metal atoms were initially created using the built-in tools in the
   molecular dynamics code ``LAMMPS{''} guided by the specific metal
   lattice parameters with a pre-defined constraint of a central hole to
   accommodate the CNT at a later stage. The cell was equilibrated with
   Brownian dynamics prior to the placement of the CNT reinforcement. The
   CNT was then placed in the central hole. This was then followed by
   equilibrating the entire system prior to pulling out the CNT, to release
   spurious stresses arising during the build up of the cell, initially
   with Brownian dynamics and later with the nvt ensemble. Our ISS
   predictions agreed very well with earlier research work. Additionally,
   our results show that box-shaped MD cells are more suitable for the
   pullout test simulations with nvt or nve ensembles, while npt scheme
   produces additional forces to the system. The MD cell length was found
   to have insignificant effect on the pullout force.}},

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{One of the most significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in
   Canada is the buildings sector, with over 30\% of national energy
   end-use occurring in buildings. Energy use must be addressed to reduce
   emissions from the buildings sector, as nearly 70\% of all Canada's
   energy used in the residential sector comes from fossil sources. An
   analysis of GHG emissions from the existing residential building stock
   for the year 2010 has been conducted for six Canadian cities with
   different climates and development histories: Vancouver, Edmonton,
   Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal, and Halifax. Variation across these cities
   is seen in their 2010 GHG emissions, due to climate, characteristics of
   the building stock, and energy conversion technologies, with Halifax
   having the highest per capita emissions at 5.55 tCO(2)e/capita and
   Montreal having the lowest at 0.32 tCO(2)e/capita. The importance of the
   provincial electricity grid's carbon intensity is emphasized, along with
   era of construction, occupancy, floor area, and climate. Approaches to
   achieving deep emissions reductions include innovative retrofit
   financing and city level residential energy conservation by-laws; each
   region should seek location-appropriate measures to reduce energy demand
   within its residential housing stock, as well as associated GHG
   emissions.}},

Abstract = {{We use energy methods and lumped-element modelling in the analysis and
   optimization of a miniaturized aluminum nitride based piezoelectric
   energy harvester which utilizes tritiated silicon as an uninterrupted
   energy source. Tritiated silicon serves as a radioisotope source which
   emits energetic beta particles that results in an electrostatic force
   between the radioactive source and collector that traps the emitted
   particles. The generated electrostatic force will drive the charging and
   actuating cycles of the piezoelectric cantilever leading to a continuous
   charge-discharge cycles, thus inducing vibrations in the piezoelectric
   cantilever. The energy generated from the piezoelectric thin-film is
   appropriately rectified and stored to provide continuous and
   uninterrupted electrical power to a low-power devices. The modelled
   results have been benchmarked against available experimental data for a
   unimorph piezoelectric harvester with very good agreement. Furthermore,
   the model was applied to a bimorph piezoelectric harvester, showing that
   the output power can be doubled in relation to a unimorph design.
   Moreover, the model accounts for the entire range of design and
   operating factors such as the ambient medium and associated damping
   losses, current leakage, and device scaling.}},

Abstract = {{The current work reports on the realization of movable micromachining

   structures as is the case with silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers. Also
   the developed process does not require an SOI substrate and accordingly
   dispensing with the application of a wet etching step, thus yielding
   uniform structures without stiction. The optimized process was applied
   to realize thermally actuated microgrippers. The article presents the
   development of the fabrication process and demonstrates the operation of
   the fabricated device. The optimized process provides an avenue for low

Abstract = {{Tissue mechanics regulate development and homeostasis and are
   consistently modified in tumor progression. Nevertheless, the
   fundamental molecular mechanisms through which altered mechanics
   regulate tissue behavior and the clinical relevance of these changes
   remain unclear. We demonstrate that increased matrix stiffness modulates
   microRNA expression to drive tumor progression through integrin
   activation of beta-catenin and MYC. Specifically, in human and mouse
   tissue, increased matrix stiffness induced miR-18a to reduce levels of
   the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN), both
   directly and indirectly by decreasing levels of homeobox A9 (HOXA9).
   Clinically, extracellular matrix stiffness correlated directly and
   significantly with miR-18a expression in human breast tumor biopsies.
   miR-18a expression was highest in basal-like breast cancers in which
   PTEN and HOXA9 levels were lowest, and high miR-18a expression predicted
   poor prognosis in patients with luminal breast cancers. Our findings
   identify a mechanically regulated microRNA circuit that can promote
   malignancy and suggest potential prognostic roles for HOXA9 and miR-18a
   levels in stratifying patients with luminal breast cancers.}},

Journal = {{NONLINEAR DYNAMICS}},

Abstract = {{This work explores the steady-state periodic transverse responses with
   their stabilities of axially accelerating viscoelastic strings.
   Longitudinally varying tension due to the axial acceleration is
   recognized in the modeling, while the tension was approximatively
   assumed to be longitudinally uniform in previous investigations. Exact
   internal resonances are highlighted in the analysis, while the
   resonances have been neglected in all available works. A governing
   equation of transverse nonlinear vibration is derived from the
   generalized Hamilton principle and the Kelvin viscoelastic model on the
   assumption that the string deformation is not infinitesimal, but still
   small. The axial speed is supposed to be a small simple harmonic
   fluctuation about the constant mean axial speed. The method of multiple
   scales is applied to solve the governing equation in the parametric
   resonances when the axial speed fluctuation frequency approaches the
   first three natural frequencies of the linear generating system based on
   1-3 term truncations. The amplitude, the existence conditions, and the
   stability are determined, and the effects of the viscosity, the mean
   axial speed, the axial speed fluctuation amplitude, and the axial
   support rigidity on the amplitude and the existence are examined via the
   numerical examples. It is found that the 1-term, the 2-term, and the
   3-term truncations yield the qualitatively same and the quantitatively
   close results in the case that there exist the exact internal resonances
   among the first three frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Gene expression data are currently collected on a wide range
   of platforms. Differences between platforms make it challenging to
   combine and compare data collected on different platforms. We propose a
   new method of cross-platform normalization that uses topic models to
   summarize the expression patterns in each dataset before normalizing the
   topics learned from each dataset using per-gene multiplicative weights.
   Results: This method allows for cross-platform normalization even when
   samples profiled on different platforms have systematic differences,
   allows the simultaneous normalization of data from an arbitrary number
   of platforms and, after suitable training, allows for online
   normalization of expression data collected individually or in small
   batches. In addition, our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
   platform normalization tools.}},

Title = {{The influence of unavoidable saturation averaging on the experimental
   measurement of dynamic capillary effects: A numerical simulation study}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{43-51}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Many studies over the past four decades have observed that capillary
   pressure-saturation (P-c-S-w) relationships are often different when
   measured dynamically under rapidly changing pressure inputs. This
   phenomenon has been referred to as a dynamic capillary effect, and its
   magnitude is often quantified by the dynamic capillary coefficient, tau.
   Experimentally-reported values of tau have varied by orders of
   magnitude, even for seemingly similar experimental systems. The purpose
   of the present work is to numerically explore the likely impact of fluid
   properties on the calculation of tau from experimental measurements.
   Specifically, the emphasis is on understanding how spatial averaging of
   the saturation profiles resulting from different fluid combinations
   contributes to the apparent magnitude of tau derived from experimental
   measurements.
   Simulations of dynamic drainage in a packed sand column were conducted
   using the CompSim multiphase flow simulator. Four nonwetting phase
   fluids with viscosities spanning four orders of magnitude were studied.
   Comparison between local and spatially-averaged rates of saturation
   change show significant differences, with the magnitude of the
   difference increasing with increasing viscosity to interfacial tension
   ratio and increasing drainage rate. Results show that at averaging
   scales likely to be experienced during experimental saturation
   measurements, this effect is likely to produce significant differences
   in the ultimate magnitude of the calculated tau values for different
   fluid systems and drainage rates. This result means that conventional
   flow phenomena may produce an inherent systematic bias in experimental
   measurements of tau, amplifying measured values for high viscosity or
   low interfacial tension systems and for experiments where higher
   drainage rates are used. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{From the City to the Lake: Loadings of PCBs, PBDEs, PAHs and PCMs from
   Toronto to Lake Ontario}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{3732-3741}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Loadings from Toronto, Canada to Lake Ontario were quantified and major
   sources and pathways were identified, with the goal of informing
   opportunities for loading reductions. The contaminants were
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers
   (PBDEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polycyclic musks
   (PCMs). Loadings were calculated from measured concentrations for three
   major pathways: atmospheric processes, tributary runoff, and wastewater
   treatment plant (WWTP) effluents.
   Although atmospheric deposition to the Great Lakes has received the
   greatest attention, this was the dominant loading pathway for PCBs only
   (17 +/- 5.3 kg/y or 66\% of total loadings). PCB loadings reflected
   elevated urban PCB air concentrations due to, predominantly, primary
   emissions. These loadings contribute to consumption advisories for
   nearshore fish. PBDE loadings to the lake, again from mainly primary
   emissions, were 48\% (9.1 +/- 1.3 kg/y) and 42\% (8.0 +/- 5.7 kg/y) via
   tributaries and WWTPs, respectively, consistent with emissions deposited
   and subsequently washed-off of urban surfaces and emissions to the
   sewage system. PAHs loadings of 1600 +/- 280 kg/y (71\%) from
   tributaries were strongly associated with vehicle transportation and
   impervious surfaces. PCM loadings were 83\% (+/- 140 kg/y) from WWTP
   final effluent, reflecting their use in personal care products.
   Opportunities for source reduction lie in reducing the current
   inventories of in-use PCBs and PBDE-containing products, reducing
   vehicle emissions of PAHs and use of PAHs in the transportation network
   (e.g., pavement sealants), and improving wastewater treatment
   technology.}},

Abstract = {{We have recently proposed a ``surplus-based{''} algorithm which solves
   the multi-agent average consensus problem on general strongly connected
   and static digraphs. The essence of that algorithm is to employ an
   additional variable to keep track of the state changes of each agent,
   thereby achieving averaging even though the state sum is not preserved.
   In this note, we extend this approach to the more interesting and
   challenging case of time-varying topologies: An extended surplus-based
   averaging algorithm is designed, under which a necessary and sufficient
   graphical condition is derived that guarantees state averaging. The
   derived condition requires only that the digraphs be arbitrary strongly
   connected in a joint sense, and does not impose ``balanced{''} or
   ``symmetric{''} properties on the network topology, which is therefore
   more general than those previously reported in the literature.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Natural social human-robot interactions (HRIs) require that robots have
   the ability to perceive and identify complex human social behaviors and,
   in turn, be able to also display their own behaviors using similar
   communication modes. Recently, it has been found that body language
   plays an important role in conveying information about changes in human
   emotions during human-human interactions. Our work focuses on extending
   this concept to robotic affective communication during social HRI.
   Namely, in this paper, we explore the design of emotional body language
   for our human-like social robot, Brian 2.0. We develop emotional body
   language for the robot using a variety of body postures and movements
   identified in human emotion research. To date, only a handful of
   researchers have focused on the use of robotic body language to display
   emotions, with a significant emphasis being on the display of emotions
   through dance. Such emotional dance can be effective for small robots
   with large workspaces, however, it is not as appropriate for life-sized
   robots such as Brian 2.0 engaging in one-on-one interpersonal social
   interactions with a person. Experiments are presented to evaluate the
   feasibility of the robot's emotional body language based on human
   recognition rates. Furthermore, a unique comparison study is presented
   to investigate the perception of human body language features displayed
   by the robot with respect to the same body language features displayed
   by a human actor.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient optimization techniques are important to manage interference
   in emerging dense wireless networks. Here, we address interference
   management through power control as a general utility maximization
   problem. For the class of utility functions that are concave in the
   logarithm of the optimization variables, we propose a power control
   algorithm based on fixed-point iterations. The iterations converge to
   the globally optimal power vector. One key benefit is that, for a
   network with N transmitters and a centralized implementation of the
   power control algorithm, the computational complexity per iteration of
   the algorithm is O(N-2). When implemented in a distributed fashion and
   allowing for a signaling complexity of N messages per iteration, the
   computation complexity is reduced to O(N). We show that the proposed
   centralized and distributed versions of the algorithm converge to the
   optimal power vector at a linear rate. Our numerical results suggest
   that in most instances, the algorithm takes fewer than ten iterations to
   converge, even fewer if the initialization is close to the optimal power
   vector. The proposed algorithm is, therefore, very efficient for power
   control in slowly fading channels. Furthermore, unlike previous works in
   the literature, the proposed algorithm does not require the objective
   function to be separable into a sum of individual utilities. As an
   example, we present results for power control in a two-hop
   decode-and-forward cooperative relay network and illustrate the
   performance gains due to interference management.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) is emerging as an advanced service-oriented
   manufacturing model for the manufacturing industry. It is changing the
   way manufacturing enterprises organize production activities in that
   tangible and intangible manufacturing resources encapsulated as
   virtualized manufacturing services are provided to customers. In this
   background, CMfg task semantic modeling and description is proposed to
   address different challenges such as matching with manufacturing
   services. Firstly, some of the essential features of CMfg tasks are
   briefly discussed and classification as well as the modeling
   requirements of CMfg tasks is also investigated, and then this paper
   proposes the modeling framework of CMfg task to solve the general CMfg
   task ontology (GCMT\_Ontology) construction and the task sub-ontology
   matching from GCMT\_Ontology. In GCMT\_Ontology construction process,
   the original CMfg task ontology (OCMT\_Ontology) is built from the CMfg
   task description model, and then an ontology learning approach is
   advanced to perfect the GCMT\_Ontology with graph-based semantic
   similarity algorithm. In task sub-ontology matching process, semantic
   feature values of concepts are calculated to extend the semantic content
   of the task document, and the extended concepts are input to find the
   sub-ontology by computing minimum connected sub-graph. Finally, the
   proposed framework is realized in a prototype system, and an example of
   cement grinding mill assembling task is carried out in a group
   enterprise to illustrate the application. The results show that the
   proposed method improves enterprise collaboration and interoperation
   effectively.}},

Abstract = {{While there is growing interest in clinical applications of handwriting
   grip kinetics, the consistency of these forces over time is not
   well-understood at present. In this study, we investigated the short-and
   long-term intra-participant consistency and inter-participant
   differences in grip kinetics associated with adult signature writing.
   Grip data were collected from 20 adult participants using a digitizing
   tablet and an instrumented pen. The first phase of data collection
   occurred over 10 separate days within a three week period. To ascertain
   long-term consistency, a second phase of data collection followed, one
   day per month over several months. In both phases, data were collected
   three times a day. After pre-processing and feature extraction,
   nonparametric statistical tests were used to compare the
   within-participant grip force variation between the two phases.
   Participant classification based on grip force features was used to
   determine the relative magnitude of inter-participant versus
   intra-participant differences. The misclassification rate for the
   longitudinal data were used as an indication of long term kinetic
   consistency. Intra-participant analysis revealed significant changes in
   grip kinetic features between the two phases for many participants.
   However, the misclassification rate, on average, remained stable,
   despite different demarcations of training, and testing data. This
   finding suggests that while signature writing grip forces may evolve
   over time, inter-participant kinetic differences consistently exceeds
   within-participant force changes in the long-term. These results bear
   implications on the collection, modeling and interpretation of grip
   kinetics in clinical applications.}},

Abstract = {{The TSI Fast Mobility Particle Sizer (FMPS), Engine Exhaust Particle
   Sizer (EEPS), and Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) provide size
   distributions for 6-560 nm particles. The aim of this study was to
   perform comprehensive equivalence testing of these three particle sizing
   instruments with particles of contrasting chemical and physical
   characteristics (urban ambient, diesel exhaust, and laboratory-generated
   particulate). It was observed that the EEPS and FMPS measurements agreed
   to within 15\% thus concluding that data from these instruments may be
   considered equivalent. Parallel measurements with the SMPS showed that
   when measuring diesel exhaust particulate during ISO8178 Mode 9
   operation there is significant overestimation of particle concentrations
   by both the EEPS and the FMPS in the 20-120 nm size range (25-38\%
   overestimation). This overestimation also occurred for near-road
   measurement of heavy emitter vehicle plumes in ambient samples (up to
   75\% overestimation). Laboratory-generated soot agglomerate particles,
   whose shape was verified by transmission electron microscopy, were also
   tested. The agglomerate nature of diesel soot particulate was the
   dominant cause of the overestimation; parallel measurements with an FMPS
   and an Ultrafine Condensation Particle Counter of the
   laboratory-generated soot particulate showed overestimation by up to a
   factor of three. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Bone embrittlement and collagen modifications due to high-dose
   gamma-irradiation sterilization}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{71-81}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Bone allografts are often used in orthopedic reconstruction of skeletal
   defects resulting from trauma, bone cancer or revision of joint
   arthroplasty. gamma-Irradiation sterilization is a widely-used
   biological safety measure; however it is known to embrittle bone.
   Irradiation has been shown to affect the post-yield properties, which
   are attributed to the collagen component of bone. In order to find a
   solution to the loss of toughness in irradiated bone allografts, it is
   important to fully understand the effects of irradiation on bone
   collagen. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in the
   structure and integrity of bone collagen as a result of
   gamma-irradiation, with the hypothesis that irradiation fragments
   collagen molecules leading to a loss of collagen network connectivity
   and therefore loss of toughness.
   Using cortical bone from bovine tibiae, sample beams irradiated at 33
   kGy on dry ice were compared to native bone beams (paired controls). All
   beams were subjected to three-point bend testing to failure followed by
   characterization of the decalcified bone collagen, using differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC), hydrothermal isometric tension testing
   (HIT), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gel
   electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The carbonyl content of demineralized bone
   collagen was also measured chemically to assess oxidative damage. Barium
   sulfate staining after single edge notch bending (SEN(B)) fracture
   testing was also performed on bovine tibia bone beams with a machined
   and sharpened notch to evaluate the fracture toughness and ability of
   irradiated bone to form micro-damage during fracture.
   Irradiation resulted in a 62\% loss of work-to-fracture (p <= 0.001).
   There was significantly less micro-damage formed during fracture
   propagation in the irradiated bone. HPLC showed no significant effect on
   pentosidine, pyridinoline, or hydroxypyridinoline levels suggesting that
   the loss of toughness is not due to changes in these stable crosslinks.
   For DSC, there was a 20\% decrease in thermal stability (p < 0.001) with
   a 100\% increase (p < 0.001) in enthalpy of denaturation (melting). HIT
   testing also showed a decrease in thermal stability (20\% lower
   denaturation temperature, p < 0.001) and greatly reduced measures of
   collagen network connectivity (p < 0.001). Interestingly, the increase
   in enthalpy of denaturation suggests that irradiated collagen requires
   more energy to denature (melt), perhaps a result of alterations in the
   hydrogen bonding sites (increased carbonyl content detected in the
   insoluble collagen) on the irradiated bone collagen.
   Altogether, this new data strongly indicates that a large loss of
   overall collagen connectivity due to collagen fragmentation resulting
   from gamma-irradiation sterilization leads to inferior cortical bone
   toughness. In addition, notable changes in the thermal denaturation of
   the bone collagen along with chemical indicators of oxidative
   modification of the bone collagen indicate that the embrittlement may be
   a function not only of collagen fragmentation but also of changes in
   bonding. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{114}},

Abstract = {{A critical limitation with transcutaneous neuromuscular electrical
   stimulation is the rapid onset of muscle fatigue. We have previously
   demonstrated that spatially distributed sequential stimulation (SDSS)
   shows a drastically greater fatigue-reducing ability compared to a
   single active electrode stimulation (SES). The purposes of this study
   were to investigate (1) the fatigue-reducing ability of SDSS in more
   detail focusing on the muscle contractile properties and (2) the
   mechanism of this effect using array-arranged electromyogram (EMG).
   SDSS was delivered through four active electrodes applied to the
   plantarflexors, sending a stimulation pulse to each electrode one after
   another with 90A degrees phase shift between successive electrodes. In
   the first experiment, the amount of exerted ankle torque and the muscle
   contractile properties were investigated during a 3 min fatiguing
   stimulation. In the second experiment, muscle twitch potentials with
   SDSS and SES stimulation electrode setups were compared using the
   array-arranged EMG.
   The results demonstrated negligible torque decay during SDSS in contrast
   to considerable torque decay during SES. Moreover, small changes in the
   muscle contractile properties during the fatiguing stimulation using
   SDSS were observed, while slowing of muscle contraction and relaxation
   was observed during SES. Further, the amplitude of the M-waves at each
   muscle portion was dependent on the location of the stimulation
   electrodes during SDSS.
   We conclude that SDSS is more effective in reducing muscle fatigue
   compared to SES, and the reason is that different sets of muscle fibers
   are activated alternatively by different electrodes.}},

Year = {{2014}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The traditional smeared crack macromodels for the analysis of masonry
   structures consider masonry as a homogeneous material with the effects
   of mortar joints included in an average sense. This approach, suitable
   for the analysis of large structures, implicitly excludes the
   possibility of representing local elastic and inelastic mechanisms
   involving mortar joints. In this study, an innovative formulation based
   on the disturbed stress field model (DSFM) is proposed for the analysis
   of unreinforced masonry structures. The advancement introduced by the
   model lies in the possibility of simulating the global average behavior
   of the composite material in combination with the local nonlinear shear
   slip response of both bed and head joints. This paper describes the
   formulation of the model; as well, it presents results obtained from the
   simulation of tests performed on shear walls demonstrating the ability
   of the DSFM to reproduce the structural response of masonry structures.}},

Title = {{Cast Steel Yielding Brace System for Concentrically Braced Frames:
   Concept Development and Experimental Validations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The Yielding Brace System is a highly ductile bracing system in which
   seismic energy is dissipated by the yielding fingers of a specially
   engineered cast steel connector. When the brace is severely loaded in
   tension and compression, the fingers yield in flexure, thus providing a
   full, symmetric hysteresis. Second-order geometric effects result in an
   increase in postyield stiffness at large displacements. The mechanics of
   the system are first presented, including several first principle
   equations used to predict a connector's response. These equations are
   then used to design a prototype connector. The geometry of this
   prototype is evaluated using nonlinear finite element analysis.
   Following this analysis, the results of full-scale axial component
   testing of the prototype are discussed. These results include tensile
   coupon tests from material taken directly from unyielded portions of the
   test specimens. The prototype design and testing program presented
   demonstrate that the Yielding Brace System is a ductile connector that
   can enhance the energy dissipation and displacement capacity of braced
   frames. Good agreement between predicted and experimental response
   showed that the mechanics of the connector were well understood and that
   the method used to design the prototype was effective in meeting the
   targeted performance.}},

Abstract = {{Mass immunization clinics (MICs) are an important component of pandemic
   influenza control strategies in many jurisdictions. Decisions about
   staffing levels at MICs affect several factors of concern to public
   health authorities: total vaccination volume, patient wait-times,
   operating costs, and intra-facility influenza transmission risk. We
   present a discrete-event simulation of an MIC to assess how strongly
   staffing changes affect these factors. The simulation is based on data
   from Canadian clinics responding to pandemic H1N1 in 2009. This study is
   the first to model flu transmission risk at an MIC, and the first to
   relate such risk to staffing decisions. We show that the marginal
   benefit of adding staff is greatly underestimated if indirect waiting
   costs and intra-facility infections are not considered.}},

Title = {{Broadband Compact Silicon Wire to Silicon Slot Waveguide Orthogonal Bend}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{32}},

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{An ultra-compact 90 degrees bend between silicon (Si) wire and silicon
   slot waveguide (SSW) with a footprint of similar to 725 nm x 500 nm is
   experimentally demonstrated on silicon-on-insulator substrate. By
   achieving momentum matching of the waveguides through an orthogonal
   junction placement, and maximizing modal overlap through an angled
   facet, coupling efficiency of similar to 70\% and 3-dB bandwidth of over
   500 nm has been achieved. The nominal experimental transmission through
   cascaded input (Si wire to SSW) and output (SSW to Si wire) orthogonal
   junctions match closely those obtained from simulations, both in the
   range from 1270 to 1360 nm and from 1480 to 1590 nm. For slot widths
   ranging from 30 to 230 nm, our Si wire-SSW bend can achieve coupling
   efficiency comparable to that of a direct butt-coupler over a 400 nm
   bandwidth. This compact and wideband waveguide bend serves as an
   important component to enable dense integration between conventional Si
   wire and SSW.}},

Abstract = {{Wastewater-fed microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a promising technology to
   treat low-organic carbon wastewater and recover part of the chemical
   energy in wastewater as electrical power. However, the interactions
   between electrochemically active and fermentative microorganisms cannot
   be easily studied in wastewater-fed MFCs because of their complex
   microbial communities. Defined co-culture MFCs provide a detailed
   understanding of such interactions. In this study, we characterize the
   extracellular metabolites in laboratory-scale membrane-less MFCs
   inoculated with Geobacter sulfurreducens and Escherichia coli co-culture
   and compare them with pure culture MFCs. G. sulfurreducens MFCs are
   sparged to maintain anaerobic conditions, while co-culture MFCs rely on
   E. coli for oxygen removal. G. sulfurreducens MFCs have a power output
   of 128mWm(-2), compared to 63mWm(-2) from the co-culture MFCs. Analysis
   of metabolites shows that succinate production in co-culture MFCs
   decreases current production by G. sulfurreducens and that the removal
   of succinate is responsible for the increased current density in the
   late co-culture MFCs. Interestingly, pH adjustment is not required for
   co-culture MFCs but a base addition is necessary for E. coli MFCs and
   cultures in vials. Our results show that defined co-culture MFCs provide
   clear insights into metabolic interactions among bacteria while
   maintaining a low operational complexity. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2014;111:

Abstract = {{In this paper, a constitutive model is proposed for analysis of
   bimodular composite laminated structures. In case of already existing
   Bert's model, the material properties are assigned according to the
   nature (tensile/compressive) of only fiber direction strain. In the
   proposed model, the material properties are assigned according to the
   nature of fiber direction and transverse to fiber direction normal
   strains. The proposed model is used for free vibration analysis of
   cylindrical and conical panels. First order shear deformation theory
   based finite element is employed to obtain the free vibration
   frequencies and through the thickness modal stress distributions. The
   free vibration frequencies predicted from the two models for the
   parameters considered are found to be very close to each other but
   transverse to the fiber direction normal stress distribution using both
   the models is significantly different. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{144-155}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The freshwater zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is an invasive,
   biofouling species that adheres to a variety of substrates underwater,
   using a proteinaceous anchor called the byssus. The byssus consists of a
   number of threads with adhesive plaques at the tips. It contains the
   unusual amino acid 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), which is believed
   to play an important role in adhesion, in addition to providing
   structural integrity to the byssus through cross-linking. Extensive DOPA
   cross-linking, however, renders the zebra mussel byssus highly resistant
   to protein extraction, and therefore limits byssal protein
   identification. We report here on the identification of seven novel
   byssal proteins in the insoluble byssal matrix following protein
   extraction from induced, freshly secreted byssal threads with minimal
   cross-linking. These proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS analysis of
   tryptic digests of the matrix proteins by spectrum matching against a
   zebra mussel cDNA library of genes unique to the mussel foot, the organ
   that secretes the byssus. All seven proteins were present in both the
   plaque and thread. Comparisons of the protein sequences revealed common
   features of zebra mussel byssal proteins, and several recurring sequence
   motifs. Although their sequences are unique, many of the proteins
   display similarities to marine mussel byssal proteins, as well as to
   adhesive and structural proteins from other species. The large expansion
   of the byssal proteome reported here represents an important step
   towards understanding zebra mussel adhesion.}},

   has been modest due to insufficient drug release at the tumor site. This
   report describes the development of a novel heat-activated
   thermosensitive liposome formulation containing CDDP (HTLC) designed to
   release approximately 90\% of the loaded drug in less than 5 min under
   mild heating conditions (42 degrees C). Physico-chemical characteristics
   of HTLC were assessed in terms of gel to liquid crystalline phase
   transition temperature (Tm), drug loading efficiency, particle size, and
   stability. The pharmacokinetic profile and biodistribution of HTLC in
   non-tumor- bearing mice were evaluated over a 24 h period. A
   sophisticated spatio-temporal elucidation of HTLC release in
   tumor-bearing mice was achieved by way of real-time monitoring using a
   magnetic resonance (MR) imaging protocol, wherein a custom-built
   laser-based conformal heat source was applied at the tumor volume to
   trigger the release of HTLC co-encapsulated with the MR contrast agent
   gadoteridol (Gd-HP-DO3A). MR thermometry (MRT) demonstrated that a
   relatively uniform temperature distribution was achieved in the tumor
   volume using the external laser-based heating setup. In mice bearing
   subcutaneously-implanted ME-180 cervical tumors, the combination of HTLC
   and heat resulted in a 2-fold increase in tumor drug levels at 1 h
   post-administration compared to HTLC without heating. Furthermore, the
   overall tumor accumulation levels for the HTLC groups (with and without
   heat) at 1 h post-injection were significantly higher than the
   corresponding free CDDP group. This translated into a significant
   improvement in therapeutic efficacy evaluated as tumor growth delay (p <
   0.05) for the heated HTLC treatment group compared to the unheated HTLC,
   heated or unheated free CDDP, and saline groups. Overall, findings from
   this study demonstrate that a heat-activated, triggered release
   formulation of CDDP results in a significant enhancement in the
   therapeutic index of this drug. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Although several modifications to graphene have been proposed to improve
   its hydrogen binding to practical levels, current theoretical studies
   largely neglect the role of topological defects. In this paper we
   analyze the effect of these defects and their possible use in a hydrogen
   storage system. Hydrogen physisorption on five types of point defects
   (Stone-Wales, single vacancy and three types of double vacancy) was
   investigated using density functional theory with the PBE-GGA
   functional. Point defects were also repeated with the vdW-DF2 functional
   to better represent long range van der Waals interactions. Although none
   of the defects were found to be detrimental to hydrogen anchoring, only
   the single vacancy showed promising hydrogen binding in the ideal range.
   Model systems combining different defects were also explored, including
   a defect-anchored metal system, a bilayer graphene system and a
   grain-boundary system. Finally, two high defect density structures
   constructed using vacancies and combined Stone-Wales defects and
   vacancies yielded gravimetric densities of 5.81\% and 7.02\%,
   respectively, with the vdW functional. This study suggests that graphene
   can be defect-engineered to develop effective hydrogen storage media.

Abstract = {{In contemporary society, a large percentage of medical equipment coming
   in contact with blood is manufactured from plastic polymers.
   Unfortunately, exposure may result in undesirable protein-material
   interactions that can potentially trigger deleterious biological
   processes such as thrombosis. To address this problem, we have developed
   an ultrathin antithrombogenic coating based on monoethylene glycol
   silane surface chemistry. The strategy is exemplified with
   polycarbonate-a plastic polymer increasingly employed in the biomedical
   industry. The various straightforward steps of surface modification were
   characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy supplemented by
   contact angle goniometry. Antithrombogenicity was assessed after 5 min
   exposure to whole human blood dispensed at a shear rate of 1000 s(-1).
   Remarkably, platelet adhesion, aggregation, and thrombus formation on
   the coated surface was greatly inhibited (>97\% decrease in surface
   coverage) compared to the bare substrate and, most importantly, nearly
   nonexistent.}},

   results from mixing the interferograms, generated in both the unbalanced
   interferometer and the virtual reference, is equivalent to the first

   advantages of the technique include speed, simplicity, convenience and

Title = {{Choosing the optimal intervention method to reduce human-related machine
   failures}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{233}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{604-612}},
Month = {{MAR 16}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method to quantify the effects of
   human-related factors on the risk of failure in manufacturing
   industries. When failures can be caused by operators, the decision maker
   must intervene to mitigate operator-related risk. There are numerous
   intervention methods possible; we develop a revenue model that provides
   the decision-maker with a systematic tool to perform a cost-benefit
   analysis, balancing the advantage of risk reduction, against the direct
   cost of the intervention method.
   A method is developed to incorporate human-related factors, in addition
   to machine-related factors, in machine failure analysis. This enables
   the revenue model to use the expected uptime and the probability of
   failure, given the operator skill level and working conditions, to
   calculate the expected revenue associated with each intervention method.
   A case study of a manufacturing company is considered incorporating two
   possible intervention methods: reducing the production rate to provide
   more cognition time and adding a shift expert to guide the operators.
   Different courses of action are chosen for the various skill-shift
   scenarios presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{62-63}},
Pages = {{181-192}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{For blast- or impact-resistant design of steel structures, it is
   important to use realistic properties of steel under high strain rate.
   In particular, the substantial rise in yield stress under high strain
   rate may have important effects on the dynamic behaviour of a steel
   structure. The high strain rate properties of some steels have been
   studied in the past; mostly reinforcing bars, plates and hot-rolled
   sections. The goal of this research is to remedy the lack of knowledge
   on the high strain rate behaviour of cold-formed steel hollow sections.
   In this study, four cold-formed Rectangular Hollow Sections (RHS)
   manufactured by two different cold-forming methods (direct-forming and
   continuous-forming) have been examined. The dynamic properties of the
   RHS specimens were determined by performing a total of 166 compressive
   and tensile Split-Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) tests at strain rates
   ranging from 100 to 1000 s(-1) and their dynamic yield stresses were
   compared to their static yield stresses, to characterise the strength
   enhancement of cold-formed RHS under such loading rates. (C) 2014

   were fabricated at various MWNT contents. Addition of low amounts of
   MWNT (0.25-1 wt \%) to PLA did not have a significant effect on the
   diameters of the fibers. Observations of the composite morphology under
   STEM indicated preferential orientation of the MWNTs along the draw
   direction of the fibers. Increasing amounts of MWNTs was found to
   increase crystallization kinetics and content. The crystalline content
   had a direct and profound implication on the mechanical properties with
   0.5-wt \% MWNT fibers having the highest crystalline content and also

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{418}},
Pages = {{292-299}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Experiments were done to observe the coalescence of highly viscous
   liquid droplets (87 wt\% glycerin-inwater solutions) deposited onto a
   flat, solid steel plate. Droplets were deposited sequentially in
   straight lines or square droplet arrays. Droplet center-to-center
   distance was varied and the final dimensions of lines and sheets
   measured from photographs. When overlapping droplets were deposited
   surface tension forces pulled impacting droplets towards those already
   on the surface, a phenomena known as drawback. A dimensionless drawback
   index, quantifying the extent of droplet displacement, was calculated
   from experimental measurements for different values of droplet overlap.
   At large overlaps droplets deposited in a line or square array coalesced
   to form a circular film. When the droplet center-to-center distance
   increased, leading to less interaction, long, thin lines and square
   sheets were formed. As overlap was further decreased lines and sheets
   became discontinuous. A simple model was developed to predict the
   conditions under which rupture occurred. The lowest droplet overlap
   ratio (defined as droplet overlap distance divided by droplet spread
   diameter) at which a continuous liquid film could be formed was gimel =
   0.293. At large overlap ratios (gimel > 0.6) droplets deposited in a
   square array formed a circular film. The minimum thickness of a
   continuous film formed by coalescence of droplets was shown to vary from
   5\% to 70\% of the initial droplet diameter while increasing impact
   Weber and Reynolds number reduced the film thickness. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In coherent optical systems laser phase noise can interact with digital
   equalization to cause equalization-enhanced impairments, which are a
   major obstacle for applying higher order modulation formats in coherent
   optical systems with digital chromatic dispersion compensation. In this
   paper a code-aided expectation maximization method to track phase noise
   in such systems is presented. A common measure of laser phase noise is
   the linewidth. It is shown that with similar to 11\% redundancy, the
   laser linewidth tolerance for 975 km transmission distance can be
   increased by 50\%, or the system reach for a laser linewidth of 5 MHz
   can be doubled. A phase-noise-robust 16-point 4-4-4-4 ring constellation
   was found to have better performance compared to 16QAM and a 2-6-8 ring
   constellations. Performance can be further improved with a lower code
   rate and fewer pilot symbols. It is also shown that algorithmic
   complexity can be reduced without significant reduction in the
   performance by reducing iterations and using low complexity codes.}},

Abstract = {{Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) comprising sterically hindered Lewis acids

   provide insights for design of new, efficient formulations of FLP
   catalysts for CO2 capture. We have developed a microfluidic approach to
   studies of FLP-CO2 reactions, which provides their thermodynamic
   characterization that is not accessible otherwise. The approach enables
   the determination- of the equilibrium reaction constants at different
   temperatures, the enthalpy, the entropy, and the Gibbs energy of these
   reactions, as well as the enhancement factor. The microfluidic
   methodology has been validated by applying it to the well-characterized
   reaction of CO2 with a secondary amine. The microfluidic approach can be
   applied for fundamental thermodynamic studies of other gas-liquid

   cerebral palsy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Background: The combination of single-switch access technology and
   scanning is the most promising means of augmentative and alternative
   communication for many children with severe physical disabilities.
   However, the physical impairment of the child and the technology's
   limited ability to interpret the child's intentions often lead to false
   positives and negatives (corresponding to accidental and missed
   selections, respectively) occurring at rates that frustrate the user and
   preclude functional communication. Multiple psychophysiological studies
   have associated cardiac deceleration and increased phasic electrodermal
   activity with self-realization of errors among able-bodied individuals.
   Thus, physiological measurements have potential utility at enhancing
   single-switch access, provided that such prototypical autonomic
   responses exist in persons with profound disabilities.
   Methods: The present case series investigated the autonomic responses of
   three pediatric single-switch users with severe spastic quadriplegic
   cerebral palsy, in the context of a single-switch letter matching
   activity. Each participant exhibited distinct autonomic responses to
   activity engagement.
   Results: Our analysis confirmed the presence of the autonomic response
   pattern of cardiac deceleration and increased phasic electrodermal
   activity following true positives, false positives and false negatives
   errors, but not subsequent to true negative outcomes.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that there may be merit in
   complementing single-switch input with autonomic measurements to improve
   augmentative and alternative communications for pediatric access
   technology users.}},

   interfacial tension reduction, and the ability of mixtures to remove
   heavy oil from oil-bearing sand. The waste biomass sources investigated
   were return activated sludge (RAS) from municipal wastewater from
   Toronto, Canada, and urban refuse (UR) matter from municipal solid waste
   compost treatment facilities in Piemonte, Italy. Surfactants from both
   sources were extracted using alkaline extraction methods. Mixtures of
   these waste biobased surfactants with the synthetic surfactant, sodium
   dioctyl sulfosuccinate (AOT), at a total concentration of 1g(TOC)/L,
   were able to achieve low interfacial tensions (<1 mN/m) with toluene and
   hexane, without the addition of electrolytes. The mixtures generally
   achieved interfacial tensions (IFTs) an order of magnitude below that of
   the pure biobased surfactant. At an increased total concentration of 10
   g(TOC)/L, an UR extract (FORSUD), mixed at 40\% with AOT, reached an
   ultralow IFT of 0.019 mN/m against hexane, without the need to add salt
   into the system. Furthermore, the RAS-AOT and UR-AOT mixtures were
   examined for their use in the removal of heavy oil, bitumen, from
   contaminated sand. The low IFTs of the mixtures proved to be useful in
   removing heavy oil (bitumen) from sand particles.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHOICE MODELLING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{46-59}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents results of investigation on mode choice behaviour for
   peak period non-work trips (trips that are made during the peak period
   and are not linked to any other trips). Pure non-work trips within the
   peak period represent a significant portion of peak period traffic. In
   the case of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA), the study area
   of this investigation, around 11 percent of peak period trips are pure
   non-work trips and auto driving is the dominant mode. Also more peak
   period non-work trips are made using the auto passenger mode than all
   transit modes combined. This heavy auto dependency for pure non-work
   trips in the peak period, when transit service is at its highest
   throughout the day, requires an improved understanding of such mode
   choice behaviour. This paper uses data from a household travel survey
   collected in the GTHA to investigate peak period pure non-work trip mode
   choice in the context of household mobility tool ownership (auto and
   transit pass ownership). The paper also proposes an advanced econometric
   modelling approach for capturing preference heterogeneity as well as
   scale heterogeneity (heteroskedasticity). The model involves systematic
   parameterization of the scale parameter of a GEV model. Empirical models
   highlight the superiority of the proposed model over a homoskedastic
   model. Empirical model also explains the influence of household mobility
   tool ownership on peak period pure non-work trip mode choices in terms
   of explaining both preference heterogeneity and scale heterogeneity. (C)

Abstract = {{This study examines the application of backscattered ultrasound (US) and
   photoacoustic (PA) signals for assessment of bone structure and density
   variations. Both methods were applied in the frequency-domain, employing
   linear frequency modulation chirps. A near-IR laser (800 nm) was used
   for inducing the PA signal. The backscattered pressure waves were
   detected with a 2.2-MHz US transducer. Experiments were focused on
   detection and evaluation of PA and US signals from in-vitro animal and
   human bones with cortical and trabecular sublayers. It was shown that PA
   signals can be detected as deep as a few millimeters below trabecular
   and cortical layers. The occurrence of multiple scattering was
   demonstrated in PA detected signals from cancellous bone. Osteoporotic
   changes in the bone were simulated by using a very mild demineralization
   ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution. Changes in the time-domain
   signals as well as integrated backscattering spectra were compared for
   the samples before and after demineralization. The results demonstrated
   the sensitivity of PA to variations in bone minerals. In comparison to
   PA, US was capable of generating detectable signals from deeper bone
   sublayers (few centimeters). However, while US signal variations with
   changes in the cortical layer were insignificant, PA proved to be
   sensitive even to minor variations of the cortical bone density. (C)

Abstract = {{In this article, a broadband magnet-induced dual-cantilever
   piezoelectric energy harvester is designed and developed. The
   dual-cantilever structure consists of an outer and an inner beams with
   magnets attached to the tips. The magnets generate nonlinear repulsive
   force between the two beams and make the structure bistable. In the
   theoretical model, each beam is considered as a single-degree-of-freedom
   system with magnetic force applied at the free end. From the simulation
   results, chaotic motion is observed in a wide frequency range. A
   prototype of the harvester is built and verified with the simulation
   results. The simulation and experimental results show good agreement
   with respect to the power bandwidth and amplitude. The distance between
   magnets is adjusted to observe its effect on the power response of the
   harvester. The inner and outer beams are simulated and tested
   independently first to observe the performance of each beam. Finally, an
   interface circuit is designed to combine all piezoelectric plates to
   acquire the overall performance. By comparing with the traditional
   piezoelectric energy harvester, the new design is shown to provide a
   significant improvement in bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{The confinement of laser interactions inside transparent materials
   assisted by tight optical focusing and short-pulsed nonlinear
   interactions has driven many high-resolution patterning and probing
   applications in science and technology. In thin transparent films, laser
   interactions confined to the film/substrate interface have underpinned
   blistering and ejection processes for nanofluidic channel fabrication,
   film patterning and cell catapulting. Here, we harness femtosecond
   lasers to drive nonlinear interactions within Fabry-Perot interference
   fringes to define narrow nanolength scale zones for highly resolved
   internal structuring of a film of refractive index, n(film), at fringe
   maxima separated by lambda/2n(film). This novel interaction internally
   cleaves the film to open subwavelength internal cavities and form thin
   membranes at single or multiple depths from which follow significant
   opportunities for writing multilevel nanofluidic channels inside the
   film, as well as ejecting nanodisks at quantized film depths for
   coloring and three-dimensional surface patterning that promise new
   compact types of lab-in-film devices.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of photonic materials into CMOS processing involves the
   use of new materials. A simple one-step metal-organic radio frequency
   plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition system (RF-PEMOCVD) was
   deployed to grow erbium-doped amorphous carbon thin films (a-C:(Er)) on
   Si substrates at low temperatures (<200 degrees C). A partially
   fluorinated metal-organic compound,
   tris(6,6,7,7,8,8,8-heptafluoro-2,2-dimethyl-3,5-octanedionate)
   Erbium(+III) or abbreviated Er(fod)(3), was incorporated in situ into
   a-C based host. Six-fold enhancement of Er room-temperature
   photoluminescence at 1.54 mu m was demonstrated by deuteration of the
   a-C host. Furthermore, the effect of RF power and substrate temperature
   on the photoluminescence of a-C:D(Er) films was investigated and
   analyzed in terms of the film structure. Photoluminescence signal
   increases with increasing RF power, which is the result of an increase
   in {[}O]/{[}Er] ratio and the respective erbium-oxygen coordination
   number. Moreover, photoluminescence intensity decreases with increasing
   substrate temperature, which is attributed to an increased desorption
   rate or a lower sticking coefficient of the fluorinated fragments during
   film growth and hence {[}Er] decreases. In addition, it is observed that
   Er concentration quenching begins at similar to 2.2 at\% and continues
   to increase until 5.5 at\% in the studied a-C: D(Er) matrix. This
   technique provides the capability of doping Er in a vertically uniform
   profile.}},

   overall productivities ranged from 1.10-2.08 g/m(2) day, with those
   grown on cellulose acetate having the highest productivity. Overall
   algal biofilm productivity was largely explained by differences in the
   colonization time which in turn was strongly correlated to the polar
   surface energy of the material, but weakly correlated to water-material
   contact angle. When colonization time was taken into account, the
   productivity for all materials except acrylic was not significantly
   different at approximately 2 g/m(2)/day. Lipid content of the algal
   biofilms ranged from 6\% to 8\% (w/w) and was not correlated to
   water-material contact angle or polar surface energy. The results have
   potential application for selecting appropriate materials for algal film
   photobioreactors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of conventional transit systems is to serve
   concentrated travel patterns in urban areas, where they usually have
   high levels of success. Unconventional transit modes have also found
   success in specific conditions, fuelled by the need for transit modes
   that handle different demand levels, urban environment patterns, and
   even natural constraints and barriers. In many urban contexts,
   geographical and topographical barriers such as mountains, valleys, and
   bodies of water, and the very large infrastructure costs associated with
   overcoming these barriers, may not permit the implementation of
   conventional public transportation systems. In such cases, transit
   agencies may look to unconventional modes of travel to serve the needs
   of the residents of these areas. Aerial ropeway transit (ART), a type of
   aerial transportation in which passengers are transported in cabins that
   are suspended and pulled by cables, is one of the solutions that has
   shown its implementation rise in the past decade. This paper attempts to
   shed some light on ART technology by presenting experiences with this
   technology from both the United States as well as other parts of the
   world including the reasons for building these systems and their service
   and operational characteristics as well as other case-specific
   information. The paper concludes with an assessment of experiences with
   these systems including their benefits and limitations as well as a
   discussion of the advancements needed for ART technologies to be a fully
   recognized transit mode.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the development and the main components of a
   simulation framework aimed to model the bus transit network evolution.
   The prediction model of transit network evolution (P-TRANE) is a
   geographic information system (GIS)-based model that develops future
   predictions of service changes in the bus transit spatial network and
   service functionality at future time steps. These changes happen as a
   result of the periodic service review process and are influenced by a
   group of variables, including the changes in the future transit
   ridership pattern and future land use distribution changes. The main
   objective for P-TRANE is to function as a transit supply prediction
   component for the transportation/land use modeling simulation
   frameworks, such as the integrated land use, transportation, and
   environment (ILUTE), by generating the future bus network (supply)
   information for ILUTE. However, P-TRANE could be an aid to transit
   agencies and urban planners by means of providing a decision support
   system prediction tool. Preliminary model results on the case study of
   the Toronto Transit Commission bus network show that it is successful in
   identifying transit routes prone to frequency changes (poor performance
   and/or overcrowding). Furthermore, results show that the P-TRANE GIS
   module is a promising tool capable of proposing new bus lines, including
   feeder lines serving rapid transit projects/stations.}},

Abstract = {{A simulation study compared 36 young adult drivers' eye movements,
   driving behavior, and task completion time while dialing a flip-phone
   with tactile pushbuttons and an iPhone which provides a touchscreen
   interface. Once recruited, information on experience with different
   phone types was collected from each participant, which was then used as
   a covariate in statistical analysis. Participants who often use a
   traditional manual button phone completed the dialing task faster when
   using the flip-phone compared to touchscreen users using the iPhone. The
   flip phone, in general, resulted in fewer glances to the device than the
   iPhone. The mean number of glances greater than 1.6 s with the iPhone
   was 2.1 times the mean number with the flip phone. Further, females
   using the flip phone had the highest percentage of time spent with eyes
   on the road and the lowest likelihood of exhibiting long duration
   off-road glances (i.e., greater than 1.6 s and greater than 2 s). In
   terms of driving behavior, non-touchscreen users were found to slow down
   both when they were dialing on the flip phone and the iPhone, whereas
   touchscreen users slowed down only when they were dialing on the flip
   phone. Standard deviation of lane position was the highest when not
   dialing a phone, followed by when dialing the flip phone, and was the
   lowest when dialing the iPhone. Advantages appear to exist in a
   traditional tactile manual interface in terms of allocation of visual
   attention and possibly in compensatory behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We present the first method for digital microfluidics-based strong
   cation-exchange solid-phase extractions. Digital microfluidics is a
   microscale fluid handling technique in which liquid droplets are
   actuated over an array of electrodes by electrodynamic forces. Strong
   cation exchange has gained considerable importance in the field of
   proteomics as a separation mode for protein and peptide extractions. The
   marriage of these two techniques is achieved by incorporating
   sulphonate-functionalised porous polymer monolith discs onto digital
   microfluidic chips. By manipulating sample and solvent droplets onto and
   off of these porous polymer monoliths, proteins and peptides are
   extracted by controlling solution pH and ionic strength. This novel
   microscale extraction method has efficiency comparable to commercially
   available strong cationexchange ZipTips and is highly effective for
   sample cleanup. We anticipate that this digital microfluidic strong
   cationexchange extraction technique will prove useful for microscale
   proteomic analyses and other applications requiring separation of
   cationic compounds.}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{777-784}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Drug efficacy does not always increase sigmoidally with concentration,
   which has puzzled the community for decades. Unlike standard sigmoidal
   curves, bell-shaped concentration response curves suggest more complex
   biological effects, such as multiple-binding sites or multiple targets.
   Here, we investigate a physical property-based mechanism for bell-shaped
   curves. Beginning with the observation that some drugs form colloidal
   aggregates at relevant concentrations, we determined concentration
   response curves for three aggregating anticancer drugs, formulated both
   as colloids and as free monomer. Colloidal formulations exhibited
   bell-shaped curves, losing activity at higher concentrations, while
   monomeric formulations gave typical sigmoidal curves, sustaining a
   plateau of maximum activity. Inverting the question, we next asked if
   molecules with bell-shaped curves, reported in the literature, form
   colloidal aggregates at relevant concentrations. We selected 12
   molecules reported to have bell-shaped concentration response curves and
   found that five of these formed colloids. To understand the mechanism
   behind the loss of activity at concentrations where colloids are
   present, we investigated the diffusion of colloid-forming dye Evans blue
   into cells. We found that colloidal species are excluded from cells,
   which may explain the mechanism behind toxicological screens that use
   Evans blue, Trypan blue, and related dyes.}},

Abstract = {{Using quantitative models to predict the biological interactions of

   we characterized the serum protein corona `fingerprint' formed around a
   library of 105 surface-modified gold nanoparticles. Applying a

   uses the protein corona fingerprint to predict cell association 50\%
   more accurately than a model that uses parameters describing
   nanoparticle size, aggregation state, and surface charge. Our model
   implicates a set of hyaluronan-binding proteins as mediators of
   nanoparticle cell interactions. This study establishes a framework for
   developing a comprehensive database of protein corona fingerprints and
   biological responses for multiple nanoparticle types. Such a database
   can be used to develop quantitative relationships that predict the

Title = {{Mind the Gap: Impact of Computational Fluid Dynamics Solution Strategy
   on Prediction of Intracranial Aneurysm Hemodynamics and Rupture Status
   Indicators}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
   Computational fluid dynamics has become a popular tool for studying
   intracranial aneurysm hemodynamics, demonstrating success for
   retrospectively discriminating rupture status; however, recent highly
   refined simulations suggest potential deficiencies in solution
   strategies normally used in the aneurysm computational fluid dynamics
   literature. The purpose of the present study was to determine the impact
   of this gap.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS:
   Pulsatile flow in 12 realistic MCA aneurysms was simulated by using both
   high-resolution and normal-resolution strategies. Velocity fields were
   compared at selected instants via domain-averaged error. We also
   compared wall shear stress fields and various reduced hemodynamic
   indices: cycle-averaged mean and maximum wall shear stress, oscillatory
   shear index, low shear area, viscous dissipation ratio, and kinetic
   energy ratio.
   RESULTS:
   Instantaneous differences in flow and wall shear stress patterns were
   appreciable, especially for bifurcation aneurysms. Linear regressions
   revealed strong correlations (R-2 > 0.9) between high-resolution and
   normal-resolution solutions for all indices except kinetic energy ratio
   (R-2 = 0.25) and oscillatory shear index (R-2 = 0.23); however, for most
   indices, the slopes were significantly < 1, reflecting a pronounced
   underestimation by the normal-resolution simulations. Some
   high-resolution simulations were highly unstable, with fluctuating wall
   shear stresses reflected by the poor oscillatory shear index
   correlation.
   CONCLUSIONS:
   Typical computational fluid dynamics solution strategies may ultimately
   be adequate for augmenting rupture risk assessment on the basis of
   certain highly reduced indices; however, they cannot be relied on for
   predicting the magnitude and character of the complex biomechanical
   stimuli to which the aneurysm wall may be exposed. This impact of the
   computational fluid dynamics solution strategy is likely greater than
   that for other modeling assumptions or uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable local information dissemination is the primary concern for
   periodic safety broadcasting in VANETs. We propose a sublayer in the
   application layer of the WAVE stack to increase the reliability of

   also tackles the synchronized collision problem stated in the IEEE
   1609.4 standard as well as congestion problem and vehicle-to-vehicle
   channel loss. We propose a discrete phase type distribution to model the
   time transitions of a node state. Based on this model, a tight loss
   probability upper bound for the network coding algorithm is derived.
   Numerical results based on our analysis as well as ns-2 simulations show
   that our method outperforms the previous repetition-based algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the utilization of mobile devices (MDs) as
   decode-and-forward relays in a device-to-device assisted virtual MIMO
   (VMIMO) system is studied. Single antenna MDs are randomly distributed
   on a 2D plane according to a Poisson point process, and only a subset of
   them are sources leaving other idle MDs available to assist them
   (relays). Our goal is to develop an efficient algorithm to cluster each
   source with a subset of available relays to form a VMIMO system under a
   limited feedback assumption. We first show that the NP-hard optimization
   problem of precoding in our scenario can be approximately solved by
   semidefinite relaxation. We investigate a special case with a single
   source and analytically derive an upper bound on the average spectral
   efficiency of the VMIMO system. Then, we propose an optimal greedy
   algorithm that achieves this bound. We further exploit these results to
   obtain a polynomial time clustering algorithm for the general case with
   multiple sources. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to
   compare the performance of our algorithm with that of an exhaustive
   clustering algorithm, and it shown that these numerical results
   corroborate the efficiency of our algorithm.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{311}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Kinetic and chemical titration studies are used to unravel the reaction
   pathways and catalytic requirements for propanal deoxygenation over
   Bronsted acid sites contained within MFI zeolites. Propanal
   deoxygenation in the absence of external hydrogen source is initiated
   via primary and competitive pathways of inter- and intra-molecular C=C
   bond formation that involve bimolecular coupling of propanal and
   uni-molecular deoxygenation steps, respectively. The inter-molecular C=C
   bond formation proceeds via mechanistic steps resembled the
   acid-catalyzed aldol condensation reactions in the homogeneous phase,
   and its reactive collision frequencies increase with increasing propanal
   pressure. The reaction is initiated by keto-enol tautomerization of
   propanal to form small concentrations of propenol. The propenol
   under-goes kinetically-relevant nucleophilic attack to protonated
   propanal, the most abundant surface intermediates,. to create the
   inter-molecular C=C bond. The competitive uni-molecular deoxygenation
   step involves kinetically-relevant hydrogen transfer from
   hydrogen-donating agents and occurs at rates that remain invariance with
   propanal pressure. Hydrogen-donating agents are aliphatic rings produced
   from consecutive inter-molecular C=C bond formation and ring closure
   events and donate hydrogen via dehydrogenation steps to increase their
   extent of unsaturation. Hydrogen-donating events must kinetically couple
   with the direct hydrogen insertion step on propanal to satisfy the
   deoxygenation stoichiometry and form propanol, which upon dehydration
   evolves predominantly propene, thus preserving the carbon backbone.
   Water as a by-product prevents binding of larger, inactive carbonaceous
   species on acid sites and inhibits the inter-molecular C=C bond
   formation step by increasing the reverse rate of this step. Water,
   however, does not alter the net rate for intra-molecular C=C bond
   formation, because of its irreversible nature. An increase in the rate
   ratio for intra- over inter-molecular C=C bond formation upon the
   addition of 3-methyl-1-pentene, an effective hydrogen-donating agent,
   confirms the kinetic relevance of the hydrogen transfer step for propene
   formation. These findings on the different kinetic dependencies for the
   competitive reactions and their mechanistic interpretations provide the
   operating strategies to tune the reaction pathways, manipulate the
   extent of hydrogen transfer, and tailor the distributions of larger
   oxygenates and alkenes during propanal deoxygenation reactions. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{One of the challenges in MRI-controlled hyperthermia cancer treatment
   for localized tumor is that the tissue properties are dynamic and
   difficult to measure. Therefore, tuning the optimal gains for a constant

   single-output adaptive controller strategy is proposed to address these
   problems. The inputs to the controller block are the frequency, rotation
   rate, and applied power level of an interstitial applicator, and the
   output is the boundary temperature during treatment. The time-varying
   gains of the new controller are updated over time using Lyapunov-based
   stability analysis. The robustness of the new controller to changes in
   the parameters of the tissue is investigated and compared to a constant
   gain controller through simulation studies. Simulations take into
   account changes in tissue properties and other conditions that may be
   encountered in a practical clinical situation. Finally, the
   effectiveness of the proposed controller is validated through an
   experimental study.}},

Abstract = {{To provide efficient, high-performance routing algorithms, a holistic
   approach should be taken. The key aspects of routing algorithm design
   include adaptivity, path selection strategy, VC allocation, isolation,
   and hardware implementation cost; these design aspects are not
   independent. The key contribution of this work lies in the design of a
   novel selection strategy, Destination-Based Selection Strategy (DBSS),
   which targets interference that can arise in many-core systems running
   consolidation workloads. In the process of this design, we holistically
   consider all aspects to ensure an efficient design. Existing routing
   algorithms largely overlook issues associated with workload
   consolidation. Locally adaptive algorithms do not consider enough status
   information to avoid network congestion. Globally adaptive routing
   algorithms attack this issue by utilizing network status beyond
   neighboring nodes. However, they may suffer from interference, coupling
   the behavior of otherwise independent applications. To address these
   issues, DBSS leverages both local and nonlocal network status to provide
   more effective adaptivity. More importantly, by integrating the
   destination into the selection procedure, DBSS mitigates interference
   and offers dynamic isolation among applications. Results show that DBSS
   offers better performance than the best baseline selection strategy and
   improves the energy-delay product for medium and high injection rates;
   it is well suited for workload consolidation.}},

Abstract = {{The increased demand for on-chip communication bandwidth as a result of
   the multicore trend has made packet-switched networks-on-chip (NoCs) a
   more compelling choice for the communication backbone in next-generation
   systems {[}1]. However, NoC designs have many power, area, and
   performance tradeoffs in topology, buffer sizes, routing algorithms, and
   flow control mechanisms-hence, the study of new NoC designs can be very
   time intensive. To address these challenges, we propose DART, a fast and
   flexible FPGA-based NoC simulation architecture. Rather than laying the
   NoC out in hardware on the FPGA like previous approaches {[}2], {[}3],
   our design virtualizes the NoC by mapping its components to a generic
   NoC simulation engine, composed of a fully connected collection of
   fundamental components (e.g., routers and flit queues). This approach
   has two main advantages: 1) since it is virtualized it can simulate any
   NoC, and 2) any NoC can be mapped to the engine without rebuilding it,
   which can take significant time for a large FPGA design. We demonstrate
   1) that an implementation of DART on a Virtex-II Pro FPGA can achieve
   over 100 x speedup over the cycle-based software simulator Booksim
   {[}4], while maintaining the same level of simulation accuracy, and 2)
   that a more modern Virtex-6 FPGA can accommodate a 49-node DART
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{The security of a high speed quantum key distribution system with finite
   detector dead time tau is analyzed. When the transmission rate becomes
   higher than the maximum count rate of the individual detectors (1/tau),
   security issues affect the scheme for sifting bits. Analytical
   calculations and numerical simulations of the Bennett-Brassard BB84
   protocol are performed. We study Rogers et al.'s scheme (further
   information is available in {[}D. J. Rogers, J. C. Bienfang, A.
   Nakassis, H. Xu, and C. W. Clark, New J. Phys. 9, 319 (2007)]) in the
   presence of an active eavesdropper Eve who has the power to perform an
   intercept-resend attack. It is shown that Rogers et al.'s scheme is no
   longer guaranteed to be secure. More specifically, Eve can induce a
   basis-dependent detection efficiency at the receiver's end. Modified key
   sifting schemes that are basis-independent and thus secure in the
   presence of dead time and an active eavesdropper are then introduced. We
   analyze and compare these secure sifting schemes for this active Eve
   scenario, and calculate and simulate their key generation rate. It is
   shown that the maximum key generation rate is 1/(2 tau) for passive
   basis selection, and 1/tau for active basis selection. The security
   analysis for finite detector dead time is also extended to the decoy
   state BB84 protocol for one particular secure sifting scheme.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the center of
   pressure (COP) velocity reflects the center of mass (COM) acceleration
   due to a large derivative gain in the neural control system during quiet
   standing. Twenty-seven young (27.2 +/- 4.5 years) and twenty-three
   elderly (66.2 +/- 5.0 years) subjects participated in this study. Each
   subject was requested to stand quietly on a force plate for five trials,
   each 90 s long. The COP and COM displacements, the COP and COM
   velocities, and the COM acceleration were acquired via a force plate and
   a laser displacement sensor. The amount of fluctuation of each variable
   was quantified using the root mean square. Following the experimental
   study, a simulation study was executed to investigate the experimental
   findings. The experimental results revealed that the COP velocity was
   correlated with the COM velocity, but more highly correlated with the
   COM acceleration. The equation of motion of the inverted pendulum model,
   however, accounts only for the correlation between the COP and COM
   velocities. These experimental results can be meaningfully explained by
   the simulation study, which indicated that the neural motor command
   presumably contains a significant portion that is proportional to body
   velocity. In conclusion, the COP velocity fluctuation reflects the COM
   acceleration fluctuation rather than the COM velocity fluctuation,
   implying that the neural motor command controlling quiet standing
   posture contains a significant portion that is proportional to body
   velocity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

   MDPs are intractable to exact methods, we employ
   linear-programming-based Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) to obtain
   approximate solutions. Using simulation, we compare the performance of
   the resulting ADP policies to practical and easy-to-use heuristic
   decision rules under diverse scenarios. The results indicate that ADP is
   promising in several scenarios, and that a specific easy-to-use
   heuristic performs well in the idealized chemotherapy scheduling setting
   we study.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, reconfigurable antennas have been sought to improve the
   performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless
   communication systems. Their ability to dynamically reconfigure their
   radiation pattern adds diversity in a manner that is not possible with
   fixed antennas. This paper investigates the performance benefits
   provided by pattern reconfigurable receiving antennas with uniform beam
   steering capability. Their potential performance is first estimated
   using simulations, and for the first time, the effect of uniform beam
   steering on MIMO system performance is evaluated in a real indoor
   channel using two electrically steerable passive array radiator (ESPAR)
   antennas. Performance comparison is made against a pair of monopole
   antennas using a hardware bit error rate (BER) test-bed that
   incorporates statistical spatial averaging in order to assess
   performance improvements in a more realistic way, and analyze the effect
   of antenna diversity on the overall system performance. The MIMO-ESPAR
   system reduces BER with certain pattern combinations and excels in
   capacity evaluations. The ESPAR antennas improve the spatially averaged
   channel capacity by as much as 37\% at 10 dB transmit SNR, and gain an
   additional 1 bit/s/Hz in peak capacity at 10 dB receive SNR from
   diversity gain alone. These improvements make pattern reconfigurable
   antennas promising options in MIMO-related applications.}},

Abstract = {{Client cache is an important technology for the optimization of
   distributed and centralized storage systems. As a representative client
   cache system, the performance of Cache Files is limited by transition
   faults. Furthermore, Cache Files just supports a simple LRU policy with
   a tightly-coupled design. To overcome these limitations, we propose to
   employ Stable Set Model (SSM) to improve Cache Files and design an
   enhanced Cache Files, SAC. SSM assumes that data access can be
   decomposed to access on some stable sets, in which elements are always
   repeatedly accessed or not accessed together. Using SSM methods can
   improve the cache management and reduce the effect of transition faults.
   We also adopt loosely-coupled methods to design prefetch and replacement
   policies. We implement our scheme on Linux 2.6.32 and measure the
   execution time of the scheme with various file I/O benchmarks.
   Experiments show that SAC can significantly improve I/0 performance and
   reduce execution time up to 84\%, compared with the existing Cache
   Files.}},

   were obtained and analyzed in a blinded manner with and without
   stimulation. The Tinetti Mobility Test was also performed in the two
   conditions. At 11 months after surgery, there was a 3-point improvement
   in the Tinetti Mobility Test in the on stimulation condition, although
   there was no statistically significant difference in spatiotemporal gait
   parameters. Static posturography did not demonstrate a significant
   improvement in stability measures between the two conditions in a
   stochastic way. Thoracic epidural spinal cord stimulation had a mild but
   clinically meaningful beneficial effect in improving gait and balance in
   a patient with SCA-7. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms remain

Title = {{The relationship between filter pressure drop, indoor air quality, and

Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{151-161}},

Abstract = {{HVAC filters are commonly used to decrease exposure to particulate
   matter, yet little is known about the energy impacts and air quality
   consequences of high efficiency filters installed in commercial
   buildings. To explore these effects, system airflow, filter and coil
   pressure drop, fan pressure rise, and power draw were measured, and
   cooling capacity and compressor power were modeled for at least four
   filter pressure drops in 15 rooftop units equipped with and without fan
   speed control. Energy implications and clean-air-delivery-rate were
   estimated for a large dataset of filters divided into four efficiency
   (MERV) categories. Field measurements conducted on units without fan
   speed control showed that increased filter pressure drop decreased flow,
   cooling capacity, and power. For a unit with fan speed control, the same
   increase in pressure drop resulted in the same magnitude change of fan
   power but in the opposite direction, and other parameters were
   unchanged. Replacing MERV 8 with MERV 13/14 resulted in higher energy
   consumption (2-4\%) during cooling mode for both unit types, energy
   savings during fan-only mode (8-13\%) in units without fan speed
   control, and increased energy consumption in fan-only mode (11-18\%) in
   the unit with fan speed control. Energy consumption increases were
   offset by improvement in clean-air-delivery-rate, especially for PM2.5
   (2.9-3.8 times increase going from MERV 8 to MERV 13/14), with larger
   benefits achieved for the unit with fan speed control. A comprehensive
   understanding of the impact of filtration is essential to selecting the
   appropriate efficiency of filters that ensures low-energy use and a
   healthy indoor environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Precursor field theory has been developed to describe the dynamics of
   electromagnetic field evolution in causally attenuative and dispersive
   media. In Debye dielectrics, the so-called Brillouin precursor exhibits
   an algebraic attenuation rate that makes it an ideal pulse waveform for
   communication, sensing, and imaging applications. Inspired by these
   studies in the electromagnetic domain, the present paper explores the
   propagation of acoustic precursors in dispersive media, with emphasis on
   biological media. To this end, a recently proposed causal dispersive
   model is employed, based on its interpretation as the acoustic
   counterpart of the Cole-Cole model for dielectrics. The model stems from
   the fractional stress-strain relation, which is consistent with the
   empirically known frequency power-law attenuation in viscoelastic media.
   It is shown that viscoelastic media described by this model, including
   human blood, support the formation and propagation of Brillouin
   precursors. The amplitude of these precursors exhibits a sub-exponential
   attenuation rate as a function of distance, actually being proportional
   to z(-p), where z is the distance traveled within the medium and 0.5 < p
   < 1. The precursors identified in this work facilitate the design of
   optimal waveforms for propagation in complex media, creating new
   possibilities for acoustic-pulse-based communication and imaging
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{The elderly often suffer from progressive muscle weakness and
   regenerative failure. We demonstrate that muscle regeneration is
   impaired with aging owing in part to a cell-autonomous functional
   decline in skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Two-thirds of MuSCs from
   aged mice are intrinsically defective relative to MuSCs from young mice,
   with reduced capacity to repair myofibers and repopulate the stem cell
   reservoir in vivo following transplantation. This deficiency is
   correlated with a higher incidence of cells that express senescence
   markers and is due to elevated activity of the p38 alpha and p38 beta
   mitogen-activated kinase pathway. We show that these limitations cannot
   be overcome by transplantation into the microenvironment of young
   recipient muscles. In contrast, subjecting the MuSC population from aged
   mice to transient inhibition of p38 alpha and p38 beta in conjunction
   with culture on soft hydrogel substrates rapidly expands the residual
   functional MuSC population from aged mice, rejuvenating its potential
   for regeneration and serial transplantation as well as strengthening of
   damaged muscles of aged mice. These findings reveal a synergy between
   biophysical and biochemical cues that provides a paradigm for a
   localized autologous muscle stem cell therapy for the elderly.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of cardiac tissue engineering is to restore function to the
   damaged myocardium with regenerative constructs. Human embryonic stem
   cell derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) can produce viable, contractile,
   three-dimensional grafts that function in vivo. We sought to enhance the
   viability and functional maturation of cardiac tissue constructs by
   cyclical stretch. hESC-CMs seeded onto gelatin-based scaffolds underwent
   cyclical stretching. Histological analysis demonstrated a greater
   proportion of cardiac troponin T expressing cells in stretched than
   non-stretched constructs, and flow sorting demonstrated a higher
   proportion of cardiomyocytes. Ultrastructural assessment showed that
   cells in stretched constructs had a more mature phenotype, characterized
   by greater cell elongation, increased gap junction expression, and
   better contractile elements. Real-time PCR revealed enhanced mRNA
   expression of genes associated with cardiac maturation as well as genes
   encoding cardiac ion channels. Calcium imaging confirmed that stretched
   constructs contracted more frequently, with shorter calcium cycle
   duration. Epicardial implantation of constructs onto ischemic rat hearts
   demonstrated the feasibility of this platform, with enhanced survival
   and engraftment of transplanted cells in the stretched constructs. This
   uniaxial stretching system may serve as a platform for the production of
   cardiac tissue-engineered constructs for translational applications. (C)

Abstract = {{The solar-power conversion efficiencies of colloidal quantum dot solar
   cells have advanced from sub-1\% reported in 2005 to a record value of
   8.5\% in 2013. Much focus has deservedly been placed on densifying,
   passivating and crosslinking the colloidal quantum dot solid. Here we
   review progress in improving charge extraction, achieved by engineering
   the composition and structure of the electrode materials that contact
   the colloidal quantum dot film. New classes of structured electrodes
   have been developed and integrated to form bulk heterojunction devices
   that enhance photocharge extraction. Control over band offsets, doping
   and interfacial trap state densities have been essential for achieving
   improved electrical communication with colloidal quantum dot solids.
   Quantum junction devices that not only tune the optical absorption
   spectrum, but also provide inherently matched bands across the interface
   between p-and n-materials, have proven that charge separation can occur
   efficiently across an all-quantum-tuned rectifying junction.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering strategies rely on the ability to promote cell
   proliferation and migration into porous biomaterial constructs, as well
   as to support specific phenotypic states of the cells in vitro. The
   present study investigated the use of released factors from monocytes
   and their derived macrophages (MDM) and the mechanism by which they
   regulate vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) response in a VSMC-monocyte
   co-culture system within a porous degradable polyurethane (D-PHI)
   scaffold. VSMCs cultured in monocyte/MDM-conditioned medium (MCM),
   generated from the culture of monocytes/MDM on D-PHI scaffolds for up to
   28 days, similarly affected VSMC contractile marker expression, growth
   and three-dimensional migration when compared to direct VSMC-monocyte
   co-culture. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-6
   (IL-6) were identified as two cytokines present in MCM, at
   concentrations that have previously been shown to influence VSMC
   phenotype. VSMCs cultured alone on D-PHI scaffolds and exposed to MCP-1
   (5 ng ml(-1)) or IL-6 (1 ng ml(-1)) for 7 days experienced a suppression
   in contractile marker expression (with MCP-1 or IL-6) and increased
   growth (with MCP-1) compared to no cytokine medium supplementation.
   These effects were also observed in VSMC-monocyte co-culture on D-PHI.
   Neutralization of IL-6, but not MCP-1, was subsequently shown to
   decrease VSMC growth and enhance calponin expression for VSMC-monocyte
   co-cultures on D-PHI scaffolds for 7 days, implying that IL-6 mediates
   VSMC response in monocyte-VSMC co-cultures. This study highlights the
   use of monocytes and their derived macrophages in conjunction with
   immunomodulatory biomaterials, such as D-PHI, as agents for regulating
   VSMC response, and demonstrates the importance of monocyte/MDM-released
   factors, such as IL-6 in particular, in this process. (C) 2013 Acta

Abstract = {{Distributed source coding is traditionally viewed in a block coding
   context wherein all source symbols are known in advance by the encoders.
   However, many modern applications to which distributed source coding
   ideas are applied, are better modeled as having streaming data. In a
   streaming setting, source symbol pairs are revealed to separate encoders
   in real time and need to be reconstructed at the decoder with subject to
   some tolerable end-to-end delay. In this paper, a causal sequential
   random binning encoder is introduced and paired with maximum likelihood
   (ML) and universal decoders. The latter uses a novel weighted empirical
   suffix entropy decoding rule. We derive a lower bounds on the error
   exponent with delay for each decoder. We also provide upper bounds for
   the special case of streaming with decoder side information and discuss
   when upper and lower bounds match. We show that both ML and universal
   decoders achieve the same (positive) error exponents for all rate pairs
   inside the Slepian-Wolf achievable rate region. The dominant error
   events in streaming are different from those in block-coding and result
   in different exponents. Because the sequential random binning scheme is
   also universal over delays, the resulting code eventually reconstructs
   every source symbol correctly with probability one.}},

Abstract = {{We study behavior of the Bayesian estimator for noisy General Gaussian
   Distributed (GGD) data and show that this estimator can be well
   estimated with a simple shrinkage function. The four parameters of this
   shrinkage function are functions of GGD's shape parameter and data
   variance. The Shrinkage map, denoted by Rigorous BayesShrink
   (R-BayesShrink), models the Bayesian estimator for any value of shape
   parameter. In addition, when the shape parameter is between 0.5 and 1,
   this Shrinkage function transforms into a simple soft threshold. This
   result places the role of soft thresholding image denoising methods,
   such as BayesSkrink, in a new theoretical perspective. Moreover,
   BayesShrink is shown to be a special case of R-BayesShrink when the
   shape parameter is one (Laplacian distribution). Our simulation results
   confirm optimality of R-BayesShrink in GGD signal denoising in the sense
   of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM)
   index for a range of shape parameters.}},

Abstract = {{We study the influences to the discrete soliton (DS) by introducing

   Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations find that the DS under
   this circumstance can exhibit strong digital effects: the fundamental DS
   is a narrow one, which occupies nearly only one waveguide, the dipole
   and double-monopole solitons, which occupy two waveguides, can be found
   in self-focusing and -defocusing nonlinearities, respectively. Stable
   flat-top solitons and their stagger counterparts, which occupy a
   controllable number of waveguides, can also be obtained through this

Title = {{Modulation of annulus fibrosus cell alignment and function on oriented
   nanofibrous polyurethane scaffolds under tension}},
Journal = {{SPINE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{424-434}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Annulus fibrosus (AF), a component of the
   intervertebral disc (IVD), is always under tension in vivo, a condition
   that must be taken into consideration when tissue engineering an IVD.
   Loss of the tensile forces has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
   disc degeneration characterized by mechanical and structural breakdown
   of the AF.
   PURPOSE: In this study, we hypothesize that tensile forces modulate
   cellular and molecular behavior of AF cells grown on nanofibrous
   scaffolds in vitro.
   STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Bovine AF cells were seeded onto strained
   electrospun-aligned nanofibrous polycarbonate urethane (PU) scaffolds.
   Tension was either maintained throughout the culture duration
   (monotonic) or removed after 24 hours (relaxed).
   METHODS: The effect of tension on AF cells cultured on PU scaffolds was
   evaluated over 7 days by scanning electron microscopy, biochemical
   assays, immunofluorescence microscopy, and quantitative polymerase chain
   reaction.
   RESULTS: Cells grown on the relaxed scaffold were significantly more
   proliferative, synthesized more collagen and had increased collagen type
   I and TGF beta-1 gene expression; however these cells were not as
   aligned as were the cells and matrix on monotonic strained scaffolds.
   The alignment of AF cells grown on monotonic scaffolds correlated with
   significantly greater scaffold elastic modulus on day 7. Additionally,
   the cellular response to the change in strain was delayed by 3 to 5 days
   after tension release, which correlated with the time at which changes
   in scaffold length were detected.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that AF cells respond at the
   molecular and cellular level to the changes in matrix/scaffold tension.
   This suggests that it may be necessary to determine the optimal elastic
   modulus and applied tensile forces to tissue engineer an AF that mimics
   the native tissue. Furthermore, this study provides insight into how
   changes in tensile forces may lead to changes in the AF cell function.

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Laparoscopy is currently the gold standard for cholecystectomy. Recent
   literature suggests surgical trainees have limited exposure to open
   cholecystectomy, which may result in suboptimal performance in the event
   of conversion. Furthermore, most training and assessment models are
   designed for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, with limited opportunities
   for open simulator training. The present study's purpose was to design
   an inexpensive model for open cholecystectomy and to validate a
   performance assessment tool.
   The simulator comprises a porcine liver and gallbladder in a mock human
   abdomen with silicon skin. The assessment tool utilizes inexpensive
   infrared (IR) cameras to provide tracking of participant hand motions.
   Eleven novice general surgery trainees (< 20 cholecystectomies) and five
   expert surgeons (> 100 cholecystectomies) completed an open
   cholecystectomy using the simulator. Procedures were recorded and
   assessed by a blinded evaluator using a global rating scale. Tracking
   data analysis was based on number of movements and total path length.
   Novices (t = 36.18 min) completed the procedure significantly slower
   than did experts (t = 19.53 min) (Mann-Whitney test U = 20, p < 0.05)
   and had significantly more hand movements (Mann-Whitney test U = 20, p <
   0.05). Analysis of the total global rating scale scores showed a
   significant difference between novice (14/35) and expert (24/35)
   performance in all categories (Mann-Whitney test U = 58, p < 0.05).
   The present model presents a realistic, low-cost tool for training and
   assessment of procedural skills in open cholecystectomy. The study
   demonstrated the validity of the IR tracking device as an objective
   assessment tool for open surgical skills training. Future training
   should incorporate this low-cost, highly effective training device into
   surgical curricula.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates the queueing system of the primary user (PU)

   found appropriate to describe the PU's queueing system even though the
   PU transmits its data at a constant rate. The queueing performance
   measures are investigated; these measures include mean service time,
   server utilization, mean waiting and transit times, and mean number of
   waiting and transit packets. Numerical results are provided to

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{A fully-coupled soot formation model is developed to predict the
   concentration, size, and aggregate structure of soot particles in the
   atmospheric pressure laminar coflow diffusion flames of a
   three-component surrogate for Jet A-1, a three-component surrogate for a
   Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK), and n-decane. To
   model the chemical structure of the flames and soot precursor formation,
   a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for fuel oxidation, with 2185
   species and 8217 reactions, is reduced and combined with a Polycyclic
   Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) formation and growth scheme. The mechanism is
   coupled to a highly detailed sectional particle dynamics model that
   predicts the volume fraction, structure, and size of soot particles by
   considering PAH-based nucleation, surface growth, PAH surface
   condensation, aggregation, surface oxidation, fragmentation,
   thermophoresis, and radiation. The simulation results are validated by
   comparing against experimental data measured for the flames of
   pre-vaporized fuels. The objectives of the present effort are to more
   accurately simulate the physical soot formation processes and to improve
   the predictions of our previously published jet fuel soot formation
   models, particularly for the size and aggregate structure of soot
   particles. To this end, the following improvements are considered: (I)
   addition of particle coalescence submodels to account for the loss of
   surface area, reduction of the number of primary particles, and increase
   of primary particle diameters upon collision, (2) consideration of a
   larger PAH molecule (benzopyrene instead of pyrene) for nucleation and
   surface growth to enhance the agreement between the soot model and the
   measured chemical composition of soot particles, and (3) implementation
   of a dimerization efficiency in the soot inception submodel to account
   for the collisions between PAH molecules that do not lead to
   dimerization. The results of two different particle coalescence
   submodels show that this process is too slow to account for the growth
   of primary particles, mainly because of the limited rate of particle
   collisions. Soot volume fraction predictions on the wings and at lower
   flame heights are considerably improved by using benzopyrene, due to the
   different distribution of the soot forming PAH molecule in the flame.
   The computed number of primary particles per aggregate and the diameters
   of primary particles agree very well with the experimentally measured
   values after implementing the dimerization efficiency for PAH
   collisions, because of the reduced rate of soot inception compared to
   growth by PAH condensation. Concentrations of major gaseous species and
   flame temperatures are also well predicted by the model. The
   underprediction of soot concentration on the flame centerline, observed
   in previous studies, still exists despite minor improvements. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The modeling of service dynamics has been the focus of recent
   developments in the field of transit assignment modeling. The emerging
   focus on dynamic service modeling requires a corresponding shift in
   transit demand modeling to represent appropriately the dynamic behaviour
   of passengers and their responses to Intelligent Transportation Systems
   technologies. This paper presents the theoretical development of a
   departure time and transit path choice model based on the Markovian
   Decision Process. This model is the core of the MIcrosimulation
   Learning-based Approach to TRansit Assignment. Passengers, while
   traveling, move to different locations in the transit network at
   different points in time (e.g. at stop, on board), representing a
   stochastic process. This stochastic process is partly dependent on the
   transit service performance and partly controlled by the transit rider's
   trip choices. This can be analyzed as a Markovian Decision Process, in
   which actions are rewarded and hence passengers' optimal policies for
   maximizing the trip utility can be estimated. The proposed model is
   classified as a bounded rational model, with a constant utility term and
   a stochastic choice rule. The model is appropriate for modeling
   information provision since it distinguishes between individual's
   experience with the service performance and information provided about
   system dynamics.}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Pattern recognition is a collection of computer techniques to classify
   various observations into different clusters of similar attributes in
   either supervised or unsupervised manner. Application of fuzzy logic to
   unsupervised classification or clustering methods has resulted in many
   wildly used techniques such as fuzzy c-means (FCM) method. However, when
   the observations are too noisy, the performance of such methods might be
   reduced. Thus, in this paper, a new fuzzy clustering method based on FCM
   is presented and the relative entropy is added to its objective function
   as a regularization function to maximize the dissimilarity between
   clusters. Several examples are provided to examine the performance of
   the proposed clustering method. The obtained results show that the
   proposed method has a very good ability in detecting noises and
   assignment of suitable membership degrees to the observations. (C) 2013

   We develop mixed integer linear and quadratic optimization formulations

   Compared to previous approaches, our models produce layouts that tend to
   be more symmetric and that generate slightly more power. Our
   formulations solve quickly, allowing a decision maker to efficiently

Abstract = {{A simplified process was developed for fabricating natural bio-based
   fiber-reinforced polymer composites for applications such as automotive
   interior trim substrates. Biofiber (Kraft pulp fiber) and four types of
   thermoplastic polymers (PP, two PP/PE polymer blends, and PLA) were
   first wet-formed into fiber/polymer mats and the mats were made into
   composites using a match-mold thermoforming process. The effects of void
   content on the composite tensile and flexural properties were
   investigated. Impact resistance and heat deflection temperature were
   tested and acoustic absorption coefficients of the composites were
   evaluated as well. Two types of prototype panels (2-D and 3-D)
   containing biofiber/polymer composite substrates with a bonded synthetic
   leather decorative surface were successfully made using this process.
   Biofiber/PP composites had comparable performance to the commercially
   available non-wood natural fiber/PP composite counterparts for the
   properties investigated in this study at the same density level (0.8
   g/cm(3)).}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies assessed the outcome of ankle arthrodesis (AA) and

   postoperative recovery towards bilateral gait mechanics (BGM) is
   unknown. We evaluated the outcome of the two surgeries at least 2 years
   post rehabilitation, focusing on BGM. 36 participants, including 12 AA
   patients, 12 TAR patients, and 12 controls were included. Gait
   assessment over 50m distance was performed utilizing pressure insoles
   and 3D inertial sensors, following which an intraindividual comparison
   was performed. Most spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters in the TAR
   group were indicative of good gait symmetry, while the AA group
   presented significant differences. Plantar pressure symmetry among the
   AA group was also significantly distorted. Abnormality in biomechanical
   behavior of the AA unoperated, contralateral foot was observed. In
   summary, our results indicate an altered BGM in AA patients, whereas a
   relatively fully recovered BGM is observed in TAR patients, despite the
   quantitative differences in several parameters when compared to a
   healthy population. Our study supports a biomechanical assessment and
   rehabilitation of both operated and unoperated sides after major

   motor speed is proportional to the amplitude of the traveling wave and,
   in order to obtain large amplitudes, the stator is excited at
   frequencies close to its resonance frequency. This paper presents a
   non-empirical partial differential equations model for the stator, which
   is discretized using the finite volume method. The fundamental frequency
   of the discretized model is computed and compared to the
   experimentally-measured operating frequency of the stator of Shinsei
   USR60 piezoelectric motor. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The solubility of CO2 in polylactide acid (PLA) and the

   results indicated that as the temperature increased, the swelling and
   the solubility decreased, whereas increased pressure produced increases
   in swelling and solubility. The D-lactic acid content (D-content) did
   not have a pronounced effect on the solubility of CO2 or on the swollen
   volume of the PLA/CO2 mixture. We compared the theoretical and

Abstract = {{Polymer nanocomposites have actively been studied to replace metals in
   different emerging applications because of their light weight, superior
   manufacturability, and low processing cost. For example, extensive
   research efforts have been made to develop advanced thermally conductive
   polymer nanocomposites, with good processability, for heat management
   applications. In this study, liquid crystal polymer (LCP)-based
   nanocomposites have shown to possess much higher effective thermal
   conductivity (k(eff)) (i.e., as high as 2.58W/m K) than neat polymers
   (i.e., similar to 0.2-0.4W/m K). The fibrillation of LCP in LCP-graphene
   nanoplatelet (GNP) nanocomposites also demonstrated more pronounced
   increase in k(eff) than that of polyphenylene sulfide (PPS)-GNP
   nanocomposites. Furthermore, ultra-drawing of LCP-GNP nanocomposite led
   to additional increase in the nanocomposite's k(eff) because of the
   alignments of LCP fibrils and the embedded GNP. Experimental results
   also revealed that, unlike k(eff), the electrical conductivity (sigma)
   of nanocomposites was unaffected by the types of polymer matrix. This
   exhibited that the k(eff) and sigma were promoted by different
   mechanisms, suggesting a potential route to tailor polymer
   nanocomposite's k(eff) and sigma independently. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Title = {{Estimating Oxygen Needs for Childhood Pneumonia in Developing Country
   Health Systems: A New Model for Expecting the Unexpected}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Planning for the reliable and cost-effective supply of a
   health service commodity such as medical oxygen requires an
   understanding of the dynamic need or `demand' for the commodity over
   time. In developing country health systems, however, collecting
   longitudinal clinical data for forecasting purposes is very difficult.
   Furthermore, approaches to estimating demand for supplies based on
   annual averages can underestimate demand some of the time by missing
   temporal variability.
   Methods: A discrete event simulation model was developed to estimate
   variable demand for a health service commodity using the important
   example of medical oxygen for childhood pneumonia. The model is based on
   five key factors affecting oxygen demand: annual pneumonia admission
   rate, hypoxaemia prevalence, degree of seasonality, treatment duration,
   and oxygen flow rate. These parameters were varied over a wide range of
   values to generate simulation results for different settings. Total
   oxygen volume, peak patient load, and hours spent above average-based
   demand estimates were computed for both low and high seasons.
   Findings: Oxygen demand estimates based on annual average values of
   demand factors can often severely underestimate actual demand. For
   scenarios with high hypoxaemia prevalence and degree of seasonality,
   demand can exceed average levels up to 68\% of the time. Even for
   typical scenarios, demand may exceed three times the average level for
   several hours per day. Peak patient load is sensitive to hypoxaemia
   prevalence, whereas time spent at such peak loads is strongly influenced
   by degree of seasonality.
   Conclusion: A theoretical study is presented whereby a simulation
   approach to estimating oxygen demand is used to better capture temporal
   variability compared to standard average-based approaches. This approach
   provides better grounds for health service planning, including
   decision-making around technologies for oxygen delivery. Beyond oxygen,
   this approach is widely applicable to other areas of resource and
   technology planning in developing country health systems.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of water monomers with a gold surface is investigated
   using density functional theory (DFT) to develop a better understanding
   of the response of a water molecule to an imposed electric field at the
   surface. Two gold surface orientations, Au(111) and Au(110), are
   studied. Multiple unique stable adsorption positions of water molecules
   are identified for each surface orientation, and the results are
   validated against existing theoretical and experimental data. The values
   of the adsorption energies do not vary by more than 0.06 eV, which
   suggests that the potential energy surface of the water molecule
   interacting with the gold electrode is relatively smooth. The projected
   density of states and the difference charge density analyses reveal that
   the interaction mechanism between the water molecule and the gold
   electrode is a partial exchange of charge rather than a chemical
   bonding. A normal electric field of magnitude between +/- 5.0 X 10(9)
   V/m is applied and its effect on the geometry and orientation of the
   water molecule is analyzed. The change in the geometry of the water
   molecule in response to the applied electric field shows a strong
   nonlinearity and asymmetry with respect to the magnitude and direction
   of the applied field. The interaction between the water monomer and Au
   electrode with/without the electric field is explained in terms of the
   interplay of Au-O, Au-OH, and electrostatic interactions. There is a
   significant difference between the dielectric response of the water
   molecule on the Au(111) and Au(110) surface that is related to the
   strength of the adsorption energy of the water monomer to both surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and analyze the performance of a technique to generate mode
   and polarization hyperentangled photons in monolithic semiconductor
   waveguides using two concurrent type-II spontaneous parametric
   down-conversion (SPDC) processes. These two SPDC processes are achieved
   by waveguide engineering which allows for simultaneous modal phase
   matching with the pump beam in a higher-order mode. Paired photons
   generated in each process are cross polarized and guided by different
   guiding mechanisms, which produces entanglement in both polarization and
   spatial mode. Theoretical analysis shows that the output quantum state
   has a high quality of hyperentanglement by spectral filtering with a
   bandwidth of a few nanometers, while off-chip compensation is not
   needed. This technique offers a path to realize an electrically pumped
   hyperentangled photon source.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying air pollutants that pose potential adverse health exposures
   in retail stores will facilitate exposure mitigation. Assessing the role
   of ventilation in mitigating this exposure is important to understand
   the energy implications of maintaining acceptable indoor air quality. In
   this work, we summarize results from 28 papers that report ventilation
   rates and/or pollutant concentrations in retail stores. These results
   were compared to available standards as well as data collected in
   non-retail environments. The findings of this review are: (1) half of
   the stores tested met/exceeded ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010 (ASHRAE 2010a;
   or California Code of Regulations Title 24-2010) for ventilation; (2)
   PM2.5, acrolein, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde exceeded their
   established, most conservative limits/reference exposures for a few of
   the stores tested in the United States, and outside the United States,
   researchers reported PM10, benzene, and trichloroethylene as additional
   pollutants found at concentrations that exceeded their limits; (3)
   alternative control methods would be more effective, and possibly more
   economical, than ventilation; (4) meeting or exceeding the ventilation
   requirements does not necessarily negate the presence of pollutants
   above their suggested limits; and (5) using
   disability-adjusted-life-year (DALY) as a metric of disease burden, two
   pollutants were identified as priority hazards in retail stores: PM2.5
   and acrolein. Control strategies should focus on decreasing exposure of
   retail employees to these pollutants generated indoors or infiltrated

Abstract = {{The adsorption of up to one monolayer (ML) of copper phthalocyanine
   (CuPc) molecules on a room temperature Cu(111) surface has been studied
   using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Below 1 ML the molecules are
   in a fluid state and are highly mobile on the surface. At 1 ML coverage
   the molecules coalesce into a highly ordered 2D crystal phase. At sub-ML
   coverages, chemisorption of individual CuPc molecules can be induced
   through exposure to tunneling electrons at a tunneling bias voltage
   exceeding a threshold value. This tunneling electron induced effect has
   been exploited to perform molecular STM lithography. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{The Fast Evolution of Vehicle Emissions from Roadway (FEVER) study was
   undertaken to strategically measure pollutant gradients perpendicular to
   a major highway north of Toronto, Canada. A case study period was
   analyzed when there was an average perpendicular wind direction. Two
   independent, fast response measurements were used to infer rapid organic
   aerosol (OA) growth on a spatial scale from 34 m to 285 m at the same
   time as a decrease was observed in the mixing ratio of primary emitted
   species, such as CO2 and NOx. An integrated organic gas and particle
   sampler also showed that near the highway, the aerosol had a larger
   semivolatile fraction than lower volatile fraction, but over a
   relatively short distance downwind of the highway, the aerosol
   transformed to being more low volatile with the change being driven by
   both evaporation of semivolatile and production of lower volatile
   organic aerosol. A new 1-D column Lagrangian atmospheric chemistry model
   was developed to help interpret the measured increase in the OA/CO2
   curve from 34 m to 285 m downwind of highway, where the refers to
   background-corrected concentrations. The model was sensitive to the
   assumptions for semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs). Different
   combinations of SVOC emissions and background mixing ratios were able to
   yield similar model curves and reproduce the observations. Future
   measurements of total gas-phase SVOC in equilibrium with aerosol both
   upwind and downwind of the highway would be helpful to constrain the
   model.}},

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to evaluate the responsiveness of mercury
   intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and dynamic water vapour sorption (DWVS)
   experiments to reflect changes to the pore structure of cement paste due
   to the influence of cementing material type. The DWVS isotherms are used
   to evaluate the pore size distribution and specific surface area. The MW
   test is used to characterize the threshold diameter, and total porosity
   of the specimens. This study examines the influence of four cement paste
   mixture designs, namely 100\% general use (GU) Portland cement, 50\% GU
   + 50\% ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), 100\% Portland
   limestone cement (PLC), and 50\% PLC + 50\% GGBFS. The specimens were
   aged for one year in saturated limewater. The results indicate that DWVS
   is sensitive to changes in microstructure resulting from GGBFS and PLC
   inclusions. The Barrett Joyner Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions
   indicate that the effect of GGBFS and PLC inclusions have a marked
   effect on pores smaller than 4 nm diameter and a slight effect on pores
   between 4 and 10 nm in diameter. Characterization of the paste
   microstructure using both DWVS and MIP techniques provide a description
   of pores ranging from less than 1 nm in diameter to up to 8 mu m. Both
   methods are well suited to detect changes due to moisture-binder and the
   cementing material type (GGBFS and PLC). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the effect of porosity heterogeneity on the bulk
   hydrodynamic properties (permeability and tortuosity) of simulated gas
   diffusion layers (GDLs). The porosity distributions of the heterogeneous
   reconstructed samples are similar to those previously reported in the
   literature for Toray TGP-H 120 (TM), GDLs. We use the lattice Boltzmann
   method to perform pore-level flow simulations in the reconstructed GDL
   samples. Using the results of pore-level simulations, the effect of
   porosity distribution is characterized on the predicted in- and
   cross-plane permeability and tortuosity. It was found that porosity
   heterogeneity causes a higher in-plane permeability and lower in-plane
   tortuosity, while the effect is opposite in the cross-plane direction,
   that is a lower cross-plane permeability and a higher crossplane
   tortuosity.
   We further investigate the effect of adding poly-tetra-fluoro-ethylene
   (PTFE) \& binder material to the reconstructed GDL samples. Three fiber
   volume percentages of 50, 75, and 100\% are considered. Overall,
   increasing the fiber volume percentage reduces the predicted in- and
   cross-plane permeability and tortuosity values. A previously reported
   relationship for permeability of fibrous materials is fitted to the
   predicted permeability values, and the magnitude of the fitting
   parameter is reported as a function of fiber volume percentage. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We have demonstrated that pentafluoro phenoxy boron subphthalocyanine
   (F(5)BsubPc) can function as either an electron donor or an electron
   acceptor layer in a planar heterojunction organic photovolatic (PHJ OPV)
   cell. F(5)BsubPc was incorporated into devices with the configurations
   ITO/MoO3/F(5)BsubPc/C-60/BCP/Al (F(5)BsubPc used as an
   electron-donor/hole-transport layer) and
   ITO/MoO3/Cl-BsubPc/F(5)BsubPc/BCP/Al (F(5)BsubPc used as an
   electron-acceptor/electron-transport layer). Each unoptimized device
   displayed open-circuit photopotentials (V-oc) close to or in excess of 1
   V and respectrable power conversion efficiencies. Ultraviolet
   photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to characterize the band-edge
   offset energies at the donor/acceptor junctions. HOMO and LUMO energy
   level offsets for the F(5)BsubPc/C-60 heterojunction were determined to
   be ca. 0.6 eV and ca. 0.7 eV, respectively. Such offsets are clearly
   large enough to produce rectifying J/V responses, efficient exciton
   dissociation, and photocurrent production at the interface. For the
   Cl-BsubPc/F(5)BsubPc heterojunction, the estimated offset energies were
   found to be ca. 0.1 eV. However, reasonable photovoltaic activity was
   observed, with photocurrent production coming from both BsubPc species
   layers. Incident and absorbed photon power conversion efficiencies (IPCE
   and APCE) showed that photocurrent production qualitatively tracked the
   absorbance spectra of the donor/acceptor heterojunctions, with some
   additional photocurrent activity on the low energy side of the
   absorbance band. We suggest that photocurrent production at higher
   wavelengths may be a result of charge-transfer species at the
   donor/acceptor interface. Cascade photovoltaics were also fabricated to
   expand on the understanding of the role of F(5)BsubPc in such device
   architectures.}},

Abstract = {{A new host material of
   (4-\{1-{[}4-(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl]-cyclohexyl\}phenyl)bis(4-methylp
   henyl)amine (POPCPA) is designed and synthesized by integrating
   electron-donating 4,4'-dimethyldiphenylamine unit and electron-accepting
   diphenylphosphine oxide group into the cyclohexane skeleton. The design
   strategy endows the host material with a high triplet energy of 2.93 eV,
   a shallow HOMO level of -5.24 eV, and a bipolar charge transporting
   feature. In addition, a new electron-transporting (ET) material of
   1,3,5-tri{[}3-(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl]benzene (TP3PO), which
   possesses a high triplet of 2.78 eV, a deep HOMO level of -6.40 eV, and
   a good ET ability, is constructed by the suitable combination of three
   diphenylphosphine oxide groups and the triphenylbenzene skeleton. These
   features render these phosphine-oxide-based functional materials ideal
   for blue phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PhOLEDs). By
   employing these functional materials, a blue device exhibits low driving
   voltages of 2.6, 3.6, and 5.4 V at the luminance of 1, 100, and 1000 cd
   m(-2), respectively, and the highest power efficiency (up to 45.3 lm
   W-1) to date for iridium(III)
   bis(4',6'-difluorophenylpyridinato)-tetrakis(1-pyrazoly)borate
   (FIr6)-based blue PhOLEDs, which is significantly higher than those of
   the FIr6-based PhOLEDs with n-doped electron-transporting layer or p-i-n
   structure. These results suggest that the high-power-efficiency blue
   PhOLEDs can be achieved by elaborate designing of host and
   electron-transporting materials systematically to suit the blue emitter
   and emission zone structure.}},

Abstract = {{Many experimental systems consist of large ensembles of uncoupled or
   weakly interacting elements operating as a single whole; this is
   particularly the case for applications in nano-optics and plasmonics,
   including colloidal solutions, plasmonic or dielectric nanoparticles on
   a substrate, antenna arrays, and others. In such experiments,
   measurements of the optical spectra of ensembles will differ from
   measurements of the independent elements as a result of small variations
   from element to element (also known as polydispersity) even if these
   elements are designed to be identical. In particular, sharp spectral
   features arising from narrow-band resonances will tend to appear broader
   and can even be washed out completely. Here, we explore this effect of
   inhomogeneous broadening as it occurs in colloidal nanopolymers
   comprising self-assembled nanorod chains in solution. Using a technique
   combining finite-difference time-domain simulations and Monte Carlo
   sampling, we predict the inhomogeneously broadened optical spectra of
   these colloidal nanopolymers and observe significant qualitative
   differences compared with the unbroadened spectra. The approach
   combining an electromagnetic simulation technique with Monte Carlo
   sampling is widely applicable for quantifying the effects of
   inhomogeneous broadening in a variety of physical systems, including
   those with many degrees of freedom that are otherwise computationally
   intractable.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its ability to tolerate high channel loss, decoy-state quantum
   key distribution (QKD) has been one of the main focuses within the QKD
   community. Notably, several experimental groups have demonstrated that
   it is secure and feasible under real-world conditions. Crucially,
   however, the security and feasibility claims made by most of these
   experiments were obtained under the assumption that the eavesdropper is
   restricted to particular types of attacks or that the finite-key effects
   are neglected. Unfortunately, such assumptions are not possible to
   guarantee in practice. In this work, we provide concise and tight
   finite-key security bounds for practical decoy-state QKD that are valid

Title = {{Surface shear stress and retention of emerging contaminants during

Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{183-191}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impact of surface shear stress, to represent
   air sparging employed for fouling control, on the retention of organic
   micropollutants during ultrafiltration for drinking water treatment. The
   retention of 16 different pharmaceutically-active and endocrine
   disrupting compounds was examined during ultrafiltration of three
   natural surface waters (two lake, one river) under four different
   surface shear stress regimes: no shear stress, low peak shear stress
   (representative of continuous coarse bubble sparging), sustained peak
   shear stress (representative of intermittent coarse bubble sparging),
   and high peak shear stress (representative of large pulse bubble
   sparging). Results indicate that surface shear stress does impact the
   retention of emerging contaminants; however, it is dependent on water
   matrix and compound properties. The greatest retention of
   micropollutants was observed in waters with a higher concentrations of
   organic matter, and for conditions where no surface shear stress was
   applied (average 32\% retention), and under conditions representative of
   large pulse bubble sparging (average 34\% retention). The observed
   retention under conditions of no shear stress was likely due to a heavy
   fouling layer that altered the membrane selectivity and was able to
   entrap organic micropollutants of larger molecular weight. Under
   conditions that mimicked air sparging, increasing the shear stress
   (quantified as the root mean square applied shear) resulted in increased
   retention of organic micropollutants, particularly those that are
   neutral and hydrophobic in nature. This may be related to solute-solute
   complexes, which are kept in solution when shear stress is applied, or
   related to modification of the fouling layer by the shear stress induced
   onto the membrane surface. The results suggest that there may be value
   added with respect to removal of organic micropollutants, such as
   pharmaceuticals, when employing air sparging as a fouling control
   strategy during ultrafiltration. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Nanofiltration (NF) of seventeen pharmaceutically active (PhAC) and
   endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), representing a wide range of
   physicochemical properties, was investigated using both
   laboratory-prepared (Milli Q (R)) and natural waters. While previous
   studies have probed compound removal by membranes pre-fouled with model
   foulants, and the impact of natural water colloidal materials, this
   study examined the impact of compound interactions with key organic
   matter fraction(s), in the absence of colloidal and suspended particles.
   Lake Ontario water, a Great Lakes' source of drinking water, was
   pretreated using ultrafiltration to remove colloidal particles but
   retain organic matter. Additionally, the concentration of cations in the
   water matrix was varied. Experiments were conducted at a recovery (50\%)
   comparable to a full-scale system. PhAC/EDC rejection from Milli Q (R)
   water increased as a function of molecular weight and molecular volume,
   but significantly decreased with increasing compound hydrophobicity.
   Dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions were found to interact
   preferentially with neutral PhAC/EDCs, causing increased rejection,
   presumably due to enhanced size exclusion of compound-humic substance
   (HS) pseudo-complexes arising from dipole-dipole interactions. Increased
   cation concentration resulted in decreased removal of the neutral
   compounds; presumably due to reduced HS interaction sites. The rejection
   of specific ionic compounds was influenced by both size and charge
   effects of the compound-HS complexes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we provide a unified and self-consistent treatment of a
   functionally graded material (FGM) microbeam with varying thermal
   conductivity subjected to non-uniform or uniform temperature field.
   Specifically, it is our objective to determine the effect of the
   microscopic size of the beam, the electrostatic gap, the temperature
   field and material property on the pull-in voltage of the microbeam
   under different boundary conditions. The non-uniform temperature field
   is obtained by integrating the steady-state heat conduction equation.
   The governing equations account for the microbeam size by introducing an
   internal material length-scale parameter that is based on the modified
   couple stress theory. Furthermore, it takes into account Casimir and van
   der Waals forces, and the associated electrostatic force with the
   first-order fringing field effects. The resulting nonlinear differential
   equations were converted to a coupled system of algebraic equations
   using the differential quadrature method. The outcome of our work shows
   the dramatic effect and dependence of the pull-in voltage of the FGM
   microbeam upon the temperature field, its gradient for a given boundary
   condition. Specifically, both uniform and non-uniform thermal loading
   can actuate the FGM microbeam even without an applied voltage. Our work
   also reveals that the non-uniform temperature field is more effective
   than the uniform temperature field in actuating a FGM cantilever-type
   microbeam. For the clamped-clamped case, care must be taken to account
   for the effective use of thermal loading in the design of microbeams. It
   is also observed that uniform thermal loading will lead to a reduction
   in the pull-in voltage of a FGM microbeam for all the three boundary
   conditions considered.}},

Title = {{Bioaugmentation with Distinct Dehalobacter Strains Achieves Chloroform

Abstract = {{Chloroform (CF) is a widespread groundwater contaminant not susceptible
   to aerobic degradation. Under anoxic conditions, CF can undergo abiotic
   and cometabolic transformation but detoxification is generally not
   achieved. The recent discovery of distinct Dehalobacter strains that
   respire CF to dichloromethane (DCM) and ferment DCM to nonchlorinated
   products promises that bioremediation of CF plumes is feasible. To track
   both strains, 16S rRNA gene-based qPCR assays specific for either
   Dehalobacter strain were designed and validated. A laboratory
   treatability study explored the value of bioaugmentation and
   biostimulation to achieve CF detoxification using anoxic microcosms
   established with aquifer material from a CF-contaminated site.
   Microcosms that received 6\% (v/v) of the CF-to-DCM-dechlorinating
   culture Dhb-CF to achieve an initial Dehalobacter cell titer of 1.6 +/-
   0.9 x 10(4) mL(-1) dechlorinated CF to stoichiometric amounts of DCM.
   Subsequent augmentation with 3\% (v/v) of the DCM-degrading consortium
   RM to an initial Dehalobacter cell abundance of 1.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(2)
   mL(-1) achieved complete DCM degradation in microcosms amended with 10
   mM bicarbonate. Growth of the CF-respiring and the DCM-degrading
   Dehalobacter populations and detoxification were also observed in
   microcosms that received both inocula simultaneously. These findings
   suggest that anaerobic bioremediation (e.g., bioaugmentation) is a
   possible remedy at CF- and DCM-contaminated sites without CT, which
   strongly inhibited CF organohalide respiration and DCM organohalide
   fermentation.}},

Abstract = {{Directed migration of groups of cells is a critical aspect of tissue
   morphogenesis that ensures proper tissue organization and, consequently,
   function. Cells moving in groups, unlike single cells, must coordinate
   their migratory behavior to maintain tissue integrity. During directed
   migration, cells are guided by a combination of mechanical and chemical
   cues presented by neighboring cells and the surrounding extracellular
   matrix. One important class of signals that guide cell migration
   includes topographic cues. Although the contact guidance response of
   individual cells to topographic cues has been extensively characterized,
   little is known about the response of groups of cells to topographic
   cues, the impact of such cues on cell-cell coordination within groups,
   and the transmission of nonautonomous contact guidance information
   between neighboring cells. Here, we explore these phenomena by
   quantifying the migratory response of confluent monolayers of epithelial
   and fibroblast cells to contact guidance cues provided by grooved
   topography. We show that, in both sparse clusters and confluent sheets,
   individual cells are contact-guided by grooves and show more coordinated
   behavior on grooved versus flat substrates. Furthermore, we demonstrate
   both in vitro and in silico that the guidance signal provided by a
   groove can propagate between neighboring cells in a confluent monolayer,
   and that the distance over which signal propagation occurs is not
   significantly influenced by the strength of cell-cell junctions but is
   an emergent property, similar to cellular streaming, triggered by
   mechanical exclusion interactions within the collective system.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigation is intended to compare the abrasion
   resistance of self-consolidating concrete (SCC) with that of
   vibratory-placed concrete (VPC) and to examine the effects of binder
   content and water-to-binder ratio (w/b) on its wear resistance. In
   comparing SCC with VPC, four mixtures with varying binder contents of
   386, 445, 504, and 564 kg/m(3) (650, 750, 850, and 950 pcy) were
   prepared at a uniform water-to-binder ratio of 0.35. To investigate the
   effect of quality (w/b) and quantity (binder content) of paste on
   abrasion resistance of SCC, additional SCC mixtures were also prepared
   with water-to-binder ratios of 0.40 and 0.45. Depth of wear and
   compressive strength were used to compare experimental results. The
   results of this investigation revealed better performance of
   self-consolidating concrete in comparison with vibratory-placed
   concrete. While compressive strength of SCC mixtures was 15-30\% more
   than the companion VPC mixtures, their final abrasion depths were lower
   by 50-70\%. Similar to conventional concrete, increasing paste quantity
   and quality of the trial SCC increased abrasion resistance and decreased
   rate of abrasion. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Inferring clonal evolution of tumors from single nucleotide somatic
   mutations}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: High-throughput sequencing allows the detection and
   quantification of frequencies of somatic single nucleotide variants
   (SNV) in heterogeneous tumor cell populations. In some cases, the
   evolutionary history and population frequency of the subclonal lineages
   of tumor cells present in the sample can be reconstructed from these SNV
   frequency measurements. But automated methods to do this reconstruction
   are not available and the conditions under which reconstruction is
   possible have not been described.
   Results: We describe the conditions under which the evolutionary history
   can be uniquely reconstructed from SNV frequencies from single or
   multiple samples from the tumor population and we introduce a new
   statistical model, PhyloSub, that infers the phylogeny and genotype of
   the major subclonal lineages represented in the population of cancer
   cells. It uses a Bayesian nonparametric prior over trees that groups
   SNVs into major subclonal lineages and automatically estimates the
   number of lineages and their ancestry. We sample from the joint
   posterior distribution over trees to identify evolutionary histories and
   cell population frequencies that have the highest probability of
   generating the observed SNV frequency data. When multiple phylogenies
   are consistent with a given set of SNV frequencies, PhyloSub represents
   the uncertainty in the tumor phylogeny using a ``partial order plot{''}.
   Experiments on a simulated dataset and two real datasets comprising
   tumor samples from acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic
   leukemia patients demonstrate that PhyloSub can infer both linear (or
   chain) and branching lineages and its inferences are in good agreement
   with ground truth, where it is available.
   Conclusions: PhyloSub can be applied to frequencies of any ``binary{''}
   somatic mutation, including SNVs as well as small insertions and
   deletions. The PhyloSub and partial order plot software is available
   from https://github.com/morrislab/phylosub/.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Substantial organ motion and tumor shrinkage occur during
   radiotherapy for cervix cancer. IMRT planning studies have shown
   that-the quality of radiation delivery is influenced by these anatomical
   changes, therefore the adaptation of treatment plans may be warranted.
   Image guidance with off-line replanning, i.e. hybrid-adaptation, is
   recognized as one of the most practical adaptation strategies. In this
   study, we investigated the effects of soft tissue image guidance using
   on-line MR while varying the frequency of off-line replanning on the
   adaptation of cervix IMRT.
   Materials and method: 33 cervical cancer patients underwent planning and
   weekly pelvic MRI scans during radiotherapy. 5 patients of 33 were
   identified in a previous retrospective adaptive planning study, in which
   the coverage of gross tumor volume/clinical target volume (GTV/CTV) was
   not acceptable given single off-line IMRT replan using a 3 mm PTV margin
   with bone matching. These 5 patients and a randomly selected 10 patients
   from the remaining 28 patients, a total of 15 patients of 33, were
   considered in this study. Two matching methods for image guidance (bone
   to bone and soft tissue to dose matrix) and three frequencies of
   off-line replanning (none, single, and weekly) were simulated and
   compared with respect to target coverage (cervix, GTV, lower uterus,
   parametrium, upper vagina, tumor related CTV and elective lymph node
   CTV) and OAR sparing (bladder, bowel, rectum, and sigmoid). Cost (total
   process time) and benefit (target coverage) were analyzed for
   comparison.
   Results: Hybrid adaptation (image guidance with off-line replanning)
   significantly enhanced target coverage for both 5 difficult and 10
   standard cases. Concerning image guidance, bone matching was short of
   delivering enough doses for 5 difficult cases even with a weekly
   off-line replan. Soft tissue image guidance proved successful for all
   cases except one when single or more frequent replans were utilized in
   the difficult cases. Cost and benefit analysis preferred (soft tissue)
   image guidance over (frequent) off-line replanning.
   Conclusions: On-line MRI based image guidance (with combination of dose
   distribution) is a crucial element for a successful hybrid adaptive
   radiotherapy. Frequent off-line replanning adjuvantly enhances
   adaptation quality. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Air sparging and coagulation/flocculation were compared as
   fouling-control strategies during ultrafiltration (UF) of surface
   waters. Fouling was assessed following coagulation {[}0.5 and 15 mg/L
   alum as Al-2(SO4)(3)center dot 14H(2)O] and surface shear stress
   representative of different air-sparging conditions: continuous coarse
   bubble, intermittent coarse bubble, and large pulse bubble. Results
   indicated that 0.5 mg/L of alum reduced membrane fouling, especially for
   waters with higher concentrations of organic matter (> 4 mg/L dissolved
   organic carbon {[}DOC]). A 15-mg/L alum dose did not significantly
   improve membrane performance relative to the low dose. Air-sparging
   reduced fouling, but the benefits were not additive in combination with
   coagulation. Potential cost savings were calculated based on longer
   permeation times made possible by reduced fouling, and the value
   associated with water produced relative to energy costs (air-sparging)
   and chemical costs (coagulant). For the waters investigated, 0.5 mg/L of
   alum or the application of large-pulse bubble air-sparging were shown to
   be optimal for membrane fouling control.}},

Abstract = {{Biomimetic design applies biological analogies to solve design problems
   and has been known to produce innovative solutions. However, when
   designers are asked to perform biomimetic design, they often have
   difficulty recognizing analogies between design problems and biological
   phenomena. Therefore, this research aims to investigate designer
   behaviors that either hinder or promote the use of analogies in
   biomimetic design. A verbal protocol study was conducted on 30
   engineering students working in small teams while participating in
   biomimetic design sessions. A coding scheme was developed to analyze
   cognitive processes involved in biomimetic design. We observed that
   teams were less likely to apply overall biological analogies if they
   tended to recall existing solutions that could be easily associated with
   specific superficial or functional characteristics of biological
   phenomena. We also found that the tendency to evaluate ideas, which
   reflects critical thinking, correlates with the likelihood of
   identifying overall biological analogies. Insights from this paper may
   contribute toward developing generalized methods to facilitate
   biomimetic design.}},

Abstract = {{The challenge of depth-resolved, nonionizing (hybrid-optical) detection
   of mineral loss in bones is addressed using truncated-correlation
   photothermal coherence tomography (TC-PCT). This approach has importance
   not only in ground-based clinical procedures, but also in microgravity
   space applications. Analogous to x-ray morphometric parameters, two-and
   three-dimensional markers have been defined and estimated for chemically
   demineralized goat rib bones. Cortical and trabecular regions have been
   analyzed independently and together using the computational slicing
   advantage of TC-PCT, and the results have been verified using micro-CT
   imaging (the gold standard). For low-demineralization levels, both
   modalities follow the same trend. However, for very high mineral loss
   that is unlikely to occur naturally, anomalies exist in both methods.
   Demineralization tracking has been carried out to a depth of similar to
   3 mm below the irradiated surface. Compared with micro-CT imaging,
   TC-PCT offers an improved dynamic range, which is a beneficial feature
   while analyzing highly demineralized bones. Also, TC-PCT parameters are
   found to be more sensitive to trabecular and combined
   cortical-trabecular demineralization compared with x-ray parameters.
   Axial and lateral resolutions in bone imaging for the current
   instrumental configuration are similar to 25 and 100 mu m, respectively.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has recently gained
   attention as a modality for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which may
   serve as an alternative access pathway for individuals with severe motor
   impairments. For NIRS-BCIs to be used as a real communication pathway,
   reliable online operation must be achieved. Yet, only a limited number
   of studies have been conducted online to date. These few studies were
   carried out under a synchronous paradigm and did not accommodate an
   unconstrained resting state, precluding their practical clinical
   implication. Furthermore, the potentially discriminative power of
   spatiotemporal characteristics of activation has yet to be considered in
   an online NIRS system. Approach. In this study, we developed and
   evaluated an online system-paced NIRS-BCI which was driven by a mental
   arithmetic activation task and accommodated an unconstrained rest state.
   With a dual-wavelength, frequency domain near-infrared spectrometer,
   measurements were acquired over nine sites of the prefrontal cortex,
   while ten able-bodied participants selected letters from an on-screen
   scanning keyboard via intentionally controlled brain activity (using
   mental arithmetic). Participants were provided dynamic NIR topograms as
   continuous visual feedback of their brain activity as well as binary
   feedback of the BCI's decision (i.e. if the letter was selected or not).
   To classify the hemodynamic activity, temporal features extracted from
   the NIRS signals and spatiotemporal features extracted from the dynamic
   NIR topograms were used in a majority vote combination of multiple
   linear classifiers. Main results. An overall online classification
   accuracy of 77.4 +/- 10.5\% was achieved across all participants. The
   binary feedback was found to be very useful during BCI use, while not
   all participants found value in the continuous feedback provided.
   Significance. These results demonstrate that mental arithmetic is a
   potent mental task for driving an online system-paced NIRS-BCI. BCI
   feedback that reflects the classifier's decision has the potential to
   improve user performance. The proposed system can provide a framework
   for future online NIRS-BCI development and testing.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel structures are finding use in
   fundamental studies of self-assembly, rheology, and 3D cell culture.
   Most techniques for 3D hydrogel formation are `single pot', in which
   gels are not addressable after formation. For many applications, it
   would be useful to be able to form arrays of gels bearing mixtures of
   constituents and/or formed from composites of different gel materials.
   Here, in response to this challenge, we introduce a digital microfluidic
   method for `on-demand' formation of arrays of microgels bearing
   arbitrary contents and shapes. On formation of the gels, each microgel
   is individually addressable for reagent delivery and analysis. We
   demonstrate the utility of the method for 3D cell culture and
   higher-order tissue formation by implementing the first sub-microlitre
   recapitulation of 3D kidney epithelialization. We anticipate this
   platform will enable new research that can exploit the flexible nature
   of this technique for forming and addressing arrays of hydrogels with
   unique geometries and contents.}},

Abstract = {{The segmentation motor activity of the gut that facilitates absorption
   of nutrients was first described in the late 19th century, but the
   fundamental mechanisms underlying it remain poorly understood. The
   dominant theory suggests alternate excitation and inhibition from the
   enteric nervous system. Here we demonstrate that typical segmentation
   can occur after total nerve blockade. The segmentation motor pattern
   emerges when the amplitude of the dominant pacemaker, the slow wave
   generated by interstitial cells of Cajal associated with the myenteric
   plexus (ICC-MP), is modulated by the phase of induced lower frequency
   rhythmic transient depolarizations, generated by ICC associated with the
   deep muscular plexus (ICC-DMP), resulting in a waxing and waning of the
   amplitude of the slow wave and a rhythmic checkered pattern of
   segmentation motor activity. Phase-amplitude modulation of the slow
   waves points to an underlying system of coupled nonlinear oscillators
   originating in the networks of ICC.}},

Abstract = {{Electromechanical coupling is a topic of current interest in
   nanostructures, such as metallic and semiconducting nanowires, for a
   variety of electronic and energy applications. As a result, the
   determination of structure-property relations that dictate the
   electromechanical coupling requires the development of experimental
   tools to perform accurate metrology. Here, a novel
   micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) that allows integrated
   four-point, uniaxial, electromechanical measurements of freestanding
   nanostructures in-situ electron microscopy, is reported. Coupled
   mechanical and electrical measurements are carried out for penta-twinned
   silver nanowires, their resistance is identified as a function of
   strain, and it is shown that resistance variations are the result of
   nanowire dimensional changes. Furthermore, in situ SEM piezoresistive
   measurements on n-type, {[}111]-oriented silicon nanowires up to
   unprecedented levels of approximate to 7\% strain are demonstrated. The
   piezoresistance coefficients are found to be similar to bulk values. For
   both metallic and semiconducting nanowires, variations of the contact
   resistance as strain is applied are observed. These variations must be
   considered in the interpretation of future two-point electromechanical
   measurements.}},

Title = {{Carotid Bifurcation Geometry Is an Independent Predictor of Early Wall
   Thickening at the Carotid Bulb}},
Journal = {{STROKE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{473-478}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background and Purpose Lumen geometry has long been suspected as a risk
   factor for atherosclerosis by virtue of its influence on blood flow
   disturbances. Confirmation of this geometric risk hypothesis has,
   however, proved challenging owing to possible effects of wall thickening
   on geometry and unproven links between candidate geometric variables and
   disturbed flow. The purpose of this study was to overcome these
   challenges.
   Methods The study relied on imaging and risk factor data from
   progressively refined subsets of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
   (ARIC) Carotid MRI study. Group 1 (n=467) included only nonstenotic
   cases having sufficient quality angiography for 3-dimensional analysis.
   Group 2 (n=346) excluded cases from group 1 having common and internal
   carotid artery wall thickness above previously identified thresholds for
   inward remodeling. Group 3 (n=294) excluded cases from group 2 having
   lumen irregularities and thus was least likely to include lumen
   geometries influenced by wall thickening.
   Results Multiple linear regressions showed that for group 3, bifurcation
   flare and proximal curvature were independent predictors of internal
   carotid artery wall thickness, consistent with their previously
   demonstrated roles in predicting disturbed flow. For the broadest group
   1, flare was an independent predictor of internal carotid artery wall
   thickness but with a sign change in regression coefficient reflecting
   effects of wall thickening on lumen geometry.
   Conclusions Carotid bifurcation geometry is an independent, albeit weak,
   predictor of its early wall thickening, but only when assumptions about
   geometric factors, and the influence of disease on them, are confronted.
   This highlights pitfalls of previous attempts to confirm geometric risk
   of atherosclerosis.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We re-examine the inviscid instability of two-phase parallel flows with
   piecewise linear velocity profiles. Although such configuration has been
   theoretically investigated, we employ the concept ofwaves resonance to
   physically interpret the instability mechanism as well as the essential
   role of density discontinuity in the flow. Upon performing linear
   stability analysis, we demonstrate the existence of neutrally stable
   ``density{''} and ``density-vorticity{''} waves which are emerged due to
   the density jump in the flow, in addition to the well-known vorticity
   waves. Such waves are capable of resonating with each other to form
   unstable modes in the flow. Although unstable modes in this study are
   classified as the ``shear instability{''} type, we demonstrate that they
   are not necessarily of the Rayleigh type. The results also show that the
   density can have both stabilizing and destabilizing effects on the flow
   stability. We verify that the difference in the resonating pair of
   neutral waves leads to such distinct behavior of the density variation.

Abstract = {{The potential-pH diagrams for lithium-titanium-water system at
   temperatures of 333.15, 363.15, 393.15 and 453.15 K and ion activities
   of 0.01, 0.1 and 1 of the dissolved species were constructed to predict
   the predominant areas of lithium-titanium composite oxides in the
   Li-Ti-H2O system. Empirical functions were applied to estimate the
   thermodynamic data, which are unavailable in the literature. The
   presented Eh-pH diagrams show that temperature and ion activity have
   significant effects upon the stable regions of various species
   considered in Li-Ti-H2O system. With an increase in temperature, or ion
   activity, the dominant regions of Li2TiO3(hc), LiaTi(5)O(12)(hc) and
   Li4TiO4(hc) shift towards lower pH zones. Also, the predominant areas of
   Li4Ti5O12(hc) and Li2TiO3(hc) shrink, while that of Li4TiO4(ch)
   enlarges. This demonstrates that the production of Li4Ti5O12 and Li2TiO3
   is thermodynamically feasible by a wet process. Experiments were
   subsequently performed in light of the constructed potential-pH
   diagrams. The results indicated that the potential-pH diagrams are
   consistent with experiment. Therefore, the preparation of Li4Ti5O12 and
   Li2TiO3 in aqueous solution is feasible and the process can be
   controlled in practice. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a robust numerical technique to verify the causality of
   sampled scattering parameters given on a finite bandwidth. The method is
   based on a filtered Fourier transform and includes a rigorous estimation
   of the errors caused by missing out-of-band samples. Compared to
   existing techniques, the method is simpler to implement and provides a
   useful insight on the time-domain characteristics of the violation.
   Through an applicative example, we shows its usefulness to improve the
   accuracy of macro-modeling techniques used to convert sampled scattering
   parameters into transient simulation models.}},

Title = {{Locating End-Effector Tips in Robotic Micromanipulation}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{125-130}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In robotic micromanipulation, end-effector tips must be first located
   under microscopy imaging before manipulation is performed. The tip of
   micromanipulation tools is typically a few micrometers in size and
   highly delicate. In all existing micromanipulation systems, the process
   of locating the end-effector tip is conducted by a skilled operator, and
   the automation of this task has not been attempted. This paper presents
   a technique to automatically locate end-effector tips. The technique
   consists of programmed sweeping patterns, motion history image
   end-effector detection, active contour to estimate end-effector
   positions, autofocusing and quad-tree search to locate an end-effector
   tip, and, finally, visual servoing to position the tip to the center of
   the field of view. Two types of micromanipulation tools (micropipette
   that represents single-ended tools and microgripper that represents
   multiended tools) were used in experiments for testing. Quantitative
   results are reported in the speed and success rate of the autolocating
   technique, based on over 500 trials. Furthermore, the effect of factors
   such as imaging mode and image processing parameter selections was also
   quantitatively discussed. Guidelines are provided for the implementation
   of the technique in order to achieve high efficiency and success rates.}},

Title = {{A stochastic model for tumor geometry evolution during radiation therapy
   in cervical cancer}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop mathematical models to predict the evolution of
   tumor geometry in cervical cancer undergoing radiation therapy.
   Methods: The authors develop two mathematical models to estimate tumor
   geometry change: a Markov model and an isomorphic shrinkage model. The
   Markov model describes tumor evolution by investigating the change in
   state (either tumor or nontumor) of voxels on the tumor surface. It
   assumes that the evolution follows a Markov process. Transition
   probabilities are obtained using maximum likelihood estimation and
   depend on the states of neighboring voxels. The isomorphic shrinkage
   model describes tumor shrinkage or growth in terms of layers of voxels
   on the tumor surface, instead of modeling individual voxels. The two
   proposed models were applied to data from 29 cervical cancer patients
   treated at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and then compared to a
   constant volume approach. Model performance was measured using
   sensitivity and specificity.
   Results: The Markov model outperformed both the isomorphic shrinkage and
   constant volume models in terms of the trade-off between sensitivity
   (target coverage) and specificity (normal tissue sparing). Generally,
   the Markov model achieved a few percentage points in improvement in
   either sensitivity or specificity compared to the other models. The
   isomorphic shrinkage model was comparable to the Markov approach under
   certain parameter settings. Convex tumor shapes were easier to predict.
   Conclusions: By modeling tumor geometry change at the voxel level using
   a probabilistic model, improvements in target coverage and normal tissue
   sparing are possible. Our Markov model is flexible and has tunable
   parameters to adjust model performance to meet a range of criteria. Such
   a model may support the development of an adaptive paradigm for
   radiation therapy of cervical cancer. (C) 2014 American Association of

Abstract = {{Crystallization is a critical phenomenon that governs the morphology and
   the properties of a semi-crystalline polymer. In this study, a
   visualization chamber with two flush-mounted sapphire windows was
   designed and installed before the die exit to investigate polypropylene
   crystallization during a tandem extrusion process. Through in-situ
   visualization of crystallization, we verified for the first time that
   crystallization can be induced in continuous extrusion by controlling
   the temperature of the second extruder after complete melting of the
   material in the first extruder. It was visualized that the crystals
   formed in the melt and they moved with the flow during the process. (C)

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{204}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Drop shape techniques are used extensively for surface tension
   measurement. It is well-documented that, as the drop/bubble shape
   becomes close to spherical, the performance of all drop shape techniques
   deteriorates. There have been efforts quantifying the range of
   applicability of drop techniques by studying the deviation of Laplacian
   drops from the spherical shape. A shape parameter was introduced in the
   literature and was modified several times to accommodate different drop
   constellations. However, new problems arise every time a new
   configuration is considered. Therefore, there is a need for a universal
   shape parameter applicable to pendant drops, sessile drops, liquid
   bridges as well as captive bubbles. In this work, the use of the total
   Gaussian curvature in a unified approach for the shape parameter is
   introduced for that purpose. The total Gaussian curvature is a
   dimensionless quantity that is commonly used in differential geometry
   and surface thermodynamics, and can be easily calculated for different
   Laplacian drop shapes. The new definition of the shape parameter using
   the total Gaussian curvature is applied here to both pendant and
   constrained sessile drops as an illustration. The analysis showed that
   the new definition is superior and reflects experimental results better
   than previous definitions, especially at extreme values of the Bond
   number. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   step-down converter, the second is a step-up converter, and the third is
   an inverting step-up/downconverter. For each converter, the structure is
   presented, its operation principle is explained, and the design
   equations are derived. A comparative analysis between the converters is
   carried out to highlight the merits and limitations of each topology.}},

Abstract = {{The assembly of nanomaterials using DNA can produce complex
   nanostructures, but the biological applications of these structures
   remain unexplored. Here, we describe the use of DNA to control the
   biological delivery and elimination of inorganic nanoparticles by
   organizing them into colloidal superstructures. The individual
   nanoparticles serve as building blocks, whose size, surface chemistry
   and assembly architecture dictate the overall superstructure design.
   These superstructures interact with cells and tissues as a function of
   their design, but subsequently degrade into building blocks that can
   escape biological sequestration. We demonstrate that this strategy
   reduces nanoparticle retention by macrophages and improves their in vivo
   tumour accumulation and whole-body elimination. Superstructures can be
   further functionalized to carry and protect imaging or therapeutic
   agents against enzymatic degradation. These results suggest a different
   strategy to engineer nanostructure interactions with biological systems
   and highlight new directions in the design of biodegradable and
   multifunctional nanomedicine.}},

Abstract = {{Electroencephalogram signals used to control brain-computer interfaces
   (BCIs) are nonstationary, a problem that makes classification of mental
   tasks difficult in real-time. Event-related potentials associated with
   BCI errors have the potential to be used as online labels for adaptation
   of BCI classifiers; however, detection of event-related potentials is
   imperfect, which makes this a partially supervised classification
   problem. In this study, two linear binary classifiers are adapted using
   uncertain labels on artificial data sets representing various scenarios
   of concept drift as well as on a real motor imagery BCI data set. Both
   perfectly and imperfectly simulated labels are incorporated into the
   classifiers which are adapted in the following two ways: (i) only after
   trials where BCI mistakes were detected and (ii) after every trial
   regardless of whether or not an error was detected. We find that all
   data sets benefit from adaptation using imperfect labels and that
   adapting after all trials results in better performance than adapting
   only after detected errors, especially when the labels are imperfect and
   the classes are inseparable. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the use of a linear periodic controller (LPC)
   for the control of linear time-invariant (LTI) plants in the

   mode (DFM), it is well known that no decentralized LTI controller can
   stabilize it, let alone provide good performance. Here we show that, if
   the plant is centrally controllable and observable and the graph
   associated with the plant is strongly connected, then even if the plant
   has an unstable DFM, we can still design a decentralized LPC to provide
   LQR performance as close to the centralized optimal performance as
   desired; the proposed controller in each channel consists of a sampler,
   a zero-order-hold, and a discrete-time linear periodic compensator,
   which makes it easy to implement.}},

Abstract = {{Porous calcium polyphosphate (CPP) structures proposed as
   bone-substitute implants and made by sintering CPP powders to form
   bending test samples of approximately 35 vol \% porosity were machined
   from preformed blocks made either by additive manufacturing (AM) or
   conventional gravity sintering (CS) methods and the structure and
   mechanical characteristics of samples so made were compared. AM-made
   samples displayed higher bending strengths (approximate to 1.2-1.4 times
   greater than CS-made samples), whereas elastic constant (i.e., effective
   elastic modulus of the porous structures) that is determined by material
   elastic modulus and structural geometry of the samples was approximate
   to 1.9-2.3 times greater for AM-made samples. X-ray diffraction analysis
   showed that samples made by either method displayed the same crystal
   structure forming -CPP after sinter annealing. The material elastic
   modulus, E, determined using nanoindentation tests also showed the same
   value for both sample types (i.e., E approximate to 64 GPa). Examination
   of the porous structures indicated that significantly larger sinter
   necks resulted in the AM-made samples which presumably resulted in the
   higher mechanical properties. The development of mechanical properties
   was attributed to the different sinter anneal procedures required to
   make 35 vol \% porous samples by the two methods. A primary objective of
   the present study, in addition to reporting on bending strength and
   sample stiffness (elastic constant) characteristics, was to determine
   why the two processes resulted in the observed mechanical property
   differences for samples of equivalent volume percentage of porosity. An
   understanding of the fundamental reason(s) for the observed effect is
   considered important for developing improved processes for preparation
   of porous CPP implants as bone substitutes for use in high load-bearing
   skeletal sites. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part

Abstract = {{A combination of solvent refining and flux treatment was employed to
   remove boron and phosphorus from crude silicon to acceptable levels for
   solar applications. Metallurgical grade silicon (MG-Si) was alloyed with
   pure copper, and the alloy was subjected to refining by liquid
   CaO-SiO2-Na2O-Al2O3 slags at 1773 K (1500 A degrees C). The distribution
   of B and P between the slags and the alloy was examined under a range of
   slag compositions, varying in CaO:SiO2 and SiO2:Al2O3 ratios and the
   amount of Na2O. The results showed that both basicity and oxygen
   potential have a strong influence on the distributions of B and P. With
   silica affecting both parameters in these slags, a critical could be
   identified that yields the highest impurity pick-up. The addition of
   Na2O to the slag system was found to increase the distributions of boron
   and phosphorus. A thermodynamic evaluation of the system showed that
   alloying copper with MG-Si leads to substantial increase of boron
   distribution coefficient. The highest boron and phosphorus distribution
   coefficients are 47 and 1.1, respectively. Using these optimum slags to
   reduce boron and phosphorus in MG-Si to solar grade level, a slag mass
   about 0.3 times and 17 times mass of alloy would be required,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{As the first clinically approved gadolinium-based blood-pool MRI
   contrast agent, gadofosveset was designed to bind to human serum albumin
   (HSA) reversibly, extending the circulation time in the bloodstream.
   This valuable pharmacokinetic property required for vasculature imaging,
   however, raises the risk of release and accumulation of gadolinium in
   vivo. The binding of gadofosveset to HSA significantly increases the
   relaxivity at low field, which decreases drastically when the magnetic
   field increases, limiting the applications of gadofosveset at fields of
   3 T and higher. To address those challenges, we evaluated a novel
   dimeric manganese(III) porphyrin (MnP2) in vitro and in vivo as a
   potential gadolinium-free blood-pool agent. Through multiple
   spectroscopic studies, we demonstrated that MnP2 binds to HSA tightly.
   MnP2 exhibits a moderate relaxivity decrease on HSA binding.
   Nevertheless, owing to the unique field-dependent relaxation behaviors
   and the dimeric construct (two Mn-III ions per complex), MnP2-HSA has a
   molar relaxivity twice that of the gadofosveset-HSA complex at 3 T.
   Through intravenous injection in rats, MnP2 exhibits long retention and
   significant contrast enhancement in the vascular compartment, as tested
   in a 3-T high-field clinical MRI scanner. Taken together, these data
   demonstrate that MnP2 represents a new class of gadolinium-free
   blood-pool agents suitable for both regular and high-field applications.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the load and displacement ratios on the mixed-mode fatigue
   threshold and fatigue crack growth rate of a toughened epoxy adhesive
   was examined experimentally. The fatigue crack growth rates were
   presented as functions of various forms of the strain energy release
   rate, G. Calculating G using the magnitude of the load range, Gap, is
   shown to reflect the range of crack-tip stresses during a loading cycle.
   This was found to eliminate the effect of load and displacement ratio on
   the fatigue threshold, G(th), in the low crack growth rate region, da/dN
   < 5 x 10(-5) mm/cycle, where adhesive plasticity was relatively small.
   In contrast, fatigue crack growth at higher da/dN, where the crack-tip
   plastic zone is larger, can be better characterized using the range of G
   in a loading cycle; i.e. Delta G = G(max) - G(min). (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Patients undergoing interfacility transfers are at potentially greater
   risk of adverse or critical events than those in hospital, and efficient
   transfers play a significant role in reducing mortality and morbidity.
   Medical dispatchers rely on accurate estimations of transfer time in
   determining the most appropriate method of transportation, often either
   a helicopter and/or land ambulance, in situations that are characterized
   by high time pressure and uncertainty. In this paper, we propose the
   design of a datadriven decision support tool to improve dispatcher
   transportmode decision making. We studied the dispatch process of the
   air and land medical transport system in Ontario, Canada through onsite
   observations and developed a tool which generates transfer time
   estimates based on historical data. We found that dispatchers have large
   estimation errors, and are biased toward higher degrees of
   underestimation for air transfers compared with land transfers. In
   contrast, the proposed tool produced estimates that had significantly
   less error than dispatcher estimates. The estimation error for the tool
   was on the average 21 min less: a practically significant difference in
   urgent patient care. Through onsite observations and the relevant
   literature, we also identified factors that may influence the
   collaboration between the dispatcher and the tool. This research is a
   first attempt to study how decisions are made for interfacility medical
   transfers and for evaluating the accuracy of human operator estimates of
   these transfer times. It is also the first to demonstrate a tool's
   utility in comparison to existing procedures for estimating transfer
   times.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of a bipolar-cooled radiofrequency device for ablation of
   bone metastases: preclinical assessment in porcine vertebrae}},
Journal = {{SPINE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{361-370}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Cancer spread to the spine affects bone stability
   and can lead to pathologic fracture and neurologic impairment.
   Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) recently has gained popularity in treating
   skeletal tumors. Conventional RFA devices use a monopolar design, which
   limits the ability to comprehensively treat large tumors in bony tissues
   and may pose risks to adjacent critical normal neurologic tissues when
   applied to vertebrae. New bipolar-cooled radio-frequency (BCRF) may
   generate larger controlled lesions without the same degree of risk to
   adjacent structures.
   PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility,
   efficacy, and safety of RFA with the use of a new bone-specific, BCRF
   probe in a porcine vertebral model and to evaluate the ability of
   magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to represent histologic outcomes of RFA
   treatment.
   STUDY DESIGN: Basic science: preclinical in vivo study.
   METHODS: RFA was evaluated in three noncontiguous lumbar vertebrae in
   six Yorkshire pigs (25-30 kg). Via a transpedicular approach for probe
   placement, two vertebrae received BCRF treatment and one vertebrae
   served as a sham control. MR imaging and neurological assessments were
   conducted pre-and posttreatment as well as immediately before animal
   sacrifice (n=3 at day 0, n53 at day 14). MR ablation zones were compared
   with hematoxylin and eosin-stained histological sections.
   RESULTS: With BCRF, large reproducible zones of ablation were achieved,
   confined within the vertebrae, without damage to adjacent tissues or the
   spinal cord. All animals demonstrated normal consistent neurologic
   behavior pre-and posttreatment. External tissue temperatures around
   targeted vertebrae were not increased. MR imaging after 14 days was more
   effective in demonstrating ablation effects than images on day 0, with
   radiologic findings most apparent on T2-weighted sequences. Histologic
   analysis of samples corresponded well to the zones of ablation observed
   on MR images (R50.9, p <. 01).
   CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated feasibility, safety, and
   effectiveness of BCRF ablation of vertebral bone. This motivates ongoing
   preclinical evaluation in diseased models to further explore the
   potential for its use in clinical treatment of metastatic vertebrae. (C)

Abstract = {{The need for an effective clustering algorithm for Vehicular Ad Hoc
   Networks (VANETs) is motivated by the recent research in cluster-based
   MAC and routing schemes. VANETs are highly dynamic and have harsh
   channel conditions, thus a suitable clustering algorithm must be robust
   to channel error and must consider node mobility during cluster
   formation. This work presents a novel, mobility-based clustering scheme
   for Vehicular Ad hoc Networks, which forms clusters using the Affinity
   Propagation algorithm in a distributed manner. This proposed algorithm
   considers node mobility during cluster formation and produces clusters
   with high stability. Cluster performance was measured in terms of
   average clusterhead duration, average cluster member duration, average
   rate of clusterhead change, and average number of clusters. The proposed
   algorithm is also robust to channel error and exhibits reasonable
   overhead. Simulation results confirm the superior performance, when
   compared to other mobility-based clustering techniques. (C) 2013

Title = {{An Improved Mechanical Testing Method to Assess Bone-implant Anchorage}},
Journal = {{Jove-Journal of Visualized Experiments}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{84}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Recent advances in material science have led to a substantial increase
   in the topographical complexity of implant surfaces, both on a microand
   a nano-scale. As such, traditional methods of describing implant
   surfaces -namely numerical determinants of surface roughness -are
   inadequate for predicting in vivo performance. Biomechanical testing
   provides an accurate and comparative platform to analyze the performance
   of biomaterial surfaces. An improved mechanical testing method to test
   the anchorage of bone to candidate implant surfaces is presented. The
   method is applicable to both early and later stages of healing and can
   be employed for any range of chemically or mechanically modified
   surfaces -but not smooth surfaces. Custom rectangular implants are
   placed bilaterally in the distal femora of male Wistar rats and

Abstract = {{In this work, a hybrid finite element formulation is presented to
   predict the flutter boundaries of circular cylindrical shells made of
   functionally graded (FG) materials. The development is based on a
   combination of linear Sanders thin shell theory and the classic finite
   element method. Material properties are temperature dependent and graded
   in the shell thickness direction according to a simple power law
   distribution in terms of volume fractions of constituents. The
   temperature field is assumed to be uniform over the shell surface and
   along the shell thickness. First-order piston theory is applied to
   account for supersonic aerodynamic pressure. The effects of temperature
   rise and shell internal pressure on the flutter boundaries of a FG
   circular cylindrical shell for different values of power law index are
   investigated. The present study shows efficient and reliable results
   that can be applied to aeroelastic design and analysis of shells of
   revolution in aerospace vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we expand on our understanding of the thrombogenicity of
   coatings prepared with three different recombinant elastin-like
   polypeptides (ELPs). The bulk platelet response of the ELP coatings was
   characterized following whole blood contact under physiological shear
   flow (300 s(-1)) using flow cytometry. Prolonged exposure to shear flow
   (1-h) indicated that materials coated with the longer ELP coatings (ELP2
   and ELP4) had less bulk platelet activation and microparticle formation
   than materials coated with the shorter ELP1. Quartz crystal microbalance
   with dissipation (QCM-D) was used to monitor the binding of the platelet
   membrane receptor GPIIb/IIIa to ELP-adsorbed fibrinogen (Fg) surfaces.
   Compared to the shorter ELPs, a lower amount of Fg adsorbed to the ELP4
   coated material and ELP4 appeared to form a softer, more structurally
   flexible coating layer. When Fg was adsorbed to the ELP coated surface
   it demonstrated an altered binding for GPIIb/IIIa that was inhibited in
   the presence of an AGDV-containing peptide but not an RGD-containing
   peptide. Conversely, on the shorter ELP coatings, binding of GPIIb/IIIa
   to an adsorbed Fg layer was partially inhibited in the presence of an
   RGD-containing peptide. These results indicate that both the quantity
   and conformational state of Fg varies when adsorbed to surfaces coated
   with ELPs of varying sequence length, which may be mediating their
   platelet response. Collectively, the findings reinforce the
   applicability of the ELPs as potential thromboresistant coatings,
   especially with the use of the longer polypeptideELP4. (c) 2013 Wiley

   effects of solution composition, plasma gas composition, and stand-off

   were evaluated. It was found that the addition of citric acid to the
   aqueous solution delayed re-solidification of NiO particles, improving
   the deposition efficiency and coating adhesion. The composition of the
   deposited coatings was found to vary with torch power. Increasing torch
   power led to coatings with decreasing Ni content, as a result of Ni
   vaporizing in-flight at stand-off distances less than 60 mm from the
   torch nozzle exit. (C) 2013 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Reconstructing 3-D maps of the local viscoelastic properties using a
   finite-amplitude modulated radiation force}},
Journal = {{ULTRASONICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{563-575}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A modulated acoustic radiation force, produced by two confocal
   tone-burst ultrasound beams of slightly different frequencies (i.e. 2.0
   MHz +/- Delta f/2, where Delta f is the difference frequency), can be
   used to remotely generate modulated low-frequency (Delta f <= 500 Hz)
   shear waves in attenuating media. By appropriately selecting the
   duration of the two beams, the energy of the generated shear waves can
   be concentrated around the difference frequency (i. e., Delta f +/-
   Delta f/2). In this manner, neither their amplitude nor their phase
   information is distorted by frequency-dependent effects, thereby,
   enabling a more accurate reconstruction of the viscoelastic properties.
   Assuming a Voigt viscoelastic model, this paper describes the use of a
   finite-element-method model to simulate three-dimensional (3-D)
   shear-wave propagation in viscoelastic media containing a spherical
   inclusion. Nonlinear propagation is assumed for the two ultrasound
   beams, so that higher harmonics are developed in the force and shear
   spectrum. Finally, an inverse reconstruction algorithm is used to
   extract 3-D maps of the local shear modulus and viscosity from the
   simulated shear-displacement fields based on the fundamental and
   second-harmonic component. The quality of the reconstructed maps is
   evaluated using the contrast between the inclusion and the background
   and the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR). It is shown that the shear modulus
   can be accurately reconstructed based on the fundamental component, such
   that the observed contrast deviates from the true contrast by a
   root-meansquare-error (RMSE) of only 0.38 and the CNR is greater than 30
   dB. If the second-harmonic component is used, the RMSE becomes 1.54 and
   the corresponding CNR decreases by approximately 10-15 dB. The
   reconstructed shear viscosity maps based on the second harmonic are
   shown to be of higher quality than those based on the fundamental. The
   effects of noise are also investigated and a fusion operation between
   the two spectral components is applied to enhance the reconstruction
   quality. Finally, a modified shear-wave spectroscopy technique, shown to
   be more robust to noise, is described for the estimation of the
   viscoelastic properties inside and outside the spherical inclusion under
   conditions of increased noise. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   encompasses the existing double integrator consensus problem as a

   develop a distributed adaptive redesign so that asymptotic
   synchronisation convergence is achieved in the presence of linearly
   parameterised model uncertainties. Simulation results show the

Abstract = {{Increasing evidence supports the importance of cell extrinsic regulation
   in stem cell fate control. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are responsive
   to local signals from their niche and to systemic feedback from
   progenitors and mature cells. The Notch ligand Delta-1 (DL1), a key
   component of the stem cell niche, regulates human hematopoietic lineage
   development in a dose-dependent manner and has been used clinically for
   primitive progenitor expansion. How DL1 acts to regulate HSC fate and
   whether these actions are related to its lineage skewing effects are
   poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that, although DL1 activates
   signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling similarly
   to the gp130-activating cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), it has opposite
   effects on myeloid cell production. Mechanistically, these different
   outcomes are attributable to a DL1-mediated reduction inmembrane
   (m)-bound IL-6 receptor (R) expression, converting progenitor cells from
   being directly IL-6 responsive to requiring both IL-6 and soluble (s)
   IL-6R for activation. Concomitant reduction of both mIL-6R (by DL1
   supplementation) and sIL-6R (using dynamically fed cultures) reduced
   myeloid cell production and led to enhanced outputs of human HSCs. This
   work describes a new mode of cytokine action in which DL1 changes
   cytokine receptor distributions on hematopoietic cells, altering
   feedback networks and their impact on stem cell fate.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the effects of dissolved butane on the
   crystallization of hard segment (HS) and its effects on enhancement of
   cell nucleation to manufacture microcellular thermoplastic polyurethane
   foams (TPU). The TPU samples were first reprocessed by melt compounding

   was-generated after this processing, including some perfected I-IS
   nano-crystals with a higher melting temperature. In addition to the
   processing effect, the saturation temperature and the plasticizing
   butane significantly induced a larger number of HS crystalline domains.
   Consequently, cell nucleation was significantly promoted in the vicinity
   of the largely distributed HS crystalline domains over a wider
   saturation temperature range of 150 degrees C-170 degrees C at a
   saturation pressure of 55 bar. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Growing access to large-scale longitudinal structural neuroimaging data
   has fundamentally altered our understanding of cortical development en
   route to human adulthood, with consequences for basic science, medicine,
   and public policy. In striking contrast, basic anatomical development of
   subcortical structures such as the striatum, pallidum, and thalamus has
   remained poorly described-despite these evolutionarily ancient
   structures being both intimate working partners of the cortical sheet
   and critical to diverse developmentally emergent skills and disorders.
   Here, to begin addressing this disparity, we apply methods for the
   measurement of subcortical volume and shape to 1,171 longitudinally
   acquired structural magnetic resonance imaging brain scans from 618
   typically developing males and females aged 5-25 y. We show that the
   striatum, pallidum, and thalamus each follow curvilinear trajectories of
   volume change, which, for the striatum and thalamus, peak after cortical
   volume has already begun to decline and show a relative delay in males.
   Four-dimensional mapping of subcortical shape reveals that (i) striatal,
   pallidal, and thalamic domains linked to specific fronto-parietal
   association cortices contract with age whereas other subcortical
   territories expand, and (ii) each structure harbors hotspots of sexually
   dimorphic change over adolescence-with relevance for sex-biased mental
   disorders emerging in youth. By establishing the developmental dynamism,
   spatial heterochonicity, and sexual dimorphism of human subcortical
   maturation, these data bring our spatiotemporal understanding of
   subcortical development closer to that of the cortex-allowing
   evolutionary, basic, and clinical neuroscience to be conducted within a
   more comprehensive developmental framework.}},

Abstract = {{SO-MUM, a coupled atmospheric transport and multimedia urban model, was
   used to estimate spatially resolved (5 X 5 km(2)),air emissions and
   chemical fate based on measured air concentrations and chemical mass
   inventories within Toronto, Canada. Approximately 95\% and 70\% of
   Sigma(5)PCBs (CB-28, -52, -101, -153, and -180) and Sigma 5PBDEs
   (BDE-28, -47, -100, -154, and -183) emissions of 17 (2-36) and 18 (3-42)
   kg y(-1), respectively, undergo atmospheric transport from the city,
   which is partly over Lake Ontario. The urban air plume was found to
   reach about 50 km for PCBs and PBDEs, in the direction of prevailing
   winds which is almost twice the distance of the wind-independent plume.
   The distance traveled by the plume is a function of prevailing wind
   velocity, the geographic distribution of the chemical inventory, and
   gas-particle partitioning. Soil wash-off of historically accumulated
   Sigma(5)PCBs to surface water contributed similar to 0.4 kg y(-1) (of
   mainly higher congeners) to near-shore Lake Ontario compared with
   volatilization of similar to 6 kg y(-1) of mainly lighter congeners.
   Atmospheric emissions from primary sources followed by deposition to
   surface films and subsequent wash-off to surface water contributed
   similar to 1 kg y(-1) and was the main route of Sigma 5PBDE loadings to
   near-shore Lake Ontario which acts as a net PBDE sink. Secondary
   emissions of PCBs and PBDEs from at least a similar to 900 000 km(2)
   rural land area would be needed to produce the equivalent primary
   emissions as Toronto (similar to 640 km(2)). These results provide clear
   support for reducing inventories of these POPs.}},

Abstract = {{Mutations of the X-linked gene encoding methyl CpG binding protein type
   2 (MECP2) are the predominant cause of Rett syndrome, a severe
   neurodevelopmental condition that affects primarily females. Previous
   studies have shown that major phenotypic deficits arising from
   MeCP2-deficiency may be reversible, as the delayed reactivation of the
   Mecp2 gene in Mecp2-deficient mice improved aspects of their Rett-like
   phenotype. While encouraging for prospective gene replacement
   treatments, it remains unclear whether additional Rett syndrome
   co-morbidities recapitulated in Mecp2-deficient mice will be similarly
   responsive to the delayed reintroduction of functional Mecp2. Here, we
   show that the delayed reactivation of Mecp2 in both male and female
   Mecp2-deficient mice rescues established deficits in motor and
   anxiety-like behavior, epileptiform activity, cortical and hippocampal
   electroencephalogram patterning and thermoregulation. These findings
   indicate that neural circuitry deficits arising from the deficiency in
   Mecp2 are not engrained, and provide further evidence that delayed
   restoration of Mecp2 function can improve a wide spectrum of the
   Rett-like deficits recapitulated by Mecp2-deficient mice.}},

Abstract = {{Abrasive slurry jet micro-machining (ASJM) uses a jet of abrasive slurry
   to erode features with relatively high resolution without the need for a
   patterned mask. The present study investigated the ability of a surface
   evolution model to predict the profiles of micro-channels and holes
   machined in borosilicate glass with a newly developed ASJM system. The
   system could produce micro-channels with depth and width variations
   along their length of less than 3\%, and a channel-to-channel
   repeatability within 5\%. The fundamental erosion rate of the
   borosilicate glass was measured as a function of impact angle using a
   slurry of water mixed with a low concentration of 10 and 25 mu m nominal
   diameter aluminum oxide particles. This erosion rate-impact angle
   relationship was used in an existing model developed previously for the
   abrasive air jet micro-machining of brittle materials. The results
   demonstrated that, despite the differences in abrasive flow patterns
   between air and slurry based systems, the surface evolution model
   accurately predicted the profiles of micro-channels with a maximum error
   of 7\% for aspect ratios (depth/width) of up to 5. The predicted
   profiles of holes were also in reasonable agreement with a maximum error
   of 14\% for aspect ratios close to 1. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{The effects of dilute polymer solution elasticity and viscosity on
   abrasive slurry jet micro-machining of glass}},
Journal = {{WEAR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{309}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{112-119}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{The present study investigated the effect of dilute polymer solutions on
   the width, shape, and centerline roughness of micro-channels machined
   using a specially-designed abrasive slurry-jet micro-machining (ASJM)
   apparatus. A positive displacement slurry pump and a pulsation damper
   were connected to an open reservoir mixing tank to generate a turbulent
   jet containing 1 wt\% 10 mu m Al2O3 particles flowing through a 180 mu m
   sapphire orifice at 4 MPa.
   The behavior of non-Newtonian fluids containing long-chain polymers is
   affected by both their viscosity and their resistance to extensional
   deformation (i.e. their ``elasticity{''}). The effects of viscosity and
   elasticity on erosion were separated by conducting experiments using
   aqueous solutions of equal viscosity, but differing elasticity. It was
   observed that jets began to oscillate laterally if the polymer
   concentration became too high.
   The width of the machined channels decreased 21\% with the addition of
   50 wppm of 8 M PEO, the highest concentration possible with a stable
   jet. This change was accompanied by a decrease in the channel depth of
   46\% and an increase in the centerline roughness of 29\%. These changes
   were due to normal stresses generated in the PEO solutions (an
   elasticity effect), and were not attributable to viscosity. It was also
   seen with this and other polymer solutions, that the channel
   cross-sections were more V-shaped compared with the U-shape of the
   reference channel machined using the glycerin solution. The same changes
   in shape, channel width, and centerline roughness were observed at a
   lower concentration of the same PEO (i.e. 25 wppm), but to a lesser
   degree. Similar changes were also evident with more concentrated 1-M PEO
   solutions (i.e. 25-400 wppm), but again to a lesser extent. However,
   even a very concentrated 2.5 x 10(4) wppm solution containing 0.1 M PEO
   had no effect, indicating the predominant role of polymer molecular
   weight in determining the magnitude of fluid elasticity and its
   influence on particle motion in the erosive slurry. The present results
   demonstrate that even a small amount of a high-molecular-weight polymer
   can significantly decrease the width of machined micro-channels for a
   given jet diameter. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of reducing power excursions in
   amplified wavelength division multiplexed networks with reconfigurable
   optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADM) and wavelength selective switches
   (WSS). In dynamic network loading scenarios, conventional WSS control
   leads to transient power excursions across the chain. Two WSS control
   strategies are considered: an integral-control and a modified
   integral-coordinated control for tracking. For both algorithms,
   convergence at an isolated node is shown to depend on the optical
   amplifier nonlinear gain coupling quantified by its Lipschitz constant.
   In a chain network with independently controlled ROADM nodes, the
   modified WSS control effectively decouples the nodes and reduces WSS
   transient power excursions across the chain. The bounds on these
   reductions are quantified analytically with respect to the L-2 norm, by
   applying Lyapunov analysis techniques for the interconnected chain
   system. Numerical results that verify and compare the two WSS control
   strategies are provided by implementation on a Transparent Optical Mesh
   (ATOM) platform for two realistic dynamic network loading scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical methods for imposing body forces in two-phase flow simulations
   are discussed. Numerical schemes are presented to avoid the inaccurate
   solutions that result from inconsistent implementation of forces. First,
   the momentum equations are discretized so that they accurately
   accommodate the discontinuity in fluid properties at an interface.
   Consistent numerical estimations for different body forces such as
   interfacial (including Marangoni), gravity and electromagnetic forces
   are discussed. Then, it is shown that the standard pressure-velocity
   coupling scheme for collocated algorithms is not sufficient for
   multiphase flows, and therefore a new pressure-velocity coupling is
   devised and tested for both single and two-phase flows. Finally, to
   advect the level set function, a cost effective fifth-order WENO method
   is developed. These formulations are accurate and efficient both for
   uniform and non-uniform meshes. Several test cases are presented and
   compared with a standard implementation of body forces to demonstrate
   the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Crown Copyright (C) 2013

   cells}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{246}},
Pages = {{430-437}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Previous methods to measure carbon deposition in solid oxide fuel cell
   (SOFC) anodes do not permit simultaneous electrochemical measurements.
   Electrochemical measurements supplemented with carbon deposition
   quantities create the opportunity to further understand how carbon
   affects SOFC performance and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). In
   this work, a method for measuring carbon in situ, named here as the
   quantification of gasified carbon (QGC), was developed. TGA experiments
   showed that carbon with a 100 h residence time in the SOFC was >99.8\%
   gasified. Comparison of carbon mass measurements between the TGA and QGC
   show good agreement. In situ measurements of carbon deposition in SOFCs
   at varying molar steam/carbon ratios were performed to further validate
   the QGC method, and suppression of carbon deposition with increasing
   steam concentration was observed, in agreement with previous studies.
   The technique can be used to investigate in situ carbon deposition and
   gasification behavior simultaneously with electrochemical measurements
   for a variety of fuels and operating conditions, such as determining
   conditions under which incipient carbon deposition is reversible. (C)

Abstract = {{The rejection of pharmaceutically active (PhACs) and endocrine
   disrupting compounds (EDCs) via a nanofiltration (NF) membrane was
   investigated as a function of naturally occurring colloidal and
   suspended particles, and cations. NF rejection of PhAC/EDCs was
   evaluated using a surface water that had been pre-treated by fluidized
   ion exchange (FIEX) to remove the humic fraction of dissolved organic
   matter yet retain the colloidal particles, and FIEX-pretreated water
   with cations added (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+). The presence of natural colloidal
   and suspended particles resulted in a significant decrease in the
   rejection of most neutral PhAC/EDCs, attributable to enhanced
   hydrophobic interactions (solute partitioning) at the membrane surface.
   The rejection of ionic compounds was governed by electrostatic
   interactions with the membrane surface and was not significantly
   affected by the presence of colloidal particles. The addition of cations
   to FIEX-pretreated water did not generally impact rejection of most
   compounds. While past research has investigated colloidal
   accumulation-associated NF/RO rejection of organic micropollutants, this
   study confirmed that colloidal particles indigenous to a typical surface
   water matrix negatively impact nanofiltration of PhAC/EDCs. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The reduction behavior of a leach residue containing hematite (Fe2O3),
   nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) and a small amount of siliceous gangue was
   studied using thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermal analysis
   (DTA) techniques. Carbon monoxide and graphite were used as reductants
   and a wide range of temperatures were covered. Both non-isothermal
   reduction (15 degrees C/min) and isothermal reduction tests with
   continuous measurement of the CO and CO2 evolution were performed to
   evaluate the temperature dependence of the reduction kinetics. In order
   to further elucidate the reduction mechanisms, the reduced products were
   subject to various analyses, i.e. SEM/EDS, XRD, and EPMA. Results show
   that the reduction rate increased with the increase of temperature when
   using CO as the reductant. Change of the rate-controlling mechanism from
   the gaseous diffusion in the pores of the sample bed to the diffusion in
   the metallic product layer was found to have taken place in the
   isothermal tests, resulting in the variation of apparent activation
   energies from 6.7 kJ/mol to 41.1 kJ/mol with the progress of reduction.
   The siliceous gangue melted at 1200 degrees C, inhibiting the reduction
   of the oxides. Effective reduction by graphite only occurred above
   around 1000 degrees C. Reduction of the molten silicate took place above
   1200 degrees C resulting in the formation of Fe-Ni-Si alloys. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{With the knowledge that the dominant photodynamic therapy (PDT)
   mechanism of la (WST09) switched from type 2 to type 1 for 1b (WST11)
   upon taurine-driven E-ring opening, we hypothesized that taurine-driven
   E-ring opening of bacteriochlorophyll derivatives and net-charge
   variations would modulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) photogeneration.
   Eight bacteriochlorophyll a derivatives were synthesized with varying
   charges that either contained the E ring (2a-5a) or were synthesized by
   taurine-driven E-ring opening (2b-513). Time-dependent density
   functional theory (TDDFT) modeling showed that all derivatives would be
   type 2 PDT-active, and ROS-activated fluorescent probes were used to
   investigate the photogeneration of a combination of type 1 and type 2
   PDT ROS in organic- and aqueous-based solutions. These investigations
   validated our predictive modeling calculations and showed that
   taurine-driven E-ring opening and increasing negative charge generally
   enhanced ROS photogeneration in aqueous solutions. We propose that these
   structure activity relationships may provide simple strategies for
   designing bacteriochlorins that efficiently generate ROS upon
   photoirradiation.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of nano-SiO2 and nano-TiO2 fillers on a thin film
   silicotungstic acid (SiWA)-H3PO4-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) proton
   conducting polymer electrolyte were studied and compared with respect to
   their proton conductivity, environmental stability, and dielectric
   properties, across a temperature range from 243 to 323 K. Three major
   effects of these fillers have been identified: (a) barrier effect; (b)
   intrinsic dielectric constant effect; and (c) water retention effect.
   Dielectric analyses were used to differentiate these effects on polymer
   electrolyte-enabled capacitors. Capacitor performance was correlated to
   electrolyte properties through dielectric constant and dielectric loss
   spectra. Using a single-ion approach, proton density and proton mobility
   of each polymer electrolyte were derived as a function of temperature.
   The results allow us to deconvolute the different contributions to
   proton conductivity in SiWA-H3PO4-PVA-based electrolytes, especially in
   terms of the effects of fillers on the dynamic equilibrium of free
   protons and protonated water in the electrolytes.}},

Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{Characterizing the biomechanical behavior of sutures in the human
   craniofacial skeleton (CFS) is essential to understand the global impact
   of these articulations on load transmission, but is challenging due to
   the complexity of their interdigitated morphology, the multidirectional
   loading they are exposed to and the lack of well-defined suture material
   properties. This study aimed to quantify the impact of morphological
   features, direction of loading and suture material properties on the
   mechanical behavior of sutures and surrounding bone in the CFS.
   Thirty-six idealized finite element (FE) models were developed. One
   additional specimen-specific FE model was developed based on the
   morphology obtained from a mu CT scan to represent the morphological
   complexity inherent in CFS sutures. Outcome variables of strain energy
   (SE) and von Mises stress (sigma(vm)) were evaluated to characterize the
   sutures' biomechanical behavior. Loading direction was found to impact
   the relationship between SE and interdigitation index and yielded varied
   patterns of sigma(vm) in both the suture and surrounding bone. Adding
   bone connectivity reduced suture strain energy and altered the sigma(vm)
   distribution. Incorporating transversely isotropic material properties
   was found to reduce SE, but had little impact on stress patterns.
   High-resolution mu CT scanning of the suture revealed a complex
   morphology with areas of high and low interdigitations. The specimen
   specific suture model results were reflective of SE absorption and
   sigma(vm) distribution patterns consistent with the simplified FE
   results. Suture mechanical behavior is impacted by morphologic factors
   (interdigitation and connectivity), which may be optimized for regional
   loading within the CFS. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a 56-channel neural recording interface with a
   chopper-stabilized DC-coupled front-end and a programmable mixed-signal
   DC cancelation feedback. Each recording channel has a fully-differential
   amplifier with 51-54dB of gain, an input-referred noise of 5 mu V-rms
   integrated from 10Hz to 5kHz and a CMRR of 65dB. Input DC-coupling
   allows for a simple chopping scheme without the area overhead of large
   capacitors and extra non-idealities compensation circuitry. Chopping is
   used to reduce the integrated input-referred noise from 7.5 mu V-rms to
   4.2 mu V-rms over the bandwidth of 1Hz to 1KHz. Each channel contains a
   digital integrator and a 16-bit delta-sigma DAC in the feedback in order
   to cancel input DC offsets of up to +/- 50mV and suppress the low
   frequency drift. Compensating the input DC offset at the folding node of
   the OTA provides an input-referred noise that is independent of the DC
   offset value. The recorded data by the array is digitized by 8

Abstract = {{This paper considers direction following control of planar snake robots
   for which the equations of motion are described based on a simplified
   model. In particular, we aim to regulate the orientation and the forward
   velocity of the robot to a constant vector, while guaranteeing the
   boundedness of the states of the controlled system. To this end, we
   first stabilize a constraint manifold for the fully-actuated body shape
   variables of the robot. The definition of the constraint manifold is
   inspired by the well-known reference joint angle trajectories which
   induce lateral undulatory motion for snake robots. Subsequently, we
   reduce the dynamics of the system to the invariant constraint manifold.
   Furthermore, we design two dynamic compensators which control the
   orientation and velocity of the robot on this manifold. Using numerical
   analysis and a formal stability proof, we show that the solutions of the
   dynamic compensators remain bounded. Numerical simulations are presented
   to validate the theoretical design.}},

Abstract = {{Approximate computing explores opportunities that emerge when
   applications can tolerate error or inexactness. These applications,
   which range from multimedia processing to machine learning, operate on
   inherently noisy and imprecise data. We can trade-off some loss in
   output value integrity for improved processor performance and
   energy-efficiency. As memory accesses consume substantial latency and
   energy, we explore load value approximation, a microarchitectural
   technique to learn value patterns and generate approximations for the
   data. The processor uses these approximate data values to continue
   executing without incurring the high cost of accessing memory, removing
   load instructions from the critical path. Load value approximation can
   also inhibit approximated loads from accessing memory, resulting in
   energy savings. On a range of PARSEC workloads, we observe up to 28.6\%
   speedup (8.5\% on average) and 44.1\% energy savings (12.6\% on
   average), while maintaining low output error. By exploiting the
   approximate nature of applications, we draw closer to the ideal latency
   and energy of accessing memory.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon interposer technology ({''}2.5D{''} stacking) enables the
   integration of multiple memory stacks with a processor chip, thereby
   greatly increasing in-package memory capacity while largely avoiding the
   thermal challenges of 3D stacking DRAM on the processor. Systems
   employing interposers for memory integration use the interposer to
   provide point-to-point interconnects between chips. However, these
   interconnects only utilize a fraction of the interposer's overall
   routing capacity, and in this work we explore how to take advantage of
   this otherwise unused resource.
   We describe a general approach for extending the architecture of a
   network-on-chip (NoC) to better exploit the additional routing resources
   of the silicon interposer. We propose an asymmetric organization that
   distributes the NoC across both a multi-core chip and the interposer,
   where each sub-network is different from the other in terms of the
   traffic types, topologies, the use or non-use of concentration, direct
   vs. indirect network organizations, and other network attributes.
   Through experimental evaluation, we show that exploiting the otherwise
   unutilized routing resources of the interposer can lead to significantly
   better performance.}},

Abstract = {{Network topology plays a vital role in chip design; it largely
   determines network cost (power and area) and significantly impacts
   communication performance in many-core architectures. Conventional
   topologies such as a 2D mesh have drawbacks including high diameter as
   the network scales and poor load balancing for the center nodes. We
   propose a methodology to design random topologies for on-chip networks.
   Random topologies provide better scalability in terms of network
   diameter and provide inherent load balancing. As a proof-of-concept for
   random on-chip topologies, we explore a novel set of networks - dodecs -
   and illustrate how they reduce network diameter with randomized
   low-radix router connections. While a 4 x 4 mesh has a diameter of 6,
   our dodec has a diameter of 4 with lower cost. By introducing
   randomness, dodec networks exhibit more uniform message latency. By
   using low-radix routers, dodec networks simplify the router
   microarchitecture and attain 20\% area and 22\% power reduction compared
   to mesh routers while delivering the same overall application
   performance for PARSEC.}},

Abstract = {{Improving branch prediction accuracy is essential in enabling
   high-performance processors to find more concurrency and to improve
   energy efficiency by reducing wrong path instruction execution, a
   paramount concern in today's power-constrained computing landscape.
   Branch prediction traditionally considers past branch outcomes as a
   linear, continuous bit stream through which it searches for patterns and
   correlations. The state-of-the-art TAGE predictor and its variants
   follow this approach while varying the length of the global history
   fragments they consider.
   This work identifies a construct, inherent to several applications that
   challenges existing, linear history based branch prediction strategies.
   It finds that applications have branches that exhibit multi-dimensional
   correlations. These are branches with the following two attributes: 1)
   they are enclosed within nested loops, and 2) they exhibit correlation
   across iterations of the outer loops. Folding the branch history and
   interpreting it as a multidimensional piece of information, exposes
   these cross-iteration correlations allowing predictors to search for
   more complex correlations in the history space with lower cost. We
   present wormhole, a new side-predictor that exploits these
   multidimensional histories. Wormhole is integrated alongside ISL-TAGE
   and leverages information from its existing side-predictors. Experiments
   show that the wormhole predictor improves accuracy more than existing
   side-predictors, some of which are commercially available, with a
   similar hardware cost. Considering 40 diverse application traces, the
   wormhole predictor reduces MPKI by an average of 2.53\% and 3.15\% on
   top of 4KB and 32KB ISL-TAGE predictors respectively. When considering
   the top four workloads that exhibit multidimensional history
   correlations, Wormhole achieves 22\% and 20\% MPKI average reductions
   over 4KB and 32KB ISL-TAGE.}},

Abstract = {{Architectural complexity continues to grow as we consider the large
   design space of multiple cores, cache architectures, networks-on-chip
   and memory controllers for emerging architectures. Simulators are
   growing in complexity to reflect each of these system components.
   However, many full-system simulators fail to take advantage of the
   underlying hardware resources such as multiple cores; as a result,
   simulation times have grown significantly in recent years. Long
   turnaround times limit the range and depth of design space exploration
   that is tractable.
   Communication has emerged as a first class design consideration and has
   led to significant research into networks-on-chip (NoC). The NoC is yet
   another component of the architecture that must be faithfully modeled in
   simulation. Given its importance, we focus on accelerating NoC
   simulation through the use of sampling techniques; sampling can provide
   both accurate results and fast evaluation. We propose NoCLabs and
   NoCPoint, two sampling methodologies utilizing statistical sampling
   theory and traffic phase behavior, respectively. Experimental results
   show that our proposed NoCLabs and NoCPoint estimate NoC performance
   with an average error of 5\% while achieving one order of magnitude
   speedup on average.}},

Abstract = {{Huygens surfaces are a superposition of scalar electric and magnetic
   surface impedances which are used to control wavefronts. Here we expand
   the capabilities of a Huygens surface to also control the polarization
   of the electromagnetic field. To achieve this, the Huygens surface must
   now compose of tensor impedances. This allows for the polarization to be
   altered to any desired state. To verify this idea, we develop an
   equivalent S-parameter model and use it to determine the required tensor
   impedances. We then use a custom TLM method to demonstrate a Huygens
   surface which takes a normally incident, linearly polarized, Gaussian
   beam and converts it to a circularly polarized Gaussian beam refracted
   by 30 degrees.}},

   Replacing the dielectric sheet with a metasurface allows greater

Abstract = {{Recent research on parameter uncertainty quantification via the
   Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method has led to several
   approaches aimed at outperforming the conventional Monte-Carlo
   technique. Among those, the use of polynomial chaos (PC) is
   characterized by mathematical robustness and computational efficiency.
   However, it still requires either multiple FDTD runs (in non-intrusive
   PC methods) or the execution of one large simulation to compute the PC
   expansion coefficients for all field nodes and time steps (in the
   intrusive case). This paper presents an intrusive PC-FDTD method
   stemming from a wavelet-based PC expansion of field components, with
   respect to the uncertain parameters. This multi-resolution expansion
   implements a sparse adaptive grid in the uncertain parameter space,
   which produces significant performance gains, without sacrificing

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel thin metasurface for microwave refraction.
   The metasurface is based on the new concept of establishing orthogonal
   electric and magnetic currents (Huygens sources) on a surface thus
   physically implementing the equivalence principle. Such thin Huygens
   Metasurfaces can be used for refraction, focusing and general beam
   shaping. Here we discuss the design procedure and experimental
   validation of such a metasurface for 1D refraction. In contrast to
   previous work, the proposed metasurface does not require stacked layers,
   but it comprises collocated electric and magnetic dipoles printed on a
   single panel. This can be represented in one layer of lattice cells, and
   its behavior described using transmission-line theory. This makes it
   electrically thin and readily scalable to millimeter-wave frequencies
   and beyond.}},

Abstract = {{Many computer vision problems require optimization of binary
   non-submodular energies. We propose a general optimization framework
   based on local submodular approximations (LSA). Unlike standard LP
   relaxation methods that linearize the whole energy globally, our
   approach iteratively approximates the energies locally. On the other
   hand, unlike standard local optimization methods (e.g. gradient descent
   or projection techniques) we use non-linear submodular approximations
   and optimize them without leaving the domain of integer solutions. We
   discuss two specific LSA algorithms based on trust region and auxiliary
   function principles, LSA-TR and LSA-AUX. These methods obtain
   state-of-the-art results on a wide range of applications outperforming
   many standard techniques such as LBP, QPBO, and TRWS. While our paper is
   focused on pairwise energies, our ideas extend to higher-order problems.

Abstract = {{Distributed storage systems store redundant data to tolerate failures of
   storage nodes and lost data should be repaired when storage nodes fail.
   A class of MDS codes, called minimum-storage regenerating (MSR) codes,
   has been designed to optimize bandwidth consumption when repairing one
   single failure. Compared with repairing failures individually, the
   cooperative repair of multiple failures can help to further save
   bandwidth consumption when multiple failures are being repaired. In this
   paper, we present a new construction of minimum-storage cooperative
   regenerating (MSCR) codes that repair two failures cooperatively and
   exactly. We show that given a valid instance of linear exact MSR codes,
   we are able to construct a corresponding repair procedure to repair any
   two failures cooperatively with optimal bandwidth consumption, i.e., to
   construct an instance of exact MSCR codes directly from exact MSR codes.
   With this connection, we are also able to repair any single failure
   exactly with MSCR codes.}},

Abstract = {{We study the multi-resource allocation problem in cloud computing
   systems where the resource pool is constructed from a large number of
   heterogeneous servers, representing different points in the
   configuration space of resources such as processing, memory, and
   storage. We design a multi-resource allocation mechanism, called DRFH,
   that generalizes the notion of Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF) from a
   single server to multiple heterogeneous servers. DRFH provides a number
   of highly desirable properties. With DRFH, no user prefers the
   allocation of another user; no one can improve its allocation without
   decreasing that of the others; and more importantly, no user has an
   incentive to lie about its resource demand. As a direct application, we
   design a simple heuristic that implements DRFH in real-world systems.
   Large-scale simulations driven by Google cluster traces show that DRFH
   significantly outperforms the traditional slot-based scheduler, leading
   to much higher resource utilization with substantially shorter job
   completion times.}},

Abstract = {{We study joint spectrum allocation and user association in heterogeneous
   cellular networks with multiple tiers of base stations. A stochastic
   geometric approach is applied as the basis to derive the average
   downlink user data rate in a closed-form expression. Then, the
   expression is employed as the objective function in jointly optimizing
   spectrum allocation and user association, which is of non-convex
   programming in nature. A computationally efficient Structured Spectrum
   Allocation and User Association (SSAUA) approach is proposed, solving
   the optimization problem optimally when the density of users is low, and
   near-optimally with a guaranteed performance bound when the density of
   users is high. A Surcharge Pricing Scheme (SPS) is also presented, such
   that the designed association bias values can be achieved in Nash
   equilibrium. Simulations and numerical studies are conducted to validate
   the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed SSAUA approach and SPS.}},

Abstract = {{Short TCP flows that are critical for many interactive applications in
   data centers are plagued by long flows and head-of-line blocking in
   switches. Hash-based load balancing schemes such as ECMP aggravate the
   matter and result in long-tailed flow completion times (FCT). Previous
   work on reducing FCT usually requires custom switch hardware and/or
   protocol changes. We propose RepFlow, a simple yet practically effective
   approach that replicates each short flow to reduce the completion times,
   without any change to switches or host kernels. With ECMP the original
   and replicated flows traverse distinct paths with different congestion
   levels, thereby reducing the probability of having long queueing delay.
   We develop a simple analytical model to demonstrate the potential
   improvement. Further, we conduct NS-3 simulations and Mininet
   implementation and show that RepFlow provides 50\%-70\% speedup in both
   mean and 99-th percentile FCT for all loads, and offers near-optimal FCT
   when used with DCTCP.}},

Abstract = {{Middleboxes are ubiquitous in today's networks. They perform deep packet
   processing such as content-based filtering and transformation, which
   requires multiple categories of resources (e.g., CPU, memory bandwidth,
   and link bandwidth). Depending on the processing requirement of traffic,
   packet processing for different flows may consume vastly different
   amounts of resources. Multi-resource fair queueing allows flows to
   obtain a fair share of these resources, providing service isolation
   across flows. However, previous solutions for multi-resource fair
   queueing are either expensive to implement at high speeds, or incurring
   high scheduling delay for flows with uneven weights. In this paper, we
   present a new fair queueing algorithm, called Group Multi-Resource Round
   Robin (GMR(3)), that schedules packets in O(1) time, while achieving
   near-perfect fairness with a low scheduling delay bounded by a small
   constant. To our knowledge, it is the first provably fair, highly
   efficient multi-resource fair queueing algorithm with bounded delay.}},

Abstract = {{With an abundance of computing resources, cloud computing systems have
   been widely used to elastically offload the execution of
   computation-intensive applications on mobile devices, leading to
   performance gains and better power efficiency. However, existing works
   have so far focused on one application only, and multiple applications
   are not coordinated when sending their offloading requests to the cloud.
   In this paper, we propose the new technique of coalesced offloading,
   which exploits the potential for multiple applications to coordinate
   their offloading requests with the objective of saving additional energy
   on mobile devices. The intuition is that, by sending these requests in
   ``bundles,{''} the period of time that the network interface stays in
   the high-power state can be reduced. We present two online algorithms,
   collectively referred to as Ready, Set, Go (RSG), that make near-optimal
   decisions on how offloading requests from multiple applications are to
   be best coalesced. We show, both analytically and experimentally using
   actual smartphones, that RSG is able to achieve additional energy
   savings while maintaining satisfactory performance.}},

Abstract = {{The ever increasing complexity of scientific applications has led to
   utilization of new HPC paradigms such as Graphical Processing Units
   (GPUs). However, modifying existing applications to enable them to be
   executed on GPU can be challenging. Furthermore, the considerable
   speedup achieved by execution of linear algebra operations on GPUs has
   added a huge heterogeneity to HPC clusters. In this work, we enabled
   NPAIRS, a neuro-imaging application, to be executed on GPU with slight
   modifications to its original code. This important feature of our
   implementation enables current users of NPAIRS, i.e. non-expert
   bio-medical scientists, to get benefit from GPU without having to apply
   fundamental changes to their existing application. As the second part of
   our research, we investigated the efficiency of several scheduling
   algorithms for a heterogeneous cluster that contains GPU nodes.
   Experimental results show that we achieved 7x speedup for NPAIRS.
   Moreover, although scheduling does not play an important role when there
   is no GPU node in the cluster, it can highly improve the makespan for a
   CPU-GPU cluster. We compared our scheduling results with Torque and MCT,
   two of the most commonly used schedulers in current HPC platforms. Our
   results show that the Sufferage scheduling can improve the makespan of
   Torque and MCT by 47\% and 4\% respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Nanotechnologies such as TiO2 photocatalysis (UV/TiO2 or solar/TiO2),
   silver nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and chitosan are currently being
   evaluated for use in drinking water and wastewater treatment
   applications. TiO2 photocatalysis, in particular, is an attractive
   option for drinking water treatment because it can provide concurrent
   disinfection, disinfection by-product (DBP) precursor reduction, and
   degradation of recalcitrant compounds. Like any oxidation-based process,
   however, it has the potential to contribute to the formation of
   by-products, whether by directly oxidizing precursor compounds to form
   degradation products with potential health effects or indirectly by
   breaking down innocuous water constituents to form DBP precursors that
   can later be converted to DBPs when chemicals such as chlorine and
   chloramines are applied for disinfection. Research into DBP formation in
   water treatment processes employing TiO2 photocatalysis is limited, but
   the studies that have been conducted to date suggest that these
   technologies create few DBPs directly and have site-specific effects on
   DBP precursor formation. The latter are also highly dependent on system
   design parameters, in particular UV dose and TiO2 configuration or
   concentration. UV/TiO2 compares favorably to existing disinfection and
   DBP precursor removal technologies in terms of both DBP formation and
   DBP precursor removal. Hybrid systems incorporating UV/TiO2 along with
   another DBP precursor removal technology such as coagulation,
   adsorption, or membrane filtration are also promising for both
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we provide an overview of a hierarchical computational
   framework to predict thermal transport in electronic devices through
   integration of physics-based models at different length scales.
   Information from atomistic simulations at the smallest length scales are
   transferred to upper levels of the hierarchy, up to thermal models for
   the chip. The proposed methodology includes five levels of length scales
   in electronic devices, namely (i) atomistic level, (ii) thin film and
   nanowire level, (iii) transistor and logic gate level, (iv) functional
   block level, and (v) chip level. At the first level of the hierarchy,
   properties of energy carriers in a semiconductor material (e.g.,
   phonons) are obtained from atomistic level simulations, such as
   Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Lattice Dynamics (LD) calculations. At the
   second level, thermal transport in thin silicon films is modelled using
   a Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) for phonons. The outcome of these
   simulations is a size-dependent thermal conductivity for silicon films.
   At the third level of the hierarchy, these effective thermal
   conductivities are used in thermal modelling of logic gates. Detailed
   structures of different types of logic gates are reconstructed based on
   different manufacturing technologies (MOSFET and FinFET) at different
   technology nodes. Since the characteristic sizes of different parts of
   the logic gates are comparable to the mean free path of energy carriers,
   we use the size-dependent, effective thermal conductivities that were
   calculated at lower levels of the hierarchy to build simulation models
   for the logic gates. Based on these models, we calculate an equivalent
   thermal conductance for the logic gates, which would then be used in the
   upper level simulations to determine an equivalent thermal conductance
   for different fitnctional blocks of the die based on their internal
   structure and the number and type of logic gates found in each
   functional block. Overall, the proposed hierarchical model enables us to
   include the effect of atomistic-level physics into package-level
   simulations, and thus, have an accurate prediction of thermal transport
   in an electronic device.}},

Abstract = {{Effective machine-aided diagnosis and repair of configuration errors
   continues to elude computer systems designers. Most of the literature
   targets errors that can be attributed to a single erroneous
   configuration setting. However, a recent study found that a significant
   amount of configuration errors require fixing more than one setting
   together. To address this limitation, Ocasta statistically clusters
   dependent configuration settings based on the application's accesses to
   its configuration settings and utilizes the extracted clustering of
   configuration settings to fix configuration errors involving more than
   one configuration settings. Ocasta treats applications as black-boxes
   and only relies on the ability to observe application accesses to their
   configuration settings.
   We collected traces of real application usage from 24 Linux and 5
   Windows desktops computers and found that Ocasta is able to correctly
   identify clusters with 88.6\% accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness
   of Ocasta, we evaluated it on 16 real-world configuration errors of 11
   Linux and Windows applications. Ocasta is able to successfully repair
   all evaluated configuration errors in 11 minutes on average and only
   requires the user to examine an average of 3 screenshots of the output
   of the application to confirm that the error is repaired. A user study
   we conducted shows that Ocasta is easy to use by both expert and
   non-expert users and is more efficient than manual configuration error

Abstract = {{This paper presents an active flutter suppression design using linear
   parameter-varying (LPV) control method for a nonlinear aeroservoelastic
   model that captures wing-section stall flutter. The
   loss-of-effectiveness fault is considered for the control surface. The
   resulting model is a function of speed as well as effectiveness factor
   of the control surface. These two parameters are treated as the varying
   parameters to formulate an LPV representation of the wing-section model
   using Jacobian linearization. An H-2 gain-scheduled controller based on
   a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function is designed for the LPV system.
   The simulation shows that it can suppress limit cycle oscillations over
   a range of speed and work under a certain range of control surface
   effectiveness loss.}},

Abstract = {{We propose Isometric Patch Alignment (IPA), a novel dimensionality
   reduction method which has a low computational cost. This method is
   inspired by the observation that, reasonably large chunks of a
   high-dimensional dataset can be approximated by low-dimensional patches
   over its underlying manifold. Thus, in our proposed approach, first the
   input data is clustered, such that the neighboring clusters have some
   overlap. Then, each cluster is modeled by a low-dimensional patch on the
   underlying manifold of the data. Conceptually, the input is now reduced
   to a set of patches. IPA rearranges these patches such that the shared
   points between the neighboring ones match accordingly. We show that this
   rearrangement can be computed by solving a relatively small
   semi-definite program. In addition, we prove that attaching two
   neighboring patches on their overlapping parts aligns them together.
   Based on this, the manifold resulted from the convex optimization of IPA
   will be unfolded and thus, can be represented in a low-dimensional
   subspace. The proposed method is stable, fast, and scalable; our
   experimental results demonstrate its capability for dimensionality
   reduction and data visualization, particularly on input datasets with
   complex structures, for example where the underlying manifold is not
   convex. Moreover, as a distinct application, IPA is employed for protein
   structure determination.}},

Abstract = {{Feeding a noisy signal to a biometric system degrades its performance.
   Hence, signal quality measure is used to avoid passing irregular signals
   to subsequent systems such as biometric systems. To tackle this issue,
   1DMRLBP features, which are 1 dimensional signal feature extraction
   (inspired by the 2 dimensional image Local Binary Patterns) is proposed.
   1DMRLBP with its multi-resolution capability captures local and global
   signal characteristics; and with its histogram extraction avoids
   segments misalignment and reduces the number of features. Also with some
   modifications, 1DMRLBP accommodates the problem of unknown amplitude of
   a signal. 1DMRLBP achieves 91\% performance rate in distinguishing
   between regular and irregular ECG waveforms. MATLAB code and more

Abstract = {{While reduced whole cell stiffness has long been used to identify
   cancerous cells, cancer progression usually results in enhanced nuclear
   deformability as well. However, previous studies on nuclear mechanical
   properties were conducted either on isolated nuclei or intact nuclei
   indirectly, and intracellular characterization in situ has been missing.
   In this paper, an AFM technique to study nuclear mechanics in situ is
   shown. Using this technique we demonstrated that isolated nuclei
   exhibited significantly lower Young's moduli than intact nuclei in situ
   (8.64 +/- 1.36 kPa vs. 78.46 +/- 14.88 kPa, p=0.0001), and we
   characterized and compared the mechanical properties of nuclei in situ
   between RT4 and T24 cells with different metastatic potential. It was
   quantitatively demonstrated that the cell nuclei were significantly
   stiffer than the cytoplasm, and that intact nuclei of RT4 exhibited
   significantly higher stiffness than that of T24 cells (8.4 +/- 1.02 kPa
   vs. 5.67 +/- 0.48 kPa, p<0.03). These results may provide insight into
   the mechanisms by which the nuclear mechanics influences cell function,
   contributing to cancer development.}},

Abstract = {{Video cameras can only take photographs with limited dynamic range. One
   method to overcome this is to combine differently exposed images of the
   same subject matter (i.e. a Wyckoff Set), producing a High Dynamic Range
   (HDR) result. Implementations for real-time HDR videos have relied upon
   methods that are less accurate. Instead of weighted-sum approaches that
   adds up noise for large number of LDR images, lookup tables that
   contains results calculated using a probabilistic model can be
   generated. This lookup table, when compressed using quadtree structure,
   can be implemented on a medium-sized FPGA. The work presented in this
   paper improves over the earlier publication to support high-definition
   videos. To achieve the required bandwidth for HDR composition, the
   evaluation of the camera response function is performed within a
   compressed lookup table that has its address retrieved using a pipelined
   multiplexer network. We are able to generate the entire circuit using
   software. It is parameterizable by user-specified error constraints,
   allowing us to explore the trade-offs in resource usage and precision of
   the implementation.}},

Abstract = {{The word ``surveillance{''} comes from the French word ``veillance{''}
   which means ``watching{''} and the French prefix ``sur{''}, which means
   ``from above{''}. Thus ``surveillance{''} means ``to watch from
   above{''} (e. g.guards watching over prisoners or police watching over a
   city through a city-wide surveillance camera network). The closest
   purely English word is ``oversight{''}.
   A more recent phenomenon, sousveillance ({''}undersight{''}) refers to
   the less hierarchical and more rhizomic veillance of social networking,
   distributed cloud-based computing, and body-worn technologies.
   Sousveillance forms a reciprocal power balance with surveillance, both
   being understood in the context of not just technology, but also complex
   human social and political relationships.
   In this paper we derive a precise theoretical and mathematical framework
   to understand, interpret, quantify, and classify ``veillance{''}
   ({''}watching{''}) as to its directionality (i.e. surveillance versus
   sousveillance).
   While veillance can occur in a variety of sensory modalities, such as
   auditory sur/sousveillance, dataveillance, etc., we will focus
   especially on optical (visual) veillance. We define new physical
   concepts: the veillon, the vixel, and the veillance vector field, to
   provide insight into the measurement and demarcation of surveillance and
   sousveillance and their interplay.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, advanced forgery and spoofing techniques are threatening the
   reliability of conventional biometric modalities. This has been
   motivating the recent investigation of a novel yet promising modality
   Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission (TEOAE), which is an acoustic
   response generated from cochlea after a click stimulus. Unlike
   conventional modalities that are easily accessible or captured, TEOAE is
   naturally immune to replay and falsification attacks as a physiological
   outcome from human auditory system. Corresponding biometric system where
   sensitive template data are stored consequently becomes the main
   intrusion target. To secure the template data, BioHashing based on
   random projection for TEOAE is proposed in this paper. Particularly,
   feature sets are projected onto random subspaces according to randomly
   generated pseudo matrices, which ensures non-linkability of hash
   templates across various systems; binary quantization after projection
   prevents recovery of original biometric data from the distorted
   templates. Quantitative analysis and experimental results verify that
   the proposed method fulfills robustness criteria, irreversibility and
   diversity, and meanwhile guarantees decent recognition performance.}},

Abstract = {{Modern smartphones comprise several processing and input/output units
   that communicate mostly through main memory. As a result, memory
   represents a critical performance bottleneck for smartphones. This
   work(1) introduces a set of emerging workloads for smartphones and
   characterizes the performance of several memory controller policies and
   address-mapping schemes for those workloads. The workloads include
   high-resolution video conferencing, computer vision algorithms such as
   upper-body detection and feature extraction, computational photography
   techniques such as high dynamic range imaging, and web browsing. This
   work also considers combinations of these workloads that represent
   possible use cases of future smartphones such as detecting and focusing
   on people or other objects in live video. While some of these workloads
   have been characterized before, this is the first work that studies
   address mapping and memory controller scheduling for these workloads.
   Experimental analysis demonstrates: (1) Most of the workloads are either
   memory throughput or latency bound straining a conventional smartphone
   main memory system. (2) The address mapping schemes that balance row
   locality with concurrency among different banks and ranks are best. (3)
   The FR-FCFS with write drain memory scheduler performs best,
   outperforming some more recently proposed schedulers targeted at
   multi-threaded workloads on general purpose processors. These results
   suggest that there is potential to improve memory performance and that
   existing schedulers developed for other platforms ought to be revisited
   and tuned to match the demands of such smartphone workloads.}},

Abstract = {{Shape memory polymers (SMP) are a class of stimuli-responsive materials
   that are able to respond to external stimulus such as heat by altering
   their shape. Bio-compatible SMPs have a number of advantages over
   existing SMP materials and are being studied extensively for biomedical
   and clinical applications. Polymer blending has proved to be an
   effective method to improve the mechanical properties of polymers (such
   as tensile strength and toughness) as well as shape memory properties.
   In this study, we investigate the effect of blending two bio compatible
   polymers, thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), a polymer with a high
   toughness and percent elongation, and poly-lactic acid (PLA), a stiff
   and strong polymer. The thermal, mechanical and thermo-mechanical (shape
   memory) properties of TPU/PLA blends were characterized in the following
   weight percent compositions: 80/20, 65/35, and 50/50 TPU/PLA. The
   TPU/PLA SMP blending was achieved with melt-blending and the tensile
   samples were fabricated with compression molding. The mechanical
   properties of each blend were studied at three different temperatures.
   The following thermo-mechanical (or shape memory) properties were also
   studied at each temperature: the shape fixity rate (R-f), shape recovery
   rate (R-r) and the effect of recovery temperature on the shape memory
   behavior. The microstructure of the polymer blends were investigated
   with an environmental scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results
   showed that the glass transition temperatures of the blends were similar
   to pure PLA. The toughness of the SMP blend increased with increasing
   TPU concentration and the tensile strength of the blend increased with
   PLA composition. The shape fixity rate of the TPU/PLA blend increased

Abstract = {{Gas-liquid two-phase flow in minichannels and microchannels display a
   unique flow pattern called ring film flow, in which stable waves of
   relatively large amplitudes appear at seemingly regular intervals and
   propagate in the flow direction. In this work, the behavior of ring
   films has been investigated experimentally in a 150 mu m diameter silica
   tube experimentally to elucidate their generation mechanism and
   propagation behavior. High speed video images were taken at 6,000 frames
   per second and the formation of ring films and the relationship between
   the wave amplitude and velocity were determined. The results indicate an
   interfacial instability leading to the formation and growth of ring
   waves with both low and high wave amplitudes. The wave velocity is
   correlated to the wave amplitude with the large amplitude waves moving
   much faster than the low amplitude waves. As a result, coalescence of
   large and low amplitude waves has been observed.}},

Abstract = {{Natural gas requires some form of ignition assist in order to autoignite
   in the time available in a compression ignition engine. Ignition assist
   using a glow plug a heated surface was investigated using an apparatus
   that consists of an optically accessible constant volume combustion bomb
   coupled to a single cylinder CFR engine through the spark plug port.
   Previous studies have shown the dominant effect of fuel injection
   pattern and glow plug shield geometry on ignition delay, combustion
   rate, and fuel utilization with 1-3 fuel jets. New work has been carried
   out to evaluate the ability of a shielded glow plug to ignite a full
   nine jet symmetrical fuel injection pattern. The sensitivity of ignition
   delay and fuel utilization to fuel injector angular alignment relative
   to the glow plug, glow plug shield opening angle, and glow plug power
   was analyzed using in-cylinder pressure data and exhaust hydrocarbon
   emissions concentrations. Two glow plugs, one conventional metallic and
   one ceramic, and two fuel injector nozzle orifice sizes were evaluated
   for their effect on ignition delay. The ignition and flame propagation
   process was observed using high speed images. Glow plug power was shown
   to have a dominant effect on ignition delay and fuel utilization, with a
   secondary effect from fuel injector angle and glow plug opening angle.
   The ceramic glow plug was shown to provide superior ignition assist
   while consuming less power than the metallic glow plug. The larger fuel
   injector nozzle size increased ignition delay times, likely due to
   increased convective cooling of the glow plug surface from the larger
   gas jet. Acquired images show that the smaller fuel injector orifice
   size created a flammable path in two distinct areas; along the periphery
   of the fuel jets and between the fuel jets. The higher mass flow rate
   and subsequent increased mixing of the larger fuel jets created
   flammable paths throughout the entirety of the combustion chamber.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the combustion behaviours of spent pulping
   liquors from 8 kraft mills, a soda mill, a dissolving pulp mill, a
   neutral sulfite semi-chemical mill and an NH4-based sulfite mill. We
   performed over 300 combustion tests using a thermogravimetric (TG)
   combustor that continuously recorded the liquor sample mass and
   documented the appearance of the sample during the combustion process.
   The results confirmed key findings reported in the literature and
   provided further insight into the combustion behaviours of the liquors.
   As the liquor sample was introduced into the TG combustor controlled at
   830 degrees C, it went through 3 main stages: drying,
   devolatilization/volatile burning, and char burning/smelt (or ash)
   formation. Drying and devolatilization were rapid, while char burning
   was slow with a rate less than one-tenth of the volatile burning rate.
   During devolatilization, all black liquors tested swelled enormously,
   reaching a maximum swollen volume of 20 to 40 times larger than their
   initial liquor volume, while the NSSC liquor and the NH4-based spent
   sulfite liquor did not swell much, only 2 to 3 times larger. The total
   combustion time was mainly governed by the char burning time, which
   varied significantly from liquor to liquor. In general, liquors that
   swelled more burned more quickly than liquors that swelled less. For
   liquors that swelled more than 25 times of their initial liquor volume,
   no further decrease in total combustion time was observed.}},

Abstract = {{Microalgae have been demonstrated to be the only viable major biofuel
   avenue due to globally finite cropland{[}1]. Traditional
   photobioreactors used to cultivate microalgae and cyanobacteria for

   penetration depth {[}2]. An optofluidic approach to cultivation of
   cyanobacteria provides an opportunity to overcome these difficulties by
   leveraging the inherent density advantages of biofilm growth {[}3]. A
   biophotovoltaic cell (BPV) is presented that is capable of high-density
   cultivation of cyanobacteria using surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
   enhanced evanescent fields as well as producing electrical power. This
   device, a photosynthetic-plasmonic-voltaic cell (PPV), demonstrated
   significant power output under direct illumination and plasmonic
   excitation and demonstrates for the first time the dual use of a gold

Abstract = {{In this work, the mechanical properties of carbon nanotube reinforced
   structural adhesive bonds are investigated both theoretically and
   experimentally. The theoretical investigations employ a novel multiscale
   modeling technique that integrates governing atomistic constitutive laws
   in a continuum framework. This technique takes into account the discrete
   nature of the atomic interactions at the nanometer length scale and the
   interfacial characteristics of the nanotube and the surrounding polymer
   matrix. Appropriate formulations are developed to allow for the
   atomistic-based continuum modelling of nano-reinforced structural
   adhesive bonds on the basis of a nanoscale representative volume element
   that accounts for the nonlinear behaviour of its constituents; namely,
   the reinforcing carbon nanotube, the surrounding adhesive and their
   interface. This model is used to evaluate the constitutive response of
   carbon nanotubes with varied chiral indices. The newly developed
   representative volume element is then used with analytical
   micromechanical modeling techniques to investigate the homogeneous and
   dispersion of the reinforcing element into the adhesive considered upon
   the linear elastic properties.}},

Abstract = {{In order to understand the detailed relationship between liquid water
   presence and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) performance,
   diagnostic tools which offer an accurate measure of liquid water in the

   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and synchrotron X-ray
   radiography for studying this liquid water/performance relationship.
   X-ray radiography was applied in the through-plane direction of the
   cell, and by using the Beer-Lambert law, liquid water was quantified in
   the anode and cathode flow channels, gas diffusion layers (GDLs),
   microporous layers (MPLs), and membrane electrode assembly (MEA). EIS
   was used as a non-invasive diagnostic tool in quantifying the equivalent
   resistances of the fuel cell. This paper presents studies of water
   thickness in various layers of the fuel cell during EIS measurements and
   demonstrates the role of the water thickness of each layer in the
   overall mass transport resistance of the fuel cell. The fuel cells
   analyzed have two varying MPL thicknesses at increasing constant current
   densities. Nyquist plots will be discussed with relation to amount of

Abstract = {{In this study, the nanoscale features of the polymer electrolyte
   membrane (PEM) fuel cell microporous layer (MPL) are considered in the
   determination of the effective thermal conductivity. A combination of
   scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy was used to
   visualize SGL-10BB and SGL-10BC MPLs, and we found that the MPL
   typically consists of randomly positioned spherical particles with
   diameters ranging from 10-100 nm. We developed a unit-cell model packed
   with spherical particles of various diameters to represent the MPL based
   on our high resolution visualizations. A thermal analysis based on the
   Gauss-Seidel iterative method for conductive heat transfer was utilized
   to obtain the effective thermal conductivity of various unit-cell
   configurations. It was found that the nature of contact between MPL
   particles dominates the effective thermal conductivity, which provides
   valuable insight for future MPL designs. To the authors' best knowledge,
   this is the first investigation of how the nanoscale features (namely
   particle to particle contacts) affect the bulk effective thermal
   conductivity of the material. This nanostructed model can also be used
   for future investigations, such as oxygen diffusion and electrical

Abstract = {{Corrosion of friction stir welds made in AZ31B magnesium alloy has been
   investigated using the microcapillary polarization technique. Various
   weld regions were examined in both spot and seam welds. The stir zone
   showed a higher reduction potential than the thermo-mechanically
   affected zone (TMAZ) and the base metal, due to the dissolution of
   beta-Mg17Al12 particles. The absence of second phase particles resulted
   in elimination of harmful microgalvanic cells between the beta-Mg17Al12
   particles and the alpha-Mg matrix, and an increased concentration of
   aluminum in solid solution. The noble stir zone formed a macro galvanic
   cell with the base metal, which resulted in accelerated corrosion of the
   TMAZ. No significant variation in the electrochemical response of
   various weld zones was seen between seam and spot welds.}},

   35 degrees C to 60 degrees C the resistance decreased from 0.83 Omega to
   0.78 Omega by 6\% and the capacitance increased from 93.32F g(-1) to
   104.36F g(-1) by 11.8\%. It was the contribution of high conductivity
   and the end open ration of CNTs. These results indicated that CNTs-based

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel architecture to manage identity and access
   (IAM) in a Multi-tier cloud infrastructure, in which most services are
   supported by massive-scale data centres over the Internet. Multi-tier
   cloud infrastructure uses tier-based model from Software Engineering to
   provide resources in different tires. In this paper we focus on design
   and implementation of a centralized identity and access management
   system for the multi-tier cloud infrastructure. First, we discuss
   identity and access management requirements in such an environment and
   propose our solution to address these requirements. Next, we discuss
   approaches to improve performance of the IAM system and make it scalable
   to billions of users. Finally, we present experimental results based on
   the current deployment in the SAVI Testbed. We show that our IAM system
   outperforms the previously proposed IAM systems for cloud infrastructure
   by factor 9 in throughput when the number of users is small, it handle
   about 50 times more requests in peak usage. Because our architecture is
   a combination of Green-thread and load balanced process, it uses less
   systems resources, and easily scales up to address high number of
   requests.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we discuss how to enable Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
   applications on Software-Defined Infrastructure (SDI) which is an
   approach for integrated control and management of converged computing
   and networking resources. Current separated resource management for
   computing or networking resources is not sufficient for addressing
   applications and multimedia services that require guaranteed service and
   quality levels. In addition, current resource management is not capable
   of managing heterogeneous resources that include computing and
   networking resources in combination with other resources such as
   programmable hardware, GPUs and network processors. We present an SDI
   that provides pluggable resource management modules for scheduling,
   networking control, fault management, and so on. This paper focuses on
   the design and implementation of a networking control module that
   enables SDN applications using information available from other modules.
   Currently, we have deployed the network control module in the practical
   multi-tier cloud infrastructure, SAVI Testbed. We present real

Abstract = {{Significant advancements have been made towards the commercialization of
   polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells in recent years. However,
   prohibitive costs and limited durability still remain as barriers toward
   deep market penetration, and these challenges largely stem from an
   incomplete understanding of how the nanoscale and microscale features of
   the porous materials in the PEM fuel cell affect multiphase and thermal
   transport within the bulk and at the interfacial regions of these porous
   layers. Non-traditional tools are needed more than ever to address these
   challenges. In the Thermofluids for Energy and Advanced Materials (TEAM)
   Laboratory at the University of Toronto, we employ a variety of advanced
   visualization tools to characterize the nanoscale and microscale
   features of the porous layers of the PEM fuel cell within ex-situ and
   in-situ environments. Accurate material characterizations are used as
   inputs for developing our predictive models, and visualizations serve as
   validations for our numerical modelling work. Our goal is to develop
   predictive numerical models that will serve as design tools that we can
   use to prescribe three-dimensional material properties for tailored
   thermal and liquid water transport for the next generation of PEM fuel
   cell technologies.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the influence of the liquid water inlet boundary
   conditions at the GDL/catalyst layer interface on the spatial
   distribution of liquid water within the GDL was studied. We used pore
   network modeling with invasion percolation to simulate liquid water
   transport in a commercially available GDL, where the detailed, 3D
   microstructure of the GDL was obtained through Xray imaging. Three inlet
   boundary conditions were studied: uniform pressure (single reservoir),
   uniform flux (completely discretized reservoirs), and distributed
   uniform pressure (random spatial- and size-distributions of reservoirs).
   We presented the distributed uniform pressure boundary condition as a
   more realistic inlet, where inlets are randomly distributed reservoirs
   that are connected to multiple inlet pores. It was found that the
   overall saturation ranged from 13\% to 23\% when the number of inlets
   ranged from 20 to 300; however, the microporous layer/catalyst layer
   delamination dominated water transport behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Balancing between fairness and throughput remains a challenging problem
   in the design of future wireless networks. This paper addresses this
   challenge and proposes a practical power optimization method, which has
   the potential of balancing between fairness and data throughput. The
   paper assumes a non-line of sight (NLOS) wireless backhaul network,
   especially introduced to serve areas with dense data traffic. The
   network comprises several transmitters, known as access-nodes (AN), each
   serving several remote terminals (RT) via wireless links. To reach a
   feasible, yet a simple, proportional fairness solution, this paper
   maximizes an approximated network-wide utility function, where the
   individual terms are based on long-term channel gains, utilized to
   compute the geometry carrier to interference and noise ratio (CINR). The
   paper then solves the power optimization problem by introducing a scalar
   bias to balance fairness with throughput. Through Monte Carlo
   simulations, performance improvement of the proposed method is
   illustrated and compared against existing classical methods.}},

Abstract = {{We present a jointly optimal selection and scheduling scheme for the
   lossy transmission of frames governed by a dependency relation and a
   delay constraint over a link with limited capacity. A main application
   for this is scalable video streaming. Our objective is to select a
   subset of frames and decide their transmission schedule such that the
   overall video quality at the receiver is maximized. The problem is
   solved for two of the most common classes of dependency structures for
   video encoding, which include as a special case the popular hierarchical
   dyadic structure. We formally characterize the structural properties of
   an optimal transmission schedule in terms of frame dependency. It is
   shown that regardless of the subset of frames selected for transmission,
   any optimal schedule has an equivalent canonical form that is a
   subsequence of a unique universal sequence containing all frames. The
   canonical form can be computed efficiently through the construction of a
   dependency tree. This leads to separable but jointly optimal frame
   selection and scheduling algorithms that have quadratic computational
   complexity in the number of frames. Simulation with video traces
   demonstrates that the optimal scheme can substantially outperform
   existing suboptimal alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, machine-to-machine (M2M) networks have been widely
   considered in wireless communication systems. Machines typically have
   constrained power, and their processing and communication capabilities
   are limited. To avoid the transmission of redundant information in order
   to save the transmission power, compressive sensing (CS) is a promising
   tool to consider. In this paper, under the two-tier architecture, we
   propose a remote CS scheme for the M2M networks with stochastic sources.
   We first formulate a stochastic CS problem and verify that the selected
   power exponential model for the stochastic source is compressible, i.e.,
   satisfies the power law. Then we propose to use the minimum mean square
   error (MMSE) estimator at the gateway to transform the problem into a
   noiseless stochastic CS one where a low-complexity sensing matrix is
   adopted. After that we derive an estimation error upper bound for the
   proposed scheme and prove that it is asymptotically optimal in the MMSE
   sense compared to the one without CS. We then use simulation to show
   that the proposed system is still approximately optimal when the
   observation length is finite.}},

Abstract = {{Containing interference within cellular communication systems requires
   the use of dedicated frequency bands to mitigate interference from other
   wireless systems. Based on this design principle, the Radio Frequency
   (RF) resources of a multi-Radio Access Technology (RAT) cellular system
   are apportioned between co-deployed RATs. However, traffic variations
   within multi-RAT systems result in the suboptimal utilization of RF
   resources under fixed, system-level spectrum allocation policies. On the
   other hand, flexible spectrum allocation policies that permit using the
   same frequency band to deploy different RATs at different locations
   introduce Inter-cell inter-RAT Interference (IRI). The potential impact
   of IRI prevents the use of flexible spectrum management techniques that
   disrupt system-level spectrum allocation in multi-RAT systems. This
   paper studies the effect of IRI on the performance of multi-RAT cellular
   systems employing Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), High
   Speed Packet Access (HSPA) and Long Term Evolution (LTE). Detailed
   system level simulations are performed to measure the impact of
   deploying different RATs at different locations using the same frequency

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the usability of two
   formats of a shortened systematic review for clinicians.
   Materials and methods: Usability of the prototypes was assessed using
   three cycles of iterative testing. 10 participants were asked to
   complete tasks of locating information or items within two prototypes
   and `think aloud' while being audio taped. Interviews were also audio
   recorded and participants completed a systematic usability scale.
   Results: Revisions were made between each iteration in order to address
   issues identified by participants. Finding information relating to the
   number of studies in the meta-analysis, and locating the number of
   studies in the entire systematic review were revealed as areas needing
   attention during the usability evaluation.
   Conclusions: Iterative testing combined with a multifaceted approach to
   usability testing offered essential insight into aspects of the
   prototypes that required modifications. Alterations were made in order
   to create finalised versions of the two shortened systematic review
   formats.}},

   evaluating the impact of removing any v is an element of V on the CNDP
   objective function within reasonable time and space complexity is then
   necessary. In this paper we propose a depth-first search solution to
   this problem that requires O(vertical bar V vertical bar + vertical bar
   E vertical bar) complexity, and employ the method in a greedy algorithm
   for quickly identifying R in large networks. We evaluate the results
   using six real-world benchmark problems. The proposed algorithm can be
   easily extended to vertex and edge-weighted variants of the critical
   vertex detection problem.}},

Abstract = {{Mo oxynitride was developed as pseudocapacitive electrode material for
   supercapacitors. A thin film Mo oxynitride was produced by first
   electrodeposition of Mo oxide on a Ti substrate followed by a
   low-temperature (400 degrees C) heat treatment in N-2 environment. XPS
   analyses showed that the surface of the Mo oxynitride film was composed
   of a mixture of MoO3, MoO2 and less than 20 at.\% Mo2N. However, the
   electrochemical behavior of the Mo oxynitride film was significantly
   different from that of Mo oxide but much similar to the behavior of pure
   Mo2N, a known pseudocapacitive material. The cycle life and stability of
   the Mo oxynitride were much improved over the Mo oxide. A twoelectrode
   symmetric cell using the developed Mo oxynitride electrodes was
   demonstrated and showed high rate performance. An asymmetric cell using
   a Mo oxynitride as negative electrode and a carbon as positive electrode
   was also established and showed an extended voltage window and, thus, an
   increased energy density.}},

   the mobile sensors to provide the required coverage of targets. Finally,
   we conduct an experiment at the University of Toronto campus to show the

Abstract = {{This paper addresses adaptive modulation and power allocation for
   maximizing the practicable sum capacity (sum of the uncoded throughputs
   of the users) of a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO)
   system. Since the optimal solution, dirty paper encoding (DPC), is
   complicated to implement, we use the simpler linear precoding based on
   signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR). For different choices of
   constellation sizes, the maximum practicable sum capacities and their
   corresponding optimal power allocations are obtained via individual
   non-convex optimization. The best constellation sizes for each user are
   then identified through a search for the highest maximized practicable
   sum capacity. Simulations demonstrate the significant performance
   improvement from this approach compared to existing power allocation
   schemes. Finally, a selection procedure between different constellation
   sets is presented to obtain the highest practicable sum capacity while
   maintaining the instantaneous BER of each user below a target value.
   This approach allows management of the trade-off between the capacity
   and error performances.}},

Abstract = {{Obtaining durability for a known service life in chloride exposures
   requires knowledge of the concrete properties, relevant transport
   processes, depth of cover as well as minimization of cracking and
   construction defects. For example, imperfect curing can result in
   depth-dependent effects on resistance to chloride ingress. Several
   service life models with various levels of sophistication exist for
   prediction of time-to-corrosion of concrete structures exposed to
   chlorides. The model inputs have uncertainty associated with them such
   as boundary conditions ( level of saturation and temperature), cover
   depths, diffusion coefficients, time-dependent changes, and rates of
   buildup of chlorides at the surface. The performance test methods used
   to obtain predictive model inputs as well as how models handle these
   properties have a dramatic impact on predicted service lives. Very few
   models deal with the influence of cracks or the fact that concrete in
   the cover zone will almost certainly have a higher diffusion coefficient
   than the bulk concrete as the result of imperfect curing or compaction.
   While many models account for variability in input properties, they will
   never be able to account for extremes in construction defects.
   Therefore, to ensure the reliability of service life predictions and to
   attain a concrete structure that achieves its predicted potential,
   designers, contractors and suppliers need to work together to ensure
   proper detailing, minimize defects, and adopt adequate, yet achievable,
   curing procedures. As well, concrete structures are often exposed to
   other destructive elements in addition to chlorides (eg frost, ASR) and
   this adds another level of complexity since regardless of cause, cracks
   will accelerate the ingress of chlorides. These issues are discussed
   along with the need to use performance-based specifications together
   with predictive models.}},

Abstract = {{Fillers such as limestone filler (LF) can be used to replace the cement
   and thus reduce the cement content in concrete. However, in applications
   where early age strength is critical such as precast and prestressed

   dilution effect. This paper investigates the influence of LF on early
   age hydration and strength of steam cured SCC made with CSA general use
   cement (type GU) and high early strength cement (type HE). The
   reactivity of LF was also evaluated using thermal analysis. Durability
   tests including rapid chloride permeability test (RCPT), freeze thaw and
   salt scaling were conducted on SCC mixtures made with and without LF.
   The results showed improved early age hydration and strength in SCC
   mixtures containing LF compared to SCC mixtures without LF. The chloride
   permeability was lower in SCC mixtures containing LF compared to SCC
   mixtures without LF. The durability performance of SCC mixes made with
   and without LF was similar under freeze thaw and salt scaling cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Interruption of plant operation can be avoided if non destructive
   testing inspections are performed on-line at operating temperatures,
   which may be up to several hundred degrees Celsius in a petrochemical or
   electric power generating plant. However, there are operational
   temperature limits for the phased array transducers and associated
   plastic wedges used for ultrasonic inspections. In this paper, an
   ultrasonic phased array system is described for inspections at elevated
   temperatures of up to 350 degrees C. Wedges are built from plastics
   resistant to high temperature degradation, and equipped with a cooling
   jacket around the array. A model of the ultrasonic beam skew pattern due
   to thermal gradients inside a wedge is developed. The model is used in a
   separate algorithm to calculate transmission and reception time delays
   on individual array elements for generation of plane waves in a hot test
   piece, while compensating for thermal gradient effects inside the wedge.
   The algorithm results for planar wave inspections of test pieces at 150
   degrees C demonstrate that application of conventional element time
   delays can lead to serious phase errors. Experimental trials indicate
   that plane waves can be generated in a hot test piece using the new
   focal law algorithm with appropriate timing delays applied to all active
   array elements.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, porous ceramics are introduced as a backing element
   suitable for high temperature transducers. Acoustic impedance and
   attenuation can be regulated through control of the porosity and pore
   size, using scattering from micropores as the attenuation mechanism.
   Porosity is induced by mixing the ceramic powder with polyethylene
   particles. The polymer component burns during the sintering process and
   leaves behind spherical voids. Porosity and pore size are controlled
   through the polymer-to-ceramic weight ratio and poltyethylene particle
   size, respectively.
   In this manner, a porous mullite material is designed and manufactured
   to act as the binding agent for a gallium phosphate (GaPO4)
   piezocrystal; this yields our goal of a wide-band signal with center
   frequency of 2.8 MHz and operating temperature up to 700 - 800 degrees
   C. The design and fabrication process can be employed in manufacturing
   backing elements for a variety of transducers with specified center

Abstract = {{Discrete flow microfluidic devices have been identified as a technology
   that can be used to efficiently deliver health care services by reducing
   the cycle times and reagent consumption of biological protocols and
   medical diagnostic procedures. These devices also have the potential to
   reduce overhead costs by performing these applications at the point of
   care. Digital microfluidic devices are one promising discrete flow
   microfluidic platform that can individually create, manipulate, and mix
   droplets through the application of asymmetric electric fields. The work
   presented here suggests that (1) monitoring electrical properties of
   droplets during specific chemical reactions and (2) supernatant dilution
   via mechanical filtration can be integrated into digital microfluidic
   immunoassay devices. Measurement of electrical properties during the
   bead based chemical reaction between p-nitrophenyl phosphate and
   particles with bound antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase
   resulted in measureable difference in capacitance and resistance when
   compared to the control particles. A single filtration cycle using the
   mechanical supernatant dilution method demonstrated here reduced the
   fluorescence intensity in particle laden droplet by approximately 80\%.}},

   design problem definitions as input and presents a set of geometries

   capture some of the required input. To evaluate the feasibility of using
   a CNL for problem definitions, we conducted a user study with 18
   participants. We found that using a CNL increases the quality of problem
   definition statements for functional requirements compared to statements
   written in natural language. While a CNL limits the breadth of problem
   definitions, it can achieve a balance between natural expression and
   formal specification of problem definitions.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous networks potentially provide significant capacity gains by
   overlaying the traditional cellular network with a layer of small cells
   (SCs) served by access points (APs). However, the limited backhaul
   capacity of the SC APs, combined with increased interference from
   neighboring cells, necessitates careful resource allocation to realize
   the gains. In our work, we consider maximization of the weighted sum
   rate in small cell networks with carrier aggregation while enforcing a
   backhaul constraint on each SC AP. We propose an efficient,
   waterfilling-like, algorithm which converges to a locally optimal
   solution of the non-convex optimization problem. This algorithm differs
   from existing works by using a computationally efficient bisection-like
   search that ensures the sum-power and sum-rate constraints at each AP
   are satisfied via an one-dimensional search. An added advantage is that
   this approach also allows for a decentralized implementation.}},

   the performance degradation in distributed power control algorithms due

Abstract = {{The joint spectrum partition and user association problem for multi-tier
   heterogeneous networks is studied in this paper, where disjoint
   spectrums are allocated among tiers and users are associated with each
   tier with a biased received power. The random placement of base-stations
   (BSs) of different tiers are modeled using stochastic geometry, which
   accounts for their practical deployment and also makes analysis
   tractable. We derive an upper bound of the average user proportional
   fair utility based on the user coverage rate, from which we formulate a
   network utility maximization problem. The optimization of the proposed
   utility bound shows that the optimal spectrum allocation for each BS
   tier matches the average proportion of users associated with that tier.
   The solution to the optimization problem also provides closed-form
   expressions for the optimal user associated bias factors. Compared to
   system-level optimization solutions based on specific network topology
   and channel realization, our off-line analytical approach offers
   deployment insights. Simulation results demonstrates the effectiveness
   of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of secure broadcasting with independent secret keys is
   studied. The particular scenario is analyzed where a common message has
   to be broadcasted to two legitimate receivers, while keeping an external
   eavesdropper ignorant of it. The transmitter shares independent secret
   keys of arbitrary rates with both legitimate receivers, which can be
   used in different ways: They can be used as one-time pads to encrypt the
   common message or they can be used as randomization resources for
   wiretap coding. Both approaches are studied in this paper. If both
   legitimate channels are degraded versions of the eavesdropper channel,
   it is shown that the one-time pad approach is optimal for several cases
   yielding corresponding capacity expressions. Reversely, the wiretap
   coding approach is shown to be optimal if the eavesdropper channel is
   degraded with respect to both legitimate channels establishing capacity
   in this case as well.}},

Abstract = {{Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common respiratory disorder among
   adults. Recently we have shown that sedentary lifestyle causes an
   increase in diurnal leg fluid volume (LFV), which can shift into the
   neck at night when lying down to sleep and increase OSA severity. The
   purpose of this work was to investigate various metrics that represent
   baseline fluid retention in the legs and examine their correlation with
   neck fluid volume (NFV) and to develop a robust model for predicting
   fluid accumulation in the neck.
   In 13 healthy awake non-obese men, LFV and NFV were recorded
   continuously and simultaneously while standing for 5 minutes and then
   lying supine for 90 minutes. Simple regression was used to examine
   correlations between baseline LFV, baseline neck circumference (NC) and
   change in LFV with the outcome variables: change in NC (Delta NC) and in
   NFV (Delta NFV90) after lying supine for 90 minutes. An exhaustive grid
   search was implemented to find combinations of input variables which
   best modeled outcomes. We found strong positive correlations between
   baseline LFV (supine and standing) and Delta NFV90. Models developed for
   predicting Delta NFV90 included baseline standing LFV, baseline NC
   combined with change in LFV after lying supine for 90 minutes. These
   correlations and the developed models suggest that a greater baseline
   LFV might contribute to increased fluid accumulation in the neck. These
   results give more evidence that sedentary lifestyle might play a role in
   the pathogenesis of OSA by increasing the baseline LFV. The best models
   for predicting Delta NC include baseline LFV and NC; they improved
   accuracies of estimating Delta NC over individual predictors, suggesting
   that a combination of baseline fluid metrics is a good predictor of the
   change in NC while lying supine. Future work is aimed at adding
   additional baseline demographic features to improve model accuracy and
   eventually use it as a screening tool to predict severity of OSA prior
   to sleep.}},

Abstract = {{With a globally aging population, the burden of care of cognitively
   impaired older adults is becoming increasingly concerning. Instances of
   Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia are becoming ever more
   frequent. Earlier detection of cognitive impairment offers significant
   benefits, but remains difficult to do in practice. In this paper, we
   develop statistical models of the behavior of older adults within their
   homes using sensor data in order to detect the early onset of cognitive
   decline. Specifically, we use inhomogenous Poisson processes to model
   the presence of subjects within different rooms throughout the day in
   the home using unobtrusive sensing technologies. We compare the
   distributions learned from cognitively intact and impaired subjects
   using information theoretic tools and observe statistical differences
   between the two populations which we believe can be used to help detect
   the onset of cognitive decline.}},

Abstract = {{Radiation dose of X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) imaging has raised a
   worldwide health concern. Therefore, low-dose CT imaging has been of a
   huge interest in the last decade. However, lowering the radiation dose
   degrades the image quality by increasing the noise level, which may
   reduce the diagnostic performance of the images. As a result, image
   denoising is one of the fundamental tasks in low-dose CT imaging. One of
   the state of art denoising methods, which has been successfully used in
   this area, is Total Variation (TV) denoising. Nevertheless, if the
   parameters of the TV denoising are not optimally adjusted or the
   algorithm is not stopped in an appropriate point, some of the small
   structures will be removed by this method. Here, we provide a solution
   to this problem by proposing a modified nonlocal TV method, called
   probabilistic NLTV (PNLTV). Denoising performance of PNLTV is improved
   by using better weights and an appropriate stopping criterion based on
   statistics of image wavelet coefficients. Non-locality allows the
   algorithm to preserve the image texture, which combined with the
   proposed stopping criterion enables PNLTV to keep fine details
   unchanged.}},

Abstract = {{Due to recent technical advancements of three-dimensional ultrasound
   imaging systems, applications of this imaging modality have been
   expanding from the fetal imaging to cardiac- and abdominal-diagnosis.
   Among all internal organs, diagnosing the kidney has a paramount
   importance for rapid bedside treatment of trauma and kidney stone
   patients using ultrasound images. Although three-dimensional ultrasound
   provides higher level of structural information of kidneys, manual
   kidney diagnosis using three-dimensional ultrasound images requires a
   highly trained medical staff, due to the extensive visual complexity
   which three-dimensional images contain. Therefore, computer aided
   automated kidney diagnosis becomes very essential. Due to the
   challenging problems of ultrasound images, such as speckle noise and
   inhomogeneous intensity profile, kidney segmentation in
   three-dimensional ultrasound images has not been sufficiently
   investigated by researchers. In this paper, we first propose a new
   automated kidney detection approach using three-dimensional Morison's
   pouch ultrasound images. Then, we proposed a shape-based method to
   segment the detected kidneys. A preprocessing step is utilized to
   overcome the ultrasound challenges. Based on a set of 14 ultrasound
   volumes, we have evaluated the detection rate of our proposed kidney
   detection approach which is 92.86\%. For kidney segmentation, we
   compared our proposed method with an existing approach, and the
   performed statistical analysis strongly validates the superiority of our
   proposed method with p = 0.000032.}},

Abstract = {{We have applied wavelet bicoherence (BIC) analysis to human iEEG data to
   characterize non-linear frequency interactions in the human epileptic
   brain. Bicoherence changes were most prominent in the gamma (30-80 Hz)
   frequency band, and allowed for the differentiation between seizure and
   non-seizure states in all patients studied (n = 3). While gamma band BIC
   values increased during seizure activity, this trend was only observed
   in a select number of electrode(s) located on the implanted patient
   subdural grids. Several studies have suggested that fast frequencies may
   play a role in the process of seizure genesis. While the small patient
   numbers limit the significance of our study, our results highlight the
   bicoherence of the gamma frequency band (30-80 Hz) as an ictal
   identifier, and suggest an active role of this fast frequency during

Abstract = {{Mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl CpG-binding protein 2
   (MeCP2) have been linked to a neurodevelopmental disorder known as Rett
   syndrome. The disorder is associated with a number of symptoms, of which
   epileptic seizures are common. In this study we examined the presence of
   high frequency oscillations (HFOs) and their interactions with low
   frequency oscillations (LFOs) during epileptiform-like discharges using
   intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings from male and female
   Mecp2-deficient mice. The study compared differences in mean HFO power
   levels normalized to baseline along with LFO-HFO modulation observed in
   short and long duration discharges. Short duration discharges, common to
   both male and female Mecp2-deficient mice, showed a decrease in mean HFO
   power levels compared to baseline levels. During the short duration
   discharges the theta (7-9 Hz) LFOs were found to modulate fast ripple
   (350-500 Hz) HFOs predominantly in the female Mecp2-deficient mice. Long
   duration discharges, predominantly observed in male Mecp2-deficient
   mice, were found to have elevated mean power levels in the ripple
   (80-200 Hz) and fast ripple (350-500 Hz) frequency ranges when compared
   to baseline. During the long duration discharges a lower frequency range
   theta LFO (4-6 Hz) modulated both the ripple (80-200 Hz) and fast ripple
   (350-500 Hz) HFOs. These findings suggest that the long duration
   discharges observed in male Mecp2-deficient mice share biomarkers
   indicative of seizure-like activity.}},

Abstract = {{While originally astrocytes have been thought to only act as support to
   neurons, recent studies have implicated them in multiple active roles,
   including the ability to moderate or alter neuronal firing patterns and
   to possibly be involved in both the prevention and propagation of
   epileptic seizures. In this study we propose a new model to incorporate
   pyramidal cells and interneurons (a common neural circuit in CA3
   hippocampal slices) as well as a model of astrocyte. As both potassium
   and calcium ions have been shown to potentially affect neuronal
   hyperexcitability, the astrocytic model has both mechanisms - the
   clearance of potassium through potassium channels (such as K-IR, K-DR
   and sodium-potassium pump), and the influence of astrocyte in the
   synapse (forming the tripartite synapse with calcium-glutamate
   interactions). Preliminary findings of the model results show that when
   potassium conductances in the astrocyte are decreased, it results in the
   accumulation of extracellular potassium, leading to both spontaneous
   discharges and depolarization block, while the alteration of normal
   calcium response in the astrocyte can lead to just hyperexcitable
   conditions without the depolarization block.}},

   an active market participant that buys and sells power at wholesale
   prices or a passive entity like a transmission line. In the latter case,
   new market mechanisms must be developed to integrate storage into
   electricity markets. In this paper, we define financial rights for
   energy storage. As with financial transmission rights, risk-averse
   market participants can acquire the storage rights to hedge against
   nodal price volatility resulting from storage congestion. We demonstrate
   that the rights specify how a system operator can redistribute budget
   surpluses resulting from storage congestion, as flowgate rights do for
   transmission congestion. We also derive a tracing rule that enables
   power flows through transmission lines and storage to be decomposed into
   present and past nodal contributions.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have emphasized the role of social media in public
   involvement during planning, construction, and operation of
   infrastructure. Social media can offer optimal, bidirectional
   communication with the public and an efficient flow of information and
   feedback between decision makers and project end users. However, the
   underlying social networks formed in the background of public relations
   processes on online social media largely have been neglected. Such
   networks are referred to as infrastructure discussion networks (IDN) and
   can be rich sources of information for decision makers. If it can be
   proved that these networks follow the general behavior of social
   networks, then rich tools developed in social network analysis can be
   used to profile users and help decision makers study user attitudes.
   This paper compares the IDNs of four light rail transit projects in
   various cities in the United States and Canada and studies them under
   the microscope of social network analysis. The study shows that IDNs
   exhibit the general structure of social networks (such as small-world
   behavior, scale-free degree distribution, and high clustering). The IDNs
   also include meaningful communities, detection and evaluation of which
   could lead to more efficient offline and online public involvement
   processes. Given the recent trends in presence of infrastructure
   projects on online social media, the methods presented in this paper can
   be readily applied by practitioners to improve their public engagement
   practices.}},

   Case Study of Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, Canada}},

Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{92-100}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents an investigation of park-and-ride access station
   choices of cross-regional commuters in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton
   area (GTHA). Data from a household travel survey conducted in 2006 in
   the GTHA were used for this empirical investigation. The household
   travel survey data were supplemented by data from transit service
   operators on park-and-ride station locations, parking lot capacities,
   parking costs, surrounding land use, and station amenities. Three groups
   of park-and-ride users were defined: (a) individuals for whom only local
   transit Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) subway stations were within
   reasonable reach, (b) individuals for whom only regional transit (GO
   Train) stations were within reach, and (c) individuals for whom both GO
   Train and TTC subway stations were within reach. Different model
   structures and specifications were tested, and three discrete choice
   models were estimated. Empirical models revealed that access distance
   and the relative station direction (toward the workplace) were the
   primary factors that affected transit station choice for park-and-ride
   options. However, for station distance and relative station direction,
   commuters were more sensitive to changes in station access distance than
   to changes in the relative station direction from their households. In
   addition, the empirical models revealed that local transit park-and-ride
   users were less sensitive to access distance than were regional transit
   park-and-ride users. The results of this investigation could be useful
   in future transit station design projects to attract more commuters to
   use park-and-ride facilities.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper is based on a term project for final year
   undergraduate students, requiring them to evaluate a process for
   producing silicon from rice husk. The traditional method for production
   of silicon involves carbothermal reduction of quartz in electric arc
   furnaces at temperatures exceeding 2000 degrees C. The technology
   consumes a considerable amount of electrical energy as well as fossil
   fuels, resulting in significant CO2 emissions. A flowsheet for
   production of silicon metal from rice husk is laid out in this paper.
   The technology will consist of combustors, which will generate steam
   using the rice husk biomass, power generator, and electric furnace for
   reduction of the rice husk. Materials and energy balance calculations
   presented here indicate that such process can be operated independent of
   external electricity.}},

   accurate affect estimation. A robot can then utilize this information in
   order to determine its own appropriate responsive behaviors to keep
   people engaged in this crucial activity. One-on-one assistive meal-time
   experiments were conducted with the robot Brian 2.1 and elderly
   participants at a long-term care facility. The results showed the
   potential of utilizing the automated affect recognition and
   classification system to identify and classify natural affective body

Abstract = {{We consider routing between large collections of interconnected
   networks, referred to as substrate networks, which do not assume
   permanent connectivity to the Internet, and which support dynamic
   changes of connectivity due to mobility. Whereas scalable routing
   schemes, such as compact routing or greedy forwarding, are suitable for
   very large networks, they generally ignore the routing methods already
   available in the substrate networks. In this paper, we present a routing
   scheme, referred to as Landmark domains routing (LDR), which maximally
   exploits available routing in the substrate networks, and establishes
   paths between connected regions of substrate networks. We analyze the
   scheme by numerical analysis and simulation, and compare its performance
   with compact and greedy routing methods. We demonstrate that leveraging
   existing routing can lead to a significant reduction in the required
   routing state information, while providing paths that are, on average,
   close to the lengths of shortest paths.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the electrochemical performance of Multi-walled Carbon
   nanotubes (MWCNT) and polyaniline (PANI) composite (PANI/MWCNT) as
   supercapacitor electrode material was investigated. An improvement in
   capacitive performance due to the combination of pseudo capacitance and
   double layer capacitance was observed. A nano-composite was fabricated
   by polymerizing pseudo-capacitive polyaniline onto the MWCNT surface
   through the in-situ chemical polymerization approach. Ammonium
   persulphate (APS) was used as oxidant to polymerize PANI and HCl was
   used as dopant. Stainless steel thin foil was used as a current
   collector as well as a flexible back bone. Graphite conductive ink as
   binder was used to form a conductive paste. Different composition is
   varied by varying the PANI concentration from 0.1M, 0.3M, and 0.5M to 1M
   molar concentration. For material characterization, Scanning Electron
   Microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize surface morphology of the
   composite. Cyclic Voltammetry and Electrochemical Impedance Spectrometry
   in three electrodes set up found that 0.1M PANI/MWCNT yields the best
   electrochemical performance. Two electrodes setup evaluation on 0.1M
   PANI/MWCNT reviews promising characteristic suitable for device
   application. The improved electroactivity of the PANI/MWCNT composite is
   discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{The main focus of this study is the optimization of a trilayer actuator
   comprising two layers of polypyrrole and a PVDF membrane core. Since the
   performance of these actuators is difficult to predict due to their
   mechanical and chemical properties, optimizing their output behavior
   such as the tip displacement and blocking force is of crucial importance
   for utilizing their full potentials and more significantly increasing
   predictability in their performance. For this purpose, two optimization
   techniques (multiobjective genetic algorithm and active set algorithm)
   have been carried out based on a developed mathematical model. Two
   nonlinear constrained equations representing the tip displacement and
   the blocking force are formulated and solved for a predetermined
   thickness of the PVDF core membrane. Both equations are subjected to a
   bound constraint and a nonlinear equality constraint. The output
   blocking force and the tip deformation act in a reverse manner and there
   is a trade-off between them. Accordingly, the results imply that there
   is no single solution to the problem and a range for each of the design
   variables should be determined so that there will be a sense of balance
   between the two objectives. Furthermore, the results obtained from the
   multiobjective optimization methodology have been verified
   experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we perform stability analysis of a quasi-ring optical
   network, the simplest configuration in which channel power excursions
   can self-propagate indefinitely. The quasi-ring is a network composed of
   two reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADMs) each equipped
   with a constant gain optical amplifier and a wavelength selective
   switch. Over the amplified spans, two sets of lightpaths (added/dropped
   by opposite ROADMs) are transmitted in mirror image of each other and
   form an overlapping ring.
   Using Lyapunov analysis and the small gain theorem, we derive sufficient
   stability conditions for the quasi-ring as well as an L-2 bound for the
   channel power excursions. These are functions of the amplifier gain
   coupling quantified by its Lipschitz constant. Numerical results that
   verify and compare the theoretical L-2 excursion bounds are provided. To
   accomplish this, we use Bell Lab's A Transparent Optical Mesh (ATOM)
   simulator to set up dynamic network loading and input channel
   disturbance scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Computer vision is embedded in toilets, urinals, handwash faucets (e.g.
   Delta Faucet's 128 or 1024 pixel linear arrays), doors, lightswitches,
   thermostats, and many other objects that ``watch{''} us. Camera-based
   motion sensing streetlights are installed throughout entire cities,
   making embedded vision ubiquitous. Technological advancement is leading
   to increased sensory and computational performance combined with
   miniaturization that is making vision sensors less visible. In that
   sense, computer vision is ``seeing{''} better while it is becoming
   harder for us to see it. I will introduce and describe the concept of a
   ``sight-field{''}, a time-reversed lightfield that can be visualized
   with time-exposure photography, to make vision (i.e. the capacity to
   see) visible. In particular, I will describe a special wand that changes
   color when it is being observed. The wand has an array of light sources
   that each change color when being watched. The intensity of each light
   source increases in proportion to the degree to which it is observed.
   The wand is a surveillometer/sousveillometer array sensing, measuring,
   and making visible sur/sousveillance. Moving the wand through space,
   while tracking its exact 3D position in space, makes visible the
   otherwise invisible ``rays of sight{''} that emenate from cameras. This
   capacity to sense, measure, and visualize vision, is useful in
   liability, insurance, safety, and risk assessment, as well as
   privacy/priveillance assessment, criminology, urban planning, design,
   and (sur/sous)veillance studies.}},

Abstract = {{Harvesting ambient wasted energy has been in recent years a prominent
   research endeavor, aimed at providing alternative energy sources for
   low-power electronic mobile devices. Among various solutions,
   piezoelectric energy harvesters have attracted major attention due to
   the scalability, high-efficiency and the universal presence of vibration
   sources. In this paper, we studied the charge redistribution phenomenon
   in piezoelectric energy harvesters employing flextensional structures
   numerically and experimentally. A finite element model was developed
   firstly to study the mechanical and electrical response of flextensional
   transducers. The simulation results were then validated by a
   corresponding experiment. The research reveals that energy is dissipated
   in the process that charge flows from the high potential region to the
   low potential region. The electrode shape has a significant effect on
   the efficiency, and therefore should be considered fully when designing
   new energy harvesters. This study also assists in the design of
   flextensional sensors and actuators.}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares two distinct downlink multicell interference
   mitigation techniques for wireless cellular networks: large-scale (LS)
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and network MIMO. The considered
   cellular network operates in a time-division duplex (TDD) fashion and
   includes non-overlapping cooperating clusters, where each cluster
   comprises B base-stations (BSs), each equipped with multiple antennas,
   and schedules multiple single-antenna users. In the LS-MIMO system, each
   BS is equipped with BM antennas, serving its K scheduled users using
   zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming, while sacrificing its excess number of
   spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) using interference coordination to
   prevent causing interference to the other K (B - 1) users within the
   cooperating cluster. In the network MIMO system, although each BS is
   equipped with M antennas, the intra-cluster interference cancellation is
   enabled by data and channel state information sharing across the
   cooperating BSs and joint downlink transmission to BK users via ZF
   beamforming. Accounting for uplink-downlink channel reciprocity provided
   by TDD and invoking the orthogonality principle of ZF beamforming,
   respectively, the channel acquisition overhead in each cluster and the
   number of spatial DoF per user are identical in both systems. Therefore,
   it is not obvious whether one system is superior to the other from the
   performance point of view. Building upon the channel distribution
   functions in the two systems and adopting tools from stochastic orders,
   this paper shows that in fact an LS-MIMO system provides considerably
   better performance than a network MIMO system. Thus, given the likely
   lower cost of adding excess number of antennas, LS-MIMO could be a
   preferred multicell coordination approach for interference mitigation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the joint beamforming and clustering design problem
   in a downlink network multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) setup, where
   the base-stations (BSs) are connected to a central processor with
   rate-limited backhaul links. We formulate the problem as that of
   devising a sparse beamforming vector across the BSs for each user, where
   the nonzero beamforming entries correspond to that user's serving BSs.
   Differing from the previous works, this paper explicitly formulates the
   per-BS backhaul constraints in the network utility maximization
   framework. In contrast to the traditional utility maximization problem
   with transmit power constraint only, the additional backhaul constraints
   result in a discrete l(0)-norm formulation, which makes the problem more
   challenging. Motivated by the compressive sensing literature, we propose
   to iteratively approximate the per-BS backhaul constraints using a
   reweighted l(1)-norm technique and reformulate the backhaul constraints
   as weighted per-BS power constraints. This allows us to solve the
   weighted sum rate maximization problem through a generalized weighted
   minimum mean square error (WMMSE) approach. To reduce the computational
   complexity of the proposed algorithm within each iteration, we propose
   two additional techniques, iterative link removal and iterative user
   pool shrinking, which dynamically decrease the potential BS cluster size
   and user scheduling pool. Numerical results show that the proposed
   algorithm can significantly improve the system throughput as compared to
   the naive BS clustering strategy based on the channel strength.}},

Abstract = {{In order for the large-scale realization of vehicular networks to be
   feasible, the problem of congestion control must be addressed to ensure
   the reliability of safety applications. The latter rely on single-hop
   broadcasts of safety packets in the control channel to acquire
   up-to-date knowledge of the local neighbourhood. However, high
   transmission ranges of onboard radios and the highly dynamic mobility of
   vehicles may result in fast-forming pockets of high node density in the
   network. Subsequently, the excessive load caused by safety packets
   broadcasts may degrade the network performance and subsequently reduce
   the level safety provided by applications. Existing congestion control
   schemes in the literature aim to reach a fair rationing of available
   channel resources throughout the network. However, a particular vehicle,
   depending on its distance and relative velocity with respect to its
   neighbours may require less or more network resources than another
   vehicle to achieve the same level of safety benefit.
   We examine the problem of adapting the probability of transmission of
   each node under a slotted p-persistent vehicular broadcast medium access
   control (MAC) scheme. A network utility maximization (NUM) problem is
   formulated, in which utility incorporates both the expected delay and a
   notion of safety benefit. A distributed algorithm is proposed to solve
   this problem in a decentralized manner and its performance is studied
   through simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an algorithm to compute the uplink transmit
   beamformers for linear interference alignment in MIMO cellular networks
   without symbol extensions. In particular, we consider interference
   alignment in a network consisting of G cells and K users/cell, having N
   and M antennas at each base station (BS) and user respectively. Using an
   alternate interpretation of the conditions for interference alignment,
   we frame the problem of finding aligned transmit beamformers in the
   uplink as an optimization problem to minimize the rank of a set of
   interference matrices subject to affine constraints. The interference
   matrix of a BS consists of all the interfering vectors at that BS. The
   proposed algorithm approximates rank using the weighted Frobenius norm
   and iteratively updates the weights so that the weighted Frobenius norm
   is a close approximation of the rank of the interference matrix. A
   crucial aspect of this algorithm is the weight update rule that guides
   the algorithm towards aligned beamformers. We propose a novel weight
   update rule that discourages the algorithm from converging to local
   minima that do not generate the requisite number of interference free
   dimensions. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient since it
   only requires solving a simple quadratic program in each iteration.
   Simulation results indicate much faster convergence to aligned
   beamformers when compared to algorithms of similar complexity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a linear beamforming strategy for interference
   alignment in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cellular networks. In
   particular, we consider a network consisting of G mutually interfering
   cells with K users/cell, having N antennas at each base station (BS) and
   M antennas at each user - a (G, K, M, N) network. We develop an
   unstructured approach to designing linear beamformers for interference
   alignment where transmit beamformers are designed to satisfy conditions
   for interference alignment without explicitly identifying the underlying
   structures for alignment. Specifically, the transmit beamformers in the
   uplink are required to satisfy a certain number of random linear vector
   equations in order to constrain the number of dimensions occupied by
   interference at each BS. The conceptual simplicity and the fact that no
   customization to a given network is needed makes this method applicable
   to a broad class of cellular networks. The key observation made in this
   paper is that such an approach appears to be capable of achieving the
   optimal DoF for MIMO cellular networks in regimes where linear
   beamforming dominates asymptotic decomposition-based schemes for
   interference alignment, and a significant portion of the DoF elsewhere.
   Remarkably, polynomial identity test plays a key role in identifying the
   scope and limitations of such a technique.}},

Abstract = {{The capability of mesoporous activated carbons (MACs) to adsorb Cr (VI)

   adsorption kinetic data was found to fit well with a pseudo-second-order
   rate equation. Three adsorption isotherm models were used to analyse the
   equilibrium data. Removal of Cr (VI) increased with an increase in
   mesoporosity of MACs, highlighting the importance of mesoporosity in
   enhancing adsorption efficiency. The major surface oxygen groups were
   carboxylic, lactonic and hydroxyl. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   analysis was employed to investigate the sorption mechanism. It was
   revealed that a portion of Cr (VI) was adsorbed via electrostatic

Abstract = {{We have studied the effects of incorporating phosphorescent sensitizers
   into fluorescent organic-light emitting diode (OLED) devices. In the
   emissive layer of this system, the host material is co-doped at low
   concentrations with both a phosphorescent and a fluorescent dye. The
   purpose of the phosphorescent dopant is to capture both singlet and
   triplet excitons from the host material and to transfer them into the
   singlet state of the fluorescent dye. Ideally, recombination of excitons
   and the emission of light would occur solely on the fluorescent dye.
   This sensitized fluorescent system can potentially achieve 100\%
   internal quantum efficiency as both triplet and singlet states are being
   harvested. We have observed an almost two-fold improvement in the
   quantum efficiency of a sensitized fluorescent system, utilizing rubrene
   as the fluorescent dye and Ir(ppy)(2)(acac) as the sensitizer, versus a
   standard rubrene-based host-guest system. By testing various dopant

Abstract = {{This paper reviews critical water hammer parameters as they are
   presented in official hydropower standards and guidelines. A particular
   emphasize is given to a number of IEC standards and guidelines that are
   used worldwide. The paper critically assesses water hammer control
   strategies including operational scenarios (closing and opening laws),
   surge control devices (surge tank, pressure regulating valve, flywheel,
   etc.), redesign of the water conveyance system components (tunnel,
   penstock), or limitation of operating conditions (limited operating
   range) that are variably covered in standards and guidelines. Little
   information is given on industrial water hammer models and solutions
   elsewhere. These are briefly introduced and discussed in the light of
   capability (simple versus complex systems), availability of expertise
   (in house and/or commercial) and uncertainty. The paper concludes with
   an interesting water hammer case study referencing the rules and
   recommendations from existing hydropower standards and guidelines in a
   view of effective water hammer control. Recommendations are given for
   further work on development of a special guideline on water hammer
   (hydraulic transients) in hydropower plants.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a tri-mode non-inverting buck-boost DC-DC converter
   with segmented power devices, power transmission gate structure and
   dead-time control to improve the power conversion efficiency and the
   overall size. The proposed DC-DC converter accepts an input voltage,
   V-in from 2.7V to 5V and produces an output, V-out ranging from 1V to
   6V. A peak power conversion efficiency of 94\% is observed from the
   simulation result. It is designed to operate in buck, boost or
   buck-boost mode while maintaining peak efficiency. Unlike existing
   switch-mode power supplies, a power transmission gate is used as the
   high-side driver to eliminate external components such as the bootstrap
   circuit. This would save a significant amount of PCB space at the
   expense of only 18\% silicon area overhead. The proposed IC is designed
   using Dongbu HiTek's 0.18 mu m UVCMOS technology.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an integrated EDMOS H-bridge that incorporates both
   segmented output transistors and segmented gate drivers is presented.
   This fully segmented design approach allows the output resistance of the
   H-bridge and the output resistance of the gate drivers to be dynamically
   adjusted. Dynamic adjustment of these parameters allows for the
   continuous optimization of the power conversion efficiency of the
   H-bridge over a wide range of output currents. The IC chip is fabricated
   using TSMC's 0.18 mu m BCD Gen-2 process technology. The H-bridge is
   operated with a 10 V input, 2 V output and a load current between 0.02 A
   and 4 A. The presented design achieves power conversion efficiency
   improvements of 32\% and 8\% at light load current and heavy load
   current, respectively, when compared to traditional fixed power
   transistor designs. Furthermore, the dynamically adjustable output
   resistance of the gate drivers allows for suppression of switching node
   ringing and conducted EMI (CEMI) by 5.5 dB with no a significant
   reduction in efficiency.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Pages = {{1176-1189}},
Abstract = {{Engineering practice, which is the ongoing application of engineering
   knowledge and skills in the professional context, is an important part
   of engineering education. Undergraduate students should demonstrate
   potential for using professional engineering skills and knowledge in
   their work after graduation. However, there is no tool to help
   instructors describe or measure the learning associated with engineering
   practice. This paper reviews the literature in the field of professional
   practice and suggests a new taxonomy of learning outcomes for this area,
   inspired by Miller's Pyramid from the medical education literature,
   supporting the use of learning outcomes for engineering practice in
   undergraduate education. The professional knowledge literature was
   reviewed to help describe engineering practice, and delineate it from
   other cognitive skills in engineering. The literature on learning
   taxonomies provides an understanding of existing tools, and demonstrates
   a gap in describing the learning associated with engineering practice.
   Finally, the proposed taxonomy was applied to two engineering courses,
   to better describe the taxonomy in context. Future research will
   specifically consider how the practice taxonomy can inform teaching and
   assessment practices. The engineering curriculum should be designed to
   provide the student with increasingly authentic experiences in which to
   practice these skills.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a thermal sensing and VLSI thermal management scheme
   using an array of on-chip all-digital delay-line based temperature
   sensors. A fully digital self-calibration method that removes the
   temperature sensors' sensitivities to supply voltage and process
   variations is proposed. The proposed calibration method assigns a unique
   correction factor, N-C to each sensor, making all the sensors'
   calibrated outputs to be the same at start-up. The correction factor is
   updated when supply voltage variations are detected. Only one
   calibration block is required to calibrate multiple delay-line based
   temperature sensors sequentially. For each additional sensor, only
   additional registers for storing N-C are required. The proposed
   self-calibrated temperature sensors are demonstrated on an Altera
   Cyclone IV FPGA based VLSI thermal management system. Runtime thermal
   profiles for four cores mapped on the Cyclone IV FPGA chip using a
   hybrid dynamic thermal management (DTM) method are obtained. The
   percentage of time that each core spent in a particular temperature
   range is plotted in a histogram. A comparison of different DTM
   techniques demonstrates that the proposed hybrid DTM reduces the amount
   of time that the MPSoC spent at higher temperatures and larger thermal
   gradients, by 10 \% and 21 \%, respectively. In addition, the proposed
   hybrid DTM offers a 10 \% improvement in the average processing rate
   (instructions per second) when compared with the conventional global DFS
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Utilizing strings of cascaded sub modules for multilevel dc/ac
   conversion has become well known due to the widespread popularity of the

   these sub module strings can be adapted to achieve single-stage dc/dc
   conversion. Although the modular string configurations for dc/ac versus
   dc/dc conversion are similar, the underlying power transfer mechanisms
   employed by each are significantly different. This paper compares the
   dc/ac and dc/dc energy conversion processes for series-cascaded sub
   modules and highlights their key similarities and differences. Converter
   operation and control requirements for dc/ac versus dc/dc conversion are

Abstract = {{Introduction: It is well established that individuals exposed to alcohol
   in utero have reduced cortical grey matter volumes. However, the
   candidate determinants of these reductions, cortical thickness (CT) and
   surface area (SA), have not been investigated exclusively in
   alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), the most prevalent
   fetal alcohol spectrum disorder subgroup that lacks the characteristic
   facial dysmorphology. Methods: T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
   scans were obtained from 88 participants (8-16 years), 36 diagnosed with
   ARND and 52 typically developing controls. Scans were submitted to the
   CIVET pipeline (version 1.1.10). Deformable models were used to
   construct the inner white matter surfaces and pial surfaces from which
   CT and SA measures were derived. Group differences in cortical volume,
   CT, and SA were computed using a general linear model covaried for age,
   sex, and handedness. Results: Global cortical volume reductions in ARND
   did not reflect CT, which did not differ between groups. Instead, volume
   decreases were consistent with global SA reductions in bilateral frontal
   and temporal as well as right occipital regions. Local reductions in SA
   were observed in the right superior temporal gyrus and the right
   occipital-temporal region. Conclusion: Results suggest that in ARND,
   prenatal alcohol exposure perturbs global SA to a greater degree than
   CT, particularly in the right temporal lobe.}},

Abstract = {{With year after year of record ridership and demand only expected to
   grow, transit infrastructure is under increasing pressure. Examining the
   impact of the scheduling and coordination of subway lines at interchange
   stations is critical to reduce crowd congestion at station facilities.
   There is, however, a gap in knowledge concerning how crowd congestion is
   affected by the arrival patterns of trains. The effects of arrival
   patterns are especially critical at interchange stations where several
   train lines converge. A simulation-based analysis was performed to fill
   this knowledge gap. Field data were collected at the Bloor-Yonge Toronto
   Transit Commission subway station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, a station
   known to be operating at capacity during peak periods. For performance
   of the analysis, a model of the station was developed, calibrated, and
   validated in the pedestrian simulator MassMotion. The congestion
   duration that passengers experienced was examined by varying the
   passenger volume and the arrival pattern of the two independent train
   lines. Adjusting the train arrival pattern was found to cause as much as
   a 63\% reduction in the congestion passengers experienced. Additional
   scenarios were proposed as improvements over the status quo and tested
   for their significance in regard to improvement in congestion time
   experienced.}},

Abstract = {{GPUs offer an order of magnitude higher compute power and memory
   bandwidth than CPUs. GPUs therefore might appear to be well suited to
   accelerate computations that operate on voluminous data sets in
   independent ways; e.g., for transformations, filtering, aggregation,
   partitioning or other ``Big Data{''} style processing. Yet experience
   indicates that it is difficult, and often error-prone, to write GPGPU
   programs which efficiently process data that does not fit in GPU memory,
   partly because of the intricacies of GPU hardware architecture and
   programming models, and partly because of the limited bandwidth
   available between GPUs and CPUs.
   In this paper, we propose BigKernel, a scheme that provides
   pseudo-virtual memory to GPU applications and is implemented using a
   4-stage pipeline with automated prefetching to (i) optimize CPU-GPU
   communication and (ii) optimize GPU memory accesses. BigKernel
   simplifies the programming model by allowing programmers to write
   kernels using arbitrarily large data structures that can be partitioned
   into segments where each segment is operated on independently; these
   kernels are transformed into BigKernel using straight-forward compiler
   transformations.
   Our evaluation on six data-intensive benchmarks shows that BigKernel
   achieves an average speedup of 1.7 over state-of-the-art
   double-buffering techniques and an average speedup of 3.0 over
   corresponding multi-threaded CPU implementations.}},

Abstract = {{Introducing glass fibre to polyurethane foams increases the foam
   stiffness without raising the isocyanate content. This allows glass
   fibre reinforced polyurethane foams to be used in structural
   applications. Glass fibre reinforced polyurethane foams can be
   manufactured on a large scale using a chopper gun spray system. The
   glass fibre is commonly supplied as a roving (long strands of fibre
   wound into a spool) and the chopper gun breaks the roving into equal
   length pieces, which delivers a stream of glass fibre at a constant mass
   flow rate. Residual natural fibre is cost-effective, abundant and
   renewable making it an ideal candidate to replace non-renewable glass
   fibre in reinforcing polyurethane foam. However, residual natural fibre
   are often supplied as loose tufts and require multiple steps to be made
   into roving. In this study a novel concept was developed that can meter
   natural fibre at a constant mass flow rate. The concept has the
   potential for developing natural fibre reinforced polyurethane foams on
   a large scale, with uniform fibre dispersion and high fibre volume

Abstract = {{Many studies have shown that on-road vehicle emissions are the dominant
   source of ultrafine particles (UFPs; diameter < 100 nm) in urban areas
   and near-roadway environments. In order to advance our knowledge on the
   complex interactions and competition among atmospheric dilution,
   dispersion, and dynamics of UFPs, an aerosol dynamics computational
   fluid dynamics (CFD) coupled model is developed and validated against
   field measurements. A unique approach of applying periodic boundary
   conditions is proposed to model pollutant dispersion and dynamics in one
   unified domain from the tailpipe level to the ambient near-road
   environment. This approach significantly reduces the size of the
   computational domain, and therefore allows fast simulation of multiple
   scenarios. The model is validated against measured turbulent kinetic
   energy (TKE) and horizontal gradient of pollution concentrations
   perpendicular to a major highway. Through a model sensitivity analysis,
   the relative importance of individual aerosol dynamical processes on the
   total particle number concentration (N) and particle number size
   distribution (PSD) near a highway is investigated. The results
   demonstrate that (1) coagulation has a negligible effect on N and
   particle growth, (2) binary homogeneous nucleation (BHN) of H2SO4 H2O is
   likely responsible for elevated N closest to the road, and (3) N and
   particle growth are very sensitive to the condensation of semi-volatile
   organics (SVOCs), particle dry deposition, and the interaction between
   these processes. The results also indicate that, without the proper
   treatment of the atmospheric boundary layer (i.e., its wind profile and
   turbulence quantities), the nucleation rate would be underestimated by a
   factor of 5 in the vehicle wake region due to overestimated dilution.
   Therefore, introducing atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) conditions to
   activity-based emission models may potentially improve their performance
   in estimating UFP traffic emissions.}},

Title = {{Novel methods for predicting gas-particle partitioning during the

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{13189-13204}},
Abstract = {{Several methods have been presented in the literature to predict an
   organic chemical's equilibrium partitioning between the water insoluble
   organic matter ((WIOM)) component of aerosol and the gas phase, K-i,
   (WIOM), as a function of temperature. They include (i) polyparameter
   linear free energy relationships calibrated with empirical aerosol
   sorption data, as well as (ii) the solvation models implemented in SPARC
   and (iii) the quantum-chemical software COSMOtherm, which predict
   solvation equilibria from molecular structure alone. We demonstrate that
   these methods can be used to predict K-i,(WIOM) for large numbers of
   individual molecules implicated in secondary organic aerosol (SOA)
   formation, including those with multiple functional groups. Although
   very different in their theoretical foundations, these methods give
   remarkably consistent results for the products of the reaction of normal
   alkanes with OH, i.e. their partition coefficients K-i,(WIOM) generally
   agree within one order of magnitude over a range of more than ten orders
   of magnitude. This level of agreement is much better than that achieved
   by different vapour pressure estimation methods that are more commonly
   used in the SOA community. Also, in contrast to the agreement between
   vapour pressure estimates, the agreement between the K-i,(WIOM)
   estimates does not deteriorate with increasing number of functional
   groups. Furthermore, these partitioning coefficients K-i,(WIOM)
   predicted SOA mass yields in agreement with those measured in chamber
   experiments of the oxidation of normal alkanes. If a K-i,(WIOM)
   prediction method was based on one or more surrogate molecules
   representing the solvation properties of the mixed OM phase of SOA, the
   choice of those molecule(s) was found to have a relatively minor effect
   on the predicted K-i, (WIOM), as long as the molecule(s) are not very
   polar. This suggests that a single surrogate molecule, such as 1-octanol
   or a hypothetical SOA structure proposed by Kalberer et al. (2004), may
   often be sufficient to represent the (WIOM) component of the SOA phase,
   greatly simplifying the prediction. The presented methods could
   substitute for vapour-pressure-based methods in studies such as the
   explicit modelling of SOA formation from single precursor molecules in
   chamber experiments.}},

   pressure-driven fracturing in jointed rock masses. The proposed approach
   is first validated by comparing the emergent pressure response and

   available analytical solutions. Then, the effect of rock mass
   discontinuities on the hydraulic fracturing process is investigated for
   several joint geometries.}},

Abstract = {{The travel activity scheduler for household agents (TASHA) is an
   operational rule-based model that generates activity schedules and

   traditional household survey and the verification results of the rules
   used in the TASHA are presented. After the results of the activity
   generation and scheduling models were analyzed, an iterative approach
   was applied to inflating the observed activity rates to calibrate the
   results. The model was shown to replicate observed activity frequency,
   tour frequency, and trip start time fairly accurately at the regional
   level. The activity duration of the model was underestimated by 13.1\%,
   but this underestimate did not add much bias to the shape of the
   duration distribution by start time. The final model results show that
   the TASHA is an attractive alternative to conventional modeling systems
   currently used in Changzhou.}},

Abstract = {{Energy storage (ES) integration into the grid is typically achieved by
   using single-stage converters interconnected to long series connected
   strings of battery cells. Such configurations are susceptible to
   reliability issues as no mechanism exists to address failure of
   individual battery cells. DC bus fault currents are also excessively
   large in such systems, which degrades safety and adds complexity to
   protection systems. This paper examines the modularized integration of
   ES into the grid by exploiting the modular nature of modular multilevel
   converters (MMCs). The power balance analysis in this paper demonstrates
   the ability of a MMC to integrate ES while addressing the short-comings
   of existing solutions. In the proposed topology, the ES is subdivided
   into banks, where each bank is integrated into an individual MMC
   submodule. This both reduces current conduction losses within the MMC
   submodules and simultaneously provides a mechanism for isolating ES
   banks from both ac and dc side fault events. This paper focuses on
   determining the robustness of the proposed ES enabled MMC structure to
   failure, overheating or over-charge/discharge of individual ES banks. It
   is shown that as many as 30\% of ES banks may be shut-down without
   affecting MMC power exchange with the grid. In cases where ES banks are
   operable in less than 70\% of modules, it is shown that auxiliary
   controls may be introduced to facilitate continued MMC power exchange
   with the grid. This is achieved through reactive current circulation
   within the MMC structure.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a prism-based and gap-based approach to model
   shopping location choice. Location choice is a fundamental decision in
   the activity scheduling process. We propose a simple yet robust model to
   capture shopping location choice behaviour. In this model, an individual
   first chooses a time window (or gap); the choice of the shopping
   location depends on the gap chosen. This notion arises from our
   understanding that shopping location choice behaviour depends on
   shopping type, scheduling constraints, time of day, and day of week. Or
   quite simply, where you shop depends on when you shop. The gap-based
   approach to destination choice is envisioned as a small but significant
   step towards a more comprehensive location choice model in a dynamic
   scheduling environment.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a single case study on the feasibility of using a
   low-cost and portable vision-based system (a Microsoft Kinect sensor) to
   monitor changes in movement patterns before and after a total hip
   replacement surgery. The primary subject was an older male adult with
   total hip replacement who performed two different functional tasks:
   walking and sit-to-stand. The tasks were recorded with a Kinect multiple
   times, starting from 1 d before the surgery until 9 wk after the
   surgery. An automated algorithm has been developed to extract the
   important spatiotemporal characteristics from the video recorded
   functional tasks (walking and sit-to-stand). Statistical analysis was
   then performed by Tryon C statistic to study changes in spatiotemporal
   characteristics between different stages before and after the surgery.
   The statistical analysis indicated significant difference and slight
   improvement between all measures from the presurgery to each postsurgery
   date. The study confirmed that the Kinect sensor and an automated
   algorithm have the potential to be integrated into a patient's home to
   monitor changes in mobility during the recovery period.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2434}},
Pages = {{26-34}},
Abstract = {{Driver distraction significantly impairs performance and increases the
   likelihood of vehicle crashes. Understanding the underlying reasons for
   distraction engagement as well as individuals' susceptibility to various
   types of distractions is a necessary step in developing effective
   solutions for mitigating distraction. This paper describes the
   development and initial evaluation of a questionnaire, the
   Susceptibility to Driver Distraction Questionnaire (SDDQ), which
   investigates distraction involvement by making a distinction between
   voluntary and involuntary engagement in secondary activities, or
   distractions, as referred to in this paper. The paper presents the
   theoretical underpinnings, the questionnaire itself, as well as the
   results of an online survey that examined the reliability and validity
   of the newly developed questionnaire. The analyses show moderate to high
   levels of internal consistency among the questionnaire items; this
   consistency provides support to the reliability of the SDDQ. The results
   also suggest that self-reported engagement in driver distraction is
   correlated with other self-reported, unsafe driving behaviors. As
   expected, personality is associated with attitudes and beliefs that
   motivate voluntary engagement in distraction, while susceptibility to
   involuntary distraction is related to cognitive limitations. These
   results indicate that the SDDQ can potentially be a useful tool to study
   driver distraction and the underlying reasons for distraction
   engagement.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new method for spectrum allocation in a heterogeneous
   cellular network with multiple tiers of randomly placed base stations
   and random user session arrivals. Different from previous works,
   inelastic network traffic is considered, so as to accommodate
   application sessions with fixed data rate requirements. We first
   quantify the average downlink sum throughput of the network in terms of
   a given spectrum allocation vector. We then derive concave upper and
   lower bounds to the throughput to allow efficient approximate solutions
   to optimize spectrum allocation. We show that the proposed approach has
   a worst case optimization performance gap of 12.6\% and further
   demonstrate via simulation that its actual performance is often near
   optimal.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel metric for image difference prediction,
   capable of handling color data. The proposed metric, namely, color
   difference index based on circular hue, is a full-reference based
   scheme, which independently processes achromatic and chromatic
   differences of two input color images. Within the framework, chromatic
   information is analyzed using two perceptual attributes, hue and chroma
   information, simulating human visual system mechanism. Unlike
   conventional approaches where the periodic nature of hue is disregarded,
   we propose to estimate hue difference by adopting theory of circular
   statistics. Performance of the proposed solution is validated using
   benchmark image quality assessment databases. Experimental results
   indicate the effectiveness of the proposed metric against a wide range
   of distortions, especially on chromatic distortions, making it better
   suited for color gamut mapping applications.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the demand for more robust protection against unauthorized use
   of mobile devices has been rapidly growing. This paper presents a novel
   biometric modality Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission (TEOAE) for
   mobile security. Prior works have investigated TEOAE for biometrics in a
   setting where an individual is to be identified among a pre-enrolled
   identity gallery. However, this limits the applicability to mobile
   environment, where attacks in most cases are from imposters unknown to
   the system before. Therefore, we employ an unsupervised learning
   approach based on Autoencoder Neural Network to tackle such blind
   recognition problem. The learning model is trained upon a generic
   dataset and used to verify an individual in a random population. We also
   introduce the framework of mobile biometric system considering practical
   application. Experiments show the merits of the proposed method and
   system performance is further evaluated by cross-validation with an
   average EER 2.41\% achieved.}},

Abstract = {{In classification of matrix-variate data, two-directional linear
   discriminant analysis (2DLDA) methods extract discriminant features
   while preserving and utilizing the matrix structure. These methods
   provide computational efficiency and improved performance in small
   sample size problems. Existing 2DLDA solutions produce a feature matrix
   which is commonly vectorized for processing by conventional vector-based
   classifiers. However, the vectorization step requires a one-dimensional
   ranking of features according to their discriminance power. We first
   demonstrate that independent column-wise and row-wise ranking provided
   by 2DLDA is not sufficient for uniquely sorting the resulting features,
   and does not guarantee the selection of the most discriminant features.
   Then, we theoretically derive the desired global ranking score based on
   Fisher's criterion. The current results focus on non-iterative
   solutions, but future extensions to iterative 2DLDA variants are
   possible. Face recognition experiments using images from the PIE data
   set are used to demonstrate the theoretically proved improvements over
   the existing solutions.}},

   obtained using backward induction algorithm of the corresponding
   discrete dynamic programming problem. We also present properties of the
   optimal policy for an important special case, where the power control at
   transmitters is limited to on-off switching. These properties facilitate
   the implementation of the MDP based solution. Our numerical simulations

   Numerous approaches to ECG processing have been proposed over the past
   years and the field has drawn significant attention from the biometrics

   algorithms. This paper proposes a set of standards for ECG signal
   recording and presents the UofT ECG Database (UofTDB) in order to
   evaluate the performance of various ECG biometric methods. Compared to
   existing databases, the UofTDB has three important characteristics
   namely, large population size (1012 individuals), varying body postures,
   physical exercise and acquisition over a long period. A promising equal
   error rate of under 5\% is also reported.}},

   For equivalent filter run-times, head loss was greater by 0.002-0.011 m

Pages = {{25564-25572}},
Abstract = {{We use the Zeta adsorption isotherm and propose a method for determining
   the conditions at which an adsorbed vapour becomes an adsorbed liquid.
   This isotherm does not have a singularity when vapour phase pressure,
   P-V, is equal to the saturation-vapour pressure, P-s, and is empirically
   supported by earlier studies for P-V < P-s. We illustrate the method
   using water and three hydrocarbon vapours adsorbing on silica. When the
   Zeta isotherm is combined with Gibbsian thermodynamics, an expression
   for gamma(SV), the surface tension of the solid-vapour interface as a
   function of x(V)( P-V/P-s) is obtained, and it is predicted that
   adsorption lowers gamma(SV) from the surface tension of the substrate in
   the absence of adsorption, gamma(SO), to that at the wetting condition.
   The wetting hypothesis indicates that gamma(SV) at wetting, x(W)(V), is
   equal gamma(LV), the surface tension of the liquid-vapour interface. For
   water vapour adsorbing on silica, adsorption lowers gamma(SV) to
   gamma(LV) at x(W)(V) equal unity, but for the hydrocarbons heptane,
   octane and toluene adsorbing on silica x(W)(V) is found to be 1.40, 1.30
   and 1.32 respectively.}},

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{47}},
Pages = {{25862-25875}},
Abstract = {{High-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with nanospray desorption
   electrospray ionization was used to probe chemical constituents of young
   soot particles sampled along the centerline of a coflow diffusion flame
   of a three-component Jet-A1 surrogate. In lower positions where
   particles are transparent to light extinction (lambda = 632.8 nm),
   peri-condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are found to be
   the major components of the particle material. These particles become
   enriched with aliphatic components as they grow in mass and size. Before
   carbonization occurs, the constituent species in young soot particles
   are aliphatic and aromatic compounds 200-600 amu in mass, some of which
   are oxygenated. Particles dominated by PAHs or mixtures of PAHs and
   aliphatics can exhibit liquid-like appearance observed by electron
   microscopy and be transparent to visible light. The variations in
   chemical composition observed here indicate that the molecular processes
   of soot formation in coflow diffusion flames may be more complex than
   previously thought. For example, the mass growth and enrichment of
   aliphatic components in an initial mostly aromatic structure region of
   the flame that is absent of H atoms or other free radicals indicates
   that there must exist at least another mechanism of soot mass growth in
   addition to the hydrogen abstraction-carbon addition mechanism currently
   considered in fundamental models of soot formation.}},

Abstract = {{The load balancing nurse-to-patient assignment problem requires the
   assignment of nurses to patients to minimize the variance of the nurses'
   workload. This challenging benchmark is currently best solved exactly
   with constraint programming (CP) using the spread constraint and a
   problem-specific heuristic. We show that while the problem is naturally
   modelled as a mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem, the
   MIQP does not match the performance of CP. We then develop several
   constraint integer programming (CIP) models that include bounds
   propagation, linear relaxations, and cutting planes associated with the
   quadratic, gcc, and spread global constraints. While the quadratic and
   gcc techniques are known, our additions to the spread constraint are
   novel. Our empirical results demonstrate that the CIP approach
   substantially out-performs the MIQP model, but still lags behind CP.
   Finally, we propose a simple problem-specific variable ordering
   heuristic which greatly improves the CIP models, achieving performance
   about an order of magnitude faster than CP and establishing a new state
   of the art.}},

Title = {{Can Microsimulation Be Used to Estimate Intersection Safety? Case
   Studies Using VISSIM and Paramics}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2432}},
Pages = {{142-148}},
Abstract = {{Safety prediction models are designed to estimate the safety of a road
   entity and, in most cases, they link traffic volumes to crashes. A major
   problem with such models is that, because crashes are rare events, crash
   statistics cannot account for many of the possible contributing factors.
   Using traffic conflicts to measure safety can overcome this problem
   because conflicts occur more frequently than crashes do and can be
   either measured in the field or estimated with microsimulation models.
   This study developed crash prediction models from simulated peak hour
   conflicts for a group of urban four-legged signalized intersections in
   Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and evaluated their predictive capabilities.
   Case studies with two microsimulation packages, VISSIM and Paramics,
   demonstrated the use of microsimulation for estimating safety
   performance. For a further demonstration of the approach's versatility,
   VISSIM was used with precalibrated parameter values, while substantial
   effort was devoted to calibrating Paramics parameters with the crash
   data. For the assessment of the predictive capability of the crash
   conflict models, specifically the models' ability to capture the safety
   impacts of geometric and operational variables, the effects of a
   hypothetical left-turn treatment on crashes and conflicts were explored
   and compared with results of an empirical Bayes study that evaluated
   actual treatments in Toronto. For this task, the predictive ability of
   the models for intersections with various ranges of average annual daily
   traffic and with various combinations of left- and right-turn lanes was
   also assessed. The results indicate that use of simulated conflicts is a
   viable, promising approach for intersection safety performance
   estimation.}},

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1768-1778}},
Abstract = {{Without any external additives such as growth factors, polymer beads
   containing methacrylic acid (MAA) promoted functional vascularization in
   vivo leading to faster cutaneous wound healing in diabetic mice and
   improved skin graft integration in Wistar rats. The aim of this work is
   to understand this material-driven vascularization by investigating the
   effect of polymer MAA-content, in the absence of surface roughness, on
   the behaviour of macrophage-like and endothelial cells. Smooth polymer
   films containing 20, 30 or 40\% MAA or methyl methacrylate as a control
   copolymerized with isodecyl acrylate, were synthesized to study the
   effect of MAA content in smooth films, without roughness.
   Macrophage-like cells (dTHP1) incubated on 40\% MAA films for 96 hours
   increased the expression of the angiogenic genes HIF1 alpha and SDF1
   alpha, and of the inflammatory genes IL1 beta, IL6 and TNF alpha, while
   decreasing the expression of osteopontin. Endothelial cells (HUVEC) on
   40\% MAA films for 96 hours increased the expression of the angiogenic
   genes MMP9 and CXCR4, and of osteopontin. In dTHP1 cells, principal
   component analysis established a positive correlation between MAA
   polymer content, HIF1 alpha expression and the expression of IL6, IL1
   beta and TNF alpha, suggesting that HIF1 alpha and NF-kappa B pathway
   may be involved. It was found that MAA chemistry, without topographical
   differences, promoted changes in gene expression in macrophage-like and
   endothelial cells. This effect was more significant above a threshold
   between 30 to 40\% MAA. The amount of MAA in the copolymer likely
   promoted the cell responses, future work will study the effects of
   varying MAA content. The 40\% MAA coatable material developed in this
   work may also be of interest as a coating to improve the integration of
   medical devices.}},

Abstract = {{Wood fiber/plastic composites (WPCs) have attracted considerable
   attention in the construction, furniture, automotive, electronics,
   packaging, and aerospace industries. However, their shortcomings such as
   high density, low ductility, and low impact strength have limited their
   utility in many applications. These shortcomings can be effectively
   compensated for through the foaming of WPC. Foaming technology is a
   family of different processing methods that can produce WPC parts with
   numerous bubbles created by a blowing agent. However, it is not easy to
   obtain fine and uniform cell structures, which are critical to the
   maintenance of mechanical properties when the density is reduced. This
   chapter reviews recent advances in WPC foams, especially focusing on
   their processing technologies. First, we recapitulate the fundamentals
   of foaming process, and then review three types of foam processing
   technologies, i.e., (i) batch foaming processing, (ii) extrusion foaming
   processing, and (iii) injection foam molding processing.}},

Abstract = {{People with lower-limb amputation have reduced mobility due to loss of
   sensory information, which may be restored by artificial sensory
   feedback systems built into prostheses. For an effective system, it is
   important to understand how humans sense, interpret, and respond to the
   feedback that would be provided. The goal of this study was to examine
   sensorimotor responses to mobility-relevant stimuli. Three experiments
   were performed to examine the effects of location of stimuli, frequency
   of stimuli, and means for providing the response. Stimuli, given as
   vibrations, were applied to the thigh region, and responses involved leg
   movements. Sensorimotor reaction time (RT) was measured as the duration
   between application of the stimulus and initiation of the response.
   Accuracy of response was also measured. Overall average RTs for one
   response option were 0.808 +/- 0.142 s, and response accuracies were
   >90\%. Higher frequencies (220 vs 140 Hz) of vibration stimulus provided
   in anterior regions of the thigh produced the fastest RTs. When
   participants were presented with more than one stimulus and response
   option, RTs increased. Findings suggest that long sensorimotor responses
   may be a limiting factor in the development of an artificial feedback
   system for mobility rehabilitation applications; however, feed-forward
   techniques could potentially help to address these limitations.}},

Abstract = {{We study the reach control problem for affine systems on simplices, and
   the focus is on cases when the problem is not solvable by continuous
   state feedback. We examine from a geometric viewpoint the structural
   properties of the system which make continuous state feedback fail. This
   structure is encoded by so-called reach control indices, which are
   defined and developed in the paper. Based on these indices, we propose a
   subdivision algorithm and associated piecewise affine feedback. The
   method is shown to solve the reach control problem in all remaining
   cases, assuming it is solvable by open-loop controls.}},

Abstract = {{Polypyrrole (PPy) conducting polymers as one of the most well-known
   actuation materials have shown numerous applications in a variety of
   fields such as biomedical devices as well as biomimetic robotics. This
   study investigates the multiobjective optimization of a PPy/MWCNTs
   actuator through an electrochemomechanical model. The multilayer
   actuator is composed of a PVDF layer, as the core membrane and an
   electrolyte reservoir, as well as two one layer of a conjugated polymer
   and one layer of multiwalled carbon nanotubes deposited on each side of
   the PVDF layer. In order to obtain the optimum values for each decision
   variable (i.e., geometrical and electrochemical), the two main outputs
   of the bending actuator, the tip displacement and blocking force, have
   been mathematically modeled and formulated as the objective functions. A
   multiobjective optimization algorithm is applied to simultaneously
   maximize the blocking force and tip displacement generated by the
   actuator. Furthermore, a range for each design variable is defined
   within which none of the objective functions of the film-type actuator
   dominates the other one while they are both kept within an acceptable
   range. The results obtained from the mathematical model are
   experimentally verified. Moreover, in order to determine the performance
   of the fabricated actuator, its outputs are compared with their
   counterparts of a neat PPy actuator.}},

   Detection of Breast Cancer Metastatic Potential}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR IMAGING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Cancer cells with a high metastatic potential will more likely escape
   and form distant tumors. Once the cancer has spread, a cure is rarely
   possible. Unfortunately, metastasis often proceeds unnoticed until a
   secondary tumor has formed. The culprit is that current imaging-based
   cancer screening and diagnosis are limited to assessing gross physical
   changes, not the earliest cellular changes that drive cancer
   progression. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel noninvasive
   magnetic resonance (MR) cellular imaging capability for characterizing
   the metastatic potential of breast cancer and enable early cancer
   detection. This MR method relies on imaging cell uptake of manganese, an
   endogenous calcium analogue and an MR contrast agent, to detect
   aggressive cancer cells. Studies on normal breast epithelial cells and
   three breast cancer cell lines, from nonmetastatic to highly metastatic,
   demonstrated that aggressive cancer cells appeared significantly
   brighter on MR as a result of altered cell uptake of manganese. In vivo
   results in nude rats showed that aggressive tumors that are otherwise
   unseen on conventional gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging are detected after
   manganese injection. This cellular MR imaging technology brings a
   critically needed, unique dimension to cancer imaging by enabling us to
   identify and characterize metastatic cancer cells at their earliest
   appearance.}},

Abstract = {{A compact, reliable and safe hydrogen sensor is required for the
   existing and emerging applications of hydrogen including aerospace and
   fuel cells. An optical sensor is an attractive option for hydrogen
   sensing because of its compactness, immunity from electromagnetic
   interference, and inherent safety. In this work we present the results
   of experimental demonstrations of a Pd-based hydrogen sensor and a ring
   resonator based temperature sensor on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI)
   platform. The hydrogen sensor consists of a ridge waveguide with a very
   thin coating of palladium. The sensor response time is less than 10
   seconds for 4\% hydrogen concentration, and the sensor response was
   repeatable under hundreds of cycles of exposure to hydrogen. The
   response of the hydrogen sensor is affected by variation of temperature,
   and this effect must be considered in a real life application of the
   hydrogen sensor. To overcome this limitation we design and
   experimentally demonstrate a temperature sensor on SOI using a ring
   resonator, which shows good sensitivity over a wide range of
   temperature. The hydrogen sensor and the temperature sensor can be
   integrated on the same chip to implement a sensor capable of reliably
   measuring hydrogen concentration under varying temperature.}},

Abstract = {{We present a real-rock micromodel approach whereby microfluidic channels
   are fabricated in a naturally occurring mineral substrate. The method is
   applied to quantify calcite dissolution which is relevant to oil/gas
   recovery, CO2 sequestration, and wastewater disposal in carbonate
   formations - ubiquitous worldwide. The key advantage of this method is
   the inclusion of both the relevant substrate chemistry (not possible
   with conventional microfluidics) and real-time pore-scale resolution
   (not possible with core samples). Here, microchannels are etched into a
   natural calcite crystal and sealed with a glass slide. The approach is
   applied to study acidified brine flow through a single channel and a
   two-dimensional micromodel. The single-channel case conforms roughly to
   a 1-D analytical description, with crystal orientation influencing the
   local dissolution rate an additional 25\%. The two-dimensional
   experiments show highly flow-directed dissolution and associated
   positive feedback wherein acid preferentially invades high conductivity
   flow paths, resulting in higher dissolution rates ('wormholing'). These
   experiments demonstrate and validate the approach of microfabricating
   fluid structures within natural minerals for transport and geochemical
   studies. More broadly, real-rock microfluidics open the door to a vast
   array of lab-on-a-chip opportunities in geology, reservoir engineering,
   and earth sciences.}},

   performance, in particular, its endurance. Analytical modeling is an
   indispensable instrument for design improvement as it demonstrates the

   characteristics. In this paper, we improve recent advances in using the
   mean field analysis as a tool for performance analysis and target
   hotness-aware flash management algorithms. We show that even under a
   generic workload model, the system dynamics can be captured by a system
   of ordinary differential equations, and the steady-state write
   amplification can be predicted for a variety of practical garbage
   collection algorithms, including the d-Choice algorithm. Furthermore,
   the analytical model is validated by a large collection of real and
   synthetic traces, and prediction errors against these simulations are
   shown to be within 5\%.}},

Abstract = {{Modern and future many-core systems represent complex architectures. The
   communication fabrics of these large systems heavily influence their
   performance and power consumption. Current simulation methodologies for
   evaluating networks-on-chip (NoCs) are not keeping pace with the
   increased complexity of our systems: architects often want to explore
   many different design knobs quickly. Methodologies that capture workload
   trends with faster simulation times are highly beneficial at early
   stages of architectural exploration. We propose SynFull, a synthetic
   traffic generation methodology that captures both application and cache
   coherence behaviour to rapidly, evaluate NoCs. SynFull allows designers
   to quickly indulge in detailed performance simulations without the cost
   of long-running hill-system simulation. By capturing a full range of
   application and coherence behaviour architects can avoid the over or
   underdesign of the network as may occur when using traditional synthetic
   traffic patterns such as uniform) random. SynFull has errors as low as
   0.3\% and provides 50x speedup on average over full-system simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) are considered as one of the
   most prominent infrastructures for human-centric multimedia applications
   due to the wide availability of low-cost hardware such as microphones
   and CMOS cameras. By virtue of the energy limitations on sensor nodes
   alongside the explicit highly demanding bandwidth requirements of
   real-time multimedia applications, these particular networks foster a
   set of non-trivial challenges that need to be confronted. In this paper
   we define a level of relevance in regards with the content of a
   multimedia packet and we further introduce a dynamic routing protocol
   that optimizes the overall network performance in terms of energy
   efficiency and packet delay. We present the design, implementation and
   applicability of our Content Relevance Opportunistic Routing (CROR)
   protocol under experimental results that show an increase in network
   lifetime of up to 20\% compared with traditional routing.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the scenario where a mobile device requires assistance from
   nearby devices to forward its computational tasks to a cloud server. We
   incentivize cooperation by allowing helper devices to conserve
   computational energy by offloading their own tasks to the source
   device's cloud, as compensation for the communication energy lost during
   task forwarding. We formulate an optimization problem with the objective
   of minimizing the cloud cost incurred by the source device due to tasks
   offloaded from helper devices, subject to no energy loss at the helper
   devices. We observe that this problem cannot be solved using a standard
   Lyapunov optimization approach. Instead, we construct an alternate
   problem that follows the standard form but has the same optimal
   objective value as the original problem. The resultant Energy
   Compensated Cloud Assistance (ECCA) algorithm does not require any
   statistics of the system and can be implemented distributively.}},

Abstract = {{Media webcasting and conferencing that involve many geographically
   distributed participants contribute significantly to congestion in the
   Internet. The current usage-based data pricing model does not take into
   account the hidden cost imposed by media streaming in the Internet core,
   including the network cost of replicating and relaying traffic in video
   multicast, and could potentially exacerbate congestion. In lieu of the
   recently emerged content sponsoring, in this paper, we present a simple
   congestion pricing model for ISPs (e. g. Comcast) to charge media
   streaming operators (e. g. Netflix) based on the bandwidth-delay product
   on each overlay link (either server-to-server or server-touser) that the
   media streaming operator has chosen to use. The proposed pricing policy
   incentivizes different media streaming applications to collectively
   reduce their ``waiting packets{''} in the Internet, alleviating
   congestion. We formulate the min-cost single and multiple multicast
   problems for the applications to construct their streaming overlays,
   based on a dense pool of CDN nodes. An efficient EM algorithm is given
   to solve the proposed geometric optimization problem and is evaluated
   through simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of finite-time vibration control of earthquake excited
   linear structures with input time-delay and saturation is concerned in
   this paper. The objective of designing controllers is to guarantee the
   finite-time stability of closed-loop systems while attenuating
   earthquake-induced vibration of the structures. First, based on matrix
   transformation, the structural system is described as a state-space
   model, which contains actuator saturation and input time-delay. Then,
   based on a Lyapunov functional and finite-time stability analysis
   method, some sufficient conditions for the existence of
   saturation-tolerant finite-time vibration-attenuation controllers are
   obtained. By solving these conditions, the desired controllers can be
   obtained for the closed-loop system to be finite-time stable with a
   prescribed level of disturbance attenuation. It is shown by the
   simulation results that compared with some Lyapunov asymptotic stability
   results, finite-time stability control can result in better state
   responses. Furthermore, saturation-tolerant controller can result in a
   much lower controller gain than the ones without considering actuator
   saturations.}},

   Trapping}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Microfluidic cell-based arraying technology is widely used in the field
   of single-cell analysis. However, among developed devices, there is a
   compromise between cellular loading efficiencies and trapped cell
   densities, which deserves further analysis and optimization. To address
   this issue, the cell trapping efficiency of a microfluidic device with
   two parallel micro channels interconnected with cellular trapping sites
   was studied in this paper. By regulating channel inlet and outlet
   status, the microfluidic trapping structure can mimic key functioning
   units of previously reported devices. Numerical simulations were used to
   model this cellular trapping structure, quantifying the effects of
   channel on/off status and trapping structure geometries on the cellular
   trapping efficiency. Furthermore, the microfluidic device was fabricated
   based on conventional microfabrication and the cellular trapping
   efficiency was quantified in experiments. Experimental results showed
   that, besides geometry parameters, cellular travelling velocities and
   sizes also affected the single-cell trapping efficiency. By fine tuning
   parameters, more than 95\% of trapping sites were taken by individual
   cells. This study may lay foundation in further studies of single-cell
   positioning in microfluidics and push forward the study of single-cell
   analysis.}},

   to build the stated preference mode switching experiments. The collected
   data set was used for estimating econometric choice models of mode
   switching toward transit. Separate models were estimated for car drivers
   and shared ride users. The empirical models showed that travel cost and
   in-vehicle travel time were of lower importance compared with other
   transit level-of-service attributes such as crowding level and number of
   transfers. That commuters prefer rail-based transit modes (e.g., subway
   and light rail transit) to other transit options (e.g., bus rapid
   transit) was evident. The developed models can enrich the transit

Abstract = {{Stereo visual odometry (VO) is a common technique for estimating a
   camera's motion; features are tracked across frames and the pose change
   is subsequently inferred. This position estimation method can play a
   particularly important role in environments in which the global
   positioning system (GPS) is not available (e. g., Mars rovers).
   Recently, some authors have noticed a bias in VO position estimates that
   grows with distance travelled; this can cause the resulting position
   estimate to become highly inaccurate. The goals of this paper are (i) to
   investigate the nature of this bias in VO, (ii) to propose methods of
   estimating it, and (iii) to provide a correction that can potentially be
   used online. We identify two effects at play in stereo VO bias: first,
   the inherent bias in the maximum-likelihood estimation framework, and
   second, the disparity threshold used to discard far-away and erroneous
   stereo observations. In order to estimate the bias, we investigate three
   methods: Monte Carlo sampling, the sigma-point method (with
   modification), and an existing analytical method in the literature.
   Based on simulations, we show that our new sigma-point method achieves
   similar accuracy to Monte Carlo, but at a fraction of the computational
   cost. Finally, we develop a bias correction algorithm by adapting the
   idea of the bootstrap in statistics, and demonstrate that our bias
   correction algorithm is capable of reducing approximately 95\% of bias
   in VO problems without incorporating other sensors into the setup.}},

   This article examines the displacement floor spectra on single-degree of

Abstract = {{This paper investigates strategies to alter the nano-and-microstructures
   of carbon-based filler-reinforced polymer matrix composites (PMCs). The
   matrix materials being studied in this work include polyphenylene
   sulfide (PPS) and liquid crystal polymer (LCP). A set of experiments
   were performed to investigate various strategies (i) to fabricate a
   morphological structure within the polymer matrix; (ii) to develop a
   thermally and electrically conductive network of nano-scaled fillers;
   and (iii) to produce a thermally conductive but electrically insulative
   network of hybrid fillers of nano-and-micro scales. The PMCs'
   structure-to-property relationships, including electrical and thermal
   properties, were revealed. In particular, the composites' effective
   thermal conductivities could be increased by as much as 10-folded over
   the neat polymers. By structuring the embedded electrically conductive
   pathways in the PMCs, their electrical conductivities could be tailored
   to levels that ranged from those of electrical insulators to those of
   semi-conductors. These multifunctional carbon-based filler-reinforced
   PMCs are envisioned to be potential solutions of various engineering
   problems. For example, light-weight thermally conductive PMCs with
   tailored electrical conductivities can serve as a new family of
   materials for electronic packaging or heat management applications.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the melting and crystallization behaviors of
   polylactide (PLA) under high-pressure CO2, N-2, and helium (He) using a
   high-pressure differential scanning calorimeter. The results showed that
   the PLA's melting temperature was depressed only in contact with
   pressurized CO2 where at high CO2 pressures the lubricating gas
   molecules induced more imperfect melt and cold crystals during the
   cooling and heating cycles, respectively. PLA's melt crystallization was
   analyzed during nonisothermal processes. Despite the effect of dissolved
   CO2 that expedited the PLA's crystallization rate, N-2 showed almost a
   neutral impact on the PLA's crystallization kinetics. Because of the
   lower solubility, N-2 gas content dissolved in the PLA had a diminutive
   plasticization effect, and thereby it could only counterbalance its
   negative hydraulic pressure effect. Moreover, as the helium pressure
   increased, the PLA's final crystallinity was reduced due to the dominant
   effect of helium's hydraulic pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) containing 0-2 wt\% glycerol
   monosterate (GMS) were compounded by a twin screw compounder and then
   foamed using a batch process and n-butane. Differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC) and high-pressure DSC were performed to evaluate the
   effects of GMS and pressurized butane on the crystallization kinetics of
   TPU. The results showed that the synergistic effect of GMS and high
   pressure butane significantly promoted hard segment (HS) crystallization
   in the TPU-GMS samples. The TPU-GMS samples showed significant increase
   in crystallinity over a wide range of saturation temperatures in the
   presence of butane compared to neat melt-compounded TPU (PR-TPU).
   Comparing the foam characteristics of PR-TPU and TPU-GMS samples, it was
   observed that both samples exhibited microcellular morphology with high
   cell density over a wide range of processing temperatures of 150 degrees
   C - 170 degrees C. However at a high foaming temperature (170 degrees
   C), PR-TPU foams showed high cell coalescence compared to TPU-GMS.
   Furthermore, TPU-GMS samples showed a much higher expansion ratio
   compared to PR-TPU over a wide range of processing temperatures. The
   lubricating effect of GMS assisted the HS to stack together and form
   crystalline domains. These HS crystalline domains are present at high
   temperature acting both as a heterogeneous nucleating sites as well as
   reinforcement leading to the observed microcellular morphology with a
   high expansion ratio in TPU-GMS samples.}},

Abstract = {{Research on solid supercapacitors over the last few years has aimed to
   provide high performing and safely operating energy storage solutions
   for the fast growing application areas of consumer and microelectronics,
   providing printable, flexible and wearable devices. Most of the reported
   research has leveraged proton conducting polymer electrolytes for
   electrochemical double layer capacitors and pseudo-capacitors. In this
   paper, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art solid
   supercapacitors enabled by proton-conducting polymer electrolytes. After
   a short overview of the types and configurations of solid
   supercapacitors, this review introduces proton-conducting polymers
   electrolytes and the mechanisms of proton conduction in a polymer
   matrix. Based on their chemistry, synthesizing method, and the nature of
   proton conduction, proton-conducting polymer electrolytes and the
   resultant supercapacitors are discussed in two categories: polymeric
   proton-conducting electrolytes and inorganic/polymer proton-conducting
   electrolytes. The performance and the technology gaps of the solid
   supercapacitors enabled by the presented polymer electrolytes are
   reviewed and compared. The review concludes with an outlook of future
   advancements required and the key research directions to achieving

Abstract = {{The performance of optoelectronic devices using glass envelopes can be
   improved substantially by the application of an effective
   anti-reflective coating. In this paper, we investigate the preparation
   of low index films through modulation of the porosity of silica
   nanoparticle films. Porosity variation is accomplished by introducing
   polystyrene porogen within colloidal silica nanoparticle films, which
   are deposited in a controlled manner, followed by pyrolysis of the
   porogen. Multilayer stacks of nanoparticle films with varying degrees of
   porosity were fabricated by sequentially spin coating and sintering
   various silica-polystyrene mixtures. The average transmittance (400-1000
   nm) of Corning glass was improved from 91.0\% to 95.2\% using a three
   layer stack on one glass-air interface, and to 99.0\% using three layer
   stacks on both interfaces - the highest reported values for facile
   synthesized multilayer structures. Utilization of the single and dual
   interface high transparency glass placed on a crystalline silicon solar
   cell leads to increased photocurrent densities by 4.0\% and 6.0\%,
   respectively, relative to uncoated glass.}},

Abstract = {{Global energy is largely a fluids problem. It is also large-scale, in
   stark contrast to microchannels. Microfluidic energy technologies must
   offer either massive scalability or direct relevance to energy processes
   already operating at scale. We have to pick our fights. Highlighted here
   are the exceptional opportunities I see, including some recent successes
   and areas where much more attention is needed. The most promising
   directions are those that leverage high surface-to-volume ratios, rapid
   diffusive transport, capacity for high temperature and high pressure
   experiments, and length scales characteristic of microbes and fluids
   (hydrocarbons, CO2) underground. The most immediate areas of application
   are where information is the product; either fluid sample analysis (e.
   g. oil analysis); or informing operations (e. g. CO2 transport in
   microporous media). I'll close with aspects that differentiate energy
   from traditional microfluidics applications, the uniquely important role
   of engineering in energy, and some thoughts for the research community
   forming at the nexus of lab-on-a-chip and energy - a microfluidic

Abstract = {{Understanding the physics of acoustic excitations emitted during the
   cracking of materials is one of the long-standing challenges for
   material scientists and geophysicists. In this study, we report novel
   results of applications of functional complex networks on acoustic
   emission waveforms emitted during the evolution of frictional
   interfaces. Our results show that laboratory faults at microscopic
   scales undergo a sequence of generic phases, including strengthening,
   weakening or fast slip and slow slip, leading to healing. For the first
   time we develop a formulation on the dissipated energy due to acoustic
   emission signals in terms of short-term and long-term features (i.e.,
   networks' characteristics) of events. We illuminate the transition from
   regular to slow ruptures. We show that this transition can lead to the
   onset of the critical rupture class similar to the direct observations
   of this phenomenon in the transparent samples. Furthermore, we
   demonstrate the detailed submicron evolution of the interface due to the
   short-term evolution of the rupture tip. As another novel result, we
   find that the nucleation phase of most amplified events follows a nearly
   constant timescale, corresponding to the initial strengthening or
   locking of the interface. This likely indicates that a thermally
   activated process can play a crucial role near the moving crack tip.}},

Title = {{Experimental Study on Early-Age Crack of Mass Concrete under the
   Controlled Temperature History}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Thermal deformation under restrained conditions often leads to early-age
   cracking and durability problems in mass concrete structures. It is
   crucial to monitor accurately the evolution of temperature and thermal
   stresses. In this paper, experimental studies using temperature stress
   testing machine (TSTM) are carried out to monitor the generated thermal
   cracking in mass concrete. Firstly, components and working principle of
   TSTM were introduced. Cracking temperatures and stress reserves are
   selected as the main cracking evaluation indicators of TSTM.
   Furthermore, effects of temperature controlling measures on concrete
   cracking were quantitatively studied, which consider the concrete
   placing temperature (before cooling) and cooling rates (after cooling).
   Moreover, the influence of reinforcement on early-age cracking has been
   quantitatively analyzed using the TSTM. The experimental results
   indicate that the crack probability of reinforced concrete (RC) is
   overestimated. Theoretical calculations proved that the internal stress
   can transfer from concrete to reinforcement due to creep effect.
   Finally, the experimental results indicate that the reinforcement can
   improve the crack resistance of concrete by nearly 30\% in the TSTM
   tests, and the ultimate tensile strain of RC is approximately 105\%
   higher than that of plain concrete with the same mix proportions.}},

Abstract = {{In the design of a wastewater treatment plant, engineers must estimate
   the future population that the plant will need to serve. When the
   population growth is uncertain, modular design can reduce up-front
   capital costs, operating costs and total expected present value costs.
   Models based on real option theory can provide insights to
   engineers/decision-makers that will not arise from standard net present
   value analysis. We consider a municipality faced with a plant expansion
   decision required to meet the demand of significant, uncertain growth.
   We present a model that optimises the size of the plant and its maximum
   modular size. The optimisation requires that multiple solutions be
   calculated at the decision time for the staged expansion. We utilise a
   moment matching technique to approximate the solution of the Asian-like
   option. The results show that as the uncertainty increases, a modular
   plant can save significant total costs for the municipality.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we will present a model for joint optimization of
   periodic inspection and inventory levels for a k-out-of-n system. The
   component failures follow a Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process and failed
   components can only be revealed at inspection times. We have two types
   of inspections; planned periodic inspections and non-planned
   opportunistic inspections. Opportunistic inspections are performed when
   the system fails, which occurs when n-k+1 components are down at the
   same time. Failed components are either minimally repaired or replaced
   with spare parts from the inventory.
   The inventory policy needs to support the inspection policy so that
   spare parts are available when needed. The inventory is replenished to
   level S at periodic inspections, after a random lead-time. However, when
   the system fails within an inspection interval, the inventory is
   replenished to level s, with no lead-time (because it is an emergency
   order). We assume that placing an emergency order is more expensive, and
   that it depends on the number of spares which is ordered.
   A simulation model is developed to find the expected total cost for
   given inspection interval t and inventory levels S and s. In order to
   find the combination of t, s and S, that minimizes the total cost over
   the system life cycle, we use a genetic algorithm. It is necessary to
   use a search heuristic method because the size of the search space makes
   it not feasible to find the optimal solution by trying all combinations
   of t, s and S.}},

   addresses the effects of spare parts shelf-life on the optimization of

   Certain conditions exacerbate the deterioration of spare parts, thereby
   affecting the reliability of the supported system. This is especially
   evident in non-repairable components that are stored for extended

Abstract = {{Shape memory polymers (SMP) are a class of stimuli-responsive materials
   that are able to respond to external stimulus such as heat by altering
   their shape. Bio-compatible SMPs have a number of advantages over static
   materials and are being studied extensively for biomedical and clinical
   applications (such as tissue stents and scaffolds). A previous study has
   demonstrated that the bio-compatible polymer blend of polylactic acid
   (PLA)/thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) (50/50 and 70/30) exhibit good
   shape memory properties. In this study, the mechanical and
   thermo-mechanical (shape memory) properties of TPU/PLA SMP blends were
   characterized; the compositions studied were 80/20, 65/35, and 50/50
   TPU/PLA. In addition, porous TPU/PLA SMP blends were fabricated with a
   gas-foaming technique; and the morphology of the porous structure of
   these SMPs foams were characterized with scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM). The TPU/PLA bio-compatible SMP blend was fabricated with
   melt-blending and compression molding. The glass transition temperature
   (T-g) of the SMP blends was determined with a differential scanning
   calorimeter (DSC). The mechanical properties studied were the
   stress-strain behavior, tensile strength, and elastic modulus; and the
   thermo-mechanical (or shape memory) properties studied were the shape
   fixity rate (R-f), shape recovery rate (R-r), response time, and the
   effect of recovery temperature on R-r. The porous 80/20 PLA/TPU SMP
   blend was found to have the highest tensile strength, toughness and
   percentage extension, as well as the lowest density and uniform pore
   structure in the micron and submicron scale. The porous 80/20 TPU/PLA
   SMP blend may be further developed for specific biomedical and clinical
   applications where a combination of tensile strength, toughness, and low
   density are required.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental tests and subsequent finite-element (FE) calibration
   studies were conducted to study the static strength of axially loaded X
   joints between elliptical hollow sections (EHS) with braces welded to
   the wide sides of the chord. Good agreement between the experimental and
   numerical results was achieved. The behavior of the EHS joints was found
   to be similar to that of rectangular hollow section (RHS) joints. For
   the EHS X joints with a brace-to-chord diameter ratio (beta) up to 0.80,
   the failure mode is chord plastification. For those with equal brace and
   chord diameters (beta = 1), the failure mode is chord sidewall failure.
   Various aspects of FE modeling, such as weld size and shape, chord
   length, and chord-end boundary conditions were investigated through
   sensitivity studies. These results constitute a solid basis for the
   subsequent numerical parametric study. (C) 2013 American Society of

Abstract = {{In 2012 approximately 800,000 spinal fusion surgeries were performed in
   the United States, requiring the insertion of screws into the pedicles.
   Their exact placement is critical and made complex due to limited
   visibility of the spine, continuous bleeding in the exposed regions, and
   variability in morphologies. The alarmingly high rate of screw
   misplacements (up to 20\%) reported in the literature is of major
   concern since such misplacements can place the surrounding vital
   structures at risk. A potential guidance method for determining the best
   screw trajectory is by the use of real-time ultrasound imaging similar
   to that used for intravascular imaging. An endovascular transducer could
   be inserted into the pedicle to image the anatomy from within and
   identify bone boundaries.
   A major challenge of imaging within bone is high signal attenuation. The
   rapid increase of attenuation with frequency requires much lower
   frequencies (1-3 MHz) than those used in intravascular imaging. This
   study describes the custom design and fabrication of 2 MHz ultrasound
   probes (3.5 mm diameter/11 Fr) for pedicle screw guidance. Three
   transducer designs are explored to provide improved sensitivity and
   signal to noise ratio, compared to the previously tested transducer
   within the pedicle. Experimental measurements are compared with the
   results obtained using various simulation tools. The work reported in
   this paper represents the first stage in our ultimate goal of developing
   a 32element phased array that is capable of generating a radial B-mode
   image.}},

Abstract = {{Reactions between hydrocarbons and ozone or hydroxyl radicals lead to
   the formation of oxidized species, including reactive oxygen species
   (ROS), and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the troposphere. ROS can
   be carried deep into the lungs by small aerodynamic particles where they
   can cause oxidative stress and cell damage. While environmental studies
   have focused on ROS in the gas phase and rainwater, it is also important
   to determine concentrations of ROS on respirable particles. Samples of
   PM2.5 collected over 3 h at midday on 40 days during November 2011 and
   September 2012 show that the particulate ROS concentration in Austin,
   Texas, ranged from a minimum value of 0.02 nmoles H2O2 m(-3) air in
   December to 3.81 nmoles H2O2 m(-3) air in September. Results from
   correlation tests and linear regression analysis on particulate ROS
   concentrations and environmental conditions (which included ozone and
   PM2.5 concentrations, temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and
   solar radiation) indicate that ambient particulate ROS is significantly
   influenced by the ambient ozone concentration, temperature and incident
   solar radiation. Particulate ROS concentrations measured in this study
   were in the range reported by other studies in the US, Taiwan and
   Singapore. This study is one of the first to assess seasonal variations
   in particulate ROS concentrations and helps explain the influence of
   environmental conditions on particulate ROS concentrations.}},

   Problems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{535-572}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic scheduling problems consist of both challenging combinatorics,
   as found in classical scheduling problems, and stochastics due to
   uncertainty about the arrival times, resource requirements, and
   processing times of jobs. To address these two challenges, we
   investigate the integration of queueing theory and scheduling. The
   former reasons about long-run stochastic system characteristics, whereas
   the latter typically deals with shortterm combinatorics. We investigate
   two simple problems to isolate the core differences and potential
   synergies between the two approaches: a two-machine dynamic flowshop and
   a flexible queueing network. We show for the first time that stability,
   a fundamental characteristic in queueing theory, can be applied to
   approaches that periodically solve combinatorial scheduling problems. We
   empirically demonstrate that for a dynamic flowshop, the use of
   combinatorial reasoning has little impact on schedule quality beyond
   queueing approaches. In contrast, for the more complicated flexible
   queueing network, a novel algorithm that combines long-term guidance
   from queueing theory with short-term combinatorial decision making
   outperforms all other tested approaches. To our knowledge, this is the
   first time that such a hybrid of queueing theory and scheduling
   techniques has been proposed and evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{We present a procedure for recovering the conformal factor of an
   anisotropic conductivity matrix in a known conformal class in a domain
   in R-n with n >= 2. The method requires one internal measurement
   together with a priori knowledge of the conformal class of the
   conductivity matrix. This problem arises in the medical imaging modality
   of current density impedance imaging (CDII), and the interior data
   needed can be obtained using MRI-based techniques for measuring current
   densities (CDI) and diffusion tensors (DTI). We show that the
   corresponding electric potential is the unique solution of a constrained
   minimization problem with respect to a weighted total variation
   functional defined in terms of the physical measurements. Further, we
   show that the associated equipotential surfaces are area minimizing with
   respect to a Riemannian metric obtained from the data. The results are
   also extended to allow the presence of perfectly conducting and/or
   insulating inclusions.}},

Abstract = {{Deformable Image Registration (DIR) has been extensively studied over
   the past two decades due to its essential role in many image-guided
   interventions. Morfeus is a DIR algorithm that works based on finite
   element biomechanical modeling. However, Morfeus does not utilize the
   entire image contrast and features which could potentially lead to a
   more accurate registration result. A hybrid biomechanical
   intensity-based method is proposed to investigate this potential benefit
   Inhale and exhale 4DCT lung images of 26 patients were initially
   registered using Morfeus by modeling contact surface between the lungs
   and the chest cavity. The resulting deformations using Morfeus were
   refined using a B-spline intensity-based algorithm (Drop, Munich,
   Germany). Important parameters in Drop including grid spacing, number of
   pyramids, and regularization coefficient were optimized on 10
   randomly-chosen patients (out of 26). The remaining parameters were
   selected empirically. Target Registration Error (TRE) was calculated by
   measuring the Euclidean distance of common anatomical points on both
   images before and after registration. For each patient a minimum of 30
   points/lung were used. The Hybrid method resulted in mean +/- SD
   (90th\%) TRE of 1.5 +/- 1.4 (2.8) mm compared to 3.1 +/- 2.0 (5.6) using
   Morfeus and 2.6 +/- 2.6 (6.2) using Drop alone.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that cognitive and social interventions are
   crucial to the overall health of older adults including their
   psychological, cognitive, and physical well-being. However, due to the
   rapidly growing elderly population of the world, the resources and
   people to provide these interventions is lacking. Our work focuses on
   the use of social robotic technologies to provide person-centered
   cognitive interventions. In this article, we investigate the acceptance
   and attitudes of older adults toward the human-like expressive socially
   assistive robot Brian 2.1 in order to determine if the robot's
   human-like assistive and social characteristics would promote the use of
   the robot as a cognitive and social interaction tool to aid with
   activities of daily living. The results of a robot acceptance
   questionnaire administered during a robot demonstration session with a
   group of 46 elderly adults showed that the majority of the individuals
   had positive attitudes toward the socially assistive robot and its
   intended applications.}},

   Adaptive Traffic Signal Control}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) is a promising technique to
   alleviate traffic congestion. This article focuses on the development of
   an adaptive traffic signal control system using Reinforcement Learning
   (RL) as one of the efficient approaches to solve such stochastic closed
   loop optimal control problem. A generic RL control engine is developed
   and applied to a multi-phase traffic signal at an isolated intersection
   in Downtown Toronto in a simulation environment. Paramics, a microscopic
   simulation platform, is used to train and evaluate the adaptive traffic
   control system. This article investigates the following dimensions of
   the control problem: 1) RL learning methods, 2) traffic state
   representations, 3) action selection methods, 4) traffic signal phasing
   schemes, 5) reward definitions, and 6) variability of flow arrivals to
   the intersection. The system was tested on three networks (i.e., small,
   medium, large-scale) to ensure seamless transferability of the system
   design and results. The RL controller is benchmarked against optimized
   pretimed control and actuated control. The RL-based controller saves
   48\% average vehicle delay when compared to optimized pretimed
   controller and fully-actuated controller. In addition, the effect of the
   best design of RL-based ATSC system is tested on a large-scale
   application of 59 intersections in downtown Toronto and the results are
   compared versus the base case scenario of signal control systems in the
   field which are mix of pretimed and actuated controllers. The RL-based
   ATSC results in the following savings: average delay (27\%), queue
   length (28\%), and l CO2 emission factors (28\%).}},

Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{The problem of delay-dependent robust stabilization for continuously
   singular time-varying delay systems with norm-bounded uncertainties is
   investigated in this paper. First, based on some mathematical transform,
   the uncertain singular system is described in a form which involves the
   time-delay integral items. Then, in terms of the delay-range-dependent
   Lyapunov functional and the LMI technique, the improved delay-dependent
   LMIs-based conditions are established for the uncertain singular systems
   with time-varying delay to be regular, causal, and stable. Furthermore,
   by solving these LMIs, an explicit expression for the desired state
   feedback control law can be obtained; thus, the regularity, causality,
   and stability of the closed-loop system are guaranteed. In the end,
   numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{In order to ascertain the optimal ladle lining to suppress erosion

   saturation, lower CO partial pressure, higher temperature and higher
   Na2S content in the fluxes lead to higher dissolved Mg and Al contents
   in the final fluxes. As the degree of MgO dissolution in the fluxes was
   much greater than that of Al2O3, an Al2O3-based ladle lining is
   considered to be superior for Cu removal considering the erosion induced
   by FeS-Na2S fluxes. Finally, the dissolution mechanisms of MgO and Al2O3

   In order to segment free fluid regions fast and accurate, we propose a
   new free fluid segmentation based on Chan-vese level-set with an
   improved initialization using minimum variance region growing. The
   proposed method is devised to take complementary effects on both
   methods. In experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method is
   demonstrated with 3D US volumes in terms of Dice's coefficient, volume
   difference, Hausdorff distance and processing time. Results show that
   the proposed method outperforms CVLS and MVRG in terms of processing

Abstract = {{This article considers the problem of managing the risks associated with
   random equipment failures by optimizing decisions regarding the quantity
   and placement of critical spares over a network of related industrial
   sites. To develop the model and provide a practical example, we focus on
   the allocation of electrical transformer spares for a large-scale
   industrial producer, such as a mining company or chemical manufacturer,
   operating several different sites across a geographic region. In
   particular, we consider the risk of financial loss due to interrupted
   business and lost production following an unexpected transformer
   failure. A two-stage stochastic integer programming model with a
   conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) criterion to incorporate risk aversion
   is developed. Computational results are presented to illustrate the
   advantages of the CVaR approach compared to a corresponding expected
   cost minimization approach. The CVaR model results in policies that have
   lower loss than the corresponding risk neutral model since, at
   sufficiently high risk aversion levels, the CVaR model introduces the
   acquisition of more spares as a hedge against catastrophic scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Pulsed sources based on approaches that employ only photonic components
   and no RF components will be discussed in this talk. Several
   technologies have been explored to generate actively mode-locked sources
   using electronically driven fiber ring cavities. However, for these
   sources the pulse repetition rate is usually limited by the bandwidth of
   the intra-cavity modulator. Filtering of highly-stable low repetition
   rate optical combs utilizing cavities such as Fabry-Perot etalons can be
   used to overcome this limitation. This scheme is not flexible as it
   requires highly precise control of ultrahigh finesse etalons which
   limits the repetition rate to the free spectral range of the filter.
   Pulsed sources based on semiconductor devices offer many advantages,
   including large gain bandwidth, rapid tunability, long-term stability.
   In this work we introduce a novel, simple method to generate optical
   clock with wavelength tunability using two continuous wave (CW) lasers.
   The lasers are injected into a conventional SOAs-based fiber ring laser.
   The beating signal generated by these two lasers causes the modulation
   of the SOA gain saturation inside the cavity. Thus, the SOA provides
   gain and functions as the modulator as well as the gain medium. When the
   lasing mode inside the cavity is amplified, it also results in
   gain-induced four wave mixing. The proposed technique is particularly
   versatile, overcoming the bandwidth limitation of other techniques,
   which require RF sources. Moreover, this technique provides the
   possibility for hybrid integration as it is comprised of semiconductor
   chips that can be heterogeneously integrated on a Si platform.}},

Abstract = {{High-contrast bone structures are a major noise contributor in chest
   radiographic images. A signal of interest in a chest radiograph could be
   either partially or completely obscured or ``overshadowed{''} by the
   highly contrasted bone structures in its surrounding. Thus, removing the
   bone structures, especially the posterior rib and clavicle structures,
   is highly desirable to increase the visibility of soft tissue density.
   We developed an innovative technology that offers a solution to suppress
   bone structures, including posterior ribs and clavicles, on conventional
   and portable chest X-ray images. The bone-suppression image processing
   technology includes five major steps: 1) lung segmentation, 2) rib and
   clavicle structure detection, 3) rib and clavicle edge detection, 4) rib
   and clavicle profile estimation, and 5) suppression based on the
   estimated profiles. The bone-suppression software outputs an image with
   both the rib and clavicle structures suppressed. The rib suppression
   performance was evaluated on 491 images. On average, 83.06\% (+/-
   6.59\%) of the rib structures on a standard chest image were suppressed
   based on the comparison of computer-identified rib areas against
   hand-drawn rib areas, which is equivalent to about an average of one rib
   that is still visible on a rib-suppressed image based on a visual
   assessment. Reader studies were performed to evaluate reader performance
   in detecting lung nodules and pneumothoraces with and without a
   bone-suppression companion view. Results from reader studies indicated
   that the bone-suppression technology significantly improved
   radiologists' performance in the detection of CT-confirmed possible
   nodules and pneumothoraces on chest radiographs. The results also showed
   that radiologists were more confident in making diagnoses regarding the
   presence or absence of an abnormality after rib-suppressed companion
   views were presented}},

Abstract = {{We report the synthesis of colloidal gamma-Fe2O3/Cu2O
   hetero-nanocrystals (HNCs) using a solution-phase seeded-growth
   approach. gamma-Fe2O3 nanocrystals were used as seeds for the nucleation
   of metallic Cu followed by oxidation of the Cu domain to Cu2O upon
   exposure to air. The resulting dimer, trimer, and oligomer HNCs were
   characterized by high resolution electron microscopy, energy dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction. The iron oxide
   component was found to be mainly gamma-Fe2O3 using a combination of
   Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A maximal HNC yield of 72\%
   was achieved by reducing particle growth time to a lower growth
   temperature with respect to the individual component particles.
   Size-selective precipitation was used to enrich the nanoparticle mixture
   in gamma-Fe2O3/Cu2O dimers by removing the larger aggregates.
   Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy was used to determine that
   gamma-Fe2O3 and Cu2O are n-doped and p-doped respectively and form a
   staggered, type II band alignment. As such, gamma-Fe2O3/Cu2O HNCs may be
   attractive candidates for applications in solar energy conversion and

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Background: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has been found to be
   effective in restoring voluntary functions after spinal cord injury
   (SCI) and stroke. However, the central nervous system (CNS) changes that
   occur in as a result of this therapy are largely unknown.
   Objective: To examine the effects of FES on the restoration of voluntary
   locomotor function of the CNS in a SCI rat model.
   Methods: SCI rats were instrumented with chronic FES electrodes in the
   hindlimb muscles and were divided into two groups: (a) FES therapy and
   (b) sedentary. At day 7 post-SCI, the animals were assessed for
   locomotion performance by using a Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB)
   scale. They were then anesthetized for a terminal in vivo experiment.
   The lumbar spinal cord and somatosensory cortex were exposed and the
   instrumented muscles were stimulated electrically. Associated
   neurovascular responses in the CNS were recorded with an intrinsic
   optical imaging system.
   Results: FES greatly improved locomotion recovery by day 7 post-SCI, as
   measured by BBB scores (P < 0.05): (a) FES 10 +/- 2 and (b) controls 3
   +/- 1. Furthermore, the FES group showed a significant increase (P <
   0.05) of neurovascular activation in the spinal cord and somatosensory
   cortex when the muscles were stimulated between 1 and 3 motor threshold
   (MT).
   Conclusion: Hind limb rehabilitation with FES is an effective strategy
   to improve locomotion during the acute phase post-SCI. The results of
   this study indicate that after FES, the CNS preserves/acquires the
   capacity to respond to peripheral electrical stimulation.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},

Pages = {{2309-2318}},
Abstract = {{We introduce oscillatory segmented flow as a compact microfluidic format
   that accommodates slow chemical reactions for the solution-phase
   processing of colloidal nanomaterials. The strategy allows the reaction
   progress to be monitored at a dynamic range of up to 80 decibels (i.e.,
   residence times of up to one day, equivalent to 720-14 400 times the
   mixing time) from only one sensing location. A train of alternating gas
   bubbles and liquid reaction compartments (segmented flow) was initially
   formed, stopped and then subjected to a consistent back-and-forth
   motion. The oscillatory segmented flow was obtained by periodically
   manipulating the pressures at the device inlet and outlet via square
   wave signals generated by non-wetted solenoid valves. The readily
   implementable format significantly reduced the device footprint as
   compared with continuous segmented flow. We investigated mixing
   enhancement for varying liquid segment lengths, oscillation amplitudes
   and oscillation frequencies. The etching of gold nanorods served as a
   case study to illustrate the utility of the approach for dynamic
   characterization and precise control of colloidal nanomaterial size and
   shape for 5 h. Oscillatory segmented flows will be beneficial for a
   broad range of lab-on-a-chip applications that require long processing

Abstract = {{Aqueous quaternary ammonium hydroxides were investigated as electrolytes
   for electrochemical capacitors (ECs) in both liquid and polymer-gel
   forms. Alkaline polymer electrolytes, composed of tetraethylammonium
   hydroxide (TEAOH) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) in different ratios,
   were developed and characterized. An optimized TEAOH-PVA electrolyte was
   developed and compared to KOH-PVA under controlled and ambient
   conditions. The stability of the polymer electrolytes and the solid ECs
   were characterized using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy. While both polymer electrolyte-based ECs
   demonstrated high rate capability in pristine condition, the TEAOH-based
   solid EC device showed a much better shelf life than the KOH-based
   device. This is likely due to the water retention capability of TEAOH,
   which promoted the amphorous phase and ion mobility, contributing to
   higher ionic conductivity and better environmental stability.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER AIDED SURGERY}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study presents and evaluates a semi-automated algorithm
   for quantifying malalignment in complex femoral shaft fractures from a
   single intraoperative cone-beam CT (CBCT) image of the fractured limb.
   Methods: CBCT images were acquired of complex comminuted diaphyseal
   fractures created in 9 cadaveric femora (27 cases). Scans were segmented
   using intensity-based thresholding, yielding image stacks of the
   proximal, distal and comminuted bone. Semi-deformable and rigid affine
   registrations to an intact femur atlas (synthetic or cadaveric-based)
   were performed to transform the distal fragment to its neutral
   alignment. Leg length was calculated from the volume of bone within the
   comminution fragment. The transformations were compared to the physical
   input malalignments.
   Results: Using the synthetic atlas, translations were within 1.71 +/-
   1.08mm (medial/lateral) and 2.24 +/- 2.11mm (anterior/posterior). The
   varus/valgus, flexion/extension and periaxial rotation errors were 3.45
   +/- 2.6 degrees, 1.86 +/- 1.5 degrees and 3.4 +/- 2.0 degrees,
   respectively. The cadaveric-based atlas yielded similar results in
   medial/lateral and anterior/posterior translation (1.73 +/- 1.28mm and
   2.15 +/- 2.13 mm, respectively). Varus/valgus, flexion/extension and
   periaxial rotation errors were 2.3 +/- 1.3, 2.0 +/- 1.6 degrees and 3.4
   +/- 2.0 degrees, respectively. Leg length errors were 1.41 +/- 1.01mm
   (synthetic) and 1.26 +/- 0.94mm (cadaveric). The cadaveric model
   demonstrated a small improvement in flexion/extension and the synthetic
   atlas performed slightly faster (6 min 24 s +/- 50 s versus 8 min 42 s
   +/- 2 min 25 s).
   Conclusions: This atlas-based algorithm quantified malalignment in
   complex femoral shaft fractures within clinical tolerances from a single
   CBCT image of the fractured limb.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{10979-10989}},
Abstract = {{A procedure for determining the structure of vapour and gas adsorbates
   that is based on the Zeta adsorption isotherm is reported. For vapours
   and for gases, this isotherm supposes that an adsorbate consists of
   particle clusters with the number of particles in a cluster denoted
   zeta, where zeta can be 1, 2, 3... up to a maximum of zeta(m), and
   predicts the isotherm constants are independent of pressure. For
   vapours, this allows the isotherm constants to be determined from
   isotherm measurements made at pressures less than the saturation-vapour
   pressure, P-s, but applied at pressures greater than P-s. Since zeta has
   an upper limit, we show that there are no singularities in the vapour or
   gas adsorption isotherms for any pressure. This allows the adsorption of
   vapours at pressures greater than P-s to be investigated: clusters with
   zeta(m) molecules are predicted to increase in number as P-V is
   increased, until they form an adsorbed film with each adsorption site
   occupied by a zeta(m)-cluster. We apply the same procedure to determine
   the value of zeta(m) for gas adsorption. For CO adsorbing on Ni(100),
   zeta(m) is predicted to be unity for all the cases considered,
   indicating that the adsorbate consists of adsorbed molecules without any
   clustering. For H-2 adsorption on the three different materials, zeta(m)
   is found to be two: indicating the adsorbate consists of both adsorbed
   molecules and atoms. For each material considered, a pressure is
   predicted where the mole fractions of both are equal, and at higher
   pressure, the mole fraction of adsorbed molecules exceeds that of the
   adsorbed atoms.}},

Abstract = {{Protein structure determination by X-ray crystallography is dependent on
   obtaining a single protein crystal suitable for diffraction data
   collection. Due to this requirement, protein crystallization represents
   a key step in protein structure determination. The conditions for
   protein crystallization have to be determined empirically for each
   protein, making this step also a bottleneck in the structure
   determination process. Typical protein crystallization practice involves
   parallel setup and monitoring of a considerable number of individual
   protein crystallization experiments (also called crystallization
   trials). In these trials the aliquots of purified protein are mixed with
   a range of solutions composed of a precipitating agent, buffer, and
   sometimes an additive that have been previously successful in prompting
   protein crystallization. The individual chemical conditions in which a
   particular protein shows signs of crystallization are used as a starting
   point for further crystallization experiments. The goal is optimizing
   the formation of individual protein crystals of sufficient size and
   quality to make them suitable for diffraction data collection. Thus the
   composition of the primary crystallization screen is critical for
   successful crystallization.
   Systematic analysis of crystallization experiments carried out on
   several hundred proteins as part of large-scale structural genomics
   efforts allowed the optimization of the protein crystallization protocol
   and identification of a minimal set of 96 crystallization solutions (the
   ``TRAP{''} screen) that, in our experience, led to crystallization of
   the maximum number of proteins.}},
