Abstract = {{Performing system diagnosis is a critical task in modern datacenters.
   Investigating individual resource behavior may not be efficient in
   detecting abnormal behavior in large and complex datacenters. In this
   paper, we propose a scalable graph based diagnosis framework to detect
   system anomalies in Software-Defined Infrastructure running in SAVI
   testbed. We have leveraged Graph Mining and Machine Learning techniques
   in our approach in order to detect different kinds of anomalies. We have
   experimentally tested our framework on several use cases:
   Webserver-Database workload pattern, bandwidth throttling between a pair
   of VMs, denial-of-service (DoS) attack on a webserver and Spark Job
   failure. Our framework was able to detect the aforementioned anomalies
   accurately.}},

Abstract = {{As Cloud efficient resource management in these Cloud platforms helps
   the Cloud provider to deliver better quality of service to its
   customers. In this paper, we present an online characterization method
   that can identify potentially jailing jobs in a Cloud platform by
   analyzing the jobs' resource usage profile as the job runs. We show
   that, by tracking the online resource consumption, we can develop a
   model through which we can predict whether or not a job will have an
   abnormal termination. We further show, using both real world and
   synthetic data, that our online tool can raise alarms as early as within
   the first 1/8th of the potentially failing job's lifetime, with a false
   negative rate as low as 4\%. These alarms can become useful in
   implementing either one of the following resource-conserving Cloud
   management techniques: alerting clients early, de-prioritizing jobs that
   are likely to fail or assigning them less performant resources,
   deploying or up regulating diagnostic tools for potentially faulty jobs.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time content delivery (RTCD) systems have become a prominent aspect
   of telecommunications as evidence by popularity of news-casting,
   real-time event subscription / publication and live media streaming
   Unlike conventional content delivery systems, RTCDs need to deliver
   processed information to users in real time. This may require the
   network to handle some of the processing closer to the users to
   efficiently use the bandwidth consumed by the applications. The
   combination of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and service
   chaining is a promising solution to address this challenge.
   Our work applies a service chaining algorithm to place NFV modules of an
   RTCD application in a Software Defined Infrastructure (51)1), where
   virtualized Customer Premise Edges (vCPEs), possessing scarce resources,
   are employed. We suggest containers to efficiently pack VNFs into vCPEs.
   Our objective is to maximize the total number of chains that can be
   serviced in the RTCD application. To optimally chain the NFV modules, a
   heuristic algorithm is proposed and evaluated.
   Using simulations, we show that our algorithm with the help of vCPEs can
   support higher number of users while providing high-level service
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) are essential blocks in digital
   signal processing (DSP) systems, software defined radio receivers
   (SDRs), and portable data acquisition systems. This paper introduces an
   8-bit Time-based Analog to Digital Converter (T-ADC). This T-ADC
   utilizes an inherited sample and hold required to eliminate the
   dedicated power hungry sample and hold circuit. Moreover, a new design
   methodology for increasing the input dynamic range as well as improving
   the circuit sensitivity is implemented. A prototype of the proposed
   T-ADC is implemented in TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. This T-ADC consumes
   1.9 mW, and achieves a maximum SNDR of 49.66 dB with sampling rate of
   200 MS/s. Moreover, comparing the area proportion of the analog and
   digital parts of the T-ADC circuit reveals that one of the main
   advantages of the T-ADC over the conventional ADCs is that the digital
   part dominates the design (i.e., the digital part occupies about 98\% of
   the whole proposed T-ADC).}},

Abstract = {{Many important applications demand large amounts of on-chip memory both
   to fully utilize an FPGA's computational capacity and to minimize
   energy-consuming off-chip memory accesses, leading some recent
   commercial FPGAs to add higher-capacity on-chip block RAMs (BRAMs).
   While memory is becoming more important to FPGA designs, SRAM scaling is
   becoming more difficult because of increasing device variation. An
   alternative is to build FPGA BRAM from magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)
   cells as this emerging embedded memory features a small cell size, low
   energy usage, and good scalability. In this work, we conduct a detailed
   comparison study of SRAM and MTJ BRAMs that includes cell designs that
   are robust with device variation, transistor-level design and
   optimization of all the required BRAM-specific circuits, and
   variation-aware simulation at the 22nm node. We find that as the
   capacity of a BRAM increases, the MTJ benefits of high-density and
   low-energy increase and its drawback of lower speed is mitigated. At a
   256 Kb block size, MTJ-BRAM is 3.06 x denser and 55\% more energy
   efficient and its F-max is 274 MHz, which is adequate for most FPGA
   system clock domains. We detail how the non-volatility of an MTJ-BRAM
   saves energy, especially for narrow write operations which are common
   for the width-configurable BRAMs of FPGAs. For a RAM architecture
   similar to the latest commercial FPGAs, MTJ-based block RAMs reduce the
   FPGA fabric area by 28\%, or alternatively could expand FPGA memory
   capacity by 2.95 x with no die size increase.}},

Abstract = {{Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained significant traction in
   the field of machine learning, particularly due to their high accuracy
   in visual recognition. Recent works have pushed the performance of GPI
   implementations of CNNs showing significant improvements in their
   classification and training times. With these improvements, many
   frameworks have become available for implementing CNNs on both CPUs and
   GPUs, with no support for FPGA implementations. In this work we present
   a modified version of the popular CNN framework Caffe, with FPGA
   support. This allows for classification using CNN models and specialized
   FPGA implementations with the flexibility of reprogramming the device
   when necessary, seamless memory transactions between host and device,
   simpleto-use test benches, and the ability to create pipelined layer
   implementations. To validate the framework, we use the Xilinx SDAccel
   environment to implement an FPGA-based Winograd convolution engine and
   show that it can be used alongside other layers running on a host
   processor to run several popular CNNs (AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGG A,
   Overfeat). The results show that our framework achieves 50 GFLOPS across
   3 x 3 convolutions in the benchmarks. This is achieved within a
   practical framework, which will aid in future development of FPGA-based
   CNNs.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic prediction of continuous level emotional state requires
   selection of suitable affective features to develop a regression system
   based on supervised machine learning. This paper investigates the
   performance of low-level dynamic features for predicting two common
   dimensions of emotional state, namely, valence and arousal
   instantaneously. Low-complexity features are extracted from audio and
   visual modalities independently and fused in the feature level. Features
   with minimum redundancy and maximum relevancy are chosen by using the
   mutual information-based selection process. The performance of
   frame-by-frame prediction of emotional state using the moderate length
   features as proposed in this paper is evaluated on spontaneous and
   naturalistic human-human conversation of SEMAINE database. Experimental
   results show that the proposed features selected by mutual information
   can be used for instantaneous prediction of emotional state with an
   accuracy higher than traditional audio or visual features that are used

Abstract = {{A practical method for exploiting the neuromuscular coordination in a
   human arm posture to control a musculoskeletal robotic arm is proposed.
   The method enables the low-dimensional control of multiple muscles in
   the arm robot without considering the differences in the size and force
   balance between the human and artificial muscles. The central idea is
   based on the assumption that the equilibrium point (EP) of an arm is
   always located at its endpoint position while maintaining the posture on
   the horizontal plane. The mathematical formulation obtained using this
   physical constraint leads to the EP-based synergies that encode the
   polar coordinates in the task space. We tested this theory by extracting
   EP-based synergies from electromyography activities during human posture
   maintenance and implementing them for a musculoskeletal robotic arm. The
   results suggest EP-based synergies could be functional modules of muscle
   mechanical impedance which is an essential primitive for human motor

Abstract = {{Developing a musculoskeletal robot with multiple muscles is important
   for not only establishing a novel robot that achieves coordination with
   a human but also in understanding the framework of motor control in the
   human body. Our pioneering work proposed a biologically inspired control
   framework for multiple redundant muscles; however, very few practical
   results have been reported on controlling a musculoskeletal robot. This
   study focused on confirming the usability of the proposed biologically
   inspired control framework, which is referred to as equilibrium-point
   (EP)-based synergyies and is expressed by the activation balance of
   agonist-antagonist muscle pairs. Electromyography data obtained from the
   pedaling task of five subjects were analyzed based on the concept of the
   EP-based synergies, and were then used to control the musculoskeletal
   lower limb robot. Three EP-based synergies obtained from all the five
   subjects indicated that the musculoskeletal robot achieved forward
   pedaling. This indicates the utility of the EP-based synergies as well
   as the modularity of motor control in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Glitches are unnecessary transitions on logic signals that needlessly
   consume dynamic power. Glitches arise from imbalances in the
   combinational path delays to a signal, which may cause the signal to
   toggle multiple times in a given clock cycle before settling to its
   final value. In this paper, we propose a low-cost circuit structure that
   is able to eliminate a majority of glitches. The structure, which is
   incorporated into the output buffers of FPGA logic elements, suppresses
   pulses on buffer outputs whose duration is shorter than a configurable
   time window (set at the time of FPGA configuration). Glitches are
   thereby eliminated ``at the source{''} ensuring they do not propagate
   into the high-capacitance FPGA interconnect, saving power. An
   experimental study, using Altera commercial tools for power analysis,
   demonstrates that the proposed technique reduces 70\% of glitches, at a
   cost of 1\% reduction in speed performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a joint design of the routing strategy over the
   fronthaul network and the transmission strategy over the wireless
   network in a downlink cloud radio access network (C-RAN), in which the
   remote radio heads (RRHs) are connected to the central processor (CP)
   via multi-hop routers. The data-sharing strategy is adopted, where the
   CP multicasts each user's data to all the RRHs serving this user via the
   multi-hop fronthaul network, which then cooperatively serve the users
   through joint beamforming. Such a setting naturally provides an
   opportunity for applying the network coding technique to efficiently
   reduce the multicast traffic in the fronthaul network. A novel
   cross-layer optimization framework is then investigated, where the RRH's
   beamforming vectors as well as the user-RRH association in the
   physical-layer, and the network coding design in the network-layer are
   jointly optimized to maximize the throughput of C-RAN subject to
   fronthaul link capacity constraints. This paper proposes a two-stage
   algorithm to solve this problem using the techniques of sparse
   optimization and successive convex approximation. Simulation results are
   provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed cross-layer design
   in the downlink multi-hop C-RAN.}},

Abstract = {{Hardware calibration is a necessary procedure to establish the
   reciprocity of the uplink (UL) and downlink channels (DL) in a time
   division duplex (TDD) mode of operation. In practice, any calibration
   scheme is prone to errors. Such errors result in a residual mismatch
   between UL and DL channels, which, in turn, can significantly affect the
   quality of DL transmission. In this paper, we study the effects of the
   hardware calibration errors on the per-user achievable ergodic rate in
   the DL of a single cell multi-user massive MIMO system. We consider
   zero-forcing (ZF) precoding under two different scenarios: first we
   assume that the UL channel state information (CSI) is known perfectly at
   the BS; we then consider the case where CSI is acquired with minimum
   mean squared error (MMSE) estimation. We verify the accuracy of our
   analytical results through numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless virtualization is a promising approach to foster innovation and
   prevent the ossification of wireless networks. Within a virtualized
   wireless network, multiple network slices, or virtual operators (VO),
   are co-hosted on the same physical infrastructure. A fundamental
   question in this environment is which multiplexing technique, TDMA, FDMA
   or SDMA, should be used to slice the network among the VOs. Another
   related question is how should the stochastic arrival process affect the
   slicing and QoS criteria. To answer these two questions, we study the
   problem of QoS-aware joint admission control and network slicing. Due to
   the NP-hardness of the problem, we approach it using a heuristic
   algorithm composed of three steps: spectrum allocation, admission
   control and spatial multiplexing. The proposed algorithm incorporates
   the effects of QoS and stochastic traffic. We study through simulations
   the benefits of joint spatial-frequency multiplexing over the static
   frequency slicing approach. Finally, our simulation results help shed
   some light on the trade-offs between frequency and spatial multiplexing
   as well as between QoS and utilization.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs) suffer from the serious
   problem of lack of energy self-sufficiency. Indeed, providing sensors
   with adequate energy over long periods is a major bottleneck in the
   implementation of WSNs. In this regard, energy harvesting (EH), i.e.,
   continuously capturing energy from ambient renewable sources, is a
   promising solution for low-power and low data-rate WSNs. The drawback is
   that the energy available to a sensor is random and this randomness
   forces the redesign of WSNs protocols. Our specific interest here is to
   enable the delivery of sensed data to a fusion center (FC) in a
   large-scale EH WSN. We propose a novel, energy-aware, opportunistic
   routing protocol in a large-scale EH WSN requiring multi-hop
   communication. In choosing the best forwarding partner, our proposed
   protocol considers the remaining energy at sensor nodes, their distances
   from the FC and the amount of data to be transmitted; importantly, we
   make no assumptions on prior knowledge of the network topology. As our
   numerical results show, the proposed protocol significantly increases
   the data delivery ratio as compared to the state-of-the-art. Our second
   contribution is to introduce an EH-aware manner for distributing sensors
   in the environment such that all nodes have approximately equal number
   of data transmissions independent of their locations.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient spectrum allocation is becoming more and more important in
   wireless networking. Auction is believed to be an effective way to
   address the problem of spectrum shortage, by dynamically redistributing
   spare channels among service providers. Combinatorial auction gives
   buyers the freedom to place bids on combinations of channels rather than
   individual channels. For example, continuous channels are easier to
   operate on and more valuable to buyers. Unlike conventional commodities,
   spectrum features spatial reusability, which depends on various
   transmission ranges of heterogeneous channels, making combinatorial
   spectrum auction more challenging. Existing works on combinatorial
   spectrum auction only consider a single seller who tries to minimize her
   cost. However, in multi-seller markets, each seller has a reserve price,
   below which the seller is reluctant to sell her channel. In this paper,
   we propose a combinatorial auction mechanism for multiple sellers with
   specified reserve prices. We design an efficient greedy algorithm to
   determine auction winners by the average virtual bids, which is decided
   by buyers' real bids and the reserve prices of channels. Simulation
   results show that our proposed auction mechanism can achieve higher
   social welfare than existing auction mechanisms without reserve prices.}},

Abstract = {{Feature selection from facial regions is a well-known approach to
   increase the performance of 2D image-based face recognition systems. In
   case of 3D modality, the approach of region-based feature selection for
   face recognition is relatively new. In this context, this paper presents
   an approach to evaluate the discrimination power of different regions of
   a 3D facial surface for its potential use in face recognition systems.
   We propose the use of weighted average of unit normal vector on the
   facial surface as the feature for region-based face recognition from 3D
   point cloud data (PCD). The iterative closest point algorithm is
   employed for the registration of segmented regions of facial point
   clouds. A metric based on angular distance between normals is introduced
   to indicate the similarity between two surfaces of same facial region.
   Finally, the intra class correlation based discrimination score is
   formulated to find out the key facial regions such as the eyes, nose,
   and mouth that are significant while recognizing a person with facial
   surface PCD.}},

Abstract = {{The Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method is widely used in signal
   and power integrity, applied electromagnetism, and physics.
   Unfortunately, its computational efficiency can be severely degraded for
   multiscale problems, where small and large features coexist. This
   scenario is common in signal and power integrity, because of the large
   aspect ratio of interconnects and power/ground planes. In this paper, we
   show how multiscale FDTD simulations can be accelerated with model order
   reduction. A detailed model for complex objects is first generated using
   a fine FDTD grid. The model is then compressed with model order
   reduction, and embedded into a main coarse grid. During this process,
   the stability limit of the reduced model can be also extended, enabling
   the use of a larger time step in the whole domain. Using a passivity
   argument, we are able to systematically guarantee the stability of the
   resulting scheme, which is a main novelty with respect to previous
   works. A numerical example with two reduced models shows the potential
   of the proposed ideas.}},

Abstract = {{The application of the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method to
   signal and power integrity problems is limited by the large aspect ratio
   of interconnects and by small skin depth at high frequency, which impose
   a very fine grid and long simulations. While local grid refinement can
   be used to overcome this issue, ensuring the stability of the resulting
   FDTD scheme is not trivial. We present a powerful stability theory for
   FDTD based on the concept of passivity. The theory is suitable to
   develop multiresolution FDTD methods with guaranteed stability. A simple
   and stable subgridding algorithm is derived. Numerical results show its
   potential for the efficient modeling of skin effect in interconnects.}},

Abstract = {{The Reach Control Problem (RCP) deals with driving the states of an
   affine system on a simplex to leave the simplex through a pre-determined
   facet. A necessary condition for the solvability of the RCP by a given
   feedback is that there are no closed-loop equilibria in the simplex. As
   a stepping stone to fully characterizing when equilibria can be removed
   from the simplex using feedback, this paper studies the geometric
   structure of open-loop equilibria. Using a triangulation in which the
   set of potential equilibria intersects the interior of the simplex, we
   prove that the equilibrium set contains at most one point, in both the
   single-input and multi-input case. We additionally improve on the
   currently available results on reach controllability to characterize
   when the closed-loop equilibria can be pushed off the simplex using
   affine feedback. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic

Abstract = {{As mass transport mechanisms, the spreading and mixing (dilution)
   processes of miscible contaminated compounds are fundamental to
   understanding reactive transport behaviors and transverse dispersion. In
   this study, the spreading and dilution processes of a miscible
   contaminated compound in a three-dimensional self-affine rough fracture
   were simulated with the coupled lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). Moment
   analysis and the Shannon entropy (dilution index) were employed to
   analyze the spreading and mixing processes, respectively. The
   corresponding results showed that the spreading process was anisotropic
   due to the heterogeneous aperture distribution. A compound was
   transported faster in a large aperture region than in a small aperture
   region due to the occurrence of preferential flow. Both the spreading
   and mixing processes were highly dependent on the fluid flow velocity
   and molecular diffusion. The calculated results of the dilution index
   showed that increasing the fluid flow velocity and molecular diffusion
   coefficient led to a higher increasing rate of the dilution index. (C)

Abstract = {{Substrate integrated waveguides (SIWs) are a popular choice for
   implementing compact slotted waveguide leakywave antennas (LWAs).
   However, certain design parameters that may not seem important can have
   a significant impact on the radiation performance of such structures.
   The junction between the end of the SIW and the microstrip line
   typically used to terminate such structures can result in spurious
   radiation if the extent of the substrate on which the antenna is printed
   is not judiciously chosen. Here, it is shown that the extent of the
   substrate beyond the via walls, as well as the length of the microstrip
   line used to terminate SIWs, can have a non-trivial impact on the gain
   and scanning performance of SIW LWAs. In many cases, this spurious
   radiation can easily be missed since it does not occur in the principle
   cuts of the radiation pattern. An increased extension of substrate as
   well as a shorter terminating microstrip line effectively eliminates the
   spurious beam.}},

   magnetic polarizabilities, and magnetoelectric coupling, allow control
   of both the aperture field phase and the BMS reflection coefficient,
   without requiring active or lossy components. Subsequently, we use this
   degree of freedom to exclusively excite the highest-order fast lateral
   mode, guaranteeing optimal aperture illumination efficiency for
   arbitrarily-large apertures, without incurring edge-taper losses. We
   verify our semianalytical calculations with full-wave simulations,
   showing that the proposed antenna can outperform our
   previously-introduced cavity-excited Huygens' metasurface antenna,
   offering a simple and efficient design for compact high-gain antennas.}},

Abstract = {{Employment of ground-based positioning systems has been consistently
   growing over the past decades due to the growing number of applications
   that require location information where the conventional satellite-based
   systems have limitations. Such systems have been successfully adopted in
   the context of wireless emergency services, tactical military
   operations, and various other applications offering location based
   services. In current and previous generation of cellular systems, i.e.,
   3G, 4G, and LIE, the base stations, which have known locations, have
   been assumed to be stationary and fixed. However, with the possibility
   of having mobile relays in 5G networks, there is a demand for novel
   algorithms that address the challenges that did not exist in the
   previous generations of localization systems. This paper includes a
   review of various fundamental techniques, current trends, and
   state-of-the-art systems and algorithms employed in wireless position
   estimation using moving receivers. Subsequently, performance criteria
   comparisons are given for the aforementioned techniques and systems.
   Moreover, a discussion addressing potential research directions when
   dealing with moving receivers, e.g., receiver's movement pattern for
   efficient and accurate localization, non-line-of-sight problem, sensor
   fusion, and cooperative localization, is briefly given.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and fast detection of event related potential (ERP) components
   is an unresolved issue in neuroscience and critical health care.
   Mismatch negativity (MMN) is a component of the ERP to an odd stimulus
   in a sequence of identical stimuli which has good correlation with coma
   awakening. All of the previous studies for MMN detection are based on
   visual inspection of the averaged ERPs (over a long recording time) by a
   skilled neurophysiologist. However, in practical situations, such an
   expert may not be available or familiar with all aspects of evoked
   potential methods. Further, we may miss important clinically essential
   events due to the implicit averaging process used to acquire the ERPs.
   In this paper we propose a practical machine learning approach for
   automatic and continuous assessment of the ERPs for detecting the
   presence of the MMN component. The proposed method is realized in a
   classification framework. Performance of the proposed method is
   demonstrated on 22 healthy subjects through a leave-one subject-out
   strategy where the MMN components are identified with about 93\%
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS) is a minimally invasive yet
   effective therapy for treating overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with
   electrical stimulations applied at 20 Hz coupled with amplitudes
   approximating the foot-twitch threshold (T). However, pre-clinical
   studies indicate that PTNS-evoked bladder reflexes require stimulation
   amplitudes exceeding 2T. The objective of this work was to evaluate the
   presence of secondary low-threshold sensory pathways in the hind-limb
   region that can be a potential target of activation during clinical PTNS
   set-up. Given the close proximity of the electrode tip and the cutaneous
   branches in the lower leg, we hypothesized the concomitant activation of
   saphenous nerve (SAFN) afferents during percutaneous PTNS. To this end,
   urodynamic model was established in ten anesthetized rats to investigate
   (1) the isolated role of SAFN trunk in modulating bladder activity and
   (2) characterize frequency-dependent changes in inhibitory response at
   low stimulation amplitudes. Our pre-clinical findings suggest that
   direct stimulation of SAFN can elicit robust and consistent inhibitory
   effects at 20 Hz. This novel inhibitory reflex may rationalize the
   therapeutic effects of clinical PTNS therapy and support the feasibility
   of enhancing the current algorithm of incontinence care.}},

Abstract = {{Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is a minimally invasive and
   effective treatment for overactive bladder (OAB). However, clinical
   trials show that positive therapeutic outcomes among patients are
   difficult to predict (failure rate = 35\% to 50\%). Inconsistencies in
   the stimulation amplitudes used clinically and those used in preclinical
   animal studies led us to hypothesize that OAB therapy involves a
   secondary bladder-inhibitory pathway. In this paper, we implemented and
   tested a computer model of the human lower leg that investigated the
   differential activation of the saphenous nerve (SAFN) and tibial nerve
   (TN) during percutaneous electrical stimulation. Our preliminary
   findings show that concomitant activation of SAFN branches occurs during
   PTNS, which suggests the possibility that the SAFN may influence the

Abstract = {{Snoring is common in the general population and the irregularity could
   lead to the presence of Obstructive sleep apnea. Diagnosis of OSA could
   therefore be made by snoring sound analysis. However, there is still a
   shortage of robust methods to automatically detect snoring sounds

   novel method based on neural network is proposed to classify breathing
   sound episodes from snoring and non-snoring sound segments. Our snore
   detection algorithm was applied to the tracheal sounds of nine
   individuals with different OSA severities. On the testing dataset, the
   classifier achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 95.9\% and 97.6\%
   respectively. Our results indicate that using such a method could help
   to detect snoring sounds with high accuracy which would be useful in the

   (cTPR). For this purpose, we introduce a novel measure called the
   contact information metric (CIM). Selectivity was tested in 2 noise
   settings, one in which white Gaussian noise was added inside the nerve
   cuff electrode and the other in which electromyogram (EMG) noise was
   added outside the nerve cuff electrode. The mean CIMs values calculated
   for the best 8 contacts were 3.42 +/- 6.25, 2.70 +/- 3.37, and 3.65 +/-
   1.90 for the TPR, the CAR and the cTPR, respectively, in the case of EMG
   noise added outside the nerve cuff electrode. This study shows that the
   use of cTPR reference is the optimal choice for selectivity when using a
   multi-contact nerve cuff electrode which contains off-centre rings.}},

Abstract = {{Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS) is an effective overactive
   bladder (OAB) therapy where electrical pulses are typically delivered
   once per week in a 12-week stimulation regime. While the mechanism of
   action remains unknown, effective long-term delivery of PTNS has
   recently become a subject of concern. To this end, a multi-contact
   electrode was surgically placed in the hind limb region of anesthetized
   cats to (1) investigate the feasibility of using a wirelessly powered
   system to stimulate PTN afferents and (2) characterize implant-driven
   effects of stimulation frequency on modulating bladder activity. Using
   an isovolumetric model, short-duration, supra-threshold stimulation
   trials were applied with frequencies ranging from 2-20 Hz. The results
   provide first pre-clinical evidence of frequency-dependent modulation of
   bladder function supporting the use of a novel therapeutic approach that
   can be clinically translated to potentially address multiple symptoms of
   lower urinary tract system.}},

   neurostimulation therapies (e. g., epilepsy, obstructive sleep apnea),
   the use of this electrode as part of a closed-up controlled system is
   very limited. The literature points to high noise content (i. e., poor
   signal-to-noise ratio, SNR) as the primary reason for not using bipolar
   NCEs to record neural activity. In fact, over the past several decades,
   the pseudo-tripolar NCEs, the symmetric configuration of this electrode
   array (i. e., electrically-shorted side contacts) makes it very
   difficult to obtain directional information from the recorded neural
   activity (efferent vs. afferent). In this study, we investigated the
   feasibility of using a bipolar NCE to achieve low-noise,
   directionally-sensitive recording of peripheral nerve activity.}},

Abstract = {{novel coding scheme is proposed to speed up distributed computation
   through a form of approximate computing. It is known that task
   replication can greatly mitigate the ``straggler effect{''} in cloud
   computing, wherein an overall computation can be significantly delayed
   by slowed processing nodes (or ``stragglers{''}). It has also been
   demonstrated that, in certain contexts, ideas of error-correction coding
   can more efficiently deal with stragglers than pure replication. The
   approach proposed herein builds on these earlier observations through an
   ``anytime{''} approach to approximate computing. In this paradigm, over
   time one can produces approximate solutions of increasing accuracy. To
   accomplish this we first decompose a computational job in to tasks of
   various priorities. Next, we apply linear error correction coding to
   produce subtasks that are assigned to different processors. The
   decomposition used has a big effect on the type of anytime performance
   we attain. We study this scheme in a general framework in terms of the
   expected cost of the approximate solution. We further explore the
   approach in the context of vector-matrix multiplication. The proposed
   construction is numerically studied and, in comparison to previous work,
   demonstrates a significant improvement in the accuracy/latency
   trade-off.}},

   around a known solution of the power flow equations are considered.
   Leveraging the equivalent linear matrix inequality formulation for the

   yielding optimal network steady state and an explicit feedback gain for
   minimum transient control cost. Numerical tests on a standard power

Abstract = {{Flexible loads can provide services such as load shifting and regulation
   to power system operators through demand response. A system operator
   must know the aggregate capabilities of a load population to use it in
   scheduling and dispatch routines such as optimal power flow and unit
   commitment. It is not practical for a system operator to model every
   single load because it would compromise tractability and require
   potentially unavailable information. A key challenge for load
   aggregators is to develop low-order models of load aggregations that
   system operators can use in their operating routines.
   In this paper, we develop a simple approximation for loads modeled by
   linear, second-order cone, and semidefinite constraints. It is an outer
   approximation of the Minkowski sum, the exact computation of which is
   intractable. We apply the outer approximation to loads with convex
   quadratic apparent power constraints and uncertainty modeled with
   second-order cone constraints.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a gossip approach for finding a Nash equilibrium in a
   distributed multi-player network game. We extend previous results on
   Nash equilibrium seeking to the case when the players' cost functions
   may be affected by the actions of any subset of players. An interference
   graph is employed to illustrate the partially-coupled cost functions and
   the asymmetric information requirements. For a given interference graph,
   we design a generalized communication graph so that players with
   possibly partially-coupled cost functions exchange only their required
   information and make decisions based on them. Using a set of standard
   assumptions on the cost functions, interference and communication
   graphs, we prove almost sure convergence to a Nash equilibrium for
   diminishing step sizes. We then quantify the effect of the second
   largest eigenvalue of the expected communication matrix on the
   convergence rate, and illustrate the trade-off between the parameters
   associated with the communication and the interference graphs. Finally,
   the efficacy of the proposed algorithm on a large-scale networked game
   is demonstrated via simulation.}},

Abstract = {{A distributed system's interconnection structure emerges as a pattern in
   the system matrices. This pattern must be preserved through system
   analysis and control synthesis, and much has been written on these
   topics. A problem which has not received any attention to date is how to
   identify a pattern, given the linear system model. This paper proposes a
   method for identifying a pattern that is mathematically encoded through
   a commuting relationship with a base matrix. Our method generates the
   commuting relationship, when it exists. When it does not exist, our
   method produces the closest approximation to the commuting relationship.
   Further, it indicates which additional subsystem interconnections would
   render it achievable. We provide both an exact solution and an almost
   sure polynomial-time solution in the probabilistic sense. Finally, we
   give several examples to demonstrate the utility of this method for
   finding patterns in distributed systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider a variant of the well known minimum cost flow
   problem in a directed network with nonconvex costs and integer flows. We
   formulate the problem in a multi-player setup, whereby we associate one
   player with each arc of the network. The goal of each player is to
   minimize its nonconvex cost that depends on the integer flow through the
   arc subject to the network flow constraints. In this multi-player setup,
   a Pareto optimal point is justified to be an efficient solution concept.
   We propose an algorithm to compute a Pareto optimal point. We show that,
   although the problem in its original form has coupled constraints
   binding every player, there exists an equivalent variable transformation
   that decouples the optimization problems for a number of players. Each
   of the decoupled players can solve its optimization problem in a
   decentralized manner. We use the solutions of those decoupled players to
   transform the optimization problems for the rest of the players using
   consensus constraints. Then we present algorithms based on algebraic
   geometry to find a Pareto optimal point.}},

Abstract = {{Significant evidence suggests protein-level or metabolic control is
   widespread and important in metabolic networks. However, the biophysical
   interactions responsible for flux control at the metabolic level are not
   nearly as well-characterized as those which are responsible for control
   at other biological levels, such as transcriptional regulation. This
   knowledge gap is a limiting factor in the application of engineered
   protein-level regulation in Metabolic Engineering for the rational and
   sensitive control of pathway flux. Here we apply an in silico dynamic
   numerical optimization approach to a representative branched pathway to
   understand how engineered allosteric regulation could be used to control
   flux. We consider inhibition sensitivity as a hypothetical tunable
   parameter to demonstrate that integration of allosteric and
   transcriptional regulation is necessary to stably achieve arbitrary
   targets for both downstream metabolite concentrations. We further show
   that the steady-state ratio of these metabolites can be controlled by
   tuning the sensitivity of allostery at the branch point. Finally, we
   demonstrate that system dynamics dictate which type of engineered
   control is optimal. This work has implications for the co-optimization
   of transcriptional and allosteric regulatory systems in metabolic
   networks and provides a framework for the design of allosteric
   regulation in engineered metabolisms. (C) 2016 IFAC (International

   designed and implemented a set of algorithms that detect four traffic
   patterns each of which detects a specific type of event. The platform
   reports the event specifications no later than 20 seconds that provides
   the opportunity to react promptly to incidents in highways. Also, we
   configure Sipresk to process traffic sensor data from January 2015 to
   June 2016 for detection and classification of events for every single
   day. In less than 2 minutes, Sipresk is able to process 24 hours of data

   video capture. The method uses a cost function to express measurement
   uncertainty, and a ``cross-uncertainty{''} metric between different
   exposures, fed into a dynamic control system. The system is designed to
   asymptotically approach an optimal distribution of camera exposure
   control settings, under varying lighting conditions and motion, to
   capture an extremely high dynamic range for HDR compositing.}},

   capacity-to-sense propagates through space. Physical-Fourier-Amplitude

Abstract = {{Recently we proposed relative observability for supervisory control of
   discrete-event systems under partial observation. Relative observability
   is closed under set unions and hence there exists the supremal
   relatively observable sublanguage of a given language. In this paper we
   present a new characterization of relative observability, based on which
   we design an algorithm that computes the supremal sublanguage. This
   algorithm is formulated in terms of languages, thereby separating out
   the linguistic essence of the problem from the implementational aspects
   of state computation using automaton models. Exploiting the linguistic
   concept of support based on Nerode equivalence, we prove that for
   regular languages the algorithm is finitely convergent to the supremal
   sublanguage.}},

   addresses the problem of synchronization control for a class of

   the information available for feedback is a mean field quantity. It is
   shown that, under mean field static feedback, the level of

Abstract = {{As cloud based platforms become more popular, it becomes an essential
   task for the cloud administrator to efficiently manage the costly
   hardware resources in the cloud environment. Prompt action should be
   taken whenever hardware resources are faulty, or configured and utilized
   in a way that causes application performance degradation, hence poor
   quality of service. In this paper, we propose a semantic aware technique
   based on neural network learning and pattern recognition in order to
   provide automated, real-time support for resource anomaly detection. We
   incorporate application semantics to narrow down the scope of the
   learning and detection phase, thus enabling our machine learning
   technique to work at a very low overhead when executed online. As our
   method runs ``life-long{''} on monitored resource usage on the cloud, in
   case of wrong prediction, we can leverage administrator feedback to
   improve prediction on future runs. This feedback directed scheme with
   the attached context helps us to achieve an anomaly detection accuracy
   of as high as 98.3\% in our experimental evaluation, and can be easily
   used in conjunction with other anomaly detection techniques for the
   cloud.}},

   new modalities for human-machine interaction such as gesture-based
   interaction via surface electromyograph (EMG). An important challenge
   when performing EMG gesture recognition is to temporally segment the

   paper proposes an approach for EMG data segmentation, by formulating the
   segmentation problem as a classification task, where a classifier is
   used to label each data point as either a segment point or a non-segment
   point. The proposed EMG segmentation approach is used to recognize 9
   hand gestures from forearm EMG data of 10 participants and a balanced

Abstract = {{Future smart-home functionalities enable users to manage their home
   appliances through a single application by connecting home appliances
   through an integrated platform and server. In the smart home, a Home
   Energy Management System (HEMS) is necessary to monitor, control and
   optimize electrical generation and consumption. On the other hand Demand
   Response (DR) provides an opportunity for consumers to play a
   significant role in the operation of the electrical grid by reducing or
   shifting their electricity usage during peak periods in response to
   time-based rates or other forms of financial incentives. In this paper
   we propose an autonomous Demand-Side Management (DSM) model to control
   the residential load of customers equipped with local power storage
   facilities as an auxiliary source of energy. In our proposed model the
   power consumption level of local devices, the amount of power being
   demanded from both local storage facilities and local utility companies
   are scheduled using a bi-level quadratic optimization approach of a
   well-defined convex cost function. Therefore we show that this goal can
   be fulfilled with a bi-level scheduler unit installed inside the smart
   meters. In addition our proposed model can also achieve the global
   optimal performance in terms of energy minimization cost at the Nash
   equilibrium of a formulated non-cooperative game. We also extend our DSM
   model to a two tiers cloud computing environment in which both customers
   and utility companies participate on it.}},

   paper, we present a model for the GTA transportation network. While the
   model enables big data transportation applications to run in real time,
   its building process implied intensive work with big data. Within this
   paper, we show the structure, the calibration, and the outputs of the
   model. Moreover, some applications, which use the proposed model, are
   presented. These big data applications are a step towards the smart city
   of Toronto. Finally, we conclude with some thoughts of future work and
   the next generation of big data models.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a novel adaptive fault tolerant cooperative

   multiagent systems with a timevarying active leader, subject to
   constraints on the control input and agents' output. Each follower node
   has distinct nonlinear dynamics with both parametric and nonparametric
   uncertainties. Both multiplicative and additive actuator faults are
   considered. We show that under the proposed scheme, exponential
   convergence of the cooperative output tracking error into a small set
   around zero is guaranteed, while the constraint requirements on the
   system output will not be violated during operation, despite the
   presence of actuator faults and system uncertainties. State vectors of
   the agents and all other closed loop signals are shown to be bounded. An
   illustrative example is presented to further demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed cooperative output tracking control
   scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Presently, renewable power plants participating in electricity markets
   receive payments at a market price determined by the marginal cost of
   the marginal generator, generally a conventional power plant. In a
   market with only renewables, market clearing prices would be determined
   by the marginal cost of renewable power plants, which is generally close
   to zero, resulting in capital cost recovery problems for renewable power
   producers. Hence, in a market with only renewables, a new price-setting
   mechanism is needed which does not depend on marginal costs.
   In this paper, we analyze a model of such a mechanism for when all
   energy production is from renewable power plants such as wind and solar.
   We consider a mechanism in which producers bid single prices instead of
   supply functions. While such a price has no physical basis, it enables
   producers to recover sunk costs and parallels pricing in less regulated,
   lowmarginal cost industries like software and digital media.
   We do not advocate the adoption of this mechanism, but rather find it
   useful for understanding renewable-only markets because it is amenable
   to analysis of strategic behavior under uncertainty. Specifically, we
   analyze a game between two renewable producers with random capacities
   described by arbitrary probability distributions. The producers compete
   to fulfill a random demand. We find that symmetry (in terms of
   size/parameters) among producers and variance in producer capacities
   tend to increase competition. We demonstrate our results via several
   case studies.}},

   Alloy Nanostructures with 3D Coupled Dynamic Phase-Field Theories}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{The behavior of shape memory alloy (SMA) nanostructures is influenced by
   strain rate and temperature evolution during dynamic loading. The
   coupling between temperature, strain, and strain rate is essential to
   capture inherent thermomechanical behavior in SMAs. In this paper, we
   propose a new 3D phase-field model that accounts for two-way coupling
   between mechanical and thermal physics. We use the
   strain-basedGinzburg-Landau potential for cubic-to-tetragonal phase
   transformations. The variational formulation of the developedmodel is
   implemented in the isogeometric analysis framework to overcome numerical
   challenges. We have observed a complete disappearance of the
   out-of-plane martensitic variant in a very high aspect ratio SMA domain
   as well as the presence of three variants in equal portions in a
   lowaspect ratio SMAdomain. Thedependence of different boundary
   conditions on the microstructure morphology has been examined
   energetically. The tensile tests on rectangular prism nanowires, using
   the displacement based loading, demonstrate the shape memory effect and
   pseudoelastic behavior. We have also observed that higher strain rates,
   as well as the lower aspect ratio domains, resulting in high yield
   stress and phase transformations occur at higher stress during dynamic
   axial loading.}},

Abstract = {{Although more than half of the Earth's population live in urban areas,
   we know remarkably little about most cities and what we do know is
   incomplete (lack of coverage) and inconsistent (varying definitions and
   scale). While there have been considerable advances in the derivation of
   a global urban mask using satellite information, the complexity of urban
   structures, the heterogeneity of materials, and the multiplicity of
   spectral properties have impeded the derivation of universal urban
   structural types (UST). Further, the variety of UST typologies severely
   limits the comparability of such studies and although a common and
   generic description of urban structures is an essential requirement for
   the universal mapping of urban structures, such a standard scheme is
   still lacking. More recently, there have been two developments in urban
   mapping that have the potential for providing a standard approach: the
   Local Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme (used by the World Urban Database and
   Access Portal Tools project) and the Global Human Settlement Layer
   (GHSL) methodology by JRC. In this paper the LCZ scheme and the GHSL
   LABEL product were compared for selected cities. The comparison between
   both datasets revealed a good agreement at city and coarse scale, while
   the contingency at pixel scale was limited due to the mismatch in grid
   resolution and typology. At a 1 km scale, built-up as well as open and
   compact classes showed very good agreement in terms of correlation
   coefficient and mean absolute distance, spatial pattern, and radial
   distribution as a function of distance from town, which indicates that a
   decomposition relevant for modelling applications could be derived from
   both. On the other hand, specific problems were found for both datasets,
   which are discussed along with their general advantages and
   disadvantages as a standard for UST classification in urban remote
   sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Upper-level ontologies provide an account of the most basic, domain
   independent entities, such as time, space, objects and processes. They
   are intended to be broadly reused, among others, during ontology
   engineering tasks, such as ontology building and integration. Ontology
   verification is the process by which a theory is checked to rule out its
   unintended models, and possibly characterize missing intended ones. In
   this paper, we translate into first-order logic, modularize, and verify
   the subtheory of location of entities in space and time of the Suggested
   Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO). As a result, we propose the addition of
   some axioms that rule out unintended models in SUMO, the correction of
   others, and make available a modularized version of SUMO
   characterization of location of entities in time and space represented
   in standard first-order logic.}},

Abstract = {{Apache Spark has become one of the most popular engines for big data
   processing. Spark provides a platform-independent, high-abstraction
   programming paradigm for large-scale data processing by leveraging the
   Java framework. Though it provides software portability across various
   machines, Java also limits the performance of distributed environments,
   such as Spark. While it may be unrealistic to rewrite platforms like
   Spark in a faster language, a more viable approach to mitigate its poor
   performance is to accelerate the computations while still working within
   the Java-based framework. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of
   incorporating FPGA acceleration into Spark, and uses a MapReduce
   implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm to show that
   acceleration is possible even when using a hardware platform that is not
   well-optimized for performance. An important feature of our approach is
   that the use of FPGAs is completely transparent to the user through the
   use of library functions, which is a common way by which users access
   functions provided by Spark. Power users can further develop other
   computations using high-level synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{Reliability evaluation plays an essential role in prognostics and health
   management for electronic systems. This paper proposes a new method for
   reliability evaluation of a degrading electronic system subject to
   competing risks of dependent soft and hard failures. The soft failure is
   described by a nonstationary Gamma process exceeding the predefined
   critical level. In the previous works the failure modes were considered
   to be independent, while in this paper the dependent relationship is
   facilitated using the Cox's proportional hazard model that incorporates
   the degradation process as a time-varying covariate. To make the
   evaluation feasible, an approximation technique is applied in both
   degradation path and time axis, thereby all the reliability quantities
   can be derived and calculated with basic manipulations of the transition
   probability matrix. Finally, the performance and effectiveness of the
   proposed method are illustrated and analyzed in a numerical study.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout the Asia Pacific region, fish farming is a vital and growing
   source of food security and economic activity. Since 1970, aquaculture
   has maintained an average annual growth rate of 8.7\% in the region.
   Currently, almost 90\% of global aquaculture production currently takes
   place in Asia Pacific and over 20 million people are employed in the
   sector. This growth has been associated with a large increase in
   family-run backyard aquaculture and integrated agriculture-aquaculture
   reservoirs in areas like rural Vietnam. However, yields in those rural
   ponds have typically been low. This is. largely due to lack of aeration
   systems, which introduce oxygen into the pond water and allow for
   greater stocking densities, healthier fish, and greater yields. Aeration
   systems typically are not employed in these remote communities due to
   high capital costs, lack of access to reliable electricity, and
   prohibitive maintenance costs. To address this need, a low-cost
   solar-thermal aeration system for implementation in resource-constrained
   settings was devised. The system consists of a metallic solar collector
   and a heat transfer column, which induces convective circulation in the
   water by dissipating heat to the cooler, deeper layers of the pond. As a
   result of the circulation produced by the device, oxygen generated by
   phytoplankton at the top of the pond is distributed throughout the water
   column, preventing oxygen losses to the atmosphere due to surface
   supersaturation and increasing the overall pond oxygen content. This
   paper presents the system models developed to validate the concept,
   including a Computational. Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model and a diel
   Dissolved Oxygen (DO) simulation model. These models, when used in
   conjunction, can estimate the increase in DO to be expected by the
   introduction of passive aeration device. These models were tailored to
   represent two target test ponds in Bac Ninh, Vietnam. To calibrate the
   models, instrumentation measured relevant parameters including DO and
   water temperatures at various depths, wind speed, ambient air
   temperature, and solar irradiance. A description of the mechanical
   design, construction and installation of two full-scale prototypes is
   then discussed, and field results for the first month
   post-implementation are analyzed. The model and experimental results
   indicate that the device can improve the DO content at deep levels of
   the ponds (i.e. oxygen-depleted regions) and has the potential to
   improve aquaculture productivity in resource constrained settings.}},

Abstract = {{Affective states of a user provide important information for many
   applications such as, personalized information (e.g., multimedia
   content) retrieval/delivery or intelligent human-computer interface
   design. In recently years, physiological signals, Electroencephalogram
   (EEG) in particular, have been shown to be very effective in estimating
   a user's affective states during social interaction or under video or
   audio stimuli. However, due to the large number of parameters associated
   with the neural expression of emotion, there is still a lot of unknowns
   on the specific spatial and spectral correlation of the EEG signal and
   the affective states expression. To investigate on such correlation, two
   types of semi-supervised deep learning approaches, stacked denoising
   autoencoder (SDAE) and deep belief networks (DBN), were applied as
   application specific feature extractors for the affective states
   classification problem using EEG signals. To evaluate the efficacy of
   the proposed semi-supervised approaches, a subject-specific affective
   states classification experiment were carried out on the DEAP database
   to classify 2-dimensional affect states. The DBN based model achieved
   averaged F1 scores of 86.67\%, 86.60\% and 86.69\% for arousal, valence
   and liking states classification respectively, which has significantly
   improved the state-of-art classification performance. By examining the
   weight vectors at each layer, we were also able to gain insights on the
   spatial or spectral locations of the most discriminating features.
   Another main advantage of applying the semi-supervised learning methods
   is that only a small fraction of labeled data, e.g., 1/6 of the training
   samples, were used in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Group-based recreational activities have shown to have a number of
   health benefits for people of all ages. The handful of social robots
   designed to facilitate such activities are currently only able to
   implement a priori known recreational activities that have been
   pre-programmed by human experts. Once deployed in their intended
   facility, these robots are not able to learn new activities from
   non-expert humans. In this paper, we present the development of a novel
   learning from demonstration (LfD) system architecture for a social robot
   in order for it to learn from non-expert teachers the structure of an
   activity and monitor the execution of the new activity. In order to
   obtain user compliance, personalized persuasive strategies are also
   learned by the robot to use while implementing the activity during
   human-robot interactions (HRI) with the intended users. The architecture
   has been integrated into our socially assistive robot Tangy to learn the
   group-based activity Bingo. System performance experiments were
   conducted with Tangy to first learn to facilitate Bingo from non-expert
   teachers and then use the learned activity to physically facilitate
   Bingo with multiple users. The results showed Tangy was able to
   effectively and efficiently learn the new Bingo activity structure as
   well as personalize its persuasive strategies to individual users in
   order to obtain activity compliance.}},

Abstract = {{Millirobots have increasingly become popular over the past several
   years, especially for swarm-behavior studies, allowing researchers to
   run experiments with a large number of units in limited workspaces.
   However, as these robots have become smaller in size, their sensory
   capabilities and battery life have been reduced. A number of these have
   also been customized, with few off-the shelf components, exhibiting
   integral (i.e., non-modular) designs. In response to the above concerns,
   this paper presents a novel open-source millirobot with a modular design
   based on the use of easily sourced elements and off-the-shelf
   components. The proposed milli-robot-Toronto (mROBerTO), is a 16x16
   mm(2) robot with a variety of sensors (including proximity, IMU,
   compass, ambient light, and camera). mROBerTO is capable of formation
   control using an IR emitter and detector add-on. It can also communicate
   via Bluetooth Smart, ANT+, or both concurrently. It is equipped with an
   ARM processor for handling complex tasks and has a flash memory of 256
   KB with over-the-air programming capability.}},

Abstract = {{Micromanipulation of individual biological cells, such as embryos during
   preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), is a delicate and
   time-consuming task. Two major procedures in PGD include the rotation of
   the embryo to gain a more favorable position for zona breaching, and the
   extraction of a blastomere after an opening has been made in the zona
   pellucida. Rotation tracking of cleavage-stage embryos has not been
   reported given their lack of distinctive features. In this manuscript, a
   geometric model for partially determining the three dimensional (3-D)
   angular position of 2-cell embryos using two dimensional (2-D)
   microscopic brightfield images was derived and verified using a computer
   generated model. This model was then applied using computer vision
   algorithms on a rotating cleavage-stage mouse embryo, demonstrating
   partial 3-D rotation tracking. Furthermore, embryo micromanipulation
   tasks are typically performed manually using micropipettes.
   Technological advances have made automation of these tasks possible.
   This manuscript also presents computer vision algorithms for the
   segmentation and calibration of micropipettes. The calibration procedure
   allowed automated position control of the micropipettes without the need
   for real-time vision feedback using micropipette recognition algorithms,
   and effective position control was verified using semi-automated
   blastomere extraction experiments. This manuscript presents preliminary
   work towards the automation of cell manipulation procedures.}},

Abstract = {{We present a kinetostatic model for a needle-sized notched tube
   continuum joint design, and examine the impact that the design
   parameters have on both stiffness and joint kinematics. The joint is
   fabricated by removing a series of asymmetric notches from a metal tube.
   By fixing a cable to the distal end of the tube, and routing this tendon
   through the tube's lumen, the joint can be actuated in bending. This
   simple cutting pattern allows for impressive performance compared to
   other mechanisms of similar size. However, selecting the cutting
   geometry using kinematics alone results in many redundant solutions.
   Since the notches significantly affect the overall structure's
   stiffness, and limit the maximum forces that it can transmit, a
   stiffness model can be used to constrain the design-space. Further,
   because the notch geometry represents a non-prismatic beam
   configuration, modelling the force-deflection behavior is nontrivial. We
   have approached this problem using a variation of Castigliano's 2nd
   Theorem, experimentally validated its performance with several test
   specimens, and analyzed the behavior of the model over a design space
   specific to neurosurgical applications. The outcomes of this study aim
   to aid in the design of joints given task-specific constraints,
   particularly within the field of surgical robotics.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile microrobots are typically fabricated in a multi-step
   microfabrication process and then transported into an enclosed workspace
   for operation. This paper presents a new, 3D printing inspired method
   for in-situ fabrication of mobile magnetic microrobots with complex
   topology from a polymer filament on demand directly inside an enclosed
   operational environment. Through the use of a tip magnet on the
   filament, the target shape is formed by magnetic guidance from external
   electromagnetic coils which wirelessly project fields into the workspace
   as the filament is fed through a hot needle which is inserted into the
   workspace. A bending model and a shape planner are developed for
   predicting and controlling the fabrication process. Magnetically-active
   millimeter-scale robotic devices of different shapes and sizes are
   fabricated using polylactic acid (PLA) filament with diameter as small
   as 50 mu m. As a demonstration of the in-situ formation of a functional
   microrobotic device, a force-sensing microrobot with integrated sensing
   spring is fabricated inside an enclosed space, and then is used to
   measure the manipulation force during a pushing experiment by optical
   deformation measurement. We thus show the utility of the fabrication
   method for creating complex microrobot shapes remotely in enclosed
   environments for advanced microrobotic applications, with the potential
   for scaled down applications in healthcare and microfluidics.}},

Journal = {{INFOR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{344-354}},
Abstract = {{We consider an asset allocation problem for a multi-asset fund where
   multiple decentralized managers implement investment strategies in
   separate asset classes that include alternative investments. In this
   setting it is common practice to use traditional asset allocation
   methodology (e.g. mean-variance optimization) to obtain optimal target
   weights and to compel investment managers to stay close to their
   targets. However, the sophistication and high level of specialization
   involved in alternative investments often result in deviations from
   target weights. Misallocations may require ad hoc investment adjustments
   to maintain feasibility of the fund with respect to overall risk and
   return profiles. We develop an asset allocation model that provides a
   range of portfolio allocations (i.e. bounds) for individual managers.
   These bounds represent the maximum flexibility managers have in their
   investments without affecting the overall portfolio characteristics.
   Based on out-of-sample testing, our model is more robust than
   traditional asset allocation methodology with respect to misallocations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a numerical study on fuel injection, ignition and
   combustion in a direct-injection natural gas (DING) engine with ignition
   assisted by a shielded glow plug (GP). The shield geometry is
   investigated by employing different sizes of elliptical shield opening
   and changing the position of the shield opening. The results simulated
   by KIVA-3V indicated that fuel ignition and combustion is very sensitive
   to the relative angle between the fuel injection and the shield opening,
   and the use of an elliptical opening for the glow plug shield can reduce
   ignition delay by 0.1-0.2ms for several specific combinations of the
   injection angle and shield opening size, compared to a circular shield
   opening. In addition, the numerical results also revealed that the
   natural gas ignition and flame propagation will be delayed by lowering a
   circular shield opening from the fuel jet center plane, due to the
   blocking effect of the shield to the fuel mixture, and hence it will
   reduce the DING performance by causing a longer ignition delay.}},

Abstract = {{Two aspects, occupants' comfort and structural safety, need to be

   maximum relative displacements between adjacent floors. To achieve the
   two objectives, the method with a combination of H. and energy-to-peak
   control is adopted to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the
   structural system with external perturbation. Using matrix
   transformation, the structural system is described by a state-space
   model. Then, the LMI-based conditions are deduced from the model to
   asymptotically stabilise the system. By solving these LMIs, the

Abstract = {{Taxis are increasingly becoming a prominent mobility mode in many major
   cities due to their accessibility and convenience. The growing number of
   taxi trips is cause for concern when vacant taxis are not distributed
   optimally within the city and are unable to find waiting passengers
   effectively. A way of improving taxi operations is to deploy a taxi
   dispatch system that considers the interrelated effects of taxis on
   other traffic modes. This paper presents a taxi dispatch model that
   takes into account the impact of taxis on normal traffic flows while
   optimizing for an effective dispatch policy. The presented model builds
   on the concept of the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) to represent
   the dynamic evolution of the traffic conditions. A model predictive
   control approach is devised to control the taxi dispatch system on a
   two-region city case study. The results show that the case of no
   network-scale taxi dispatching leads to severe accumulation of taxi
   passengers and vacant taxis in different regions whereas the dispatch
   system improves the taxi service performance and reduces traffic
   congestion by regulating the network towards the under-saturated
   condition.}},

   teaching paradigms on teaching a large-scale iOS programming MOOC
   consisting of 30,162 students. Our initial approach utilizes methods
   from our in-person lecturing experience. After launching the initial
   version of the course, we analyzed our performance and student feedback
   based on which we recreated and re-launched the entire course with a
   particular focus on clarity, video-quality, and packaging the topics in
   1-2 minute micro-modules. Based on feedback from 650 students, we
   observed that the overall lecture positive feedback increased from 65\%
   before our course adjustment to 83\% after the adjustment. In this paper
   we will provide a detailed overview of the lessons learned and the
   impact of our new teaching methods on each section of the course.

Abstract = {{We identify requirements and then propose a multi-layer architecture for
   smart city platforms (SCPs) based on an infrastructure layer operating
   as a multi-tier computing cloud using software-defined infrastructure
   (SDI), a platform layer providing data dissemination, and a
   Business-Intelligence-as-a-Service (BIaaS) layer offering analytics
   services to support smart city applications through open APIs. The
   multitier cloud enables the end-to-end orchestration of resources from
   sensor/actuator to smart edge and to core massive datacenter. The SDI
   provides the necessary heterogeneous resources, including computing,
   storage, GPUs, programmable hardware, sensors and networking, that are
   all managed jointly within a single domain or across multiple domains
   through federation. The data dissemination services allow individuals,
   organizations, and public agencies to share real-time or historical data
   within a domain or across domains. The analytics services provide
   intelligence by acting on data in support of decision-making. Public and
   private application providers use these services to create smart city
   applications. We discuss our experience implementing and operating a
   Canada-wide multitier SDI cloud and a Greater Toronto Area (GTA)
   platform for smart transportation, and we present extensions of these
   platforms to handle smart city applications across multiple domains.
   Throughout we describe how the proposed smart city platform supports
   extensibility and smartness, and how it has the desired attributes of
   replicability, scalability and interoperability.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important objectives of the GDL in a PEM fuel cell is
   the transport of reactant gases from the gas flow channels to the
   reaction sites at the catalyst layer. Most state-of-the-art GDLs are
   composed of a carbon fiber paper coated with a microporous layer
   composed of carbon nano-particles. This bi-layered GDL structure has
   been proven to provide significant improvement to the performance of PEM
   fuel cells.
   In order to improve our understanding of reactant transport through
   these GDL materials, it is important for us to characterize the
   structure of these materials. In this study, we use X-ray Computed
   Tomography (X-CT) to study the structure of the bi-layered GDL at the
   microscale. This work presents a unique segmentation routine developed
   in-house to identify the distinct components of the bi-layer GDL,
   isolating the carbon fiber, the microporous layer and the void regions
   as individual phases.
   Two commercially available GDL samples, SGL 35BA and SGL 35BC are
   segmented with this novel algorithm to obtain. unique porosity profiles.
   The MPL is identified separately in SGL 35BC along with the fibrous
   substrate region. It is observed that in the case of this sample, there
   is no region where only the MPL is present. The entire thickness of the
   MPL region is within the substrate region with fibers present throughout
   the MPL region. The substrate region is 300 mu m thick while the MPL is
   present up to 200 mu m from one side.}},

Abstract = {{The unintended accumulation of oxygen gas in polymer electrolyte
   membrane (PEM) electrolyzers has been recently identified as one of the
   main hurdles to achieving high cell efficiencies. Oxygen is a by-product
   of the electrochemical reaction used to produce hydrogen, and this
   oxygen must be removed in order to reduce mass transport losses. The
   porous transport layer (PTL) is a key component of the PEM electrolyzer
   which facilitates mass transport and electrical conductance. However,
   oxygen bubble accumulation potentially dominates the total mass
   transport losses during operation. Many experimental and computational
   studies have been performed in an attempt to understand the relationship
   between the morphology of the PTL and the voltage loss of the
   electrolyzer, but this relationship has yet to be fully defined. In this
   work, efforts towards identifying and understanding mass transport
   losses are discussed. PTL structural parameters that were shown to
   affect performance, such as bulk porosity, particle size, pore size,
   thickness, and permeability are reviewed. Visualization techniques that
   have been employed to investigate the behavior of oxygen bubbles are
   also discussed. This work presents a summary of the studies which have
   been performed to investigate the key parameters of the PTL that should
   be tailored for improved PEM electrolyzer performance.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of active flow control through synthetic jet actuator to
   reattach the stalled flow on a NACA 0025 at low Reynolds number was
   investigated experimentally. Wind tunnel tests were performed where
   boundary layer velocity profiles were measured by hot-wire anemometry.
   The effects of excitation frequency and momentum input, quantified by
   the blowing ratio were the focus of the measurements. Using both low-
   and high frequency actuation, the boundary layer was reattached in a
   time-averaged sense, however the mechanism of control was not the same.
   Low frequency excitation lead to oscillations in the boundary layer at
   the control frequency due to the passage of a vortex transporting
   high-momentum to the inner boundary layer Conversely, high frequency
   control caused a steady reattachment of the boundary layer.}},

Abstract = {{Large-eddy simulation and linear stability analysis were performed on a
   NACA 0025 airfoil at a chord Reynolds number of 105 and four angles of
   attack. The computations showed that the initial vortex roll-up quickly
   breaks down to three-dimensional turbulence. Flow separation was
   observed at all angles, whereas only the lowest angle of attack formed a
   laminar separation bubble due to flow transition occuring close to the
   airfoil surface. A Chebyshev collocation method was employed to solve
   the viscous and inviscid stability equations. Linear stability analysis
   demonstrated that high-frequency disturbances occur in the laminar
   separation bubble case, whereas lower frequencies are present for the
   fully separated angles of attack. The maximum disturbance growth rates
   were dampened with the addition of viscosity but negligible change in
   peak frequency was noted.}},

Title = {{Accessing the Subway in Toronto, Canada: Access Mode and Catchment Areas}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{52-61}},
Abstract = {{A buffer of 1/2 mi (805 m) is commonly used to define the service area
   of a subway (metro) station. This buffer is based on an approximation of
   the distance people are willing to walk to access the subway. This
   research compared the 1/2-mi pedestrian catchment area with the service
   areas reported in the Transportation Tomorrow Survey for access to the
   Toronto Transit Commission Subway System in Canada. This paper assesses
   the breakdown of access by mode to the subway and the pedestrian, bus
   streetcar, and automobile catchment areas of stations in Toronto. This
   analysis finds two major drawbacks with the use of the 1/2-mi pedestrian
   catchment area. The service areas of buses and streetcars that connect
   to the subway are critical; they account for more than a third of all
   riders. Spatially, the size and the shape of the service area predicted
   by the 1/2-mi approach do not accurately represent what is observed in
   Toronto. Pedestrian catchment areas are commonly less than \% mi in
   radius, and the bus streetcar and automobile catchment areas are often
   many times larger.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method for defining an index based on multi-level clustering of
   40-Hz auditory steady state response is presented in this paper. The
   index is a measure of depth of anaesthesia which can help monitoring
   depth of anaesthesia more closely and accurately. Multi-level
   expectation maximization (EM) is used for clustering the recorded 40-Hz
   auditory steady state response signals recorded from human subjects. The
   clustering information is used to define the depth of anaesthesia index.
   Rather than extracting the maximum amplitude and frequency at each cycle
   as clustering features, principal components analysis (PCA) is used for
   analyzing all samples of the cycles and projecting data into a lower
   dimension space. Both dimension reduction and clustering schemes are
   unsupervised methods, hence the algorithm does not need initial data
   labeling or training phase.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Smart Home Sensor Network (WSHSN) is a home-similar
   environment, where several wireless sensors can observe the home status
   and transmit the data streams to the Smart Home Information System
   (SHIS). Communication in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) in small living
   environments faces noise and data transmission speed problems.
   Especially in the case of employing mobile agents, the WSN restructures
   dynamically, hence the network performance reduces dramatically. On the
   one hand, the Internet of Things (IoT) concept includes a broad
   application of wireless devices, while on the other hand, the WSN
   throughput decreases significantly by application of more wireless
   devices. Network coding is a promising technique that can help to
   broaden the utilization of nodes in WSNs, while network throughput
   improves by the application of more wireless nodes. In this paper, IoT
   in WSHSN is modelled as a particular instance of butterfly network and
   the corresponding network coding based methodology aiming to increase
   the network throughput is proposed. A case study, supporting the theory
   of network coding in IoT in small living rooms, is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Two-tier cellular communication systems introduce a primary-secondary
   connectivity structure that improves the performance of cellular systems
   by offsetting the limitations of mobile User Equipment (UE) and
   providing superior high performing links to system Access Points (APs).
   This paper considers two-tier cellular systems employing vehicular-based
   primary nodes, with focus on enhancing the performance of primary links
   connecting vehicular nodes with system APs. Current vehicle mounted
   antenna designs do not take advantage of the relaxed energy and spacing
   constraints confining mobile UE antennas, thus limiting vehicle antenna
   gains to the elimination of vehicle penetration losses only. The
   employment of widely-spaced vehicular antenna arrays is proposed in this
   paper to enable the exploitation of high-order Multiple-Input
   Multiple-Output (MIMO) transmission schemes. Detailed system-level
   simulations are employed to compare the performance of various vehicular
   antenna array configurations for a wide range of deployment scenarios.
   When compared to narrowly-spaced antenna arrays with low-order MIMO
   transmission schemes, widely-spaced vehicular antenna arrays utilizing
   high-order MIMO transmission schemes are shown to provide substantial
   system coverage and capacity gains.}},

   computationally-intensive application and design a pipelined accelerator
   for calculating minimum distances between points and centroids. Our
   accelerator is unique in that it works in collaboration with CPU
   threads, accessing shared data in system memory. It achieves a speedup
   of 3.8X over a reference software implementation. Moreover, the combined
   use of CPU threads and the FPGA accelerator achieves a speedup of up to
   2.9X over using only the CPU threads and of up to 1.9X over using only
   the accelerator, depending on the number of CPU threads. We analyze the
   impact of data sharing between the CPU threads and the FPGA and reason
   that while this sharing increases memory traffic, it has little impact
   on overall performance.}},

Abstract = {{The standard ASTM C672/C672M-12 deicer salt scaling resistance test has
   been found to be overly aggressive to concretes containing slag cement
   or fly ash. It was compared to the recently adopted CSA A23.2-22A test
   method, based on the Quebec BNQ test, as well as several modifications,
   including use of an accelerated curing regime developed by Virginia
   (VADOT). Sixteen concrete mixtures were studied using high-alkali
   cement, low-alkali cement, grade 100 slag and grade 120 slag with slag
   contents of 0, 20, 35, and 50 \%. Vinsol resin air-entraining admixture
   (AEA) was compared to a synthetic AEA. Modifications to the test method
   used in this study resulted in improved deicer scaling performance of
   concretes containing slag and many of these modifications have been
   incorporated into the CSA A23.2-22A test method. While it was found that
   increasing the level of slag replacement resulted in increased scaling,
   it was found that for slag mixtures, the synthetic AEA provided an
   improved air void spacing factor, higher hardened air content, and
   improved scaling resistance compared to Vinsol resin AEA.}},

Abstract = {{Steel-reinforced concrete structures are prone to corrosion that cost
   billions of dollars in repair and maintenance every year in addition to
   loss of productivity. In 2010, the total annual cost of corrosion
   globally was estimated at US \$2.2 trillion which amounted to about 3\%
   of the world's GDP. Obviously, an alternative is needed to build
   sustainable infrastructure. Glass fibre reinforcement polymer (GFRP)
   bars present a feasible and cost effective solution to the steel
   corrosion problem in structures. Despite many advantages of GFRP, most
   designers are still reluctant to use GFRP as the main reinforcement in
   concrete members due to its different behavior than steel and a lack of
   experimental data.
   The aim of this paper is to develop a better understanding of the
   overall behaviour of GFRP as internal reinforcement so that they have
   better confidence in using it as a sustainable material. Significant
   results from an extensive experimental program underway at the
   University of Toronto are briefly presented. The part of the program
   discussed in this paper involved testing of 40 GFRP reinforced beams, 60
   GFRP direct tension specimens and 20 GFRP confined columns in which the
   behavior of GFRP-reinforced concrete in flexure, shear, tension and
   compression was investigated. A new tension-stiffening model was
   developed that significantly improved capability for the prediction of
   deflection and stiffness of GFRP-reinforced concrete beams. Another
   significant conclusion drawn from this research is that GFRP spirals not
   only can be used efficiently as primary lateral reinforcement in columns
   but also confine the concrete core more effectively than steel spirals.
   GFRP bars were also found to resist about 700 MPa compression which is
   about 60\% of their tensile capacity.}},

   relies on bit-serial compute units and on the parallelism that is
   naturally present within DNNs to improve performance and energy with no
   accuracy loss. In addition, STR provides a new degree of adaptivity
   enabling on-the-fly trade-offs among accuracy, performance, and energy.

   STR is 57\% more energy efficient than the baseline at a cost of 32\%

   per-bit precision control, STR allows the user to trade accuracy for
   further speedup and energy efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a multi-user mobile cloud computing system with a computing
   access point (CAP) where each mobile user has multiple dependent tasks
   to be processed using a round-by-round schedule. The CAP can either
   process the received tasks from mobile users or offload them to the
   cloud. In each round, we aim to jointly optimize the offloading
   decisions of all users and the CAP, together with communication and
   processing resource allocation, to minimize the overall cost of energy,
   computation, and the maximum delay among all users. Since the
   centralized optimization problem is non-convex and mobile users may not
   follow the obtained solution, we further formulate a mobile cloud
   offloading game. We show the existence of a Nash equilibrium (NE) of
   this game and propose an algorithm to attain the NE. Simulation results
   show that our proposed algorithm gives nearly optimal performance in
   terms of the total system cost under various parameter settings.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an ultrathin planar structure which equally splits the power
   of a normally-incident plane wave into two beams outgoing at oblique
   angles, without incurring reflections. The design is based on an
   omega-type bianisotropic metasurface (O-BMS), exhibiting electric and
   magnetic polarizability, as well as magnetoelectric coupling. We
   rigorously show that this class of metasurfaces can implement arbitrary
   field transformations with passive lossless components, as long as real
   power is locally conserved. By stipulating the fields corresponding to
   the beam-splitting functionality, we find the metasurface constituents
   that accurately satisfy the boundary conditions, and verify the design
   via full-wave simulations. Compared to recently proposed reflect-mode
   Huygens' metasurface beam splitters, the O-BMS works in transmit mode,
   its design follows an exact solution, and it is predicted to maintain
   the same splitting efficiency for arbitrarily-large angles.}},

   arrays. The device is based on a probe-fed shielded FP-LWA structure,
   with the standard partially-reflecting surface replaced by a
   metasurface. The cavity excitation is optimized to uniformly illuminate
   the aperture, forming radiating hot spots half-a-wavelength apart, while
   the metasurface imposes the linear phase required to promote directive
   radiation. This yields a probe-fed low-profile antenna with near-unity
   aperture illumination efficiency and no edge-taper losses. In previous
   work we have shown that a Huygens' metasurface can be used to that end;
   in this report we present an improved design featuring an omega-type

Abstract = {{Vector parabolic equation (VPE) offers a very efficient methodology for
   high fidelity modeling of wave propagation in complex environments.
   While the propagation environment can be discretized and represented in
   detail, the representation of radiating sources (such as transmitting
   antennas) requires the calculation, analytical if possible or numerical
   via another method such as ray-tracing, of the fields that the sources
   generate on the initial plane of the VPE model. These initial conditions
   are necessary for subsequently applying VPE. Addressing this significant
   limitation of VPE methods, we introduce a technique that allows one to
   directly embed antennas into a VPE mesh, via a Gaussian beam
   approximation of their radiated fields. Hence, the initial conditions
   for VPE are generated for practical antenna patterns, without invoking
   other techniques and with no compromise on the inherent efficiency of
   VPE. Comparisons of numerical results to experimental data demonstrate
   the validity and usefulness of the technique.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of big data processing frameworks, the performance of
   data-parallel applications is heavily affected by the time it takes to
   read input data, making it important to improve data locality. Existing
   methods in achieving data locality have primarily focused on selecting
   machines to place tasks of applications. Nevertheless, the set of
   machines that an application can choose from is determined by a cluster
   manager, which is oblivious to the location of data in existing resource
   sharing frameworks. In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate
   Custody, a new cluster management framework that helps to maximize data
   locality by allocating the executor processes with local access to data
   to those applications in need. Custody achieves this objective by
   dynamically collecting runtime information of an application's input
   data and by effectively allocating executors among and within
   applications through theoretic analyses of the data-aware resource
   sharing problem. With significantly better data locality, Custody avoids
   unnecessary network transfers and thus expedites job completion times.
   Our experimental results on a 100-node cluster demonstrate that Custody
   can improve the data locality for input tasks by 36.9\% in comparison
   with Spark's default cluster manager. Meanwhile, it reduces the job
   completion times by 14.9\% due to fewer network transfers.}},

Abstract = {{The mobile-target search problem has been, typically, addressed in the
   literature through the sole use of mobile agents. Recently, however, it
   has been shown that the use of static-sensor networks could
   significantly contribute to the likelihood of detecting a mobile target
   and in a shorter time.
   In this paper, thus, we propose a novel adaptive and optimal
   static-sensor network deployment strategy to detect un-trackable targets
   in unstructured environments. The strategy utilizes a probabilistic
   target-motion model representative of the demographic group to which the
   target belongs and real-time location history information to construct a
   target-location probability distribution function over the search
   region. The novelty of our strategy lies in the utilization of a
   time-varying target-location probability distribution in order to deploy
   sensors in a manner that is both maximally adaptive and optimal for
   every deployment.
   Network deployment for a wilderness search and rescue problem is also
   presented in detail as an example case. Furthermore, numerous factors
   that may influence the performance of our deployment strategy are
   discussed, including a network coverage comparative study.}},

Volume = {{17}},
Abstract = {{The JMLR study Do we need hundreds of classifiers to solve real world
   classification problems? benchmarks 179 classifiers in 17 families on
   121 data sets from the UCI repository and claims that ``the random
   forest is clearly the best family of classifier{''}. In this response,
   we show that the study's results are biased by the lack of a held-out
   test set and the exclusion of trials with errors. Further, the study's
   own statistical tests indicate that random forests do not have
   significantly higher percent accuracy than support vector machines and
   neural networks, calling into question the conclusion that random
   forests are the best classifiers.}},

Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{90-101}},
Abstract = {{Advancements in information and communication technologies have enabled
   transit agencies around the world to generate streams of data on a
   high-frequency basis. Increasingly, these agencies are interested in new
   methods of visualizing these data to communicate the results of their
   planning efforts, operational investments, and overall transit
   performance to decision makers and stakeholders. Most agencies today
   collect and provide numerous kinds of data, including Google's general
   transit feed specification schedule data, automatic vehicle location
   data, and automatic passenger count data. This paper aims to demonstrate
   the untapped potential of these data sources; specifically, the paper
   uses transit data from Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to generate performance
   measures that are of interest to both transit planners and marketing
   professionals. Some of these measures can also help in communicating the
   positive attributes of public transportation to the community.
   Performance measures are generated at different scales, including
   transit system, neighborhood, route, and stop levels. This paper expands
   on previous research on transit performance research and visualization
   by adopting currently available resources for so-called big data.}},

Abstract = {{The decoupling of control and data plane in software-defined networking
   (SDN) has been shown to be promising to improve routing performance in
   the context of intra-domain routing. The applicability of SDN in
   inter-domain routing, especially with respect to route convergence, has
   not been properly explored. In this work, we propose a mathematical
   model to quantify the BGP convergence time for inter-domain routing by
   capturing only the essential components in BGP convergence process.
   Based on the model and some practical observations, we study how SDN may
   help to facilitate the inter-domain routing. We further present a greedy
   algorithm that selects Autonomous Systems (ASes) for incremental SDN
   deployment with the objectives of minimizing the BGP convergence time.
   The simulation result based on the real world Internet topology confirms
   the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a general multi-user mobile cloud computing system where

   share the communication resource while offloading tasks to the cloud. We

   of energy, computation, and delay fir all users. The optimization
   problem is formulated as a non-convex quadratically constrained
   quadratic program, which is NP-hard in general. An efficient approximate
   solution is proposed by using separable semidelinite relaxation,
   fbllowed by recovery of the binary offloading decision and optimal
   allocation of the communication resource. For performance benchmark, we
   further propose a numerical lower bound of the minimum system cost. By
   comparison with this lower bound, our simulation results show that the
   proposed algorithm gives nearly optimal performance under various

Abstract = {{Dynamic spectrum access (DAS) is an efficient way to redistribute spare
   channels among users. Conventionally, dynamic spectrum access is
   conducted through (double) spectrum auction, where a third-party
   auctioneer collects bids from buyers and sellers, and determines the
   spectrum allocation. Rather than placing bids only on individual
   channels, combinatorial spectrum auction allows buyers to express their
   valuations for different combinations of channels. However, auction
   mechanisms are generally vulnerable to the collusion between the
   auctioneer and buyers or sellers. Furthermore, to find the optimal
   allocation in combinatorial auction is usually NP-hard. In this paper,
   we propose to leverage a many-to-many matching framework to realize
   combinatorial spectrum trading. Unlike traditional many-to-many matching
   problem, spectrum matching is more challenging, because spectrum
   allocation is interference-limited rather than quota-limited. To deal
   with this problem, we propose a novel matching algorithm, which takes
   buyers' interference relationship into consideration. We theoretically
   prove that the matching result is individual rational, strong pairwise
   stable and is a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium of the corresponding
   spectrum bargaining game. Simulation results show that the proposed
   algorithm can converge to a stable matching within a few iterations.}},

Abstract = {{Guaranteed performance for data-parallel applications is important for
   both service providers and cloud data centers that host such services. A
   job of data-parallel applications involves communication among multiple
   machines to transmit intermediate results. Such communication comprises
   a collection of parallel flows, which is abstracted as a coflow in
   recent proposals. In this paper, we study the problem of meeting
   deadlines for coflows in data center networks. Existing flow-level
   scheduling schemes are insufficient to guarantee the coflow-level
   performance, since a coflow can meet its deadline only when all its
   constituent flows finish on time. Due to the scarce bandwidth on the
   network bottleneck, it is vital to coordinate concurrent coflows to meet
   as many deadlines as possible. We present Chronos, a scheduling
   framework that captures the correlation of flows belonging to a coflow,
   and handles the resource allocation among multiple concurrent coflows.
   Chronos is work-conserving and starvation-free without integrating
   complicated admission control mechanisms. We show via extensive
   simulations on ns3 that Chronos can make 1.6x more coflows meet their
   deadlines compared to flow-level schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The software-defined approach of cloud radio access networks (C-RANs)
   enables supporting multiple virtual operators (VOs) on the same physical
   infrastructure. In this shared environment, a coordinator is needed to
   manage the sharing of resources between the VOs. Designing a coordinator
   is about striking a good balance between the flexibility given to the
   VOs, and the efficiency of the resource utilization. In this paper, we
   study the problem of coordinated scheduling in the multioperator
   cloud-RAN environment. We formulate the problem as a distributed
   scheduling performed by the VOs, after which they submit their resource
   requests to a centralized coordinator. The coordinator selects a subset
   of non-conflicting requests for transmission. We show that the problem
   in the general case is NP-hard. We then discuss two special cases and
   relate them to the existing communication protocols. By gaining insights
   from these two special cases, we propose a general heuristic, which
   works on any formulation of the problem, and is still able to provide
   close-to-optimum performance in the special cases we considered. The
   heuristic is shown to have some similarities to the neuro-computation
   techniques such as Hopfield-network. Finally, simulation results are
   provided to show the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a downlink Coordinated Multi Point (CoMP)
   transmission network, where the base stations (BSs) are connected to a
   central unit via backhaul links to serve mobile users (MUs). The
   objective is to jointly optimize the BS mode (active or sleep), MU
   association, and cooperative beamforming to minimize the total power
   consumption including backhauling power. We formulate the problem as a
   mixed-integer non-convex problem under the constraints of
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements and limited
   BS power. By exploiting a hidden convexity structure of the SINR, the
   problem is first transformed equivalently into a mixed-integer
   second-order core programming (MI-SOCP) problem. Due to the coupled
   integer variables, the complexity of exhaustive search grows
   exponentially with network size, which motivates developing
   low-complexity heuristic algorithms. We propose a novel Two-stage Rank
   Selection (TRS) method to approximately solve the coupled MI-SOCP

Abstract = {{To ensure numerical stability, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL)

   example and present a stable wave-equation based FDTD method with a
   simple solution procedure. The method is based on the eigen analysis of
   the FDTD solution structure and transforms the FDTD computation into
   simple computations of mode expansion coefficients. A numerical example

Abstract = {{Uplink-downlink duality refers to the fact that the Gaussian broadcast
   channel has the same capacity region as the dual Gaussian
   multiple-access channel under the same sum-power constraint. This paper
   investigates a similar duality relationship between the uplink and
   downlink of a cloud radio access network (C-RAN), where a central
   processor (CP) cooperatively serves multiple mobile users through
   multiple remote radio heads (RRHs) connected to the CP with
   finite-capacity fronthaul links. The uplink of such a C-RAN model
   corresponds to a multiple-access relay channel; the downlink corresponds
   to a broadcast relay channel. This paper considers compression-based
   relay strategies in both uplink and downlink C-RAN, where the
   quantization noise levels are functions of the fronthaul link
   capacities. If the fronthaul capacities are infinite, the conventional
   uplinkdownlink duality applies. The main result of this paper is that
   even when the fronthaul capacities are finite, duality continues to hold
   for the case where independent compression is applied across each RRH in
   the sense that when the transmission and compression designs are jointly
   optimized, the achievable rate regions of the uplink and downlink remain
   identical under the same sum-power and individual fronthaul capacity
   constraints. As an application of the duality result, the power
   minimization problem in downlink C-RAN can be efficiently solved based
   on its uplink counterpart.}},

   consists of an orthogonal broadcast channel from a source to two relays

   access part, we consider both the case with full channel state

   and the legitimate destination. For both the cases, we establish the
   exact secure degrees of freedom and generalize the results for multiple
   relays. For the converse part, we introduce a new technique of capturing
   the trade-off between the message rate and the amount of individual
   randomness injected at each relay. In the achievability part, we show
   (i) how to strike a balance between sending message symbols and common
   noise symbols from the source to the relays in the broadcast component
   and (ii) how to combine artificial noise-beamforming and noise-alignment
   techniques at the relays in the multiple access component.}},

Abstract = {{We consider streaming data transmission over a discrete memoryless
   channel. A new message is given to the encoder at the beginning of each
   block and the decoder decodes each message sequentially, after a delay
   of T blocks. In this streaming setup, we study the fundamental interplay
   between the rate and error probability in the central limit and moderate
   deviations regimes and show the following achievability results: i) in
   the moderate deviations regime, the moderate deviations constant
   improves over the block coding or non-streaming setup at least by a
   factor of T and ii) in the central limit regime, the second-order coding
   rate improves at least by a factor of approximately root T for a wide
   range of channel parameters. For both the regimes, we propose coding
   techniques that incorporate a joint encoding of fresh and previous
   messages. Furthermore, we show that the exponent of the error
   probability can be improved tremendously by allowing variable decoding
   delay in the moderate deviations regime.}},

Abstract = {{An induction machine with skewed rotor bars has enhanced starting
   performance and reduced current harmonic distortion. In a conventional
   skewed induction machine (IM) modeling, the axial magnetic flux
   variation is usually ignored in machine performance analysis in spite of
   significant parameter variation in the axial direction. Furthermore, the
   selection of optimal skew angle is vital to keep the output torque
   constant, especially in electric vehicle applications. In this paper, a
   7.5 hp IM with one slot pitch skew angle is considered as an initial
   model and space harmonic reduction has been investigated by considering
   axial variation of the air-gap flux density. An analytical model
   incorporating spatial harmonics due to slotting has been intplemented in
   parallel with a 3-D FEA model towards improvements in skew angle and
   rotor bar geometry selection using improved swarm intelligence
   technique. The air gap flux density distortion and torque ripple due to
   space harmonic reduction for improved design are compared with that of
   the initial design.}},

Abstract = {{This work represents a pressure distribution model for finite length
   squeeze film dampers (SFDs) executing small amplitude circular-centered
   orbits (CCOs) with application in high-speed turbomachinery design. The
   proposed pressure distribution model only accounts for unsteady
   (temporal) inertia terms, since based on order of magnitude analysis,
   for small amplitude motions of the journal center, the effect of
   convective inertia is negligible relative to unsteady (temporal)
   inertia. In this work, the continuity equation and the momentum
   transport equations for incompressible lubricants are reduced by
   assuming that the shapes of the fluid velocity profiles are not strongly
   influenced by the inertia forces, obtaining an extended form of Reynolds
   equation for the hydrodynamic pressure distribution that accounts for
   fluid inertia effects. Furthermore, a numerical procedure is represented
   to discretize the model equations by applying finite difference
   approximation (FDA) and to numerically determine the pressure
   distribution and fluid film reaction forces in SFDs with significant
   accuracy. Finally, the proposed model is incorporated into a simulation
   model and the results are compared against existing SFD models. Based on
   the simulation results, the pressure distribution and fluid film
   reaction forces are significantly influenced by fluid inertia effects
   even at small and moderate Reynolds numbers.}},

Abstract = {{Upper-level ontologies provide an account of the most basic,
   domain-independent, existing entities, such as time, space, objects, and
   processes. Ontology verification is the process by which a theory is
   checked to rule out unintended models, and possibly characterize missing
   intended ones. In this paper, we verify the core characterization of
   mereotopology of the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO), and the
   mereology of the Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive
   Engineering (DOLCE), while relating their axiomatizations via ontology
   mapping. As a result, we propose the correction and addition of some
   axioms to the analyzed theories which eliminate unintended models and
   characterize missing ones. In addition, we show by formal means which is
   the relation existing between the axiomatization of mereology in both
   upper-level ontologies, and make available a modular representation in
   first-order logic of the SUMO characterization of mereotopology.}},

Abstract = {{This work studies the behavior of state-of-the-art memory controller
   designs when executing scale-out workloads. It considers memory
   scheduling techniques, memory page management policies, the number of
   memory channels, and the address mapping scheme used. Experimental
   measurements demonstrate: 1) Several recently proposed memory scheduling
   policies are not a good match for these scale-out workloads. 2) The
   relatively simple First-Ready-First-ComeFirst-Served (FR-FCFS) policy
   performs consistently better, and 3) for most of the studied workloads,
   the even simpler First-Come-First-Served scheduling policy is within 1\%
   of FRFCFS. 4) Increasing the number of memory channels offers negligible
   performance benefits, e.g., performance improves by 1.7\% on average for
   4-channels vs. 1-channel. 5) 77\%90\% of DRAM rows activations are
   accessed only once before closure. These observation can guide future
   development and optimization of memory controllers for scale-out
   workloads.}},

Abstract = {{Tasks in a data-parallel job communicate with each other through a
   number of concurrent flows, which is described as a coflow. These flows
   are correlated in the sense that the performance of a coflow is dictated
   by the flow that takes the longest time to complete. Minimizing coflow
   completion times, however, turns out to be a challenge, given the
   correlation across flows and how they are routed collectively through a
   datacenter network. In this paper, we propose Tailor, a simple yet
   effective mechanism with the objective of trimming the coflow completion
   times in a datacenter network. To achieve our objective, Tailor takes
   advantage of OpenFlow in a software-defined datacenter network. By
   monitoring and rerouting live flows to links with lighter loads, Tailor
   guarantees that the coflow completion time is minimized dynamically and
   converges to its lower bound. Our experimental results in both Mininet
   and large-scale simulations have shown that Tailor is much more
   effective than flow-level schemes when it comes to reducing coflow
   completion times. It also outperforms existing scheduling-only coflow
   mechanisms and achieves similar performance with the state-of-the-art
   hybrid mechanism, yet with much lower complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Mental vigilance monitoring is useful in helping people improve their
   prowess in situations such as sports, musical performance or
   occupational demands. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide
   appropriate information for identification of vigilance lapses; however,
   almost all of the previous EEG based vigilance monitoring studies
   require high density EEG montages, with the added inconvenience of
   conductive gels and the requirement for accurate placement of
   electrodes. In this paper we propose a practical machine learning
   approach for identification of vigilance lapses using EEG signals
   recorded from a very sparse electrode configuration with only 4
   electrodes: 2 electrodes at the forehead and 2 electrodes behind the
   ears. This is a challenging problem since these four electrodes are
   easily contaminated by eye blinks and muscle artifacts. The performance
   of the proposed machine-learning based algorithm is demonstrated in a
   real world scenario where vigilance lapses are identified with about
   95\% accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{An algorithm for predicting the amplitude of 40-Hz auditory steady state
   response (ASSR), which is an indicative of depth of anaesthesia, is
   presented in this paper. The amplitude of 40-Hz ASSR is an indicative of
   the depth of anaesthesia. Predicting this amplitude will help
   anesthesiologists in choosing the dose of the anaesthetic agents and
   have an estimation of the patients' next depth of anaesthesia state. The
   method is applied to the 40-Hz ASSR signals recorded from 20 human
   subjects during surgical operation. The algorithm uses sequential
   feature selection and multi-linear regression for choosing the most
   informative features and estimating the amplitude of ASSR on the next
   cycle and at the end of induction stage, when the patient looses his/her
   eyelash reflex. The algorithm uses the dose of anaesthetic drug, some of
   the demographics and medical parameters of the patients and their
   previous ASSR cycles for prediction. As the system provided with more
   ASSR cycles, the error in prediction decreases and estimation gets more
   accurate. The method is applied on the induction phase where patients'
   depth of anaesthesia changes very fast but it is applicable to all other
   stages of anaesthesia as well.}},

Abstract = {{Human recognition has been an active research area in the past decade.
   As the traditional biometrics such as face, fingerprint and iris have
   been widely deployed around the world, the vulnerability of such systems
   to falsification and spoofing attacks has been admitted. ECG is related
   to electrical activities of heart and is among the newer additions to
   biometric family. In addition to its inherent liveness detection, it is
   easy to collect. It can be easily captured from fingertips. However, ECG
   is a time-varying signal. Unlike most of previous works on ECG biometric
   that are limited to rest condition, we consider the effect of exercise
   on biometric performance of ECG. We consider the case that enrollment
   and testing are in different body conditions: rest and exercise. A
   feature selection is conducted to select features that are less affected
   by exercise. Selected features are then used for enrolling and testing
   the biometric system's users. Experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed approach performs significantly better than the
   state-of-the-art methods in ECG recognition.}},

   single feature vector that captures changes occurred to observations
   over time. This enhancement is crucial in cases where the examined
   signal is repetitive in nature, such as ECG signal. Enhanced binary
   patterns were examined for ECG biometric application on ECG database
   with 1,012 subjects. The enhanced binary patterns achieved an EER of
   7.89\% in comparison to 12.4\% and 12.3\% for non-enhanced binary
   patterns and a state of the art work. We also showed that enhanced
   binary patterns features are capable to extract discriminative ECG
   features that reduced EER by 15\% when compared to time-domain raw

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a segmentation approach, where a discriminative
   dictionary with objects' shape information is learned, followed by a
   sparse representation based segmentation process. In contrast with
   state-of-the-art sparse representation classification methods using
   discriminative dictionary learning, the proposed method learns a
   discriminative dictionary containing both intensity and shape
   information of object classes, in which shape information is collected
   and represented in the form of binarized masks. Object segmentation is
   achieved through an iterative process, including sparse representation,
   shape estimation, and shape refinement. The introduced method is
   evaluated and compared to state-of-the-art sparse representation based
   segmentation methods, and demonstrated better segmentation performance.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that dispersed and burst packet losses introduce
   significantly different amount of distortions. Since perceptual models
   are typically content dependent, it is challenging to characterize how
   losses interact with concealment. This paper presents loss-pattern-aware
   distortion (LoPAD), a content-independent metric that explicitly models
   the impact of different loss patterns. LoPAD operates solely on the loss
   trace without analyzing received media. It is fast, and supports offline
   and cloud-based monitoring of network impairment. Taking audio
   conferencing as target application, we show that full-reference PESQ
   scores for a collection of speech samples can be closely approximated by
   LoPAD. For various combinations of erasure channel models and forward
   error correction (FEC) codes, the correlation coefficients between LoPAD
   and PESQ-DMOS range from 0.90 to 0.97.}},

Abstract = {{Texture is considered one of most significant information sources in
   histo-pathology image analysis. To take advantage of information on
   color texture in digital histo-pathology, this work analyzes inherent
   characteristics of the hue component in the cylindrical color space, and
   introduces an effective color texture descriptor based on the LBP
   paradigm. Unlike existing LBP variants designed for linear data, the
   proposed descriptor, namely Hue-LBP, addresses the angular and periodic
   nature of hue and shows that color variation in the hue channel can be
   quantified by an angular variable in the range of {[}0, 180]. By
   introducing the concept of color similarity as a metric to measure color
   variation, we obtain a histogram to describe local color texture
   patterns. Experimentation on histo-pathology image classification
   suggests that the proposed Hue-LBP is discriminative as it is capable of
   describing texture information conveyed by the hue components.}},

   the discretization of the degradation path and the time axis,
   closed-form approximations for the reliability quantities are obtained
   using the transition probability matrix. Unlike the conventional method
   which is applicable only for a small number of degradation states, the
   calculation of these quantities can be accomplished with just the basic
   manipulation of the transition matrix, which is computationally
   efficient and applicable to real-time conditional reliability
   calculation for a general number of states. The effectiveness of the
   proposed approach is demonstrated by a numerical study.}},

Abstract = {{Separating function estimation tests (SFETs) replace detection problems
   with an estimation problem. In this paper, we study the relationship
   between improving the estimation of unknown parameters using Bayesian
   approaches and the performance of the corresponding SFET. Although the
   estimation method in the SFET is deterministic, we show that applying
   Bayesian methods to estimate the rest of unknown parameters that are not
   involved in the SF provide improved SFET performance. We illustrate this
   idea using two important problems. In the first example, we consider a
   sinusoid signal with unknown parameters in white noise. We show that a
   softmax function using the Fourier transform of the signal is a proper
   probability density function (pdf) for the frequency to improve the
   performance of the SFET. In the second example, a more accurate
   estimation of the unknown parameters of the signal is achieved, using
   the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimation of the random signal
   corrupted by white noise.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by recent evolution of cutting-edge sensor technologies with
   complex-valued measurements, the paper exposes complex valued
   (non-circular) false data injection attacks. We propose an attack model
   where an adversary applies widely-linear transformations on the sensor
   measurements to introduce correlations between the real and imaginary
   parts of the reported observations. Existing state estimators and attack
   detectors assume the measurements to have statistical properties similar
   to real-valued signals making them highly vulnerable to such
   complex-valued attacks. As a countermeasure, we propose to transform the
   attack detection problem into the problem of comparing the statistical
   distance between the Gaussian representation of the innovation sequence
   under attack and its counterpart with the optimal profile. Our Monte
   Carlo simulations illustrate the destructive nature of complex-valued
   attacks and validate the effectiveness of the proposed detection

Abstract = {{The aim of this investigation is to assess the effect of various
   additives on coalescence of nickel, copper and cobalt from slags
   generated during nickel extraction. The analyzed fluxes were silica and
   lime while examined reductants were pig iron, ferrosilicon and
   copper-silicon compound. Slag was settled at the different holding
   temperatures for various times in conditions that simulated the
   industrial environment. The newly formed matte and slag were
   characterized by their chemical composition and morphology. Silica flux
   generated higher partition coefficients for nickel and copper than the
   addition of lime. Additives used as reducing agents had higher valuable
   metal recovery rates and corresponding partition coefficients than
   fluxes. Microstructural studies showed that slag formed after adding
   reductants consisted of primarily fayalite, with some minute traces of
   magnetite as the secondary phase. Addition of 5 wt\% of pig iron,
   ferrosilicon and copper-silicon alloys favored the formation of a
   metallized matte which increased Cu, Ni and Co recoveries. Addition of
   copper-silicon alloys with low silicon content was efficient in copper
   recovery but coalescence of the other metals was low. Slag treated with
   the ferrosilicon facilitated the highest cobalt recovery while
   copper-silicon alloys with silicon content above 10 wt\% resulted in
   high coalescence of nickel and copper, 87 \% and 72 \% respectively.}},

   first technique attacks dynamic power by placing unused conductors,
   adjacent to used conductors, into a high-impedance state, reducing the
   effective capacitance seen by used conductors. A second technique,
   charge recycling, re-purposes unused conductors as charge reservoirs to
   reduce the supply current drawn for a positive transition on a used
   conductor. A third approach reduces leakage current in interconnect
   buffers by pulsed signalling, allowing a driving buffer to be placed
   into a high impedance stage after a logic transition. All three
   techniques require CAD support in the routing stage to encourage
   specific positionings of unused conductors relative to used conductors.}},

Abstract = {{Indoor wireless transceivers connect sensors and actuators, which are
   carried by a mobile agent to the Smart Home Information System (SHIS).
   In the smart home, the sensors' role is to observe the human activities
   and horne status, while the actuators are to perform assistive and
   recovery actions for serving the home resident. The SHIS then analyzes
   the sensors' data and issues the actuation commands for the task of
   activity recognition and technological assistance provision. By
   integrating the wireless network management system with the activity
   recognition system, we could improve three key parameters in the smart
   home. First, we could apply sensors and actuators efficiently, by
   spatially positioning the sensors and actuators in the right place at
   right time. Second, we could decrease the communication delay, by
   managing the wireless transceivers at the physical and data-link layer.
   Third, we let SHIS access the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI)
   information, so it considers the spatiotemporal features of the mobile
   agent observations as additive information tor activity recognition. The
   main ideas of this paper are examined through experimentation with the
   use of an Opportunistic Mesh (OPM) platform.}},

Abstract = {{Affective states classification has become an important part of the
   Brain-Computer Interface (HCI) study. In recent years, affective
   computing systems using physiological signals, such as ECG, GSR and EEG
   has shown very promising results. However, like many other machine
   learning studies involving physiological signals, the bottle neck is
   always around the database acquisition and the annotation process. To
   investigate potential ways to address this small sample problem, this
   paper introduces a Deep Belief Networks (DBN) based learning system for
   the EEG-based affective processing system. Through the greedy-layer
   pretraining using unlabeled data as weIl as a supervised fine-tuning
   process, the DBN-based approaches significantly reduced the number of
   labeled samples required. The DBN methods also acted as an application
   specific feature selector, by examining the weight vector between the
   input feature vector and the first invisible layer, we can gain much
   needed insights on the spatial or spectral locations of the most
   discriminating features. In this study, DBNs are trained on the
   narrow-band spectral features extracted from multichannel EEG
   recordings. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed DBN-based learning
   system, we carried out an subject-independent affective states
   classification experiments on the DEAP database to classify
   2-dimensional affect states. As a baseline to the proposed DBN approach,
   the same classification problem was also carried out using support
   vector machines (SVMs) and one-way ANOVA based feature selection
   process. The classification results shown that the proposed framework
   using Deep Belief Networks not only provided better classification
   performance, but also significantly lower the number of labeled data
   required to train such machine learning systems.}},

Abstract = {{Erasure coding has been increasingly replacing replication in
   distributed storage systems, thanks to its lower storage overhead with
   the same level of failure tolerance. However, with lower storage
   overhead, the reconstruction overhead of erasure codes can increase
   significantly as well. Under the ever-changing workload, in which the
   data access can be highly skewed, it is difficult to achieve a well
   trade-off between the storage overhead and the reconstruction overhead.
   In this paper, we propose Zebra, a framework that encodes data into
   multiple tiers by their demand. Given the overall storage overhead and
   the number of failures to tolerate, Zebra determines the parameters of
   erasure coding in each tier by solving a geometric programming problem.
   Based on the demand of data, Zebra can dynamically assign data into the
   corresponding tiers to minimize the overall reconstruction overhead, and
   achieve a flexible trade-off between the storage overhead and the
   reconstruction overhead in multiple tiers, such that hot data can enjoy
   less overhead of reconstruction and cold data can be stored with lower
   storage overhead. When demand changes, Zebra can adjust itself
   accordingly with a marginal amount of network transfer.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work in magnetically-actuated micro-scale robots for biomedical
   or microfluidic applications has resulted in electromagnetic actuation
   systems which can command precise five-degree-of-freedom control of
   simple magnetic devices at the sub-millimeter scale in remote
   environments. This paper presents a new type of actuation system which
   uses an array of large, rotatable, permanent magnets to generate the
   same level of control over untethered micro-robotic systems with the
   potential for increased field and gradient strength and minimal heat
   generation. We show that the system can produce any field or field
   gradient at the workspace (including a value of zero). In contrast with
   previous permanent magnet actuation systems, the system proposed here
   accomplishes this without any hazardous translational motion of the
   control magnets, resulting in a simple, safe, and inexpensive system.
   The proof-of-concept prototype system presented, with eight permanent
   magnets, can create fields and gradients in any direction with strength
   of 30 mT and 0.83 T.m(-1), respectively. The effectiveness of the system
   is shown through characterization and feedback control of a 250 mu m
   micro-magnet in a path-following task with average accuracy of 39 mu m.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method to independently control two millimeter-scale
   soft-bodied magnetic swimmers, with nominal dimensions of 1.5 x 4.9 x
   0.06 mm. A swimmer's speed depends on its relative angle with the
   actuation magnetic field. The two swimmers under control have different
   directions of net magnetic moments, and assume distinct orientations in
   one global magnetic field. With this fixed heading difference between
   two swimmers, the global actuation field forms different relative angles
   with the two swimmers. By manipulating these two relative angles, the
   two swimmers can exhibit different speeds. Theoretically, any speed
   ratios can be achieved between the two swimmers. In practice, a
   relatively accurate speed ratio can be obtained when both swimmers have
   nonzero speeds and one swimmer is no more than twice as fast as the
   other. Adding the control over the strength of actuation field, two
   swimmers can obtain independent speeds within a certain range. Two
   feedback controllers are proposed to control two such swimmers to arrive
   at independent global points (positioning) and move along paths (path
   following). Type I Sequential Controller manipulates two swimmers to
   move to their respective goals in sequence, while Type II Parallel
   Controller moves both swimmers simultaneously. Experiments are presented
   in which two swimmers are controlled to pass a series of points to form
   the letters ``UT{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Mammalian sperms reorient against fluid flow in the female reproductive
   tract, known as rheotaxis. Compared to chemotaxis that provides
   short-distance guidance, rheotaxis provides long-distance guidance for a
   sperm to find the egg cell. However, only a low number of sperms are
   capable of rheotaxis and their tail behavior during reorientation is not
   yet known. We have developed an automated system to manipulate human
   sperm orientation in fluid flow and quantitatively reveal sperm behavior
   changes during rheotaxis. The system automatically detects multiple
   sperms, selects the sperm for analysis, controls fluid flow, and
   quantifies sperm tail behavior. Sperm head angle is used as feedback to
   control fluid flow and select reorienting sperms. High accuracy of head
   angle tracking and automated sperm selection enables the capturing of
   dynamic sperm turning behavior in a large sample size. Algorithms are
   developed to track sperm tail skeletons and quantify tail beating
   amplitude and asymmetry, based on which the first quantitative analysis
   of sperm tail behavior in rheotaxis is obtained. Experimental results
   reveal, for the first time, that the sperms that are capable of
   reorienting against fluid flow beat their tails more asymmetrically than
   those sperms that are unable to reorient against fluid flow while no
   significant difference was found in their tail beating amplitudes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the synthesis of piece-wise affine
   feedback controllers to address the problem of safe and robust
   controller design in robotics based on high-level controls
   specifications. The methodology is based on formulating the problem as a
   collection of reach control problems on a polytopic state space. Reach
   control has so far only been developed in theory and has not been tested
   experimentally on a real system before. Using a quadrocopter as our
   experimental platform, we show that these theoretical tools can achieve
   fast, albeit safe and robust maneuvers. In contrast to most traditional
   control techniques, the reach control approach does not require a
   predefined open-loop reference trajectory or spacial path. Experimental
   results on a quadrocopter show the effectiveness and robustness of this
   control approach. In a proof-of-concept demonstration, the reach
   controller is implemented in one translational direction while the other
   degrees of freedom are stabilized by separate controllers.}},

Abstract = {{A wearable-optimized implementation of a sleep stage classification
   algorithm that has low detection latency, high detection accuracy and
   low resource consumption is developed and successfully implemented on a
   low-power FPGA microsystem for closed-loop electrical brain stimulation.
   This implementation uses EEG and EMG signals as inputs and classifies
   stages of sleep. By structurally merging multichannel FIR and window
   averaging filters into one reconfigurable, multipurpose filter, the new
   implementation maintains a sleep detection accuracy of 79.7\%, a REM
   detection sensitivity of 98.2\%, a REM detection specificity of 89.2\%
   and a detection latency of 0.982 ms, while consuming 6.8 times fewer
   logic elements and 96.28\% less power compared with the current state of
   the art implementation. With its high performance and low resource
   usage, this implementation enables a low-power wearable microsystem to
   perform neural recording, real-time REM sleep stage detection, and
   closed-loop responsive brain stimulation as a tool to study the
   mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses general tradeoffs between wireless communication
   and computation in closed-loop implantable medical devices for
   neurological applications. Closed-loop devices enable neural monitoring,
   automated diagnostics and treatment of neurological disorders. Several
   topologies for the loop are discussed, including within the implant, as
   well as implemented with a wearable, handheld or stationary processor.
   Common wireless communication data rate and range requirements and
   algorithmic computational requirements are summarized. As a case study,
   a 0.13 mu m CMOS neurostimulator SoC for closed-loop treatment of
   intractable epilepsy is presented. Its triple-band radio with a 1m
   230Mbps pulse-radio, a 2m 46Mbps pulse-radio 2, and a 10m 1.2Mbps FSK
   radio provides a versatile transcutaneous interface. The in-implant
   processor has constrained computational resources which results in a
   limited detection performance - seizure detection sensitivity of 87\%. A
   higher-performance signal processing algorithm implemented on a
   stationary device within a loop enhances the seizure detection
   performance which was improved to a sensitivity of 98\% with three times
   fewer false alarms. This comes at the cost of an increased wireless
   transmitter power budget, if communicated directly. These results
   illustrate a fundamental tradeoff between the communication and
   computation in closed-loop electronic therapies for neurological
   disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional transmission line (TL) grids have been shown to
   demonstrate interesting behaviors, such as effective negative refractive
   index and growing of evanescent waves. The analytical treatment of
   periodic TL-grid structures in the literature predicts a closed bandgap
   dispersion relation and 2 eigenmodes for a symmetric unperturbed TL-grid
   unit cell. In this paper, it is shown that unloaded 2D TL-grids
   inherently exhibit an open bandgap in the dispersion relation and the
   TL-grid has to be perturbed for successful closure of the bandgap.
   Furthermore, it is shown that there is a flat (deaf) band in the
   dispersion relation which is regarded as an additional 3rd eigenmode.
   Finally, based on this analysis, a 2D single-point fed TL-grid Dirac
   leaky-wave antenna (DLWA) design is fabricated. Experimental results
   show true broadside radiation, which is a proper indication of the
   successful closure of the bandgap in the dispersion relation.}},

Abstract = {{Several types of absorbing boundary conditions and simple matched
   absorbers, employed for mesh truncation in time and frequency domain
   numerical techniques (FDTD, FEM) work well for normally incident waves.
   However, their performance at other angles of incidence is often deemed
   unacceptable, motivating their replacement by perfectly matched layers.
   We propose a medium that can collimate incident waves, producing almost
   normally incident plane waves that can be readily absorbed even by a low
   order absorbing boundary condition such as Mur's. This perfectly matched
   layer collimator (PMLC) is a lossless, uniaxially anisotropic medium;
   its numerical implementation is much simpler than that of the
   conventional PML. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of
   this medium as a means of rendering the performance of a first order
   absorbing boundary condition comparable to that of a PML.}},

Abstract = {{In Software Defined Infrastructure ( SDI), a network topology consists
   of many converged heterogeneous resources, both physical and virtual,
   for computing and networking. However, the network topology is dynamic
   due to various physical and logical activities such as addition of new
   racks, VM addition/deletion/migration, and network
   creation/modification/deletion. In this paper we propose SDIGraph, which
   is a graph-based topology management service, for such dynamic,
   converged, and heterogeneous infrastructure resources in SDI. For
   modeling the topology, we use a graph model for representing converged
   heterogeneous resources and their associations. We also use a graph
   database to enable us to efficiently store resources and to make queries
   based on graph traversal and indexing. We develop a prototype for how to
   get a network topology in the SAVI Testbed which is an operational
   facility based on SDI deployed over much of Canada.}},

   JANUS, that was developed and implemented in the SAVI testbed for
   application platforms. We focus on advanced software-defined network
   services that can be provided in this SDI environment. We present
   requirements that must be met by the SDI management system: Pro-active
   rule installation; Broadcast-free networking; VN creation and
   management; scalability and extensibility; and support for legacy
   networks. We describe the Network Control Module of the JANUS SDI

   innovation that promotes scalability and performance is a FlowStore that
   tracks flows and cache rules in the SDN network.}},

Abstract = {{The quality of multimedia communications heavily relies on the
   end-to-end network condition. Sub-optimal resource allocation in the
   substrate network may deplete certain links sooner, making the network
   less resilient to link failures, traffic fluctuation or random traffic
   spikes. Regulating the traffic can improve the media quality, but is not
   an easy operation to do in legacy IP networks. SDN technology provides
   the support for an unprecedented centralized solution in this regard.
   Thus the biggest challenge is how to allocate resources in the data
   plane.
   In this paper, we propose a Two-phase flow embedding approach with an
   iterative traffic engineering algorithm to address the resource
   allocation problem lying in the data plane of multimedia IP
   communication systems. We numerically evaluate it and compare it with
   (a) Dijkstra algorithm and (b) flow embedding approach with a greedy TE
   heuristics. We show that the flow embedding approach with the iterative
   TE excels in all three metrics: session accept rate, throughput, and
   link utilizations, under a spectrum of scenarios including unexpected
   network conditions and traffic conditions.}},

   the decay properties of quantum emitters in metal-dielectric resonator
   systems, including hybrid plasmonic-photonic coupled cavities as well as
   hyperbolic metamaterial resonators. We quantify both the radiative and
   non-radiative decay rates in these complex structures using these QNMs
   and a Green function expansion, which yields an excellent agreement with
   full-dipole calculations of Maxwell's equations. Using this analytical
   QNM theory, we can map the Purcell factor for the system over a wide
   range of frequencies and dipole positions. We further show that how
   individual QNMs of these systems contribute to the underlying physics,
   whether it is strong interference effects between the sub-systems, in
   the case of a hybrid structure, or it is a physically meaningful
   explanation of very low beta factor for single photon emission in the

Abstract = {{Previous research proved that applications of computer vision-based
   methods for automated recognition and tracking of project related
   entities at construction sites are very promising. Nevertheless, the
   applications of these methods for indoor construction sites have not
   been explored sufficiently. Automated visual recognition of indoor
   project-related objects can provide both essential information about the
   current state of progress and provide semantic information for
   model-based approaches. There are a large number of challenges
   associated with indoor visual recognition, such as illumination and
   changes in viewpoint that significantly reduce the accuracy of existing
   methods. In this paper, a novel procedure is introduced that takes an
   integrated color and shape-based approach toward recognition of
   projectrelated objects including structural elements and interior walls
   under moderate to extreme illumination conditions and from different
   viewpoints. The procedure is validated using a comprehensive library of
   indoor digital images under different illumination conditions and
   viewpoints. The results indicate the applicability of the proposed
   method for visual recognition of indoor project-related objects for
   further use in automated progress monitoring and providing as-built 3D
   models with supplementary semantic information.}},

Abstract = {{Although safety performance measurement over time are vital for safety
   management, few longitudinal studies of construction safety have been
   conducted. While youth (age 18-24) are most often the focus of safety
   initiatives, safety management of older workers (age 55 plus) is also
   important because of the large percentage of older workforce. This paper
   examines the change in safety incidents on Ontario construction sites
   based on survey data from 2004 and 2014. Safety incident frequencies of
   three age groups (18-24, 25-54, 55 plus) are compared. The results show
   a downward trend for nearly all incident types. However, sprains or
   strains and fractures (high cost injuries) remain unchanged.
   Correspondingly, slips, trips and falls, which are the indicator events,
   are up. In addition, the results show that youth have the greatest
   decrease in frequency of almost all incident types and older workers
   made the greatest improvement percentage-wise in physical injuries and
   safety events. However, youth should still be the focus of safety
   initiatives because they experience the most incidents in 14 out of 26
   injury and event types. Safety training strategies may need to be
   adapted to the older workforce given the important role of older workers
   in building a safer workplace.}},

Abstract = {{In a crowdsourcing system, it is important for the crowdsourcer to
   engineer extrinsic rewards to incentivize the participants. With mobile
   social networking, a user enjoys an intrinsic benefit when she aligns
   her behavior with the behavior of others. Referred to as network
   effects, such an intrinsic benefit becomes more significant as the
   number of users grows in the crowdsourcing system. But should a
   crowdsourcer design her extrinsic rewards differently when such network
   effects are taken into account? In this paper, we, for the first time,
   consider network effects as a contributing factor to intrinsic rewards,
   and study its influence on the design of extrinsic rewards. Rather than
   assuming a fixed participant population, we show that the number of
   participating users evolves to a steady equilibrium, thanks to subtle
   interactions between intrinsic rewards due to network effects and
   extrinsic rewards offered by the crowdsourcer. Taken network effects
   into consideration, we design progressively more sophisticated extrinsic
   reward mechanisms, and propose new and optimal strategies for a
   crowdsourcer to obtain a higher utility. Via extensive simulations, we
   demonstrate that with our new strategies, a crowdsourcer is able to
   attract more participants with higher contributed efforts; and
   participants gain higher utilities from both intrinsic and extrinsic
   rewards.}},

Abstract = {{Typically called big data processing, processing large volumes of data
   from geographically distributed regions with machine learning algorithms
   has emerged as an important analytical tool for governments and
   multinational corporations. The traditional wisdom calls for the
   collection of all the data across the world to a central datacenter
   location, to be processed using data-parallel applications. This is
   neither efficient nor practical as the volume of data grows
   exponentially. Rather than transferring data, we believe that
   computation tasks should be scheduled where the data is, while data
   should be processed with a minimum amount of transfers across
   datacenters. In this paper, we design and implement Flutter, a new task
   scheduling algorithm that improves the completion times of big data
   processing jobs across geographically distributed datacenters. To cater
   to the specific characteristics of data-parallel applications, we first
   formulate our problem as a lexicographical min-max integer linear
   programming (ILP) problem, and then transform it into a nonlinear
   program with a separable convex objective function and a totally
   unimodular constraint matrix, which can be solved using a standard
   linear programming solver efficiently in an online fashion. Our
   implementation of Flutter is based on Apache Spark, a modern framework
   popular for big data processing. Our experimental results have shown
   that we can reduce the job completion time by up to 25\%, and the amount
   of traffic transferred among datacenters by up to 75\%.}},

Abstract = {{Even with the recent proliferation of in-memory computation in
   data-parallel frameworks (such as Spark), transfers over the network are
   still time-consuming. Similar to computation, network transfers serve as
   main roadblocks as we try to minimize job completion times. Existing
   schedulers were designed as isolated solutions that focused on
   computation or network performance only. Without any coordination, the
   utilization of computation and network resources may become unbalanced,
   leading to a reduced level of overall resource utilization. In this
   paper, we design, implement, and evaluate Symbiosis, a network-aware
   task scheduler designed to coordinate computation-bound and
   network-bound tasks in a large cluster, so that resources are utilized
   in a more balanced fashion. Symbiosis is an online scheduler that
   predicts resource imbalance before launching tasks, and correct such
   imbalance by co-locating computation-bound and network-bound tasks in
   the same executor process. As a guiding principle, it is engineered to
   be practically implemented within and to complement existing
   data-parallel frameworks. We have implemented Symbiosis within Spark,
   and carried out our experiments on a 100-node cluster. We show
   convincing evidence that Symbiosis reduces job completion times by
   11.9\% in comparison to Spark's current scheduler with little overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Soft processors have a role to play in easing the difficulty of
   designing applications into FPGAs for two reasons: first, they can be
   deployed only when needed, unlike permanent on-die hard processors.
   Second, for the portions of an application that can function
   sufficiently fast on a soft processor, it is far easier to write and
   debug single-threaded software code than to create hardware. The breadth
   of this second role increases when the performance of the soft processor
   increases, yet there has been little progress in the performance of soft
   processors since their commercial inception - in particular, the
   sophisticated out-of-order superscalar approaches that arrived in the
   mid 1990s are not employed, despite the fact that their area cost is now
   easily tolerable. In this paper we take an important step towards
   out-of-order execution in soft processors by exploring instruction
   scheduling in an FPGA substrate. This differs from the hard-processor
   design problem because the logic substrate is restricted to LUTs,
   whereas hard processor scheduling circuits employ CAM and wired-OR
   structures to great benefit. We discuss both circuit and
   microarchitectural trade-offs, and compare three circuit structures for
   the scheduler, including a new structure called a fused-logic matrix
   scheduler. With this circuit, large schedulers up to 40 entries can be
   built with the same cycle time as the commercial Nios II/f soft
   processor (240 MHz). This careful design has the potential to
   significantly increase both the IPC and raw compute performance of a
   soft processor, compared to current commercial soft processors.}},

Abstract = {{Apache Spark has become one of the most popular engines for big data
   processing. Spark provides a platform-independent, high-abstraction
   programming paradigm for large-scale data processing by leveraging the
   Java framework. Though it provides software portability across various
   machines, Java also limits the performance of distributed environments,
   such as Spark. While it may be unrealistic to rewrite platforms like
   Spark in a faster language, a more viable approach to mitigate its poor
   performance is to accelerate the computations while still working within
   the Java-based framework. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
   incorporating FPGA acceleration into Spark, and uses a MapReduce
   implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm to show that
   acceleration is possible even when using a hardware platform that is not
   well-optimized for performance. An important feature of our approach is
   that the use of FPGAs is completely transparent to the user through the
   use of library functions, which is a common way by which users access
   functions provided by Spark. Power users can further develop other
   computations using high-level synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method for extracting auditory steady state
   response (ASSR) signals from background electroencephalogram. 40-Hz ASSR
   signals are sensitive to subject's state of consciousness and can be
   used as a monitor for the depth of anaesthesia. The suggested method is
   a multilevel adaptive wavelet denoising scheme that extracts ASSR cycles
   faster than the currently used averaging schemes and can monitor depth
   of anesthesia with minimum delay. It estimates the variance of noise and
   adapts the threshold at each denoising level. The algorithm benefits
   from the fact that wavelet transform preserves temporality and takes
   into consideration the correlation of the neighbor wavelet coefficients.
   Our method extracts ASSR from small number of epochs in a short time
   moreover, it does not neglect the variations of the signal from one
   epoch to the other and outperforms averaging. The performance of the
   proposed scheme is evaluated on the synthetic and on real data recorded
   during induction of anaesthesia ASSR signals in the paper.}},

   decisions of all users and the CAP, together with communication and
   processing resource allocation, to minimize the overall cost of energy,
   computation, and the maximum delay among all users. It is shown that the
   problem can be formulated as a non convex quadratically constrained
   quadratic program, which is NP-hard in general. We further propose an
   efficient solution to this problem by semidefinite relaxation and a
   novel randomization mapping method. Our simulation results show that the
   proposed algorithm gives nearly optimal performance with only a small
   number of randomization iterations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the optimal placement of content in cache-enabled
   base-stations (BSs) for reducing backhaul traffic in a densely deployed
   wireless access network. By caching popular files, users requesting
   these files can be served directly by their associated BSs without
   needing to fetch content from the core network. This paper makes an
   observation that a real network consists of distinct classes of users
   with different file preferences, so jointly optimizing cache placement
   and user-BS association can result in significant benefit. This paper
   considers such a joint optimization problem for achieving an optimized
   tradeoff between load balancing and backhaul saving, while accounting
   for both the physical layer wireless propagation characteristics and the
   finite cache size at the BSs. By proposing a numerical algorithm that
   iteratively optimizes the content placement policy for fixed
   user-association and optimizes the user association policy for fixed
   content placement, with a goal of maximizing a backhaul-aware
   proportional fairness network utility, this paper shows that placing
   similar content at strategically located BSs can result in significant
   backhaul saving without sacrificing as much in user access rates.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a joint uplink user scheduling and beamforming
   algorithm for a multiple-antenna wireless cellular network. We show that
   coordinated optimization across the cells can significantly alleviate
   intercell interference, thereby improving the cell-edge rates in a
   multicell network. Unlike the downlink case, coordinating uplink
   transmission in a multicell network is significantly more challenging,
   because uplink interference depends strongly on the schedule and
   beamformers of neighboring cells. The main contribution of this paper is
   the recasting of the problem in terms of sum-of-ratio programming and a
   subsequent quadratic reformulation which allows scheduling and
   beamforming to be optimized through solving a matching problem. This
   problem reformulation also provides a new interpretation of the
   well-known weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm.
   Simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly
   outperforms both the WMMSE algorithm and the existing uncoordinated
   scheduling approach.}},

Abstract = {{In underlay device-to-device (D2D) communication, a D2D pair reuses the

   Optimal operation requires joint consideration for the achieved D2D rate
   and the added interference to cellular users. Most existing work on D2D
   rate maximization concerns only the simplified scenario where the D2D
   pair has access to a single channel or resource block. In this work, we
   present an optimization solution to allocate the D2D transmission power
   over multiple channels, to maximize the sum rate between D2D and
   cellular users, under a sum-power constraint on the D2D transmitter and
   minimum SINR guarantees at each RB for all cellular users. The proposed
   optimization is applicable to both uplink and downlink cellular spectrum
   sharing. Our simulation studies further shed light into how the maximum

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method to control multiple micro-scale
   magnetic agents operating in close proximity to each other for
   applications in microrobotics. Controlling multiple magnetic microrobots
   close to each other is difficult due to magnetic interactions between
   the agents, and here we seek to control those interactions for the
   creation of desired multi-agent formations. We use the fact that all
   magnetic agents orient to the global input magnetic field to modulate
   the local attraction-repulsion forces between nearby agents. Here we
   study these controlled interaction magnetic forces for agents at a
   water-air interface and devise two controllers to regulate the
   inter-agent spacing and heading of the set, for motion in two
   dimensions. Simulation and experimental demonstrations show the
   feasibility of the idea and its potential for the completion of complex
   tasks using teams of microrobots. Average tracking error of less than 73
   mu m and 14 degrees is accomplished for the regulation of the interagent
   space and the pair heading angle, respectively, for identical disk-shape
   agents with nominal radius of 500 mu m and thickness of 80 mu m

Abstract = {{In today's competitive market, a company's success is strongly dependent
   on delivering sophisticated and state-of-the-art IPs prior to their
   competitors. To take a short cut, a company may resort to reverse
   engineering or pirating their competitor's IP.
   In this paper, we examine the feasibility of extracting the design of a
   secure IP from one technology and using it in another. In particular, we
   start by extracting the IP from an FPGA vendor tool flow and map the IP
   blocks to an ASIC technology. We show that there is not a significant
   degradation in quality compared to starting with the original source,
   thus showing that taking a pirated IP from an FPGA and using it in
   another technology is viable, and therefore worth doing. This
   demonstrates a clear motivation for patching a vulnerability in FPGA CAD
   tools.
   Note that the intent of this work is not to promote the piracy of IPs.
   Instead, the goal is to demonstrate a mechanism for extracting a design
   as a means towards understanding what methods of pirating are possible,
   and whether they can be prevented.}},

Abstract = {{Among many key subjects in the smart grid technology, Demand Side
   Management (DSM) which is one of the common and popular subjects
   interests researchers on controlling and monitoring customers'
   consumption activities. In reality, DSM involves any activities that
   impress customer's consumption levels in a power grid system. This
   usually happens by means of employing new policies by utility companies,
   defining suitable pricing schemes that guarantee grid's continual
   working and using effective scheduling approaches to adjust hourly
   customer's consumption levels, especially on peak-time hours. Among
   them, pricing methods are very important and effective in controlling
   customer's consumption patterns. Real-Time Pricing (RTP) and Time of Use
   (TOU) pricing are common approaches which are being employed by many
   utility companies and are mostly dependent on the grid's dynamic load
   behavior. In addition, real-time pricing methods adjust real-time prices
   based on grid's real-time demand level dynamically. In this paper, we
   propose a new pricing method that not only makes use of grid's real-time
   consumption data but also considers consumption levels of each customer
   and define real-time prices individually (Personalized Pricing). This
   means that the consumption price for each individual customer will be
   adjusted by the changes that occur during the course of power
   consumption and also reflect each individual customer's habit of using
   electricity. In this way, our proposed method can consider both grid and
   individual customer's consumption level to adjust real-time prices.
   Generally personalized pricing is a type of an incentive-based DSM model
   that can impress customer's consumption levels by persuading them to
   decrease their consumption levels during peak-time hours and updating
   each customer's consumption prices individually. However, individual
   satisfaction is a more important capability that lies at the heart of
   Personalized Pricing. Our results also intensify that most of our
   customers in the grid will decrease their consumption levels during
   peak-time hours to reduce their electricity consumption costs.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1365-1371}},
Abstract = {{Study Objectives: Induction of fluid overload during sleep in older men
   causes fluid accumulation in the neck, worsens obstructive sleep apnea
   (OSA), and reduces sleep efficiency and slow wave sleep. However, it is
   not clear whether disrupted sleep structure was related to age, fluid
   accumulation, or to OSA severity as assessed by the apnea-hypopnea index
   (AHI). We hypothesize that fluid accumulation in the neck is a
   significant contributor to the sleep structure.
   Methods: Twenty non-obese men, 46 +/- 11 years, underwent a daytime
   sleep study following a night of sleep deprivation. Before and after
   sleep, neck circumference (NC), upper airway cross-sectional area, and
   neck fluid volume (NFV) were assessed. Stepwise regression analyses were
   used to determine factors that contributed to sleep structure, AHI, and
   arousal frequency. Independent factors were age, NC, Delta NC, Delta
   NFV, and AHI (excluded for AHI and arousal).
   Results: Subjects slept for 145 +/- 44 minutes with a mean AHI of 26 +/-
   25. After sleep, Delta NC and Delta NFV increased and the upper airway
   narrowed (all: p < 0.001)..NC and.NFV correlated directly with \% N2 and
   inversely with \% N3 sleep. Regression analyses revealed that only Delta
   NC correlated directly with \% N2 sleep (r(2) = 0.44, p = 0.001). Delta
   NC, Delta NFV, and pre-sleep NC correlated inversely with \% N3 sleep
   (r(2) = 0.76, p < 0.001). Pre-sleep NC and Delta NC correlated directly
   with AHI and arousal frequency.
   Conclusions: Fluid accumulation in the neck and larger neck
   circumference are related to impaired sleep structure with reduced \% N3
   sleep. Fluid accumulation in the neck had stronger contribution to sleep
   structure than AHI or age.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{198-211}},
Abstract = {{Acute brain injury is a common cause of death and critical illness in
   children and young adults. Fundamental management focuses on early
   characterization of the extent of injury and optimizing recovery by
   preventing secondary damage during the days following the primary
   injury. Currently, bedside technology for measuring neurological
   function is mainly limited to using electroencephalography (EEG) for
   detection of seizures and encephalopathic features, and evoked
   potentials. We present a proof of concept study in patients with acute
   brain injury in the intensive care setting, featuring a bedside
   functional imaging set-up designed to map cortical brain activation
   patterns by combining high density EEG recordings, multi-modal sensory
   stimulation (auditory, visual, and somatosensory), and EEG source
   modeling. Use of source-modeling allows for examination of
   spatio-temporal activation patterns at the cortical region level as
   opposed to the traditional scalp potential maps. The application of this
   systemin both healthy and brain-injured participants is demonstrated
   with modality-specific source-reconstructed cortical activation
   patterns. By combining stimulation obtained with different modalities,
   most of the cortical surface can be monitored for changes in functional
   activation without having to physically transport the subject to an
   imaging suite. The results in patients in an intensive care setting with
   anatomically well-defined brain lesions suggest a topographic
   association between their injuries and activation patterns. Moreover, we
   report the reproducible application of a protocol examining a

Abstract = {{Network function virtualization (NFV) has emerged as a promising
   paradigm in networking, where the hardware-based middleboxes are
   replaced with software-based virtualized entities typically running on
   the cloud to provide specific functionalities. By deploying NFV, network
   services become more adaptive and cost-effective. Many multicast
   services such as real-time multimedia streaming and intrusion detection
   require appropriate services chaining; however, NFVs placement in the
   network as well as traffic routing strategy to guarantee that the
   multicast flows traverse through the services chain before reaching the
   end user is still an open problem. In this paper, we present an
   algorithm to solve this problem.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud data centers today use virtualization technologies to facilitate
   allocation of physical resources to multiple applications. As cloud data
   centers continue to grow in scale and complexity, effectively monitoring
   and identifying system anomalies is becoming a critical problem.
   Furthermore, due to complex dependencies between system components in a
   virtualized data center, a single cause of anomaly can typically trigger
   multiple alarms. Therefore there is also a need to efficiently analyze
   and identify the causes of the anomalies in a scalable and effective
   manner, in order to reduce the overhead of diagnosis and troubleshooting
   performed by the cloud operator.
   Motivated by these observations, we present a mechanism for automatic
   anomaly detection and root cause analysis in virtualized cloud data
   centers. We first use unsupervised learning techniques to identify
   abnormal system behaviors, and then propose a technique for root cause
   analysis with consideration to anomaly propagation among system
   components. Using a real virtualized cloud testbed, we show that our
   mechanism efficiently identifies system anomalies and accurately
   determines their causes.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic open-cell polymer foams are promising materials for the
   treatment of oil sands process-affected water due to their oleophilic
   and hydrophobic properties. This paper presents the characterization of
   inexpensive and accessible polyester polyurethane foam for this
   application. The kinetics and adsorption equilibrium of emulsified oil
   onto the polymer adsorbent were studied at temperatures ranging from 20
   degrees C to 40 degrees C and oil volume fractions in oil-in-water
   emulsions of 3\% and 10\%. The data were found to be well described by a
   sequential dual Fickian (SDF) model of diffusion in composite polymers.
   The model assumes two diffusion stages driven by different mechanisms,
   surface diffusion and clustering. In the first stage, at 30 degrees C
   and 40 degrees C, the diffusion coefficient increased with the
   concentration gradient, suggesting Fickian chemical or surface
   diffusion. The improved mass uptake at corresponding temperatures was
   attributed to the surface wetting and bonding between oil molecules and
   polymer. In the second stage, substantially low diffusivities and
   fractional mass uptakes were due to Fickian physical diffusion or
   clustering. In this stage, the mass uptake was a cumulative result of
   the clustering of emulsion molecules in the polymer voids, newly formed
   sites from swelling, and creeping of a low-viscosity crude.}},

Abstract = {{A homogeneous nano-porous medium of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) was
   fabricated using supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)). A unique
   complex 3-dimensional nano-fibrillar network, using sorbitol
   derivatives, was induced inside iPP to gel the matrix. The
   nucleating/clarifying agent, 1,2,3-trideoxy-4,6:
   5,7-bis-O-{[}(4-propylphenyl) methylene]-nonitol (TBPMN), was used to
   promote crystal nucleation, which in turn dramatically enhanced nanocell
   nucleation. This clarifying agent (CA) has been developed as a new
   generation sorbitol derivative to improve the clarity of polypropylene
   (PP). Samples of iPP with the clarifying agent (iPP/CA) were prepared
   using a twin-screw microcompounder, and their thermal stability was
   accessed. The crystallization behaviors of the neat iPP (iPP/0CA) and
   iPP with 0.5 wt\% CA (iPP/0.5CA) were studied using differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized optical microscopy, and rheometry.
   The percolation state of the sorbitol nano-fibrillar network in
   iPP/0.5CA was also investigated using the Van Gurp-Palmen-plot. The
   cellular morphology was characterized as a function of the processing
   conditions at both the micro and nano-scales. A nanocellular structure
   with an average pore size of similar to 70 nm, cell density of similar
   to 10(15) cells per cm(3), and void fraction of 86\% (an expansion ratio
   of 7.56) was achieved by controlling the crystallization kinetics of iPP
   in the presence of CA. An optimum foaming temperature was found wherein
   the smallest pore size with the highest cell density could be produced.
   The thermal conductivity of the nanoporous sample decreased dramatically
   up to about 8-fold compared with its solid counterpart. Its viability
   stemmed from its relative low density, unique 3D nanocellular structure,
   and nanoscale confinement of the gaseous medium inside the nanopores
   (i.e., the Knudsen effect).}},

Abstract = {{In sensor-node applications, the auxiliary power is drawn from the ac
   mains to supply the mixed-signal sensor components. There is therefore a
   need for low-cost, sub-1W, miniature non-isolated ac-dc down-converters.
   In this work, a new two-chip architecture is proposed to implement a
   high-voltage quasi-resonant buck converter with peak current-mode
   control. The current and voltage control loops are implemented in the
   high-side (HS) and low-side (LS) IC, respectively. Each IC includes a
   700V power transistor, sensing and control circuits. The LS IC transmits
   the digital peak current command, along with mode selection information,
   to the HS IC using a low-power 20 MHz isolated communication interface.
   The architecture achieves a peak simulated efficiency of 85.6\% when
   converting from 339 V to 12 V and allows the size of the input filter to
   be greatly reduced due to the current-mode operation. State-of-the- art
   UHV BCD technologies offer a unique opportunity to increase the level of
   integration and reduce the system cost in the targeted sensor node
   applications, despite the relatively poor figure-of-merit of the HV
   devices compared to discrete Silicon super-junction or GaN alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{Active noise control (ANC) provides a suitable solution for low
   frequency noise control. The aim of conventional ANC is to attenuate the
   unwanted noise as much as possible without consideration of its
   frequency components. However, it is desirable to retain certain sounds
   with specified spectral content to improve the human perception of
   sound. Active noise equalizer (ANE) is a method proposed to solve this
   problem. Traditional ANE uses standard filtered-x least mean square
   (FXLMS) algorithm. To accelerate the convergence of the controller while
   retaining low mean square error (MSE), we propose to use the variable
   step size filtered-x normalized least mean square (VSS-FXNLMS) algorithm
   to replace the FXLMS algorithm when updating the controller. The
   adaptation step size of this algorithm is adjusted dynamically according
   to the input signal and the instantaneous pseudo error of the
   controller. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that VSS-FXNLMS
   algorithm exhibits rapid convergence with low MSE.}},

Abstract = {{The secondary grid network allows customers in a distribution system to
   be supplied with minimal interruptions when outages occur. Under second
   contingency scenarios, where two feeders or equipment are lost, an
   entire grid may have to be dropped because it cannot sustain the load.
   This paper proposes a method to optimally partition secondary grid
   networks to maximize the amount of customers that can be supported
   during second contingency events. Additionally, a new method is
   presented to develop an approximate model of secondary grid networks.
   Rather than rely on the availability of a detailed circuit layout, more
   readily available information-such as the network units' loading,
   customer demand and geographic positions-are used to estimate an
   equivalent impedance representation of the network, which is then used
   as an input to the partitioning algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Bentonite is a naturally occurring clay-rich sediment that has a high
   cation exchange capacity and swells upon contact with water. Owing to
   these characteristics, highly compacted bentonite (HCB) is often used as
   an engineered barrier system (EBS) to protect used nuclear fuel
   containers (UFCs) that are stored in deep geological repositories (DGR).
   Nutrients present in the bentonite may support microbial activity and
   growth leading to possible microbial influenced corrosion (MIC). To
   evaluate the potential extent of MIC in a DGR, a bulk chemistry approach
   was employed, accounting for nutrients in the bentonite, backfill, and
   groundwater, and established limiting nutrients (LNs) for microbial
   growth. The methodology was applied to one UFC encased in HCB and to an
   entire placement room containing 341 UFCs. The method was also applied
   to both crystalline and sedimentary rock environments, typical of
   Canadian geologies. Nitrogen and phosphorous were identified as the LNs,
   depending if one UFC or the entire placement room was considered. The
   results show that there is limited carbon and nutrients available for
   microbial growth in a DGR. The results also highlight the need for
   construction and operating procedures to control nutrients and organics
   additions to the repository.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional (3D), two-phase numerical model was developed and
   presented as a useful tool for investigating oxygen bubble propagation
   in porous transport layers (PTLs) (otherwise known as gas diffusion
   layers (GDLs)) of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. The
   volume-of-fluid (VoF) technique was employed to simulate the liquid-gas
   interface movement through liquid-saturated porous media designed to be
   representative of PEM electrolyzer PTLs. The circulation of the liquid
   within the channel and the porous domain was included in the model.
   Bubble propagation patterns and bulk saturations for porous material
   representations of commonly used PTLs were determined as a function of
   time leading up to the moment of breakthrough. Previously conducted
   experimental microfluidic investigations were used for model validation,
   and it was found that the numerical results were in good agreement with
   the numerical predictions. The validated model was used to calculate
   pressure variations in bubbles during propagation, and the highest
   threshold capillary pressure corresponding to a critical throat was
   introduced as a means to measure the efficacy of oxygen bubble removal.
   The information obtained from the developed numerical tool can be used
   for designing and evaluating PTL microstructures for next generation

Abstract = {{The integration of planar-type perovskite (E-g similar to 1.5 eV) solar
   cells (PSCs) with a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) composite comprising a
   near-infrared (NIR) absorbing conjugated polymer ( E-g < 1.4 eV) and a
   fullerene derivative is a promising approach to overcoming the narrow
   absorption limit of typical PSCs. Nevertheless, integrated solar cells
   (ISCs) suffer from low fill factors (FFs) and inefficient NIR
   harvesting, mainly due to poor charge transport in the BHJ films. Here,
   we successfully demonstrate highly efficient P-I-N perovskite/BHJ ISCs
   with an enhanced FF and improved NIR harvesting by introducing a novel
   n-type semiconducting polymer and a new processing additive into the BHJ
   films. The optimized ISCs exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of
   16.36\%, which far surpasses that of the reference PSCs (similar to
   14.70\%) due to the increased current density (J(sc) similar to 20.04 mA
   cm(-2)) resulting from the additional NIR harvesting. Meanwhile, the
   optimized ISCs maintain a high FF of 77\% and an open-circuit voltage
   (V-oc) of 1.06 V. These results indicate that this approach is a
   versatile means of overcoming the absorption and theoretical efficiency
   limits of state-of-the-art PSCs.}},

Title = {{Corrosion kinetics of 316L stainless steel bipolar plate with
   chromiumcarbide coating in simulated PEMFC cathodic environment}},

Abstract = {{Stainless steel with chromium carbide coating is an ideal candidate for
   bipolar plates. However, the coating still cannot resist the corrosion
   of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) environment. In this
   work, the corrosion kinetics of 316L stainless steel with chromium
   carbide is investigated in simulated PEMFC cathodic environment by
   combining electrochemical tests with morphology and microstructure
   analysis. SEM results reveal that the steel's surface is completely
   coated by Cr and chromium carbide but there are pinholes in the coating.
   After the coated 316L stainless steel is polarized, the diffraction peak
   of Fe oxide is found. EIS results indicate that the capacitive
   resistance and the reaction resistance first slowly decrease (2-32 h)
   and then increase. The potentiostatic transient curve declines sharply
   within 2000 s and then decreases slightly. The pinholes, which exist in
   the coating, result in pitting corrosion. The corrosion kinetics of the
   coated 316L stainless steel are modeled and accords the following
   equation: i(0) = 7.6341t (0) (.5), with the corrosion rate controlled by
   ion migration in the pinholes. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{The uplink in a cellular network where the base station (BS) and an
   advanced user equipment (UE) that is not the traditional mobile device
   is investigated. This is proposed as a method of antenna offloading for
   the typical UE which suffers from size constraints. The Gram-Schmidt
   (GS) precoding algorithm is used to design novel precoding solutions
   when the receiver and transmitter can have a large antenna array (e.g.
   N-R = 64; N-T = 32), as expected to be the case for deploying wireless
   backhaul links. Using the QR-decomposition on the Zero Forcing (ZF)
   receiver, the proposed scheme is shown to essentially perform channel
   inversion with the help of the transmitter and receiver. With a moderate
   number of receive antenna elements, the matched filter (MF) was observed
   to incur inter-stream interference, while the ZF and minimum mean
   squared error (MMSE) receiver were more susceptible to transmitter side
   correlation compared to the GS precoding algorithm. When there is only
   channel correlation information (CCI) at the transmitter side, the GS
   precoding matrix is shown to be approximated by inverting the Cholesky
   decomposition of the CCI transmit matrix and outperforms the MF. Finally
   a block successive interference cancellation (SIC) detection scheme for
   the K-User MIMO channel is presented. It is shown for N-T = 2 the GS
   precoder has a higher sum rate than the ZF receiver in the high signal
   to noise ratio (SNR) regime.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud Radio Access Networks (Cloud-RAN) promise to leverage cloud
   computing capabilities to enhance the quality and coverage of wireless

   with such dense network: the first is the high energy consumption
   associated with such a large number of RRHs; the second is the
   interference experienced by the receiver due to close proximity of the
   transmitters. To address these challenges, we study the problem of joint
   activation and clustering of RRHs. Since the problem is NP-hard, we
   provide a two-step algorithm that can find an efficient solution. The
   first step uses linear-programming relaxation to find a feasible
   solution. The second step is a greedy approach to improve the utility
   function through gradual activation-clustering of RRHs. Our simulation
   results demonstrate the benefit in the joint design of activation and
   clustering over existing activation only approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud Radio Access Networks (C-RAN) promise to leverage cloud computing
   capabilities for enhancing the quality and coverage of next generation
   5G networks. 5G networks shall witness an increasing density of users
   and access points, very small latencies, more bandwidth resources, and
   the use of virtualized hardware for baseband processing. Within such an
   environment, the problem of scheduling the network users across the
   radio resources might become a bottleneck of the system. In this paper,
   we study the problem of fully distributed scheduling in C-RAN systems.
   The idea is that each user's base band processing unit (BBU) tries to
   guess whether its user should be scheduled or not. First, we focus on
   the case of maximum throughput scheduling and Rayleigh channels, and
   provide closed-form expression for the expected effective channel and
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the distributed scenario. In order to
   deal with general channels and schedulers, we adopt the classification
   techniques from machine learning We discover an interesting relationship
   between the fairness of the scheduler, and its ability to be
   distributed. In particular, schedulers which are more fair are also more
   prune to prediction errors in the distributed scenario. Finally, we
   provide simulation results that show that distributed scheduling can
   provide up to 90\% of the performance of the centralized case.}},

Abstract = {{Diversification of application areas, technologies, and computational
   techniques in the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) domain alongside the
   need for a balance between reproducibility and customizability for the
   heterogeneous end-user groups has led towards the development of
   domain-specific middleware platforms, which are software frameworks that
   facilitate integration and communication amongst heterogeneous hardware
   and software components, so they can operate synergistically within a
   shared environment. Recent efforts that study such platforms have
   emphasized the need for improved evaluation methods, particularly
   feature-focused scenario-based evaluations. Thus, the objective of this
   work was to perform a comparative analysis of two prominent AAL
   middleware platforms and their programmability for Older Adults with
   Dementia (OAwD) to ultimately derive guidelines for the development of
   AAL systems. Mapping of a platform-independence use-case scenario to
   both platforms, hinted towards the need for graphical-user interfaces
   over text-based interfaces and application area-specific modules. (C)

Abstract = {{Digital isolators are widely used in isolated power converters for
   transmitting high-frequency gating pulses. Opto-isolators generally
   suffer from low reliability, while emerging RF based isolators are
   expensive and power-hungry. In this work, two Phase-Locked-Loop (PLL)
   based synchronization schemes are introduced and demonstrated to operate
   a bidirectional Dual-Active-Bridge (DAB) dc-dc converter. The proposed
   Digital Isolator Sensing (DIS) scheme utilizes a miniature air-core
   pulse transformer for synchronization and data communication, while the
   Power Transformer Sensing (PTS) scheme eliminates the need for any
   digital isolator for synchronization by using the power transformer. The
   application of DIS scheme can be extended to any topology that requires
   active switches on both sides of the isolation boundary, whereas the PTS
   scheme is designed for the DAB converter. In both schemes, the reference
   clock is generated on the secondary-side controller, and sensed
   indirectly on the primary-side. A PLL with a 100 MHz delay line, precise
   12-bit phase-shift control module, and high-frequency transceiver are
   implemented on-chip in a 0.18 mu m 80V BCD process, and are used to
   control an off-chip DAB power stage.}},

Abstract = {{The diagnosis of infectious disease is typically carried out at the
   point-of-care (POC) using the lateral flow assay (LFA). While
   cost-effective and portable, LFAs often lack the clinical sensitivity
   and specificity required for accurate diagnoses. In response to this
   challenge, we introduce a new digital microfluidic (DMF) platform
   fabricated using a custom inkjet printing and roll-coating process that
   is scalable to mass production. The performance of the new devices is on
   par with that of traditional DMF devices fabricated in a cleanroom, with
   a materials cost for the new devices of only US \$0.63 per device. To
   evaluate the usefulness of the new platform, we performed a 13-step
   rubella virus (RV) IgG immunoassay on the inkjet printed, roll-coated
   devices, which yielded a limit of detection of 0.02 IU mL(-1), well
   below the diagnostic cut-off of 10 IU mL(-1) for RV infection and
   immunity. We propose that this represents a breakthrough for DMF,
   lowering the costs to a level such that the new platforms will be an
   attractive alternative to LFAs for the diagnosis of infectious disease
   at the POC.}},

Abstract = {{We study the application of constraint programming (CP) to the planning
   and scheduling of multiple social robots interacting with residents in a
   retirement home. The robots autonomously organize and facilitate group
   and individual activities among residents. The application is a
   multi-robot task allocation and scheduling problem in which task plans
   must be determined that integrate with resident schedules. The problem
   involves reasoning about disjoint time windows, inter-schedule task
   dependencies, user and robot travel times, as well as robot energy
   levels. We propose mixed-integer programming (MIP) and CP approaches for
   this problem and investigate methods for improving our initial CP
   approach using symmetry breaking, variable ordering heuristics, and
   large neighbourhood search. We introduce a relaxed CP model for
   determining provable bounds on solution quality. Experiments indicate
   substantial superiority of the initial CP approach over MIP, and
   subsequent significant improvements in the CP approach through our
   manipulations. This work is one of the few, of which we are aware, that
   applies CP to multi-robot task allocation and scheduling problems. Our
   results demonstrate the promise of CP scheduling technology as a general
   optimization infrastructure for such problems.}},

Abstract = {{As wind energy is established as a sustainable alternative source of
   electricity, very large-scale wind farms with hundreds of turbines are
   becoming increasingly common. For the optimal design of wind farm
   layouts, the number of decision variables is at least twice the number
   of turbines (e.g., the Cartesian coordinates of each turbine). As the
   number of turbines increases, the computational cost incurred by the
   optimization solver to converge to a satisfactory solution increases as
   well. This issue represents a serious limitation in the computer-aided
   design of large wind farms. Moreover, the wind farm domains are
   typically highly constrained including land-availability and proximity
   constraints. These non-linear constraints increase the complexity of the
   optimization problem and decrease the likelihood of obtaining even a
   feasible solution. Several approaches have been proposed for micrositing
   of wind turbines, including random searches, mixed-integer programs, and
   metaheuristics. Each of these methods has its own trade-off between the
   quality of optimized layouts and the computational cost of obtaining the
   solution. In this paper, we demonstrate the capability of non-linear
   mathematical programming for optimizing very large-scale wind farms by
   leveraging explicit, analytical derivatives for the objective and
   constraint functions, thus overcoming the aforementioned limitations
   while also providing convergence and local optimality guarantees. For
   that purpose, two large farms with hundreds of turbines and significant
   land-use constraints are solved on a standard personal computer.}},

Abstract = {{Designing protective structures capable of withstanding the combined
   extreme actions of impact/blast and fire necessitates the accurate
   prediction of material properties under the coupled effects of
   high-strain-rate and subsequent elevated temperature loadings. An
   extensive experimental program was being carried out in the Civil
   Engineering Laboratories at Monash University to investigate the
   post-impact fire properties of plain self-compacting concrete (SCC)
   material and the results are presented in this paper. This will help in
   evaluating whether partially damaged concrete elements can further
   sustain additional stresses in case of a subsequent fire outbreak.
   Specimens have undergone interrupted high-strain-rate compressive
   loading, controlled locally at defined levels of axial displacement, to
   account for different deformation states. Results indicate that the
   mechanical behavior of concrete subject to post-impact fire scenarios is
   dependent on the rate of loading, the damage history and the fire
   temperature to which it is subsequently exposed.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Citrated Sprague-Dawley rat blood plasma was used as a biologically
   relevant exposure medium to assess the acellular toxic potential of two
   metal oxide engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), zinc oxide (nZnO), and
   cerium oxide (nCeO(2)). Plasma was incubated at 37 degrees C for up to
   48 h with ENM concentrations ranging between 0 and 200mg/L. The degree
   of ENM-induced oxidation was assessed by assaying for reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) levels using dichlorofluorescein (DCF), pH, ferric
   reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), lipase activity, malondialdehyde
   (MDA), and protein carbonyls (PC). Whereas previous in vitro studies
   showed linear-positive correlations between ENM concentration and
   oxidative damage, our results suggested that low concentrations were
   generally pro-oxidant and higher concentrations appeared antioxidant or
   protective, as indicated by DCF fluorescence trends. nZnO and nCeO(2)
   also affected pH in a manner dependent on concentration and elemental
   composition; higher nZnO concentrations maintained a more alkaline pH,
   while nCeO(2) tended to decrease pH. No other biomarkers of oxidative
   damage (FRAP, MDA, PC, lipase activity) showed changes at any ENM
   concentration or time-point tested. Differential dissolution of the two
   ENMs was also observed, where as much as similar to 31.3\% of nZnO was
   instantaneously dissolved to Zn2+ and only negligible nCeO(2) was
   degraded. The results suggest that the direct oxidative potential of
   nZnO and nCeO(2) in citrated rat blood plasma is low, and that a
   physiological or immune response is needed to generate appreciable
   damage biomarkers. The data also highlight the need for careful
   consideration when selecting a model for assessing ENM toxicity.}},

   in the 18 Hz - 28 Hz frequency range of the participant's
   electroencephalograpic signals, triggered a neuroprosthesis designed to
   facilitate forward reaching, reaching to the mouth, and lateral reaching
   movements. After 40 90-minute sessions in which the participant
   attempted the reaching tasks repeatedly, with the movements assisted by
   the BCI-triggered neuroprosthesis, the participant's arm function showed
   a clinically significant six point increase in the Fugl-Meyer Asessment

   restore voluntary reaching function in individuals with chronic severe

Title = {{Continuous Size-Dependent Sorting of Ferromagnetic Nanoparticles in
   Laser-Ablated Microchannel}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports a low-cost method of continuous size-dependent
   sorting of magnetic nanoparticles in polymer-based microfluidic devices
   bymagnetic force. A neodymium permanent magnet was used to generate a
   magnetic field perpendicular to the fluid flow direction. Firstly, FeNi3
   magnetic nanoparticles were chemically synthesized with diameter ranges
   from 80 nm to 200 nm; then, the solution of magnetic nanoparticles and a
   buffer were passed through the microchannel in laminar flow; the
   magnetic nanoparticles were deflected from the flow direction under the
   applied magnetic field. Nanoparticles in the microchannel will move
   towards the direction of high-gradient magnetic fields, and the degree
   of deflection depends on their sizes; therefore, magnetic nanoparticles
   of different sizes can be separated and finally collected from different
   output ports. The proposed method offers a rapid and continuous approach
   of preparing magnetic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution from
   an arbitrary particle size distribution. The proposed new method has
   many potential applications in bioanalysis field since magnetic
   nanoparticles are commonly used as solid support for biological entities
   such as DNA, RNA, virus, and protein. Other than the size sorting
   application of magnetic nanoparticles, this approach could also be used
   for the size sorting and separation of naturally magnetic cells,
   including blood cells and magnetotactic bacteria.}},

   Sound Exposure in a Precocious Animal Model (Chinchilla laniger)}},
Journal = {{NEURAL PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Auditory brain areas undergo reorganization resulting from abnormal
   sensory input during early postnatal development. This is evident from
   studies at the cortical level but it remains unclear whether there is
   reorganization in the auditory midbrain in a species similar to the
   human, that is, with early hearing onset. We have explored midbrain
   plasticity in the chinchilla, a precocious species that matches the
   human in terms of hearing development. Neonatal chinchillas were
   chronically exposed to a 2 kHz narrowband sound at 70 dB SPL for 4
   weeks. Tonotopic maps in inferior colliculus (central nucleus) were
   defined based on single neuron characteristic frequency. We hypothesized
   an overrepresentation of the 2 kHz region of the maps. However, we
   observed a significant decrease in the proportion of neurons dedicated
   to the 2 kHz octave band and also away from the exposure frequency at 8
   kHz. In addition, we report a significant increase in low frequency
   representation (< 1 kHz), again a change to tonotopic mapping distant to
   the 2 kHz region. Thus in a precocious species, tonotopic maps in
   auditory midbrain are altered following abnormal stimulation during
   development. However, these changes are more complex than the
   overrepresentation of exposure related frequency regions that are often
   reported.}},

Journal = {{CASE REPORTS IN NEUROLOGICAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{We report the therapeutic effects of integrating brain-computer
   interfacing technology and functional electrical stimulation therapy to
   restore upper limb reaching movements in a 64-year-old man with severe
   left hemiplegia following a hemorrhagic stroke he sustained six years
   prior to this study. He completed 40 90-minute sessions of functional
   electrical stimulation therapy using a custom-made neuroprosthesis that
   facilitated 5 different reaching movements. During each session, the
   participant attempted to reach with his paralyzed arm repeatedly.
   Stimulation for each of the movement phases (e.g., extending and
   retrieving the arm) was triggered when the power in the 18Hz-28Hz range
   (beta frequency range) of the participant's EEG activity, recorded with
   a single electrode, decreased below a predefined threshold. The function
   of the participant's arm showed a clinically significant improvement in
   the Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) subscore (6 points)
   as well as moderate improvement in Functional Independence Measure
   Self-Care subscore (7 points). The changes in arm's function suggest
   that the combination of BCI technology and functional electrical
   stimulation therapy may restore voluntary motor function in individuals
   with chronic hemiplegia which results in severe upper limb deficit
   (FMA-UE <= 15), a population that does not benefit from current
   best-practice rehabilitation interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, we studied communication delay in distributed control of
   untimed discrete-event systems based on supervisor localisation. We
   proposed a property called delay-robustness: the overall system
   behaviour controlled by distributed controllers with communication delay
   is logically equivalent to its delay-free counterpart. In this paper, we
   extend our previous work to timed discrete-event systems, in which
   communication delays are counted by a special clock event tick. First,
   we propose a timed channel model and define timed delay-robustness; for
   the latter, a verification procedure is presented. Next, if the
   delay-robust property does not hold, we introduce bounded
   delay-robustness, and present an algorithm to compute the maximal delay
   bound (measured by number of ticks) for transmitting a channelled event.
   Finally, we demonstrate delay-robustness on the example of an under-load
   tap-changing transformer.}},

Title = {{A thin-film silicon based photocathode with a hydrogen doped TiO2
   protection layer for solar hydrogen evolution}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},

Abstract = {{Photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices for solar water splitting require not
   only high solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency but also high chemical
   stability in strong acidic or alkaline electrolytes for long-term
   operation. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been considered as a highly
   promising protection layer to achieve high chemical stability for solar
   water splitting devices, especially for silicon based monolithic
   photovoltaic electrochemical (PV-EC) systems, while there is a trade-off
   relationship between activity and stability in these devices: the high
   charge transport barrier at the PV (silicon based thin film solar
   cells)/TiO2 interface and the high ohmic loss in TiO2 films hinder the
   device performance, especially when a thick TiO2 protection layer
   (preferred to enhance the chemical stability in the electrolyte) is
   used. Herein, we show that a hydrogen doped TiO2 protection layer can
   break this traditional trend to increase the activitywithout
   deteriorating the stability, when thick protection layers are employed
   to ensure stability. We demonstrated significant performance enhancement
   in hydrogenated amorphous silicon/silicon germanium (a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H)
   photocathodes through this approach. On one hand, the H-doping can shift
   up the Fermi level and reduce the electron transport barrier at the
   interface of the PV/TiO2 protection layer. On the other hand, the higher
   carrier density via H-doping leads to the enhancement of electron
   transport in TiO2 films and a shorter depletion layer barrier. Thus, the
   H-doping results in a higher photocurrent output at 0 V vs. reversible
   hydrogen electrode (RHE), indicating the high potential of the H-doped
   TiO2 protection layer for achieving stable and efficient monolithic
   solar water splitting devices.}},

   resonance spectroscopy}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},

Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{4424-4435}},
Abstract = {{Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is extremely powerful for
   chemical analysis but it suffers from lower mass sensitivity compared to
   many other analytical detection methods. NMR microcoils have been
   developed in response to this limitation, but interfacing these coils
   with small sample volumes is a challenge. We introduce here the first
   digital microfluidic system capable of interfacing droplets of analyte
   with microcoils in a high-field NMR spectrometer. A finite element
   simulation was performed to assist in determining appropriate system
   parameters. After optimization, droplets inside the spectrometer could
   be controlled remotely, permitting the observation of processes such as
   xylose-borate complexation and glucose oxidase catalysis. We propose
   that the combination of DMF and NMR will be a useful new tool for a wide
   range of applications in chemical analysis.}},

   mobile capillary microgripper}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{4445-4457}},
Abstract = {{At the sub-millimeter scale, capillary forces enable robust and
   reversible adhesion between biological organisms and varied substrates.
   Current human-engineered mobile untethered micromanipulation systems
   rely on forces which scale poorly or utilize gripper-part designs that
   promote manipulation. Capillary forces, alternatively, are dependent
   upon the surface chemistry (which is scale independent) and contact
   perimeter, which conforms to the part surface. We report a mobile
   capillary microgripper that is able to pick and place parts of various
   materials and geometries, and is thus ideal for microassembly tasks that
   cannot be accomplished by large tethered manipulators. We achieve the
   programmable assembly of submillimeter parts in an enclosed
   three-dimensional aqueous environment by creating a capillary bridge
   between the targeted part and a synthetic, untethered, mobile body. The
   parts include both hydrophilic and hydrophobic components: hydrogel,
   kapton, human hair, and biological tissue. The 200 mu m untethered
   system can be controlled with five-degrees-of-freedom and advances
   progress towards autonomous desktop manufacturing for tissue
   engineering, complex micromachines, microfluidic devices, and
   metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a tool for the evaluation of employer-based
   transportation demand management (TDM) strategies. The conventional
   method of evaluating TDM strategies has typically been to conduct
   expensive before-and-after strategy implementation surveys. As an
   alternative approach, this research uses a joint revealed preference
   (RP) and stated preference (SP) survey (the RP SP survey) administered
   before deployment of the TDM strategy, which is more cost-effective and
   efficient. The data collected from the RP SP survey were used to
   estimate an advanced discrete choice model, which was packaged into a
   spreadsheet-based tool for TDM decision support. The tool adopted the
   concept of penetration rate, whereby only a subset of the target
   population could be targeted for any specific TDM strategy. The tool
   that was developed provides an alternative approach for the
   predeployment evaluation of any TDM strategy for efficient
   implementation. Moreover, the empirical model used in the tool reveals
   many behavioral details about commuters' responses to employer-based TDM
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This work discusses how the Williamson equivalent circuit for the
   modeling of via transitions is augmented using the polynomial chaos
   expansion (PCE) method to take into account stochastic variations of
   model parameters. In addition, it is shown how the PCE can be applied in
   combination with Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling to conduct an efficient
   design space analysis. The physics-based via (PBV) model is used to
   efficiently model multi-layer via interconnects by concatenating
   equivalent circuit models representing certain geometric sections of the
   interconnect. These equivalent circuits are expanded with respect to the
   stochastic model parameters by means of PCE and concatenated to derive
   an augmented model of the whole interconnect. From this representation,
   stochastic scattering parameters are extracted. Numerical examples
   verify the method and the computational advantages over MC sampling. The
   method provides a fast and comprehensive approach to design space
   exploration and variability assessment in the design stage of via
   interconnects. The presented approach is not limited to via models and
   can be applied to various microwave structures in a similar way.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, we propose a secure multi-modal biometric
   authentication that will have cancellable property. Cloud servers need
   to have the confidential information mobile and ready in case of
   cancellation so that the same user can authenticate or identify using
   the same authentication process when joining to other clouds. However, a
   cloud server needs to be careful transferring biometric data to other
   cloud during busy time, since biometric data is sensitive to bit error
   rate that may adversely affect the false acceptance or rejection rate.
   As such another key contribution of this paper is to provide a decision
   making model for biometric/confidential data transfer among clouds in
   busy time in order to avoid network congestion. The work presented in
   this research is also a good fit during migration of today's internet
   into MobilityFirst architecture while biometric information in a
   locality is being shared by cloud servers and service is being provided
   at the same time.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, iron oxide microrods (MRs) with different crystal phases
   were successfully fabricated by a facile solvothermal method and
   sequential annealing processes. It was found that the carbon content

   C). The carbon in the MRs contributed to the higher dye adsorption and
   drug loading capabilities of the MRs. The Fe3O4-C sample showed superior
   adsorption for both a cationic dye (methylene blue) and an anionic dye
   (methyl orange) with an equilibrium adsorption capability of 11.7 mg
   g(-1) and 20.8 mg g(-1), respectively. When applied as a drug carrier
   for a tissue plasminogen activator, the mass loading ratio of the MRs
   was as high as 12.9\% for chemical loading and 7.8\% for physical
   loading. With the high dye adsorption/drug loading ratio, such magnetic

Abstract = {{The performance versus cost tradeoffs of a fully electric, hybrid energy
   storage system (HESS), using lithium-ion (LI) and lead-acid (PbA)
   batteries, are explored in this work for a light electric vehicle (LEV).
   While LI batteries typically have higher energy density, lower internal
   resistance and longer lifetime than PbA batteries, the module cost of LI
   batteries are typically three to five times the cost of PbA batteries.
   The objective is to design a HESS that 1) is cost-competitive with a PbA
   single energy storage system (SESS) and 2) maintains most of the
   performance benefits of a lithium SESS. A modular HESS architecture with
   a bi-directional dc-dc converter and controller is proposed, and a
   power-mix algorithm with active inter-chemistry battery state-of-charge
   (SOC) balancing is presented, simulated, and verified experimentally.
   The batteries, converter and control algorithm are modeled in MATLAB,
   and the effects of total ESS energy, vehicle loading, depth-of-discharge
   (DOD), and speed are explored. The cost and performance of the HESS are
   assessed side-by-side with PbA and LI single energy storage system
   (SESS) configurations of comparable total energy, using expected vehicle
   range as the performance metric. The experimental HESS has a total
   projected cost midway between the SESS PbA cost and the SESS Li cost,
   while providing 17\% range and 22.5\% efficiency increase over the SESS
   PbA vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{Although dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) is a popular power reduction
   solution that has been widely used by processors and ASICs, it is still
   not commercially adopted by FPGAs. A unique feature of FPGAs that leads
   to challenges in adopting DVS is that the critical path and hence the
   minimum safe V-dd depends on the configured application. We present a
   robust DVS technique that solves these challenges. For each application,
   we generate a calibration table (CT) that stores the actual failing
   points of that application on a specific FPGA, under various operating
   conditions. This CT is used to scale V-dd while the application is
   running to guarantee safe operation with minimal power consumption. We
   develop an automated tool (FRoC) that ensures a Fast-Robust-Calibration
   of the FPGA to any application using it. FRoC ensures that the
   calibration process is invisible to FPGA users and does not add any
   extra manual steps to the design process. We show that our proposed DVS
   technique achieves a 33\% total power reduction on two large
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{High Level Synthesis (HLS) tools improve the speed of FPGA hardware
   design entry compared to traditional hardware description languages by
   raising the level of design abstraction. Using compiler directives to
   guide the tool, a wide variety of hardware architectures can be obtained
   without modification of the original behavioural code. However,
   selecting an optimal application of directives from this large design
   space can be daunting and time-consuming for a designer since evaluating
   a particular setting of directives requires running the FPGA tool flow.
   This work considers the use of sequential model-based optimization
   (SMBO) methods for automatically selecting directive settings. These
   methods construct models of the design space to guide the optimization
   process and minimize the number of tool evaluations. In this paper, we
   evaluate the use of SMBO for selecting HLS directives and extend the
   method to relate multiple uses of the same directive within a design. We
   observe that SMBO can quickly find optimal directive settings in a space
   of tens of thousands of possible directive configurations and find that
   our proposed extension can further improve the convergence rate over the
   standard method.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid growth of wire RC delay with technology scaling has put
   increasing pressure on FPGA architects to make more efficient use of the
   different layers available in the metal stack. While commercial FPGA
   architectures have implemented the majority of inter-logic-block wiring
   on the lower metal layers and a small fraction of wires on the
   least-resistive upper metal layers, published explorations have largely
   ignored the question of how to exploit the different layers of the metal
   stack, focusing instead on very simple interconnect topologies and
   physical models. We generate VPR architectures and detailed area and
   delay models at the 22nm node and present enhancements to VPR that
   enable us to describe and evaluate complex interconnect topologies. We
   use our new architectures and tool enhancements to explore complex
   interconnect patterns suitable for modern unidirectional architectures
   and suggest topologies to connect wires on the semi-global and global
   metal layers. The proposed topologies improve the critical path routing
   delay by 17\% compared to architectures with no global layer wires, and
   by 5-13\% compared to architectures with global layer wires using the
   default VPR switch pattern.}},

Abstract = {{A 4-channel wireless and battery-less neurostimulator with

   device houses a 10 mm(2) 0.35 mu m HV-CMOS SoC (system on a chip) that

   compliance of up to 20 V. An on-chip mixed-signal controller together
   with a 3-bit charge-pump maintain supply voltage at its minimum required
   value, resulting in up to 68.5\% saving in power. An 8-bit current DAC
   is implemented in each channel, which together with adjustable supply
   voltage yield a current range from 23 mu A to 95 mA (100 Omega load).
   The device receives both power and configuration commands wirelessly
   using a near-field inductive link. The neurostimulator SoC is
   wire-bonded on a 2x2 cm(2) PCB. Additional rigid and flexible PCBs of

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the degradation produced in natural images

   relationships between the amount of compression-induced degradation in

   blocks that will exhibit lower/higher rates of degradation as the degree
   of compression increases. (ii) To compare the above objective
   characterizations with subjective assessments of observers.
   The conclusions of our study are rather significant in several aspects.
   First of all, ``bad{''} blocks, i.e., blocks exhibiting greater degrees
   of degradation visually, have among the lowest RMSEs of all blocks and
   among the medium-to-highest structural similarity (SSIM)-based errors.
   Secondly, the standard deviations of ``bad{''} blocks are among the
   lowest of all blocks, suggesting a kind of ``Weber law for
   compression,{''} a consequence of contrast masking. Thirdly, ``bad{''}
   blocks have medium-to-high high-frequency (HF) fractions as opposed to

Abstract = {{In underlay Device-to-Device (D2D) communication, a D2D pair reuses the
   cellular spectrum and creates interference to regular cellular users.
   Achieving potential improvements in underlay D2D communication requires
   joint consideration for the achieved D2D rate and the interference to
   cellular users. In this work, we present stochastic optimization
   solutions to allocate the D2D transmission power over multiple resource
   blocks (RBs), to maximize the D2D rate, under a long-term sum-power
   constraint and long-term individual power constraints over each RB at
   the D2D transmitter. The long-term sum-power constraint limits the
   battery usage of the D2D transmitter, and the per-RB constraints give
   probabilistic guarantees on the interference to regular cellular users.
   The proposed optimization is applicable to both uplink and downlink
   cellular spectrum sharing. We present two dynamic algorithms to solve
   this stochastic optimization problem: a Lagrange dual based algorithm
   that is optimal but has high computational complexity, and a
   low-complexity heuristic based on dynamic time averaging. Through
   simulation, we show that the performance gap between optimal and
   heuristic algorithms is small, and effective long-term stochastic power
   optimization over the D2D shared RBs can lead to substantial gains in
   the ergodic sum rate between D2D and cellular users.}},

   patterns of other users in the neighboring cells. This paper formulates
   the uplink joint cell association and scheduling problem as a network
   utility maximization problem. We propose a series of problem
   reformulations based on fractional programming, and recursively solve
   the resulting convex approximation to reach a local optimum of the

   improvement as compared to the benchmarks.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid analog and digital beamforming is a promising technique for
   large-scale MIMO systems since it can achieve a performance close to the
   performance of the conventional fully-digital beamforming schemes, but
   with much lower hardware implementation complexity and power
   consumption. One of the major challenges in hybrid beamforming is to
   design the hybrid beamformers for broadband systems with
   frequency-selective channels. This is because in broadband systems, it
   is desirable to design the same analog beamformers for the entire band
   while adapting digital beamformers in each frequency tone. In this
   paper, we consider the hybrid beamforming design for large-scale MIMO
   systems with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
   modulation. Specifically, we propose a unified heuristic design for two
   different hybrid beamforming structures, the fully-connected and
   partially-connected structures, to maximize the overall spectral
   efficiency of a broadband system. Numerical results show that the
   proposed algorithm outperforms the existing hybrid beamforming designs
   and further the proposed algorithm for the fully-connected structure can
   achieve spectral efficiency close to that of the optimal fully-digital
   solution with much less number of RF chains.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides an analytical performance characterization of
   user-centric cooperation for network multiple-input multiple-output
   (MIMO) systems, where base-stations (BSs) form finite-sized clusters to
   jointly transmit information to and receive information from multiple
   mobile users. In the user-centric model, the cooperation BS cluster for
   each user is formed individually and may overlap with each other. The
   size of clusters determines the amount of backhaul and channel state
   information needed for implementation. The BSs are equipped with
   multiple antennas; multiple single-antenna users are served
   simultaneously; the cooperating BSs perform zero-forcing beamforming
   across the cluster. By using a stochastic geometry model where the BSs
   and the users form Poisson point processes over the two-dimensional
   plane and by further approximating both the signal and interference
   powers using Gamma distributions of appropriate parameters, this paper
   shows that, network MIMO provides sum-rate gain for both uplink (UL) and
   downlink (DL) transmission as compared to single-cell processing. The
   sum-rate gain is about 30\%-60\% for a cluster size of 10 and is larger
   in DL than UL in a typical deployment due to the larger DL transmit
   power. More significantly, network MIMO can provide 300\% gain or more
   for cluster-edge users, but only for the DL and only with user-centric
   clustering. This highlights the conclusion that performance evaluation
   for network MIMO should focus on DL cluster-edge users and on the
   user-centric clustering strategy.}},

   which, in turn, is a function of the transmitted signal. This paper
   considers the joint design of adaptive transmit and receive weights to
   maximize the SINR of a target at a chosen look angle-Doppler point. This
   is akin to extending receive-only space-time adaptive processing (STAP)
   to include transmit adaptivity. Previous work in joint design assumed
   that the required second-order statistics are known a priori. In this
   paper we develop a method to estimate the required statistics through a
   number of training sequences. The estimation is based on received data
   only, and does not assume any specific structure for, or a-priori
   knowledge of, the clutter covariance matrix. We do assume that the
   clutter statistics do not change during the training and detection
   intervals. Simulation results show that, as in receive- only STAP, the
   proposed method does not suffer from a large SINR loss with respect to
   the known-covariance case.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we address distributed detection wherein the instantaneous
   signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the individual sensors are unknown. A
   motivating example is a distributed radar receiver when the target radar
   cross section and/or the noise variance are unknown at each receiver.
   Recently it has been shown that detection problems can be converted into
   the estimation of a separating function (SF) followed by comparison to a
   threshold. Importantly, using an SF eliminates unknown parameters. Here,
   since the optimal detector depends on the unknown parameters, we propose
   a Separating Function Estimation Test (SFET) and a Generalized
   Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) at each receiver. Since the likelihood
   ratio test in the fusion center depends on the detection probability of
   local receivers, which are unknown, the optimal fusion rule is not
   applicable. We therefore employ an Asymptotically Optimal SFET (AOSFET)
   and a GLRT to find a suboptimal fusion rule. We assume that the local
   SNR at each sensor has a known probability density function. Simulation
   results show that the SFET outperforms the GLRT in the local detectors
   and under some conditions, the AOSFET provides better performance as
   compared to the majority fusion rule.}},

Journal = {{DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION-ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{150-157}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: We present the development and evaluation of a robust hand
   tracker based on single overhead depth images for use in the COACH, an
   assistive technology for people with dementia. The new hand tracker was
   designed to overcome limitations experienced by the COACH in previous
   clinical trials. Methods: We train a random decision forest classifier
   using similar to 5000 manually labeled, unbalanced, training images.
   Hand positions from the classifier are translated into task actions
   based on proximity to environmental objects. Tracker performance is
   evaluated using a large set of similar to 24 000 manually labeled images
   captured from 41 participants in a fully-functional washroom, and
   compared to the system's previous colour-based hand tracker. Results:
   Precision and recall were 0.994 and 0.938 for the depth tracker compared
   to 0.981 and 0.822 for the colour tracker with the current data, and
   0.989 and 0.466 in the previous study. Conclusions: The improved
   tracking performance supports integration of the depth-based tracker
   into the COACH toward unsupervised, real-world trials.
   Implications for Rehabilitation
   The COACH is an intelligent assistive technology that can enable people
   with cognitive disabilities to stay at home longer, supporting the
   concept of aging-in-place.
   Automated prompting systems, a type of intelligent assistive technology,
   can help to support the independent completion of activities of daily
   living, increasing the independence of people with cognitive
   disabilities while reducing the burden of care experienced by
   caregivers.
   Robust motion tracking using depth imaging supports the development of
   intelligent assistive technologies like the COACH.
   Robust motion tracking also has application to other forms of assistive
   technologies including gaming, human-computer interaction and automated
   assessments.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{166-175}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: This study further delineates the merits and limitations of the
   Access Technology Delivery Protocol (ATDP) through its application to
   two children with severe disabilities.
   Method: We conducted mixed methods case studies to demonstrate the ATDP
   with two children with no reliable means of access to an external
   device. Evaluations of response efficiency, satisfaction, goal
   attainment, technology use and participation were made after 8 and 16
   weeks of training with custom access technologies.
   Results: After 16 weeks, one child's switch offered improved response
   efficiency, high teacher satisfaction and increased participation. The
   other child's switch resulted in improved satisfaction and switch
   effectiveness but lower overall efficiency. The latter child was no
   longer using his switch by the end of the study.
   Conclusions: These contrasting findings indicate that changes to any
   contextual factors that may impact the user's switch performance should
   mandate a reassessment of the access pathway. Secondly, it is important
   to ensure that individuals who will be responsible for switch training
   be identified at the outset and engaged throughout the ATDP. Finally,
   the ATDP should continue to be tested with individuals with severe
   disabilities to build an evidence base for the delivery of response
   efficient access solutions.
   Implications for Rehabilitation
   A data-driven, comprehensive access technology delivery protocol for
   children with complex communication needs could help to mitigate
   technology abandonment.
   Successful adoption of an access technology requires personalized
   design, training of the technology user, the teaching staff, the
   caregivers and other communication partners, and integration with
   functional activities.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This paper presents a new cognitive assistive technology,
   nonlinear contextually aware prompting system (N-CAPS) that uses
   advanced sensing and artificial intelligence to monitor and provide
   assistance to workers with cognitive disabilities during a factory
   assembly task. Methods: The N-CAPS system was designed through the
   application of various computer vision and artificial intelligence
   algorithms that allows the system to track a user during a specific
   assembly task, and then provide verbal and visual prompts to the worker
   as needed. A pilot study was completed with the N-CAPS solution in order
   to investigate whether it was an appropriate intervention. Four
   participants completed the required assembly task five different times,
   using the N-CAPS system. Results: The participants completed all of the
   trials that they attempted with 85.7\% of the steps completed without
   assistance from the job coach. Of the 85.7\% of steps completed
   independently, 32.5\% of these were completed in response to prompts
   given by N-CAPS. Overall system accuracy was 83.3\%, the overall

Abstract = {{Forces transferred to the upper body during crutch use can lead to both
   short-term and long-term injuries, including joint pain, crutch palsy,
   and over-use injuries. While this force transmission has been studied in
   controlled laboratory settings, it is unclear how these forces are
   affected by irregular terrains commonly encountered during community
   ambulation. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of
   walking speed and uneven terrain on the load magnitude, distribution,
   and rate of loading at the human-crutch contact surfaces. Our results
   show that the rates of loading were significantly increased with higher
   walking speeds and while negotiating certain irregular terrains, despite
   there being no apparent effect on the peak force transmission,
   suggesting load rate may be a more appropriate metric for assessing
   terrain effects on crutch gait. Furthermore, irrespective of the type of
   terrain and walking condition, the largest compressive forces were found
   to reside in the carpal-tunnel region of the hand, and may therefore be
   a primary contributor to carpal-tunnel injury.}},

Abstract = {{A partial-order plan (POP) compactly encodes a set of sequential plans
   that can be dynamically chosen by an agent at execution time. One
   natural measure of the quality of a POP is its flexibility, which is
   defined to be the total number of sequential plans it embodies (i.e.,
   its linearizations). As this criteria is hard to optimize, existing work
   has instead optimized proxy functions that are correlated with the
   number of linearizations. In this paper, we develop and strengthen
   mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models for three proxy
   functions: two from the POP literature and a third novel function based
   on the temporal flexibility criteria from the scheduling literature. We
   show theoretically and empirically that none of the three proxy measures
   dominate the others in terms of number of sequential plans. Compared to
   the state-of-the-art MaxSAT model for the problem, we empirically
   demonstrate that two of our MILP models result in equivalent or slightly
   better solution quality with savings of approximately one order of
   magnitude in computation time.}},

Abstract = {{Linear assemblies of nanoparticles show promising applications due to
   their collective electronic, optical and magnetic properties. Rational
   design and controllable organization of nanoparticles in one-dimensional
   structures can strongly benefit from the marked similarity between
   conventional step-growth polymerization reactions and directional
   step-wise assembly of nanoparticles in linear chains. Here we show
   different aspects of the ``polymerization{''} approach to the
   solution-based self-assembly of polymer-functionalized metal
   nanoparticles with different chemical compositions, shapes and
   dimensions. The self-assembly was triggered by inducing solvophobic
   attraction between polymer ligands, due to the change in solvent
   quality. We show that both anisotropic (patchy) nanoparticles and
   nanoparticles uniformly capped with polymer molecules can self-assemble
   in linear chains. We explore the control of chain length, morphology,
   and composition, discuss the ability to form isotropic and hierarchical
   structures and show the properties and potential applications of linear
   assemblies of plasmonic nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{The standard sampling practice involves procuring lollipop samples from
   an opening on tundish floor close to the stopper rods. Analyzing these

   computational fluid dynamics to determine the inclusion paths in cases
   of balanced and unbalanced throughput casting of steel. The calculated
   trajectories showed that the inclusions are mostly concentrated near the
   ladle shroud where the tundish open eye (TOE) forms. In order to
   investigate the effect of TOEs on the chemistry of steel, the ideal
   sampling location was determined from the mathematical model.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid-liquid extraction is an important separation and purification
   method; however, it faces a challenge in reducing the energy consumption
   and the environmental impact of solvent (extractant) recovery. The
   reversible chemical reactions of switchable solvents (nitrogenous bases)
   with carbon dioxide (CO2) can be implemented in reactive liquid-liquid
   extraction to significantly reduce the cost and energy requirements of
   solvent recovery. The development of new effective switchable solvents
   reacting with CO2 and the optimization of extraction conditions rely on
   the ability to evaluate and screen the performance of switchable
   solvents in extraction processes. We report a microfluidic strategy for
   time-and labour-efficient studies of CO2-mediated solvent extraction.
   The platform utilizes a liquid segment containing an aqueous extractant
   droplet and a droplet of a solution of a switchable solvent in a
   non-polar liquid, with gaseous CO2 supplied to the segment from both
   sides. Following the reaction of the switchable solvent with CO2, the
   solvent becomes hydrophilic and transfers from the non-polar solvent to
   the aqueous droplet. By monitoring the time-dependent variation in
   droplet volumes, we determined the efficiency and extraction time for
   the CO2-mediated extraction of different nitrogenous bases in a broad
   experimental parameter space. The platform enables a significant
   reduction in the amount of switchable solvents used in these studies,
   provides accurate temporal characterization of the liquid-liquid
   extraction process, and offers the capability of high-throughput
   screening of switchable solvents.}},

   carefully monitored. The test was based on a modified Hopkinson pressure
   bar system and a Piston-holder system. The energy consumed by the sample
   during fragmentation was determined by considering the energy carried by
   the incident wave and the reflected wave. A granite with the feed size
   ranging from 9.5 to 12.7 mm was employed in this study. The samples were
   impacted sequentially from one to ten times, with fragment size
   reduction determined after each set of impacts by sieve analysis. The
   link between fragment size distribution and the energy absorbed by the

   MPa) under the hydrostatic confinement of 0 MPa, 5 MPa, 10 MPa, 15 MPa,
   and 20 MPa were tested under different loading rates. The result shows
   that the dynamic tensile strength increases with the hydrostatic
   confinement stress. It is also observed that under the same hydrostatic
   pre-stress, the dynamic tensile strength increases with the loading
   rate, revealing the so called material rate dependency. Furthermore, the
   increment of the tensile strength decreases with the hydrostatic
   confinement stress, which resembles the behavior of rock static tensile
   strength under confining pressure as reported in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of Longyou Sandstone (LS) (a material for
   Longyou rock caverns) under the combination of high loading rate and
   high temperature are important parameters for the protection of the
   caverns. Thus, the LS sample were first heat treated by various
   temperatures (150 degrees C, 250 degrees C, 350 degrees C, 450 degrees
   C, 600 degrees C and 850 degrees C) and the thermal damage was then
   characterized by the 3D X-ray Micro-Computed Tomography (CT) method.
   Meanwhile, the density and P-wave velocity of heat-treated sample and
   reference sample were measured. The values of CT value, density, and
   P-wave velocity decrease with the elevated heat-treatment temperature
   except for 450 degrees C. Thereafter, according to the suggested method
   for determining dynamic tensile strength and dynamic fracture toughness
   of rock by International Society of Rock Mechanics (ISRM), Brazilian
   Disc (BD) and Notch Semi-Circular Bend (NSCB) samples were employed in
   the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) system to measure the dynamic
   tensile strengths and the Mode-I fracture toughness of these LS samples
   under different dynamic loading rates. The dynamic tensile strength and
   fracture toughness of LS increase with the loading rate at a given
   heat-treatment temperature, and both the tensile strength and fracture
   toughness at the same loading rate decreases with the heat-treatment
   temperature except for 450 degrees C. This phenomenon can be explained
   by the variation of the numbers of micro-cracking in LS sample for the
   different heat-treatment temperatures. With the thermal damage variable
   derived from the average CT value, empirical formulas were established
   to relate the dynamic tensile strength and fracture toughness of LS to
   the loading rate and the heat-treatment temperature. The results
   demonstrate that the dynamic tensile strength and Mode-I fracture
   toughness of LS are significantly influenced by the heat-treatment,
   especially under higher loading rate.}},

Abstract = {{Non-conventional (anomalous) current-voltage characteristics are
   reported with increasing frequency for colloidal quantum dot-based (CQD)
   solar cells. The causes of S-shaped or negative-exponential J-V curves
   are not well understood. Many attempts made to explain these behaviors
   do not fully consider the physical electronic transport processes inside
   the solar cell within a hopping exciton and/or dissociated charge
   carrier framework. In this paper physical optoelectronic processes in
   heterojunction PbS CQD solar cells exhibiting anomalous J-V
   characteristic curves which are likely to share common origins with
   other QD solar cells with similar J-V characteristics are studied at 300
   K, 250 K, 200 K, 150 K and 100 K and a suitable theoretical model of
   purely hopping transport is developed. Hopping
   exciton-dissociation-generated hole accumulation at, and near, the
   CQD/metal interface leading to a space-charge layer (SCL) of
   temperature-dependent width is predicted, and a new ``hopping{''}
   Einstein relation is derived and experimentally demonstrated. A
   two-diode-equivalent charge carrier transport model is invoked and
   quantitative measurements of hopping carrier transport parameters are
   made both in the forward region and the reverse SCL, based on the J-V
   characteristics at those temperatures. The quantitative results add
   physical insight to the transport mechanism in glass/FTO/TiO2/PbS
   QD/MoO3/Au/Ag solar cells, in the bulk CQD film as well as within the
   SCL. These insights can be used for potential design improvement to
   maximize solar power conversion efficiencies, such as optimal dot-to-dot
   distance for maximizing charge carrier diffusivity and mobility.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS}},

Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{We consider the inverse problem of recovering an isotropic electrical
   conductivity from interior knowledge of the magnitude of one current
   density field generated by applying current on a set of electrodes. The
   required interior data can be obtained by means of MRI measurements. On
   the boundary we only require knowledge of the electrodes, their
   impedances, and the corresponding average input currents. From the
   mathematical point of view, this practical question leads us to consider
   a new weighted minimum gradient problem for functions satisfying the
   boundary conditions coming from the complete electrode model (CEM) of
   Somersalo, Cheney, and Isaacson {[}SIAM J. Appl. Math., 52 (1992), pp.
   1023-1040]. We show that this variational problem has nonunique
   solutions. The surprising discovery is that the physical data is still
   sufficient to determine the geometry of (the connected components of)
   the level sets of the minimizers. We thus obtain an interesting phase
   retrieval result: knowledge of the input current at the boundary allows
   determination of the full current vector field from its magnitude. We
   characterize locally the nonuniqueness in the variational problem. In
   two and three dimensions we also show that additional measurements of
   the voltage potential along a curve joining the electrodes yield unique
   determination of the conductivity. The proofs involve a maximum
   principle and a new regularity up to the boundary result for the CEM
   boundary conditions. A nonlinear algorithm is proposed and implemented
   to illustrate the theoretical results.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{7920-7936}},
Abstract = {{This paper numerically quantifies the dispersion of a solute, and in
   particular, the Taylor dispersion, in the pressure-driven flow of a
   non-colloidal suspension at moderately high volume fractions (0.2 to
   0.5) through conduits of different cross-sectional shapes. An obvious
   intuition is that the Taylor dispersivity should increase owing to a
   decrease in the molecular diffusivity of the solute in the presence of
   particles impermeable to the solute; however, this is true only at low
   volume fractions. At higher volume fractions, three other physical
   effects become important, all of which lead to a reduction in Taylor
   dispersivity relative to a Newtonian fluid. The first is the blunting of
   the velocity profile resulting from particle migration into the low
   shear-stress regions, an effect that has been alluded to in the past by
   Roht et al. {[}J. Contam. Hydrol., 2013, 14, 10] and is important only
   at low Peclet numbers (Pe). At higher Pe, the two stronger effects are
   shear-induced solute self-diffusion, which arises due to shear-induced
   particle-particle interactions, and secondary convection, which is
   observed in non-axisymmetric cross-sections as a result of the second
   normal stress differences exhibited by concentrated suspensions. For a
   given volume fraction and cross-sectional geometry, a regime map,
   developed using a scaling analysis, delineates five regimes of
   dispersion involving one or a combination of the mass transfer
   mechanisms mentioned above. Our analysis also suggests that the
   cross-sectional shape can be exploited to enhance or suppress solute
   dispersion by modifying the secondary current strength and profile.}},

   Changing Global Transport Costs}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2598}},
Pages = {{46-57}},
Abstract = {{Despite the complex political and economic trade environment, the
   generalized costs of transportation still play an important role in
   determining trade patterns. This paper analyzes how global trade
   patterns would simultaneously change as a result of new global
   transportation costs and for which countries the new patterns of global
   trade would be beneficial or detrimental. A random utility-based
   multiregion input-output model helps quantify the size of the impacts,
   identify the countries and sectors that would gain or lose the most, and
   explain the change in trade patterns that would create these impacts.
   Results suggest that Canada is most susceptible to negative economic
   impacts caused by decreases in global transportation costs, mainly
   because of its important trade relationship with the United States.
   Canada's economy benefits from its proximity to the United States, but
   as transportation costs decrease, this proximity becomes less relevant
   as the United States increasingly trades with more distant countries.
   The United States suffers the same susceptibility to negative economic
   impacts with decreases in global transportation costs, but to a larger
   absolute (smaller relative) extent. However, global transportation cost
   reductions are especially beneficial to Japan, China, and South Korea,
   which absorb much of the trade diverted away from the United States and
   Canada.}},

Abstract = {{The reuse of ontologies is critical to their value as a means of
   knowledge representation. Unfortunately, reuse also still poses a
   considerable challenge for the ontological community. One reason for
   this is the lack of a formal definition of reuse. How can we attempt to
   perform or even assist this sort of ontology design, if we have no clear
   understanding of what constitutes reuse, and what does not? In this work
   we aim to remedy this situation by providing a formal definition of the
   concepts of reuse and reusability. Beyond providing a clear
   understanding of these concepts, part of the resulting definition is a
   characterization of the operations of reuse that can be leveraged to
   determine how a given ontology(s) must be reused to satisfy some
   specified requirements. This serves not only to provide direction for
   the task of reuse, but also to assess the implications of reusing an
   ontology(s), a priori. Collectively, the solutions presented in this
   paper serve as a major step in improving the current state of reuse.}},

Abstract = {{Many software systems rely on ontologies for semantic interoperation.
   However, ontologies which admit unintended models might cause
   misunderstandings that hinder interoperability because their
   vocabularies are ambiguously defined. Foundational ontologies, such as
   SUMO, provide rich characterizations for general concepts that underly
   every knowledge representation enterprise. Those ontologies are intended
   to be broadly reused as a reference for semantics. Ontology verification
   is the process by which a theory is checked to rule out unintended
   models by means of further axiomatization, and characterize missing
   intended ones. In this paper, we verify the subtheory of core temporal
   concepts of the SUMO foundational ontology and relate its axiomatization
   via ontology mapping with other time ontologies, the foundational
   ontology DOLCE, and the generic ontology PSL. As a result, we propose
   the addition of some missing axioms that we have identified during our
   verification task, and the correction of others.}},

Title = {{Bilevel Fuzzy Chance Constrained Hospital Outpatient Appointment
   Scheduling Model}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Abstract = {{Hospital outpatient departments operate by selling fixed period
   appointments for different treatments. The challenge being faced is to
   improve profit by determining the mix of full time and part time doctors
   and allocating appointments (which involves scheduling a combination of
   doctors, patients, and treatments to a time period in a department)
   optimally. In this paper, a bilevel fuzzy chance constrained model is
   developed to solve the hospital outpatient appointment scheduling
   problem based on revenue management. In the model, the hospital, the
   leader in the hierarchy, decides the mix of the hired full time and part
   time doctors to maximize the total profit; each department, the follower
   in the hierarchy, makes the decision of the appointment scheduling to
   maximize its own profit while simultaneously minimizing surplus
   capacity. Doctor wage and demand are considered as fuzzy variables to
   better describe the real-life situation. Then we use chance operator to
   handle themodel with fuzzy parameters and equivalently transform the
   appointment scheduling model into a crisp model. Moreover, interactive
   algorithm based on satisfaction is employed to convert the bilevel
   programming into a single level programming, in order to make it
   solvable. Finally, the numerical experiments were executed to
   demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.}},

   Water Piston Pump Used in the Naval Ship}},
Journal = {{SHOCK AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Aiming at the existing problems of traditional water piston pump used in
   the naval ship, such as low efficiency, high noise, large vibration, and
   nonintelligent control, a new type of linear-motor-driven water piston
   pump is developed and its vibration characteristics are analyzed in this
   research. Based on the 3D model of the structure, the simulation
   analyses including static stress analysis, modal analysis, and harmonic
   response analysis are conducted. The simulation results reveal that the
   mode shape under low frequency stage is mainly associated with the
   eccentricity swing of the piston rod. The vibration experiment results
   show that the resonance frequency of linear-motor-driven water piston
   pump is concentrated upon 500 Hz and 800 Hz in the low frequency range.
   The dampers can change the resonance frequency of the system to a
   certain extent. The vibration under triangular motion curve is much
   better than that of S curve, which is consistent with the simulation
   conclusion. This research provides an effective method to detect the
   vibration characteristics and a reference for design and optimization of
   the linear-motor-driven water piston pump.}},

Title = {{Development of Replaceable Cast Steel Links for Eccentrically Braced
   Frames}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{10}},
Abstract = {{Replaceable links for eccentrically braced steel frames (EBFs) decouple
   the yielding links from the floor beams to facilitate rapid repair or
   replacement after a seismic event. Replaceable links that are composed
   of rolled or built-up steel sections are, however, susceptible to the
   same failure modes as links in conventional EBFs. These failure modes
   include fracture in the base metal or welds, local buckling, and
   lateral-torsional buckling, all of which limit the ductility of the link
   and consequently, the overall ductility of the frame. An extensive
   numerical analysis study was completed to develop replaceable cast steel
   link concepts, with practical connection details, that combine the
   advantages of replaceable links with the geometric freedom and material
   properties inherent to castings. Results indicate that the unique
   geometry of the proposed concepts achieves a larger rotation capacity
   and longer low-cycle fatigue life by evenly distributing flexural
   yielding over the entire length of the link and minimizing stress
   concentrations. The replaceable cast steel links have the potential to
   significantly improve the performance, reliability, robustness, and
   resilience of EBFs.}},

Abstract = {{When planning complex transit terminals, hubs, and stations, it is
   critical to analyze a facility's capacity to handle expected passenger
   movements and volumes. In Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the revitalization
   of Union Station, the country's busiest transit facility, involved the
   development of a set of high-fidelity pedestrian microsimulation models
   that were used to plan the improvement of this major intermodal hub. The
   pedestrian models were first created with MASSMOTION software, and
   construction plans and projected transit schedules were applied to
   represent various scenarios during and after the station revitalization.
   These models were then calibrated and validated against data from
   passenger counts and transit usage surveys to provide an accurate base
   for future scenarios. Through the use of a fully constructed model of
   the station with 2031 transit demand projections, a series of stress
   experiments was performed to evaluate the station's capability to handle
   future passenger volumes. Under projected 2031 circumstances, it was
   found that Union Station could operate reasonably well. However, an
   increase in inbound transit passenger volumes of a mere 10\% over 2031
   projections could lead to severe levels of congestion within constrained
   sections of the station. This paper reports on the development of the
   microsimulation models and the model results for future scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Growing interest within the neurophysiology community in assessing
   healthy and pathological brain activity in animals that are awake and
   freely-behaving has triggered the need for optical systems that are
   suitable for such longitudinal studies. In this work we report
   label-free multi-modal imaging of cortical hemodynamics in the
   somatosensory cortex of awake, freely-behaving rats, using a novel
   head-mounted miniature optical microscope. The microscope employs
   vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) at three distinct
   wavelengths (680 nm, 795 nm, and 850 nm) to provide measurements of four
   hemodynamic markers: blood flow speeds, HbO, HbR, and total Hb
   concentration, across a > 2 mm field of view. Blood flow speeds are
   extracted using Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI), while oxygenation
   measurements are performed using Intrinsic Optical Signal Imaging
   (IOSI). Longitudinal measurements on the same animal are made possible
   over the course of > 6 weeks using a chronic window that is surgically
   implanted into the skull. We use the device to examine changes in blood
   flow and blood oxygenation in superficial cortical blood vessels and
   tissue in response to drug-induced absence-like seizures, correlating
   motor behavior with changes in blood flow and blood oxygenation in the
   brain.}},

Title = {{Assessing the Potential Impacts ofConnected Vehicles: Mobility,

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{20}},

Pages = {{229-243}},
Abstract = {{The connected vehicle is a rapidly emerging paradigm aimed at deploying
   and developing a fully connected transportation system that enables data
   exchange among vehicles, infrastructure, and mobile devices to improve
   mobility, enhance safety, and reduce the adverse environmental impacts
   of the transportation systems. This study focuses on micromodeling and
   quantitatively assessing the potential impacts of the connected vehicle
   (CV) on mobility, safety, and the environment. To assess the benefits of
   CVs, a modeling framework is developed based on traffic microsimulation
   for a real network located in the city of Toronto, Canada, to mimic
   communication between enabled vehicles. In this study, we examine the
   effects of providing real-time routing guidance and advisory warning
   messages to CVs. In addition, to take into account the rerouting in
   nonconnected vehicles (non-CVs) in response to varying sources of
   information such as apps, global positioning systems (GPS), variable
   message signs (VMS), or simply seeing the traffic back up, the impact of
   fraction of non-CV vehicles was also considered and evaluated.
   Therefore, vehicles in this model are divided into;
   uninformed/unfamiliar not connected (non-CV), informed/familiar but not
   connected (non-CV) that get updates infrequently every 5 minutes or so
   (non-CV), and connected vehicles that receive information more
   frequently (CV). The results demonstrate the potential of connected
   vehicles to improve mobility, enhance safety, and reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions (GHGs) at the network-wide level. The results also show
   quantitatively how the market penetration of connected vehicles
   proportionally affects the performance of the traffic network. While the
   presented results are pertinent to the specifics of the road network
   modeled and cannot be generalized, the quantitative figures provide
   researchers and practitioners with ideas of what to expect from vehicle
   connectivity concerning mobility, safety, and environmental
   improvements.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) redistributes spectrum from service
   providers with spare channels to those in need for them. Existing works
   on such spectrum exchange mainly focus on double auctions, where an
   auctioneer centrally enforces a certain spectrum allocation policy. In
   this paper, we take a different and new perspective, proposing to use
   matching as an alternative tool to realize DSA in a distributed way for
   a free market, which consists of only buyers and sellers, but no
   trustworthy third-party authority. Compared with conventional
   many-to-one matching problems, the spectrum matching problem is
   distinctively challenging due to the interference bound between buyers:
   the same channel can be reused by an unlimited number of non-interfering
   buyers, but must be exclusively occupied by only one of interfering
   buyers. In this paper, we firstly formulate the spectrum matching
   problem as a many-to-one matching with peer effects, i.e., a buyer's
   utility is affected by other buyers who are matched to the same seller.
   We then present a two-stage distributed algorithm that converges to an
   interference-free and Nash-stable matching result. Simulations show that
   the proposed distributed matching algorithm can achieve 90\% of the
   social welfare from the optimal matching result.}},

Abstract = {{Chitin nanowhisker (CNW)/polypropylene (PP) composites with various CNW
   loadings fabricated through melt blending were characterized for their
   morphology, thermal properties, water barrier properties, mechanical
   properties, and rheological properties. The effects of CNWs and
   compatibilizer on these properties were investigated. Morphological
   studies of the composites revealed good dispersion of CNWs within the
   polymer matrix, which translated into improvements in elastic modulus,
   ultimate tensile strength, and water barrier properties. These results
   were further supported by thermal and rheological properties showing
   increase in crystallinity and extensional viscosity of the composites
   respectively. Moreover, the addition of a compatibilizer suggested
   reinforcement and enhanced interaction between the CNW and PP as a
   significant improvement in water barrier properties was observed. Based
   on the results, the multiple properties that were explored in this study
   can be tailored with the addition of CNWs, which is a biodegradable
   filler, for various sustainable packaging and industrial applications.}},

Abstract = {{We consider discrete-event systems (DES) consisting of parallel arrays
   of machines and buffers. The machines are divided into groups in each of
   which the members have identical structure, i.e. same state set and
   isomorphic transitions. In these systems, to avoid the underflow or
   overflow of the buffers, the controller only needs the information of
   the total numbers of components at each state and the numbers of
   workpieces in the buffers. By exploiting the identical structure of each
   group, we extract such control information from the control functions
   computed by the state tree structures (STS) to generate abstract control
   functions. Thanks to the symmetry of the system, we show that all
   controllable events relabeled to the same symbol share an invariant
   abstract control function, which is independent of the total number of
   machines, as long as the buffer sizes are fixed. The approach is
   illustrated by two examples.}},

Abstract = {{The ever-increasing Internet traffic has challenged the business model
   of many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in their core network as the
   revenue cannot not grow up as expected anymore. Therefore, ISPs should
   redesign their network to minimize their cost per bit using a careful
   provisioning and traffic routing in the network. In this paper, we
   consider multi-chassis routers with multi-rate line cards in IP/optical
   networks and develop a Mixed Linear Integer Program (MILP) to minimize
   the CAPital EXpenditure (CAPEX) cost. Placeholder for network topology,
   demand traffic matrix and network elements prices are the inputs to the
   problem, and the optimum network design and traffic routing with a
   detailed list of network elements are its outputs. Moreover, a heuristic
   provisioning algorithm is developed which reduces the complexity of the
   problem by separating routing from provisioning. Simulation results
   verify the performance of the proposed heuristic algorithm.(1)}},

Abstract = {{The quality of multimedia communications heavily relies on the
   end-to-end network condition. Media sessions that are routed through
   highly-utilized links are in more jeopardy of longer delays, more packet
   loss. Choosing optimal routes to embed the data flows can be performed
   in a centralized manner in SDN-enabled networks. However, the
   calculation of such optimal flow embedding is NP-hard.
   In this paper, we propose a Two-phase Flow Embedding heuristic to tackle
   the problem. Phase I is a global planning module, periodically invoked.
   Given the total traffic of a time period, it produces the optimal
   end-to-end tunnels between each pair of communication endpoints. The
   objective is to balance the traffic distribution, measured by the value
   of network criticality. Phase II is a traffic engineering module, always
   active. It receives the individual data flows, and selects one of the
   pre-configured tunnels between the requested endpoints, to embed the
   flow. We compare the Two-phase flow embedding heuristic with Dijkstra
   algorithm. We show that the proposed heuristic outperforms the
   Dijkstra's in three different metrics: session accept rate,
   maximum/average substrate link utilization, and network criticality.}},

Abstract = {{Batteries can be used to provide ancillary services to electric power
   systems; however, a battery's energy storage capacity degrades as it
   consumes and produces power. To improve the economics of batteries, we
   wish to control them in ways that minimize degradation. This is a
   challenging task because i) battery dynamics are nonlinear, ii) battery
   power dynamics are on a completely different timescale than battery
   degradation dynamics, and iii) batteries only have one control input
   (current) and if we wish to achieve two objectives (signal tracking
   accuracy and degradation minimization) we must trade-off between them.
   We extend an existing nonlinear battery model, pose the battery
   control/management problem as a tracking control problem, and develop
   three controllers based upon PID control, feedback linearization, and
   sliding mode control. In simulation, we show how the controllers enable
   us to easily tradeoff tracking accuracy and battery life, and how
   explicitly considering nonlinear battery dynamics in the controllers
   improves performance. We also show how state estimation error and model
   mismatch impact the performance of the feedback linearization
   controller, and how the sliding model control is more more robust to
   these errors.}},

Abstract = {{The error-related potential (ErrP) can inform the correction of
   brain-computer interface (BCI) mistakes, but it has thus far been
   incorporated only into visual BCIs, with mixed success. Given that ErrPs
   are thought to have higher impact when BCI accuracy is relatively low,
   we sought to identify the aurally evoked ErrP and investigate its
   auto-corrective value in auditory BCIs, which typically yield lower
   accuracies than visual BCIs. We implemented an auditory P300 BCI with
   four selectable items. Each of nine typically developed participants
   attempted to spell letter sequences on two separate days. Erroneous
   feedback was detected by (i) making use of the ErrP, (ii) assessing BCI
   selection confidence, and (iii) combining these two pieces of
   information into a hybrid detector. ErrPs were detected with an average
   cross-validation area under the curve of 0.946. Simulated automatic
   correction by reverting to the second-ranked letter improved
   participant-wise information transfer rate by 2.3 bits/minute when
   errors were detected by the hybrid method. The results suggest
   ErrP-based error correction can be used to make a substantial
   improvement in the performance of auditory BCIs.}},

Abstract = {{The multi-scale modelling approach is a, powerful mathematical technique
   for simulating and analyzing complex biological systems such as the
   human body. This tool can help study the interactions of the various
   networks in a living organism, from the cellular level up to the
   population scale, in one framework. In this paper, a generic
   mathematical model is developed that describes human metabolism with 237
   serum metabolites integrated with a chosen set of human metabolic
   networks. A new computational approach is presented for solving the
   resulting dynamic problem using parsimonious flux balance analysis
   (pFBA). To illustrate the performance of the proposed;Approach, the
   human hepatocyte genome scale model is selected for the metabolic
   network to be included. The simulation results show that the proposed
   approach has promise with respect to both computational efficiency and
   convergence. To demonstrate the potential application of the developed
   model, prediction of amino acid biomarkers for a set of inborn errors of
   metabolism (IEM) is considered as an example. All the simulations are
   performed rising MATLAB and the COBRA toolbox. This framework has the
   potential to simulate various human metabolic disorders to help with the
   diagnosis of associated human diseases and to suggest novel treatment
   strategies. In addition, it opens the door to new opportunities for
   personalized medicine. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of

Pages = {{1000-1015}},
Abstract = {{This study presents a two-stage vertex analysis (TSVA) method for the
   planning of electric power systems (EPS) under uncertainty. TSVA has
   advantages in comparison to other optimization techniques. Firstly, TSVA
   can incorporate greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement policies directly into
   its optimization process, and, secondly, it can readily integrate
   inherent system uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets and probability
   distributions directly into its modeling formulation and solution
   procedure. The TSVA method is applied to a case study of planning EPS
   and it is demonstrated how the TSVA efficiently identify optimal
   electricity-generation schemes that could help to minimize system cost
   under different GHG-abatement considerations. Different combinative
   considerations on the uncertain inputs lead to varied system costs and
   GHG emissions. Results reveal that the total electricity supply will
   rise up along with the time period due to the increasing demand and, at
   the same time, more non-fossil fuels should be used to satisfy the
   increasing requirement for GHG mitigation. Moreover, uncertainties in
   connection with complexities in terms of information quality (e.g.,
   capacity, efficiency, and demand) result in changed
   electricity-generation patterns, GHG-abatement amounts, as well as
   system costs. Minimax regret (MMR) analysis technique is employed to
   identify desired alternative that reflects compromises between system
   cost and system-failure risk.}},

Abstract = {{Half of the time in the design cycle today is spent on verifying and
   debugging the correctness of a design. Although some debugging tasks
   have been automated, determining the root-cause of errors that have been
   locked in memory for a number of clock cycles before they propagate to
   an observation point remains a time consuming effort. This is because
   the error traces exposing such behavior can be excessively long, a fact
   that requires modeling the circuit for many time-frames. This paper
   introduces a performance-driven debugging methodology for pinpointing
   the root-cause of memory-locked errors. The technique models only a
   sliding time window and a final time window explicitly at any one time,
   while interstitial time-frames are linked with a lightweight memory
   model. This technique is later extended to a complete methodology that
   diagnoses errors that may be missed. Experiments on industrial designs
   with memory-locked errors demonstrate a 72\% reduction in peak memory
   usage with a comparable runtime to existing methodologies.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic computing (SC) {[}1] has received attention recently as a
   paradigm to improve energy efficiency and fault tolerance. SC uses
   hardware-generated random bitstreams to represent numbers in the {[}0:
   1] range - the number represented is the probability of a bit in the
   stream being logic-1. The generation of random bitstreams is typically
   done using linear-feedback shift register (LFSR)-based random number
   generators. In this paper, we consider how best to design such
   LFSR-based stochastic bitstream generators, as a means of improving the
   accuracy of stochastic computing. Three design criteria are evaluated:
   1) LFSR seed selection, 2) the utility of scrambling LFSR output bits,
   and 3) the LFSR polynomials (i.e. locations of the feedback taps) and
   whether they should be unique vs. uniform across stream generators. For
   a recently proposed multiplexer-based stochastic logic architecture
   {[}8], we demonstrate that careful seed selection can improve accuracy
   results vs. the use of arbitrarily selected seeds. For example, we show
   that stochastic logic with seed-optimized 255-bit stream lengths
   achieves accuracy better than that of using 1023-bit stream lengths with
   arbitrary seeds: an improvement of over 4x in energy for equivalent
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Recapitulating the architecture of native tissue remains a significant
   challenge, impeding the progress of engineering tissues. Imposing
   appropriate organization is especially challenging in tissues that
   contain multiple cellular components in complex structural units. One
   solution is to mimic developmental processes in embryos. In an embryo,
   cells are organized by tissue patterning, whereby induction of
   fate-determining genes is spatially controlled to generate patterns of
   cell differentiation and maturation. Following patterning, the imposed
   cell organization is further reinforced by implementation of compartment
   boundaries, which prevent intermingling of cells from distinct
   phenotypic domains, thereby ensuring preservation of proper cell
   organization in growing and reorganizing tissues. Both morphogenic
   processes utilize a conserved set of fundamental principles, the
   implementation of which leads to highly regulated cell organization. In
   this article, we review these patterning principles in vivo and reflect
   on the progress made by tissue engineers in mimicking tissue patterning
   ex vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Quality of Experience (QoE) is a crucial guiding factor for network
   management of an end-to-end service session. The network provider can
   control the resources allocated to sessions and in doing so, influence
   the Technical Quality (TQ), which covers the technical aspects of signal
   quality during the session. On the other hand, the network provider has
   no control over the Content Quality (CQ), which pertains to the user's
   level of interest in a particular video. Together TQ and CQ influence
   the Overall eXperience (OX) in a session. In this paper, we present
   results from a user subjective study in which the impact of TQ and CQ on
   OX was investigated for Over-The-Top (OTT) video sessions from the
   perspective of a network provider. This perspective places a focus on
   those elements of QoE that can be controlled by the provider. Various
   studies have shown that very high interest in a content can strongly
   influence QoE independent of other factors, so our study uses videos
   that are neutral with respect to content. We assess the TQ, CQ and OX
   for video sessions that contain Integrity impairments (in the form of
   image freezing) and failures in terms of session Accessibility and
   Retainability. Our findings indicate that TQ and CQ have a strong impact
   on OX in the presence of impairments, but no failures. On the other
   hand, TQ is the main determinant of OX when failures are present.}},

Abstract = {{In this demonstration we use a prototype of a Wireless Sensor Node along
   with a Software Defined Infrastructure to monitor the quality of the air
   in different classrooms at a University. Specifically, a number of
   wireless nodes are deployed in different classrooms. Each node has a
   number of sensors to monitor the air quality in the room. A number of
   relay nodes forward the data to a vCPE, which delivers the data to a
   Smart Edge. In the vCPE and the Smart Edge, a monitoring and analytic
   system, called MonArch, is used for collection, storage and analytic
   purposes of the monitoring data.}},

Abstract = {{The trade-off between extinction ratio (ER), insertion loss (IL), and
   energy consumption (E) is a common bottleneck for existing integrated
   optical modulators. In this work, we report an indium tin oxide (ITO)
   based hybrid-plasmonic modulator, consisting of a
   Si/ITO/HfO2/Al/HfO2/ITO/Si stack, that can alleviate such tradeoff in
   device metrics. This is achieved by first use field symmetry matching
   technique to engineer the waveguide to support long-range propagation.
   Then, by electrostatically inducing the ITO layers to enter an
   epsilon-near-zero state, strong carrier absorption as well as
   disturbance to the field symmetry will render the otherwise low-loss
   waveguide highly absorptive. Using this strategy, amplitude modulation
   with ER = 4.83 dB/pm, IL = 0.03 dB/pm, and E = 14.8 fJ is achieved.
   Moreover, with a triode-like biasing scheme, the modulator attributes
   can be further manipulated and the same device can be dynamically
   reconfigured for phase and 4-quadrature-amplitude modulation, with
   actively device length of only 5.53 mu m and 17.78 mu m respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The formation and characteristics of non-metallic inclusions in 316L
   stainless steel produced by the AOD (argon oxygen decarburization)-ladle
   furnace-continuous casting process were investigated. The morphology and
   composition of inclusions changed significantly during the refining and
   casting processes. After de-oxidation with Si/Mn additions, spherical
   complex inclusions mainly consisting of calcium silicates were observed.
   The contents of MgO and Al2O3 in these inclusions continuously increased
   as the steel moved from the AOD through ladle processing to the tundish.
   As the temperature decreased from the tundish through to solidification,
   harmful crystals of MgO/Al2O3 spinel were precipitated within the steel
   melt as well as within the calcium silicate matrix of existing
   inclusions. The results obtained from thermodynamic calculations carried
   out using FactSage (TM) commercial software agreed well with the
   information derived from evaluation of the industrial samples enabling
   recommendations to be made for the avoidance of detrimental spinel
   inclusions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Lifestyle behavior modification can reduce the risk of
   cardiovascular disease, one of the leading causes of death worldwide, by
   up to 80\%. We hypothesized that a dynamic risk assessment and behavior
   change tool delivered as a mobile app, hosted by a reputable nonprofit
   organization, would promote uptake among community members. We also
   predicted that the uptake would be influenced by incentives offered for
   downloading the mobile app.
   Objective: The primary objective of our study was to evaluate the
   engagement levels of participants using the novel risk management app.
   The secondary aim was to assess the effect of incentives on the overall
   uptake and usage behaviors.
   Methods: We publicly launched the app through the iTunes App Store and
   collected usage data over 5 months. Aggregate information included
   population-level data on download rates, use, risk factors, and user
   demographics. We used descriptive statistics to identify usage patterns,
   t tests, and analysis of variance to compare group means. Correlation
   and regression analyses determined the relationship between usage and
   demographic variables.
   Results: We captured detailed mobile usage data from 69,952 users over a
   5-month period, of whom 23,727 (33.92\%) were registered during a
   1-month AIR MILES promotion. Of those who completed the risk assessment,
   73.92\% (42,380/57,330) were female, and 59.38\% (34,042/57,330) were
   <30 years old. While the older demographic had significantly lower
   uptake than the younger demographic, with only 8.97\% of users aged >=
   51 years old downloading the app, the older demographic completed more
   challenges than their younger counterparts (F-8,F- 52,F-422=55.10,
   P<.001). In terms of engagement levels, 84.94\% (44,537/52,431) of users
   completed 1-14 challenges over a 30-day period, and 10.03\%
   (5,259/52,431) of users completed >22 challenges. On average, users in
   the incentives group completed slightly more challenges during the first
   30 days of the intervention (mean 7.9, SD 0.13) than those in the
   nonincentives group (mean 6.1, SD 0.06, t(28870)=-12.293, P<.001,
   d=0.12, 95\% CI -2.02 to -1.47). The regression analysis suggested that
   sex, age group, ethnicity, having 5 of the risk factors (all but
   alcohol), incentives, and the number of family histories were predictors
   of the number of challenges completed by a user (F-14,F-
   56,F-538=86.644, P<.001, adjusted R-2=.021).
   Conclusion: While the younger population downloaded the app the most,
   the older population demonstrated greater sustained engagement. Behavior
   change apps have the potential to reach a targeted population previously
   thought to be uninterested in or unable to use mobile apps. The
   development of such apps should assume that older adults will in fact
   engage if the behavior change elements are suitably designed, integrated
   into daily routines, and tailored. Incentives may be the stepping-stone
   that is needed to guide the general population toward preventative tools
   and promote sustained behavior change.}},

Abstract = {{The public health implications of growing numbers of older adults at
   risk for dementia places pressure on identifying dementia at its
   earliest stages so as to develop proactive management plans. The
   prodromal dementia phase commonly identified as mild cognitive
   impairment is an important target for this early detection of impending
   dementia amenable to treatment. In this paper, we propose a method for
   home-based automatic detection of mild cognitive impairment in older
   adults through continuous monitoring via unobtrusive sensing
   technologies. Our method is composed of two main stages: a training
   stage and a test stage. For training, room activity distributions are
   estimated for each subject using a time frame of. weeks, and then
   affinity propagation is employed to cluster the activity distributions
   and to extract exemplars to represent the different emerging clusters.
   For testing, room activity distributions belonging to a test subject
   with unknown cognitive status are compared to the extracted exemplars
   and get assigned the labels of the exemplars that result in the smallest
   normalized Kullbak-Leibler divergence. The labels of the activity
   distributions are then used to determine the cognitive status of the
   test subject. Using the sensor and clinical data pertaining to 85 homes
   with single occupants, we were able to automatically detect mild
   cognitive impairment in older adults with an F-0.5 score of 0.856. Also,
   we were able to detect the non-amnestic sub-type of mild cognitive
   impairment in older adults with an F-0.5 score of 0.958.}},

Title = {{Investigation of Commercial Vehicle Parking Permits in Toronto, Ontario,
   Canada}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2547}},
Pages = {{11-18}},
Abstract = {{As the City of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, implements stricter parking
   enforcement in the city's downtown core, commercial vehicles (CVs) have
   become targets of increased ticketing and towing, often without
   alternate legal means of parking and loading. This paper investigates
   the feasibility of a CV parking permit to provide lawful and affordable
   parking options yet maintain a source of revenue for the municipality.
   Parking permits around the world are reviewed on the basis of their cost
   and scope. An analysis of historical parking citations in Toronto
   indicates clear patterns of parking behavior for which a permit would be
   beneficial. A nested choice model is developed to reflect the decision
   process of drivers searching for parking and calculate the revenue
   impacts of permit pricing schemes. This decision structure reflects a
   trade-off between permit pricing, legal parking costs (such as the value
   of walking time from distant loading zones), and the expected value of
   citations for illegal parking. The trade-off between permit revenue and
   parking ticket revenue shows that optimal permit pricing, in the order
   of Can\$300 annually, can provide an improvement in municipal revenue
   and achieve widespread adoption (Can\$1 = US\$0.799 in March 2015). An
   improvement in social welfare is also achieved with permit adoption
   through the reduction of the cost of congestion, as permit holders are
   encouraged to park in legal zones away from congested arterials. The
   feasibility of a permit is contingent on the calibration of the price
   and rule structure in the fair appraisal of the value of parking in the
   downtown core and the needs of CV operators.}},

Title = {{Deriving Local Operating Distributions to Estimate Transit Bus Emissions
   Across an Urban Network}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2570}},
Pages = {{57-68}},
Abstract = {{In a 6-week data collection campaign, instantaneous bus speeds and
   ridership data were collected onboard 96 buses operating over 3,700 road
   links. Emissions were estimated by using the Motor Vehicle Emission
   Simulator 2014 version (MOVES2014). The effects of bus type and
   passenger load were explicitly accounted for in the emissions estimation
   process. The resulting emissions figures exhibit networkwide variations
   across different time periods, directions, land uses, passenger
   ridership figures, and transit service. Per passenger emissions data
   highlight the importance of considering onboard passenger weight in the
   estimation process. These results are relevant to transit planners who
   are evaluating plans to modify or introduce bus routes. This study also
   demonstrated a process in which local operating mode distributions were
   generated and specific drive cycles were developed for different average
   speeds and then were embedded into the MOVES2014 database. A validation
   test suggested that emissions figures derived using the locally
   developed operating mode distributions were better than and largely
   different from the emissions figures obtained using the MOVES default
   distributions. These embedded drive cycles could be useful when
   instantaneous speed information is unavailable, especially when
   developing a regional inventory for bus emissions in Montreal, Canada.}},

Title = {{Gold nanoparticle DNA damage in radiotherapy: A Monte Carlo study}},
Journal = {{AIMS BIOENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{352-361}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated the DNA damage due to the dose enhancement of
   using gold nanoparticles (GNPs) as a radiation sensitizer in
   radiotherapy. Nanodosimetry of a photon irradiated GNP was performed
   with Monte Carlo simulations using Geant4-DNA (ver. 10.2) in the
   nanometer scale. In the simulation model, GNP spheres (with diameters of
   30, 50, and 100 nm) and a DNA model were placed in a water cube (1 mu
   m(3)). The GNPs were irradiated by photon beams with varying energies
   (50, 100, and 150 keV), which produced secondary electrons, enhancing
   the dose to the DNA. To investigate the dose enhancement effect at the
   DNA level, energy deposition to the DNA with and without the GNP were
   determined in simulations for calculation of the dose enhancement ratio
   (DER). The distance between the GNP and the DNA molecule was varied to
   determine its effect on the DER. Monte Carlo results were collected for
   three variables; GNP size, distances between the GNP and DNA molecule,
   and the photon beam energy. The DER was found to increase with the size
   of GNP and decrease with the distance between the GNP and DNA molecule.
   The largest DER was found to be 3.7 when a GNP (100 nm diameter) was
   irradiated by a 150 keV photon beam set at 30 nm from the DNA molecule.
   We conclude that there is significant dependency of the DER on GNP size,
   distance to the DNA and photon energy and have simulated those
   relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Gap junctions are essential for the proper function of many native

   approaches to drug delivery and cellular communication. Microinjection
   is a robust, albeit difficult, technique, which provides considerable
   information that is superior to many of the simpler techniques due to
   its ability to isolate cells, quantify kinetics, and allow
   cross-comparison of multiple cell lines. Despite its user-dependent
   nature, the strengths of the technique are considerable and with the
   advent of new, automation technologies may improve further. This text
   describes the basic technique of microinjection and briefly discusses

Title = {{A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of On-Road Simulator and Cognitive
   Driving Assessment in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},

Pages = {{713-729}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI) are at an increased risk of driving
   impairment. There is a need for tools with sufficient validity to help
   clinicians assess driving ability.
   Objective: Provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of the primary
   driving assessment methods (on-road, cognitive, driving simulation
   assessments) in patients with MCI and AD.
   Methods: We investigated (1) the predictive utility of cognitive tests
   and domains, and (2) the areas and degree of driving impairment in
   patients with MCI and AD. Effect sizes were derived and analyzed in a
   random effects model.
   Results: Thirty-two articles (including 1,293 AD patients, 92 MCI
   patients, 2,040 healthy older controls) met inclusion criteria. Driving
   outcomes included: On-road test scores, pass/fail classifications,
   errors; caregiver reports; real world crash involvement; and driving
   simulator collisions/risky behavior. Executive function (ES {[}95\% CI];
   0.61 {[}0.41, 0.81]), attention (0.55 {[}0.33, 0.77]), visuospatial
   function (0.50 {[}0.34, 0.65]), and global cognition (0.61 {[}0.39,
   0.83]) emerged as significant predictors of driving performance. Trail
   Making Test Part B (TMT-B, 0.61 {[}0.28, 0.94]), TMT-A (0.65 {[}0.08,
   1.21]), and Maze test (0.88 {[}0.60, 1.15]) emerged as the best single
   predictors of driving performance. Patients with very mild AD (CDR =
   0.5) and mild AD (CDR = 1) were more likely to fail an on-road test than
   healthy control drivers (CDR = 0), with failure rates of 13.6\%, 33.3\%
   and 1.6\%, respectively.
   Conclusion: The driving ability of patients with MCI and AD appears to
   be related to degree of cognitive impairment. Across studies, there are
   inconsistent cognitive predictors and reported driving outcomes in MCI
   and AD patients. Future large-scale studies should investigate the
   driving performance and associated neural networks of subgroups of AD
   (very mild, mild, moderate) and MCI (amnestic, non-amnestic,
   single-domain, multiple-domain).}},

   results indicate that the addition of a cognitive load increases
   response times relative to the baseline condition by 0.26 to 0.33 s. The
   prosthetic liner produced a less pronounced increase in RT of 0.06 to
   0.11 s. Participants were able to correctly identify the stimulus

Abstract = {{Scientific evidence is quickly growing that establishes FGF21 as a
   cytokine that signals both locally and systemically to induce metabolic
   effects. The focus of this chapter is the receptor/co-receptor signaling
   complex formed by endocrine FGF21. We provide an introduction to the
   major components of the complex including the Klotho family of
   co-receptors, fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), and the
   fibroblast growth factor ligands, placing each in the context of its own
   family members while emphasizing structural features that drive
   interaction. We subsequently focus specifically on FGF21 signaling
   through FGFR1c and KLB, describing what is known about each protein's
   structure and how this drives protein interaction and formation of the
   signaling complex at the plasma membrane. We subsequently explore the
   stoichiometry of FGFR1c and KLB at the plasma membrane before and after
   the addition of FGF21 ligand, comparing how unique features of the
   interaction could potentially affect signaling intensity. Finally, we
   discuss how formation of the signaling complex is potentially regulated
   by other regulatory interactions, including galectins, the extracellular
   matrix, and co-expression of FGFR5.}},

   fashion requires a prohibitively high number of experiments. We present
   a simple hydrogel-based platform for the rapid, full-factorial mapping
   of light and nutrient availability on the growth and lipid accumulation
   of microalgae. We accomplish this without microfabrication using thin
   sheets of cell-laden hydrogels. By immobilizing the algae in a hydrogel
   matrix we are able to take full advantage of the continuous spatial
   chemical gradient produced by a diffusion-based gradient generator while
   eliminating the need for chambers. We map the effect of light
   intensities between 0 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 130 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)
   (similar to 28 W m(-2)) coupled with ammonium concentrations between 0
   mM and 7 mM on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Our data set, verified with
   bulk experiments, clarifies the role of ammonium availability on the
   photosynthetic productivity Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, demonstrating the
   dependence of ammonium inhibition on light intensity. Specifically, a
   sharp optimal growth peak emerges at approximately 2 mM only for light
   intensities between 80 and 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) - suggesting that
   ammonium inhibition is insignificant at lower light intensities. We
   speculate that this phenomenon is due to the regulation of the high
   affinity ammonium transport system in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as well
   as free ammonia toxicity. The complexity of this photosynthetic
   biological response highlights the importance of full-factorial data
   sets as enabled here.}},

Abstract = {{Tissues are challenging to genetically manipulate due to limited
   penetration of viral particles resulting in low transduction efficiency.
   We are particularly interested in expressing genetically-encoded sensors
   in ex vivo pancreatic islets to measure glucose-stimulated metabolism,
   however poor viral penetration biases these measurements to only a
   subset of cells at the periphery. To increase mass transfer of viral
   particles, we designed a microfluidic device that holds islets in
   parallel hydrodynamic traps connected by an expanding by-pass channel.
   We modeled viral particle flow into the tissue using
   fluorescently-labelled gold nanoparticles of varying sizes and showed a
   penetration threshold of only similar to 5 nm. To increase this
   threshold, we used EDTA to transiently reduce cell-cell adhesion and
   expand intercellular space. Ultimately, a combination of media flow and
   ETDA treatment significantly increased adenoviral transduction to the
   core of the islet. As proof-of-principle, we used this protocol to
   transduce an ER-targeted redox sensitive sensor (eroGFP), and revealed
   significantly greater ER redox capacity at core islet cells. Overall,
   these data demonstrate a robust method to enhance transduction
   efficiency of islets, and potentially other tissues, by using a
   combination of microfluidic flow and transient tissue expansion.}},

Abstract = {{Human intervention can be replaced through development of tools resulted
   from utilizing sensing devices possessing a wide range of applications
   including humanoid robots or remote and minimally invasive surgeries.
   Similar to the five human senses, sensors interface with their
   surroundings to stimulate a suitable response or action. The sense of
   touch which arises in human skin is among the most challenging senses to
   emulate due to its ultra high sensitivity. This has brought forth novel
   challenging issues to consider in the field of biomimetic robotics. In
   this work, using a multiphase reaction, a polypyrrole (PPy) based
   hydrogel is developed as a resistive type pressure sensor with an
   intrinsically elastic microstructure stemming from three dimensional
   hollow spheres. Furthermore, a semi-analytical constriction resistance
   model accounting for the real contact area between the PPy hydrogel
   sensors and the electrode along with the dependency of the contact
   resistance change on the applied load is developed. The model is then
   solved using a Monte Carlo technique and the sensitivity of the sensor
   is obtained. The experimental results showed the good tracking ability
   of the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{Shape memory materials (SMMs) are materials that can return to their
   virgin state and release mechanically induced strains by external
   stimuli. Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are a class of SMMs that show a
   high shape recoverability and which have attractive potential for
   structural applications. In this paper, we experimentally study the
   shape memory effect of origami based metamaterials. The main focus is on
   the Muira origami metamaterials. The fabrication technique used to
   produce origami structure is direct molding where all the geometrical
   features are molded from thermally virgin polymers without post folding
   of flat sheets. The study shows experimental investigations of shape
   memory metamaterials (SMMMs) made of SMPs that can be used in different
   applications such as medicine, robotics, and lightweight structures. The
   origami structure made from SMP blends, activated with uniform heating.
   The effect of blend composition on the shape memory behavior was
   studied. Also the influence of the thermomechanical and the viscoelastic
   properties of origami unit cell on the activation process have been
   discussed, and stress relaxation and shape recovery were investigated.
   Activation process of the unit cell has been demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectric materials are commonly known as electrical insulators that
   can be polarized under strong electrical field. Currently, emerging
   dielectric research interests are focusing on nanoparticles mixed
   polymer based composites, since such materials demonstrated an
   astonishing increase in dielectric performance when compared to neat
   polymer matrix, due to the exponential increase in the interfacial area
   between the nanoparticles and polymer. Such findings infer that particle
   dispersion plays a critical role for the overall dielectric performance.
   In this study, we present a continuous manufacturing process consists of
   extrusion and stretching for Poly(vinylidene fluoride)/silane-treated
   titanium dioxide (PVDF/silane-treated TiO2) flexible organic/inorganic
   polymer nanocomposites and the experimental result. Our results show
   that melt blending process is able to break down both silane treated and
   untreated micro-size TiO2 agglomerates with extremely well dispersion in
   PVDF matrix. Follow-up studies and characterizations indicated that the
   material performances such as dielectric constant and dielectric loss
   are either similar or surpass the sample prepared via solvent casting
   and the effects of silane treatment are also discussed. A number of

Abstract = {{The melting characteristics of aluminium ( Al) scrap were studied in a
   pilot-scale revolving liquid metal tank ( RLMT) which sits in a
   resistance furnace. Commercially pure Al of about 39 kg was melted in
   the RLMT. Experiments were carried out in a stagnant and in a revolving
   Al bath at different liquid metal temperatures and speeds. Cylindrical
   Al 6061 alloy samples were used in this experimental work. Their melting
   time inside the Al bath was recorded with a specially designed
   electrical circuit. Upon immersion of a cold cylindrical sample into
   liquid Al, a shell solidifies around the specimen and subsequently melts
   back. The time during which the shell exists around the cylinder is
   called shell period. The free melting period commences when the shell
   period ends. The thermal contact resistance ( TCR) at the Al
   shell/cylinder interface affects how long the shell lasts. A methodology
   was developed to estimate this TCR. The convective heat flux from the Al
   bath to the cylindrical specimen influences the shell and free melting
   periods, and is a function of liquid Al temperature and speed. The Part
   I of this research work presents a baseline of Al melting measurements
   under single phase flow conditions, that will be compared against two
   phase flow conditions in Part II of this research.}},

Title = {{Aluminium scrap melting under different liquid aluminium flow
   conditions: part-II: two phase flow}},

Abstract = {{This experimental research work deals with aluminium ( Al) alloy melting
   in an Al bath. In this liquid metal, nitrogen gas was introduced at
   specific locations and at different gas flow rates. The samples
   employed, along with their position in the liquid Al, and the procedure
   for melting detection, were identical with the ones utilised in Part I.
   The introduction of gas into liquid Al has different effects on the
   melting time of the immersed Al 6061 alloy cylinder. For the range of
   gas flow rates examined, the addition of gas into a stagnant Al bath (
   i.e. natural convection conditions) produces insignificant changes in
   melting time. However, when the liquid Al is moving ( i.e. forced
   convection conditions), the gas addition leads to a sizeable reduction
   in melting time. The melting time reduction ratio is introduced as a way
   to compare the melting under single and two phase flow liquid Al
   conditions. It is found that this ratio is affected by the nozzle
   position and also by the gas flow rate. The concept of an equivalent
   single phase velocity is also introduced, and defines the single phase
   velocity of liquid Al which results in the same melting time of the
   cylinder as under two phase flow conditions. It is found that the
   equivalent single phase velocity is influenced by both the gas flow rate
   and the nozzle position. The parameter which most likely contributes to
   the acceleration of the melting rate in two phase flow is the turbulence
   intensity, which is expected to increase due to the nitrogen gas
   injection.}},

Abstract = {{A novel robust method for estimating equivalent tunnelling Mohr-Coulomb
   strength parameters in elastic-plastic or elasto-brittle-plastic media
   satisfying Hoek-Brown failure criterion is proposed. Based on the best
   uniform approximation technique, this method consists of explicit and
   closed-form formulae in terms of elementary functions, making the
   estimation of equivalent parameters more convenient than other methods.
   A simple code is provided and a series of benchmark test cases are
   performed for validation. When the tunnel support is accurately known,
   the performance estimates of this method are better than estimates of
   best fitting in an artificial stress range and best fitting in the
   existing range methods, but not as accurate as the performance of
   equating model responses method and that proposed by Jimenez et al.
   However, when the estimation of support pressure is poor, this method is
   the most robust among all methods. In elasto-brittle-plastic rock mass,
   the advantage of robustness of this method is even more obvious.
   Considering both accuracy and robustness, this method can be employed as
   a preferable alternative.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, fatigue life assessment of a tensioner is studied through
   dynamic load analysis, stress analysis, and stress-life fatigue analysis
   approach. Tensioner is a critical part of an automotive front end
   accessory drive system, providing pre-tension to the belt. The front end
   accessory drive systems are responsible for transmitting power from the
   crankshaft to the accessory components. Due to the engine pulsation,
   components of the accessory drive including the tensioner are subjected
   to dynamic loads leading to fatigue failure. The fatigue life assessment
   of a mechanical component highly depends on loading, geometry, and
   material properties. In addition, the dynamic behavior of the front end
   accessory drive is complicated due to coupling between several modes of
   vibrations in belt, pulleys, and the tensioner arm. Duo to the
   complexity of the parameters involved and complicated dynamics, the
   fatigue life analysis of FEAD components is a challenging task. This
   paper includes three main parts, namely stress analysis, fatigue
   properties prediction, and life estimation. The dynamic analysis of a
   generic front end accessory drive system is performed in order to obtain
   effective loads on the tensioner. Stress state for the tensioner in case
   of different applied loading conditions is performed via a series of
   Finite Element (FE) analyses, and the critical region of the part is
   determined. Finally, fatigue life is estimated through strain-life
   approach. Modest work has been found in this area providing a
   comprehensive solution to the fatigue life investigation of power train
   components. The present study offers a comprehensive modeling approach
   which predicts the automative tensioner lifetime. The lifetime of any
   FEAD system components can be determined using the developed fatigue
   life prediction approach.}},

Abstract = {{Much existing work aims to understand how to change human behavior
   through product-design interventions. Given the diversity of individuals
   and their motivations, solutions that address different motives are
   surprisingly rare. We aim to develop and validate a framework that
   clearly identifies and targets different types of behavioral motives in
   users. We present a behavior model comprising egoistic, sociocultural
   and altruistic motives, and apply the model to sustainable behavior. We
   confirmed the explanatory power of the behavior model by categorizing
   user comments about an international environmental agreement from
   multiple news sources.
   We next developed concepts, each intended to target a single motive
   type, and elicited evaluations from online respondents who self-assessed
   their motivation type after evaluating the concepts. We present and
   discuss correlation results between motive types and preference for
   products that target these types for two iterations of the experiment.
   Deviations from our expected results are mainly due to unexpected
   perceptions, both positive and negative, of our concepts. Despite this,
   the main value of this work lies in the explicit consideration of a
   manageable number of different types of motives. A proposed design tool
   incorporates the three types of motives from the model with the
   different levels of persuasion others have proposed to change user
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Energy harvesting from vibrations has become, in recent years, a
   recurring target of a quantity of research to achieve self-powered
   operation of low-power electronic devices. However, most of energy
   harvesters developed to date, regardless of different transduction
   mechanisms and various structures, are designed to capture vibration
   energy from single predetermined direction. To overcome the problem of
   the unidirectional sensitivity, we proposed a novel multi-directional
   nonlinear energy harvester using piezoelectric materials. The harvester
   consists of a flexural center (one PZT plate sandwiched by two
   bow-shaped aluminum plates) and a pair of elastic rods. Base vibration
   is amplified and transferred to the flexural center by the elastic rods
   and then converted to electrical energy via the piezoelectric effect. A
   prototype was fabricated and experimentally compared with traditional
   cantilevered piezoelectric energy harvester. Following that, a nonlinear
   conditioning circuit (self-powered SSHI) was analyzed and adopted to
   improve the performance. Experimental results shows that the proposed
   energy harvester has the capability of generating power constantly when
   the excitation direction is changed in 360 degrees. It also exhibits a
   wide frequency bandwidth and a high power output which is further
   improved by the nonlinear circuit.}},

Abstract = {{Biocompatible hollow porous materials, due to their high void volume and
   shell porosity, are favorable platforms for efficient drug delivery. In
   this study, carboxylic group functionalized hollow mesoporous silica
   nanospheres (HMSNs-COOH) were successfully synthesized in a simple and
   one-pot co-condensation method using polystyrene nanospheres as a hard
   template, and carboxyethylsilanetriol as a source of carboxyl groups and
   reaction catalyzer. The synthesized HMSNs-COOH were studied by
   characterizing their morphology, nanostructure, specific surface area,
   particle size distribution and chemical composition using FESEM, HRTEM,
   SAXRD, N-2-sorption, DLS, FTIR and TGA techniques. The large specific
   surface area measured (973 m(2) g(-1)) for the prepared HMSNs-COOH was
   found to increase the loading capacity of cisplatin to similar to 48\%,
   as an anti-neoplastic agent. Furthermore, release tests performed at
   three different pH values of 7.4, 6.5 and 5.5 showed a sustained and pH
   dependent release of the drug from the prepared HMSNs-COOH. The
   cytotoxicity of the formulated drug was also examined in c26 colon
   carcinoma cell lines using the MTT assay. We demonstrate that the drug
   loaded HMSNs-COOH samples have a lower toxicity than the free drug, due
   to controlled and sustained drug release.}},

Abstract = {{Despite current knowledge of the myriad physiological effects of vagus
   nerve stimulation (VNS) in various mammalian species (including humans),
   the impact of varying stimulation parameters on nerve recruitment and
   physiological responses is not well understood. We investigated nerve
   recruitment, cardiovascular responses, and skeletal muscle responses to
   different temporal patterns of VNS across 39 combinations of stimulation
   amplitude, frequency, and number of pulses per burst. Anesthetized dogs
   were implanted with stimulating and recording cuff electrodes around the
   cervical vagus nerve, whereas laryngeal electromyogram (EMG) and heart
   rate were recorded. In seven of eight dogs, VNS-evoked bradycardia
   (defined as >= 10\% decrease in heart rate) was achieved by applying
   stimuli at amplitudes equal to or greater than the threshold for
   activating slow B-fibers. Temporally patterned VNS (minimum 5 pulses per
   burst) was sufficient to elicit bradycardia while reducing the
   concomitant activation of laryngeal muscles by more than 50\%. Temporal
   patterns of VNS can be used to modulate heart rate while minimizing
   laryngeal motor fiber activation, and this is a novel approach to reduce
   the side effects produced by VNS.}},

Abstract = {{Many remote communities rely on diesel generators as their primary power
   source, which is expensive and harmful to the environment. Renewable
   energy systems, based on photovoltaics and wind turbines, present a more
   sustainable and potentially cost-effective option for remote communities
   with abundant sun and wind. Designing and implementing community-owned
   and operated renewable power generation alternatives for critical
   infrastructure such as hospitals, water sanitation, and schools is one
   approach towards community autonomy and resiliency. However, configuring
   a cost-effective and reliable renewable power system is challenging due
   to the many design choices to be made, the large variations in the
   renewable power sources, and the location specific renewable power
   source availability. This paper presents an optimization-based approach
   to aid the configuration of a solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine
   generator and lead-acid battery storage hybrid power system. The
   approach, implemented in MATLAB, Uses a detailed time series system
   model to analyze system Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) and a lifetime
   system cost model to analyze system cost. These models are coupled to a
   genetic algorithm to perform a multi-objective optimization of system
   reliability and cost.
   The method was applied to two case studies to demonstrate the approach:
   a windy location (Gibraltar, UK), and a predominantly sunny location
   (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). Hourly solar and wind resource data was
   extracted for these locations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration for five-year data sets. The village load requirements
   were statistically generated from a mean daily load for the community
   estimated based on the population and basic electricity needs. The case
   studies demonstrate that the mix and size of technologies is dependent
   on local climatic conditions. In addition, the results show the tradeoff
   between system reliability and cost, allowing designers to make
   important decisions for the remote communities.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of wind farm design is to maximize energy production and
   minimize cost. In particular, optimizing the placement of turbines in a
   wind farm is crucial to minimize the wake effects that impact energy
   production. Most work on wind farm layout optimization has focused on
   flat terrains and spatially uniform wind regimes. In complex terrains,
   however, the lack of accurate analytical wake models makes it difficult
   to evaluate the performance of layouts quickly and accurately as needed
   for optimization purposes. This paper proposes an algorithm that couples
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with mixed-integer programming (MIP)
   to optimize layouts in complex terrains. High-fidelity CFD simulations
   of wake propagation are utilized in the proposed algorithm to constantly
   improve the accuracy of the predicted wake effects from upstream
   turbines in complex terrains. By exploiting the deterministic nature of
   MIP layout solutions, the number of expensive CFD simulations can be
   reduced significantly. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated on the
   layout design of a wind farm domain in Carleton-sur-Mer, Quebec, Canada.
   Results show that the algorithm is capable of producing good wind farm
   layouts in complex terrains while minimizing the number of
   computationally expensive wake simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, land has been exploited extensively for onshore wind farms and
   turbines are frequently located in proximity to human dwellings, natural
   habitats, and infrastructure. This proximity has made land use
   constraints and noise generation and propagation matters of increasing
   concern for all stakeholders. Hence, wind farm layout optimization
   approaches should be able to consider and address these concerns. In
   this study, we perform a constrained multi-objective wind farm layout
   optimization considering energy and noise as objective functions, and
   considering land use constraints arising from landowner participation,
   environmental setbacks and proximity to existing infrastructure. The
   optimization problem is solved with the NSGA-II algorithm, a
   multi-objective, continuous variable Genetic Algorithm. A novel hybrid
   constraint handling tool that uses penalty functions together with
   Constraint Programming algorithms is introduced. This constraint
   handling tool performs a combination of local and global searches to
   find feasible solutions. After verifying the performance of the proposed
   constraint handling approach with a suite of test functions, it is used
   together with NSGA-II to optimize a set of wind farm layout optimization
   test cases with different number of turbines and under different levels
   of land availability (constraint severity). The optimization results
   illustrate the potential of the new constraint handling approach to
   outperform existing constraint handling approaches, leading to better
   solutions with fewer evaluations of the objective functions and
   constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial infection causes Sepsis which is one of the leading cause of
   mortality in hospitals. This infection can be quantified from blood
   plasma using C - reactive protein (CRP). A quick diagnosis at the
   patient's location through Point-of-Care (POC) testing could give
   doctors the confidence to prescribe antibiotics. In this paper, the
   development and testing of a bead-based procedure for CRP quantification
   is described. The size of the beads enable them to be trapped in wells
   without the need for magnetic methods of immobilization. Large (1.5 mm
   diameter) Polyamide nylon beads were used as the substrate for capturing
   CRP from pure analyte samples. The beads captured CRP either directly
   through adsorption or indirectly by having specific capture antibodies
   on their surface. Both methods used fluorescent imaging techniques to
   quantify the protein. The amount of CRP needed to give a sufficient
   fluorescent signal through direct capture method was found suitable for
   identifying bacterial causes of infection. Similarly, viral infections
   could be quantified by the more sensitive indirect capture method. This
   bead-based assay can be potentially integrated as a disposable cartridge
   in a POC device due to its passive nature and the small quantities
   needed.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene is a promising material to design faster microprocessors given
   its exceptionally high thermal conductivity. However, due to its null

   alternatives to traditional semiconductors. Thus, the goal of this study
   is to determine the thermal conductivities and heat capacities of
   two-dimensional superlattices of graphene and boron nitride as a
   function of the secondary periodicity and interface orientation. We
   apply the Green-Kubo method to atomic trajectories calculated with
   Molecular Dynamics to determine the thermal conductivities of
   superlattices with periodicities between one and five in the armchair
   and zigzag orientations at 300 K. Results show that conductivities
   increase with decreasing periodicity, in good agreement with predictions
   made with Harmonic Lattice Dynamics. Thermal conductivities parallel to
   the interface are significantly higher than those perpendicular to the

Abstract = {{This study presents a multiscale framework to simulate the effect of
   nanovoids on the mechanical response of alpha-Al2O3 at finite
   temperatures. The bridging cell method, which divides the system into
   three domains (atomistic, bridging and continuum) and incorporates a
   finite element method throughout the system, was performed for the
   simulations. Two important crystal orientations of basal and prismatic
   planes of alpha-Al2O3's hexagonal crystal structure were selected. The
   simulations were conducted at room temperature, 300K, and fire
   temperature, 1400K, based on the variety of in-service temperatures
   alumina is being applied in. The results were compared with respect to
   deformation behavior, stress distribution and ultimate tensile strength.
   Results showed different failure mechanism and tensile strength for the
   two crystal orientations. In addition, the magnitude of stresses and
   material's deformation were increased at higher temperatures, where the
   ultimate tensile strength slightly reduced.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study is to examine the theoretical capability of
   bimaterial lattices as thermally driven actuators. The lattices are
   composed of planar non-identical cells. Each cell consists of a skewed
   hexagon surrounding an irregular triangle; the skew angles of the
   hexagon and the ratio of the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) of
   the two component materials determine the overall performance of the
   actuator. Such a cell has three tailorable CTEs along the lines
   connecting the points where adjoining cells are connected. Each
   individual cell and a lattice consisting of such cells can be strongly
   anisotropic in terms of thermal expansion. While these lattice cells
   have been used as stress-free connectors for components with differing
   CTEs, they have not been explored for their actuation capacity. This
   paper develops models for bimaterial lattices that can be used as
   mechanical actuators for valves, switches and differential motion. A
   general procedure for lattice design includes drawing of its skeleton,
   which identifies the points at which a lattice cell is connected to
   other cells or substrates; calculation of three CTEs in each cell
   depending upon the functionality desired; choosing lattice materials;
   and finding of the skew angles for each cell as solutions of three
   nonlinear algebraic equations. By changing materials and geometry, we
   can determine the change of their configuration when the temperature
   changes. This paper illustrates the concepts with several examples: a
   two-cell lattice that is connected to a substrate that functions as a
   lever in a switch; a three-cell lattice that serves as a valve; and a
   lattice that controls the maximum total deflection of two adjoining
   parts of a structure.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the maintenance and inventory policy for a k-out-of-n
   system where the components' failures are hidden and followa
   non-homogeneous Poisson process. Two types of inspections are performed
   to find failed components: planned periodic inspections and unplanned
   opportunistic inspections. The latter are performed at system failure
   timeswhen n-k+1 components are simultaneously down. In all cases, the
   failed components are either minimally repaired or replaced with spare
   parts from the inventory. The inventory is replenished either
   periodically or when the system fails. The periodic orders have a random
   lead-time, but there is no lead-time for emergency orders, as these are
   placed at system failure times. The key objective is to develop a method
   to solve the joint maintenance and inventory problem for systems with a
   large number of components, long planning horizon, and large inventory.
   We construct a simulation model to jointly optimize the periodic
   inspection interval, the periodic reorder interval, and periodic and
   emergency order-up-to levels. Due to the large search space, it is
   infeasible to try all possible combinations of decision variables in a
   reasonable amount of time. Thus, the simulation model is integrated with
   a heuristic search algorithm to obtain the optimal solution.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, air velocities in the channels of an operating polymer
   electrolyte membrane fuel cell are measured using electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy (EIS). From the equations of the oxygen transport
   in fuel cell channels, we derive an analytical expression of the channel
   impedance at low frequencies which is a function of the operating
   conditions, the channel geometry and air velocity only. Air velocities
   are computed using a nonlinear curve fitting of the analytical channel
   impedance to the single cell impedance measured at current densities
   ranging from 0.16 to 0.5 A/cm(2) under various air stoichiometries. Our
   results show less than 13\% of relative error between the theoretical
   air velocities given by the mass flow controller and those measured from
   the fuel cell impedance for current densities lower than 0.42 A/cm(2). A
   direct application of this work is the real-time diagnostic of fuel cell

Abstract = {{In this work, micro-computed tomography (mu CT) imaging is presented as
   a novel and robust tool for characterizing the surface roughness
   andmorphological properties of polymer electrolytemembrane (PEM) fuel
   cell gas diffusion layers (GDLs). Commercially available paper and felt
   GDLs with varying degrees of hydrophobic treatments and microporous
   layer (MPL) coatings were characterized. GDL surface height data was
   obtained from high resolution three-dimensional (3D) mu CT
   reconstructions (2.44 mu m-wide voxels), where large samples
   (approximately 4.5 mm x 4.5 mm) were used in order to capture the
   roughness features of the GDL, MPL crack depths, MPL crack widths, and
   MPL crack lengths. A sensitivity study reveals the significance of
   sample size and surface height thresholding on roughness parameters in
   this work. Therefore, the authors warn that caution must be exercised
   when selecting surface roughness measurements for modelling applications
   and that scanning size and resolution should correspond to the phenomena

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a preferred technique for
   noninvasively monitoring the fate of implanted cells, such as stem cells
   and immune cells in vivo. Cellular MRI requires contrast agents (CAs) to
   label the cells of interest. Despite promising progress made in this
   emerging field, highly sensitive, stable and biocompatible T-1 CAs with
   high cell permeability and specificity remains an unmet challenge. To
   address this need, a novel Mn-III-porphyrin, MnAMP was designed and
   synthesized based on the modification of Mn(III)tetra(carboxy-porphyrin)
   (MnTCP), a small and highly stable non-Gd extracellular CA with good
   biocompatibility and high T-1 relaxivity (r1 = 7.9 mM (1) s (1)) at
   clinical field of 3 Tesla (T). Cell permeability was achieved by masking
   the polar carboxylates of MnTCP with acetoxymethyl-ester (AM) groups,
   which are susceptible to hydrolysis by intracellular esterases. The
   enzymatic cleavage of AM groups led to disaggregation of the hydrophobic
   MnAMP, releasing activated MnTCP with significant increase in T1
   relaxivity. Cell uptake of MnAMP is highly efficient as tested on two
   non-phagocytic human cell lines with no side effects observed on cell
   viability. MRI of labeled cells exhibited significant contrast
   enhancement with a short T-1 of 161 ms at 3 T, even though a relatively
   low concentration of MnAMP and short incubation time was applied for
   cell labeling. Overall, MnAMP is among the most efficient T1 cell
   labeling agents developed for cellular MRI.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is
   an inflammatory disorder of the brain that has garnered significant
   interest within the medical and lay communities. There is a need for
   formal guidelines to assist physicians in identifying patients who
   should undergo testing for NMDAR encephalitis, recognizing the high
   potential for this potentially treatable disease to mimic more common
   disorders, and consequently remain undiagnosed.
   Areas covered: This review highlights the impact of the discovery of
   NMDAR encephalitis on the fields of neurology and psychiatry, and
   discusses the steps that are necessary to improve recognition and
   treatment of NMDAR encephalitis.
   Expert commentary: While much progress has been made in our
   understanding of NMDAR encephalitis, much work remains to be done to
   delineate the underlying disease mechanisms and their relevance to brain
   function.}},

   techniques for the Travelling Purchaser Problem, an important
   optimization problem with applications in vehicle routing, logistics,
   and warehouse management. Our master problem determines a set of markets
   and directed travel arcs that satisfy product purchase constraints with
   relaxed travel costs. Our subproblem identifies subtours within this
   master assignment and produces a set of generalized subtour elimination
   cuts. We show that the proposed technique demonstrates strong
   performance on the asymmetric problem variants, finding optimal
   solutions to previously unsolved instances, while performing
   competitively on a number of symmetric problem classes. Furthermore, our
   model is implemented unchanged for the four problem variants whereas
   other state-of-the-art approaches are variant-specific.}},

Title = {{The mixed alloyed chemical composition of chloro-(chloro)(n)-boron
   subnaphthalocyanines dictates their physical properties and performance
   in organic photovoltaic devices}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{9566-9577}},
Abstract = {{Chloro-boron subnaphthalocyanine (Cl-BsubNc) has recently attracted
   significant interest as a light-harvesting and charge transporting
   material in organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) by enabling an 8.4\%
   efficient planar heterojunction OPV cell. We present herein a variety of
   experimental data that supports the conclusion that Cl-BsubNc, whether
   synthesized via literature methods or our in-house methods or purchased
   commercially, is actually a mixed alloyed composition of Cl-BsubNcs with
   random amounts of chlorination at the bay position(s) of the BsubNc
   macrocyclic structure which we hereafter will refer to as
   Cl-Cl(n)BsubNc(s). We outline our efforts to develop alternative
   chemical processes, whereby we did obtain samples with lower and higher
   amounts of bay position chlorination. However, we were unable to obtain
   a pure, non-bay chlorinated sample of Cl-BsubNc. The positions and
   frequencies of the peripheral chlorine atoms were determined via single
   crystal X-ray crystallography of two different mixed alloyed
   compositions of Cl-Cl(n)BsubNc samples and MS and XPS analysis of all
   Cl-Cl(n)BsubNc samples. The photo-and electro-physical properties were
   found to differ amongst the Cl-Cl(n)BsubNc samples with varying amounts
   of chlorination. These differences also translated into varying
   performance within planar heterojunction OPVs, whereby a mixture of
   Cl-Cl(n)BsubNcs with lower amounts of chlorination produced less
   efficient OPVs (albeit with a higher open circuit voltage) compared to a
   mixture with higher amounts of chlorination. Additionally, an in-house
   made sample of Cl-Cl(n)BsubNc, with the highest level of bay position
   chlorination, yielded the best performing OPVs through an improved fill
   factor. A commercial sample of Cl-Cl(n)BsubNc also yielded OPVs with
   efficiencies equivalent to a Cl-Cl(n)BsubNc sample prepared in our
   laboratory. This mixture of Cl-Cl(n)BsubNcs is therefore likely to be
   present in the reported 8.4\% efficient OPV device. Our results
   therefore offer a cautionary note that the Cl-BsubNc samples used within
   the existing literature are likely not a pure chemical composition but
   are rather mixtures of Cl-Cl(n)BsubNcs with bay position chlorination.
   Our findings clarify the previous literature results on the chemistry of
   Cl-BsubNc, firm up the photo-and electro-physical properties of these
   materials, and offer additional insight into their application as
   functional materials in efficient OPVs.}},

Abstract = {{A polymer electrolyte comprised of H5BW12O40 (BWA) and cross-linked
   polyvinyl alcohol (BWA-XLPVA) has been developed and characterized for
   solid supercapacitors. The performance of this polymer electrolyte was
   compared to that of a known polymer electrolyte based on H4SiW12O40
   (SiWA). An enhanced proton conductivity was observed for BWA-XLPVA
   compared to its SiWA counterpart, especially under low humidity
   conditions (5\% RH). Dielectric analyses revealed an increase of proton
   density and proton mobility in the BWA-based electrolyte. A solid-state
   H-1 NMR study showed that all protons in the BWA-based electrolyte were
   hydrated in the low humidity environment. This indicated that BWA had
   more crystallized water content than SiWA, resulting in higher proton
   mobility in the PVA matrix. An in situ tracking of electrode potential
   in solid supercapacitors was utilized to identify the reactions and the
   factors limiting solid supercapacitor cell voltage for both BWA-and
   SiWA-based polymer electrolyte systems. A solid device leveraging the
   BWA-based polymer electrolyte achieved a cell voltage of 1.3 V, 0.2 V
   wider than that of a SiWA-based device.}},

   Unifying the reaction steps of CA19-9 for antigen direct detection, CEA
   for secondary antibody (rabbit-antiCEA) addition, AFP for secondary
   (rabbit antiAFP) and an enhancer (goat IgG) application, and
   comprehensively considering the dynamic ranges and detection
   sensitivities, we combined these three markers into multiplex analysis
   in serial format.The sensitivities and dynamic ranges for CA19-9, CEA
   and AFP were 10.0U/mL, 1.0 ng/mL, 1.0 ng/mL and 2.0-100.0 U/mL, 0.1-64.0
   ng/mL, 1.0-128.0 ng/mL, respectively. The intra-assay and inter-assay
   (coefficient variations) CVs of CA19-9, CEA and AFP were between
   1.6-8.9\% and 2.1-7.8\%. The specificities tested for both
   cross-reaction and heterogeneous proteins of CA19-9, CEA and AFP were
   not more than 6.7\%. Quantitative detection of 49 sera from gastric
   patients demonstrated that the accuracy for gastric cancer diagnosis was
   83.4\%. The total detection time is only 60min for an automated process.

Abstract = {{Collagen (I) impairs the targeting of nanoparticles to tumor cells by
   obstructing their diffusion inside dense tumor interstitial matrix. This
   potentially makes large nanoparticles (>50 nm) reside near the tumor
   vessels and thereby compromises their functionality. Here we propose a
   strategy to locally improve nanoparticle transport inside collagen (I)
   component of the tumor tissue. We first used heat generating gold
   nanorods to alter collagen (I) matrix by local temperature elevation. We
   then explored this impact on the transport of 50 nm and 120 nm inorganic
   nanoparticles inside collagen (I). We demonstrated an increase in
   average diffusivity of 50 nm and 120 nm in the denatured collagen (I) by
   similar to 14 and similar to 21 fold, respectively, compared to intact
   untreated collagen (I) matrix. This study shows how
   nanoparticle-mediated hyperthermia inside tumor tissue can improve the
   transport of large nanoparticles through collagen (I) matrix. The
   ability to increase nanoparticles diffusion inside tumor stroma allows
   their targeting or other functionalities to take effect, thereby
   significantly improving cancer therapeutic or diagnostic outcome.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores wavelength-modulated differential photoacoustic
   (WM-DPA) imaging for non-invasive early cancer detection via sensitive
   characterization of functional information such as hemoglobin
   oxygenation (sO(2)) levels. Well-known benchmarks of tumor formation
   such as angiogenesis and hypoxia can be addressed this way. While most
   conventional photoacoustic imaging has almost entirely employed
   high-power pulsed lasers, frequency-domain photoacoustic radar (FD-PAR)
   has seen significant development as an alternative technique. It employs
   a continuous wave laser source intensity-modulated and driven by
   frequency-swept waveforms. WM-DPA imaging utilizes chirp modulated laser
   beams at two distinct wavelengths for which absorption differences
   between oxy- and deoxygenated hemoglobin are minimum (isosbestic point,
   805 nm) and maximum (680 nm) to simultaneously generate two signals
   detected using a standard commercial array transducer as well as a
   single-element transducer that scans the sample. Signal processing is
   performed using Lab View and Matlab software developed in-house.
   Minute changes in total hemoglobin concentration (tHb) and oxygenation
   levels are detectable using this method since background absorption is
   suppressed due to the out-of-phase modulation of the laser sources while
   the difference between the two signals is amplified, thus allowing
   pre-malignant tumors to become identifiable. By regulating the signal
   amplitude ratio and phase shift the system can be tuned to applications
   like cancer screening, 502 quantification and hypoxia monitoring in
   stroke patients. Experimental results presented demonstrate WM-DPA
   imaging of sheep blood phantoms in comparison to single-wavelength
   FD-PAR imaging. Future work includes the functional PA imaging of small
   animals in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular related diseases are ranked as the second highest cause
   of death in Canada. Among the most important cardiovascular diseases is
   atherosclerosis. Current methods of diagnosis of atherosclerosis consist
   of angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence
   tomography (OCT). None of these methods possesses adequate sensitivity,
   as the ideal technique should be capable of both depth profiling, as
   well as functional imaging. An alternative technique is photoacoustics
   (PA) which can perform deep imaging and spectroscopy. The presented
   study explores the application of wavelength-modulated differential
   photoacoustic radar (WM-DPAR) for characterizing arterial vessels. The
   wavelength-modulated differential photoacoustic technique was shown to
   be able to substantially increase the dynamic range and sensitivity of
   hemoglobin oxygenation level detection. In this work the differential PA
   technique was used with a very high frequency modulation range. To
   perform spectroscopic PA imaging, at least two wavelengths are required.
   The selected wavelengths for this work are 1210 nm and 980 nm. 1210 nm
   corresponds to the maximum optical absorption coefficient of cholesterol
   and cholesteryl esters which are the main constituents of plaques. Since
   water, elastin and collagen also have high absorption coefficients at
   1210 nm, this wavelength alone cannot provide very high sensitivity and
   specificity. The additional wavelength, 980 nm corresponds to high
   absorption coefficient of those constituents of healthy artery tissue.
   The simultaneous application of the abovementioned wavelengths can
   provide higher sensitivity and improved specificity in detecting lipids
   in the arterial vessels.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we present some examples of waveform engineering
   applications in frequency-domain photoacoustics (FD-PA). Linear
   frequency modulation (LFM) has been employed in many different fields
   such as radar, sonar, ultrasound and photoacoustics to perform temporal
   encoding of the transmitted signal. Encoding the transmission and
   matched filtering in receive mode tends to increase the signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) while maintaining the resolution. One example of using LFM
   for photoacoustic spectroscopy is the capability of simultaneous
   probing/imaging with multiple wavelengths. Use of mismatched coded
   waveforms enables encoding the signal sources and, therefore,
   facilitates simultaneous probing and imaging. This method enables high
   frame rate functional imaging with reduced motion artifacts.
   Furthermore, it is shown that the phase of the cross-correlation of the
   PA signal modulated with a linear chirp can yield the absolute
   absorption coefficient of the chromophore. This method is not affected
   by attenuation of the fluence due to the absorption and scattering of
   the overlayer material. Therefore, the method provides a
   calibration-free approach for quantitative PA imaging. These are some of
   the features of PA using linear frequency modulation chirp.}},

Abstract = {{A closed cell rubber foam, based on a natural rubber (NR)/nanoclay
   nanocomposite, was produced using a one-step foaming process with
   compression molding. The effects of three different nanoclays on the
   properties of the NR/nanoclay nanocomposite foam were examined: an
   un-modified nanoclay (Cloisite Na+) and two organo-modified nanoclays
   (Cloisite 20A and Cloisite 30B). We examined their curing behavior, foam
   morphology, sound absorption, and their mechanical and thermal
   properties. The morphological results from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
   Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) showed that the Cloisite Na+
   agglomerated in the NR matrix while an
   intercalated-exfoliated/fully-exfoliated morphology was seen in the
   Cloisite 30B and the Cloisite 20A, respectively. The rheometry results
   showed that all three nanoclay types increased the NR's curing rate, and
   also accelerated its scorch and curing time. Other results showed that
   the organo-modified nanoclays, which were the ammonium-salt modified
   nanoclays (Cloisite 30B and Cloisite 20A), improved the foam's curing
   behavior more than the pristine Cloisite Na+. Using the one-step foaming
   process kept the nanocomposite foam density and expansion ratio constant
   in all of the samples, independent of the nanoclay type. Meanwhile, the
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that the nanoclay
   increased the cell density and decreased the cell size, depending on the
   nanoclay type. The mechanical properties of NR nanocomposite foams
   including the hardness and the modulus were improved by incorporating
   the nanoclays. At the same time, there was a gradual deterioration in
   the foams' sound absorption and thermal stability behavior.}},

Abstract = {{A porous silicon carbide (SiC) material was synthesized using a novel
   technique, which incorporates the natural porous structure of a fruit,
   in particular apple. Its characteristic morphological structure has been
   difficult to obtain using traditional methods. The novel porous SiC
   structure was characterized using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray
   diffraction, and vector network analyses. Microstructural analysis
   indicated that the microstructure of the porous SiC could be adjusted
   simply by varying the mass ratio of the Si:C precursors. When stacking
   faults were introduced into the porous SiC, the EM absorption was
   greatly enhanced. The lowest reflection loss value reduced from -30 dB
   to -60 dB. This enhancement was attributed to the introduction of
   stacking faults in the SiC which result in charge redistribution and
   generates significant dipole polarization within the porous SiC. This
   novel porous structure of SiC also facilitated the multi-reflection of
   EM waves within the absorber, which leads to enhanced absorption
   performance.}},

   reliability in two full-scope simulator experiments investigating
   dramatically different operational concepts. Practicality was assessed
   based on qualitative feedback of participants and researchers. The
   Process Overview Measure demonstrated sensitivity and validity by
   revealing significant effects of experimental manipulations that
   corroborated with other empirical results. The measure also demonstrated
   adequate inter-rater reliability and practicality for measuring SA in
   full-scope simulator settings based on data collected on process
   experts. Thus, full-scope simulator studies can employ the Process
   Overview Measure to reveal the impact of new control room technology and
   operational concepts on monitoring process plants.
   Practitioner Summary: The Process Overview Measure is a query-based
   measure that demonstrated practicality, sensitivity, validity and
   reliability for assessing operator situation awareness (SA) from
   monitoring process plants in representative settings.}},

Abstract = {{In order to develop low fluoride or fluoride free CaO-Al2O3 based mould
   flux for casting high aluminium steel, an investigation was carried out
   to study the effect of substituting CaF2 with B2O3 on heat transfer and
   crystallisation behaviour of CaO-Al2O3 based mould flux by employing a
   heat transfer simulator of mould flux and a single hot thermocouple
   technique. The results showed that addition of CaF2 promoted heat
   transfer of CaO-Al2O3 based mould flux, which was opposite to the effect
   of CaF2 on heat transfer in conventional CaO-SiO2 based mould flux.
   Addition of CaF2 inhibited crystallisation of CaO-Al2O3 based mould flux
   by lowering the start crystallisation temperature and prolonging the
   incubation time of crystallisation. B2O3 showed similar effects to CaF2
   on heat transfer and crystallisation of CaO-Al2O3 based mould flux, but
   its ability to promote heat transfer and suppress crystallisation was
   stronger than CaF2. Ca3B2O6 (melting temperature 1480 degrees C) was
   found as the primary crystalline phase in fluoride free CaO-Al2O3 based
   mould flux compared with the primary crystalline phase Ca2Al3O6F
   (melting temperature 1507 degrees C) in fluoride bearing (20\% CaF2)
   CaO-Al2O3 based mould flux.}},

   artificial cellular microenvironments that recapitulate the spatial,
   biochemical, and biophysical characteristics of the native extracellular
   matrices and enable systematic, quantitative, and high-throughput
   studies of cell fate in their respective environments. We developed a
   microfluidic platform for the generation of two-dimensional arrays of
   micrometer-size cell-laden hydrogel modules (HMs) for cell encapsulation
   and culture. Fibroblast cells (NIH 3T3) and non-adherent T cells (EL4)
   encapsulated in HMs showed high viability and proliferation. The
   platform was used for real-time studies of the effect of spatial
   constraints and structural and mechanical properties of HMs on cell
   growth, both on the level of individual cells. Due to the large number
   of cellladen HMs and stochastic cell distribution, cell studies were
   conducted in a time-and labor efficient manner. The platform has a broad
   range of applications in the exploration of the role of chemical and
   biophysical cues on individual cells, studies of in vitro cell

Title = {{The Omitted Dimension: Exploiting Multiuser Diversity in Multi-Radio
   Access Technology Data Cellular Communication Systems}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{2068-2082}},
Abstract = {{Performance of cellular communication systems is typically enhanced by
   leveraging the three dimensions of system transmission bandwidth, area
   frequency reuse, i.e. system access point (AP) density, and spectral
   efficiency of employed radio air interface, referred to as the radio
   access technology (RAT). In particular, refined RATs are continuously
   introduced to compensate for limited spectrum availability and
   restrictions on system AP densification in cellular communication
   systems. While the performance of cellular communication systems is
   maximized by employing a single RAT providing maximal spectral
   efficiency, varying capabilities of user equipment compels the
   co-deployment of multiple RATs in cellular communication systems and
   entails fragmenting system radiofrequency resources between co-deployed
   RATs. Nevertheless, the inefficient structuring of multi-RAT systems as
   independently operated collocated single-RAT subsystems results in
   unbalanced system loading, suboptimal spectrum utilization, and the
   omission of multiuser diversity as a performance enhancement dimension
   in multi-RAT systems. The omitted dimension of multiuser diversity is
   exploited in this paper, through multiple means and techniques, to
   further enhance the performance of multi-RAT data cellular communication
   systems. Unifying the architectural structure of multi-RAT systems is
   proposed to eliminate the redundant duplication of radio access network
   functions and elements, reduce system deployment costs and operational
   complexity, improve system scalability, and enable the joint execution
   of non-radio transmission functions for all co-deployed RATs. By fully
   exploiting system multiuser diversity, the joint allocation of system
   radiofrequency resources under autonomous spectrum assignment is shown
   to substantially enhance the performance of all employed RATs, in
   addition to the overall performance of multi-RAT systems, without
   extending any of the three typical performance enhancement dimensions of
   cellular communication systems.}},

   high-temperature H2O vapor directly in the presence of room-temperature
   ambient H2O vapor.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical study of ignition and combustion in a glow plug (GP)
   assisted direct-injection natural gas (DING) engine is presented in this
   paper. The glow plug is shielded and the shield design is an important
   part of the combustion system development. The results simulated by
   KIVA-3V indicated that the ignition delay (ID) predicted by an
   in-cylinder pressure rise was different from that based on a temperature
   rise, attributed to the additional time required to burn more fuel to
   obtain a detectable pressure rise in the combustion chamber. This time
   difference for the ignition delay estimation can be 0.5 ms, which is
   significant relative to an ignition delay value of less than 2 ms. To
   further evaluate the time difference between the two different methods
   of ignition delay determination, sensitivity studies were conducted by
   changing the glow plug temperature, and rotating the glow plug shield
   opening angle towards the fuel jets. The results indicated that the ID
   method time difference varied from 0.3 to 0.8 ms for different
   combustion chamber configurations. In addition, this study also
   investigated the influences of different glow plug shield parameters on
   the natural gas ignition and combustion characteristics, by modifying
   the air gap between the glow plug and its shield, and by changing the
   shield opening size. The computational results indicated that a bigger
   air gap inside the shield can delay gas ignition, and a smaller shield
   opening can block the flame propagation for some specific fuel injection
   angles.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, expanded polylactide (EPLA) bead foams were produced with
   cellular morphology ranging from nanocellular to microcellular. This was
   achieved by using bead foaming technology while a double crystal melting
   peak structure was generated. The high melting peak crystals generated
   during the gas saturation played an important role on controlling the
   cell size and expansion ratio of the foamed beads. As the amount of high
   melting peak crystals increased, the cell sizes were reduced to around
   350 nm while the expansion ratio was around 3-fold. In other words, the
   induced perfected crystals significantly promoted the heterogeneous cell
   nucleation while hindering the cell growth. On the other hand, with the
   reduced amount of these perfected crystals, the cell sizes were
   increased to around 15 mu m and the expansion ratio of the foamed beads
   increased to 30-fold.}},

Abstract = {{In order to improve separation performance of pervaporation membranes,
   we explored, for the first time, using tree bark biochar (BB) as filler
   for preparing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite membranes to
   separate ethanol from water. The composite membranes prepared by adding
   BB fillers obtained from different temperatures had different
   pervaporation performances. It was found that the addition of the three
   types of modified BB particles could all significantly improve
   pervaporation performance of the composite membranes. However their
   effects on permeation flux and separation factor were varied. Compared
   to BB obtained at 300 degrees C and 900 degrees C, BB obtained at 600
   degrees C resulted in the membrane with the highest pervaporation
   performance with a separation factor of 9.92 and a permeation flux of
   219.20 g m(-2) h(-1) at 40 degrees C in 10\% ethanol solution. This
   study demonstrates the promise of biochar as a novel type of

   brown carbon (BrC) that absorbs near-ultraviolet and visible light,
   resulting in significant impacts on regional visibility degradation and
   radiative forcing. The mixing state of BBOA can play a critical role in
   the prediction of aerosol optical properties. In this work,
   single-particle measurements from a Soot-Particle Aerosol Mass
   Spectrometer coupled with a light scattering module (LS-SP-AMS) were
   performed to examine the mixing state of BBOA, refractory black carbon
   (rBC), and potassium (K, a tracer for biomass burning aerosol) in an air
   mass influenced by wildfire emissions transported from northern Qu,bec
   to Toronto, representing aged biomass burning plumes. Cluster analysis
   of single-particle measurements identified five BBOA-related particle
   types. rBC accounted for 3-14aEuro-wtaEuro-\% of these particle types on
   average. Only one particle type exhibited a strong ion signal for K+,
   with mass spectra characterized by low molecular weight organic species.
   The remaining four particle types were classified based on the apparent
   molecular weight of the BBOA constituents. Two particle types were
   associated with low potassium content and significant amounts of high
   molecular weight (HMW) organic compounds. Our observations indicate
   non-uniform mixing of particles within a biomass burning plume in terms
   of molecular weight and illustrate that HMW BBOA can be a key
   contributor to low-volatility BrC observed in BBOA particles. The
   average mass absorption efficiency of low-volatility BBOA is about
   0.8-1.1aEuro-m(2)aEuro-g(-1) based on a theoretical closure calculation.
   Our estimates indicate that low-volatility BBOA contributes similar to
   33-44aEuro-\% of thermo-processed particle absorption at 405aEuro-nm;
   and almost all of the BBOA absorption was associated with low-volatility
   organics.}},

   behavior in a centrifugal pump}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{171-183}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the cavitation
   dynamics in the blade channel of a centrifugal pump with a particular
   focus on the direct influence of the pump's volute.
   Design/methodology/approach - A homogeneous multiphase model, namely the
   Zwart-Gerber-Belamri cavitation model, is employed to numerically
   describe the evolution of the process of cavitation within the pump. The
   RNG k-e turbulence model is applied to analyze the unsteady turbulent
   flow. A second order implicit formulation is used for the time
   discretization for the unsteady flow calculation and a finite volume
   algorithm is used for the space discretization.
   Findings - The cavities in the passage exhibit an obvious life cycle
   which includes initiation, growth, contraction, and separation, and
   collapse with a frequency corresponding to the impeller rotation
   frequency under off-design conditions. This phenomenon arises through an
   alternating interaction between reverse flow with the cavity interface
   and is associated with the response of the vortex region to the effect
   of uneven pressure distribution on volute and impeller-tongue
   interaction.
   Originality/value - This study simulated and analyzed the complex
   transient cavitation flow patterns inside a centrifugal pump and
   explains the reason for the unsteadiness. This knowledge is instructive
   in achieving the stable operation of pumps and in trouble shooting rough
   or cavitating operation.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{324-336}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a psychometrically
   validated survey to assess satisfaction in complex continuing care
   (CCC)/rehabilitation patients.
   Design/methodology/approach - A paper or computer-based survey was
   administered to 252 CCC/rehabilitation patients (i.e. post-acute
   hospital care setting for people who require ongoing care before
   returning home) across two hospitals in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
   Findings - Using factor analysis, five domains were identified with
   loadings above 0.4 for all but one item. Behavioral intention and
   information/communication showed the lowest patient satisfaction, while
   patient centredness the highest. Each domain correlated positively and
   significantly predicted overall satisfaction, with quality and safety
   showing the strongest predictive power and the healing environment the
   weakest. Gender made a significant contribution to predicting overall
   satisfaction, but age did not.
   Research limitations/implications - Results provide evidence of the
   survey's psychometric properties. Owing to a small sample, supplemental
   testing with a larger patient group is required to confirm the
   five-factor structure and to assess test-retest reliability.
   Originality/value - Improving the health system requires integrating
   patient perspectives. The patient experience, however, will vary
   depending on the population being served. This is the first
   psychometrically validated survey specific to a smaller specialty
   patient group receiving care at a CCC/rehabilitation facility in Canada.}},

Title = {{A Serious Game for Clinical Assessment of Cognitive Status: Validation
   Study}},
Journal = {{JMIR SERIOUS GAMES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{E7+}},
Month = {{JAN-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: We propose the use of serious games to screen for abnormal
   cognitive status in situations where it may be too costly or impractical
   to use standard cognitive assessments (eg, emergency departments). If
   validated, serious games in health care could enable broader
   availability of efficient and engaging cognitive screening.
   Objective: The objective of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility
   of a game-based cognitive assessment delivered on tablet technology to a
   clinical sample and to conduct preliminary validation against standard
   mental status tools commonly used in elderly populations.
   Methods: We carried out a feasibility study in a hospital emergency
   department to evaluate the use of a serious game by elderly adults
   (N=146; age: mean 80.59, SD 6.00, range 70-94 years). We correlated game
   performance against a number of standard assessments, including the
   Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment
   (MoCA), and the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM).
   Results: After a series of modifications, the game could be used by a
   wide range of elderly patients in the emergency department demonstrating
   its feasibility for use with these users. Of 146 patients, 141 (96.6\%)
   consented to participate and played our serious game. Refusals to play
   the game were typically due to concerns of family members rather than
   unwillingness of the patient to play the game. Performance on the
   serious game correlated significantly with the MoCA (r=-.339, P<.001)
   and MMSE (r=-.558, P<.001), and correlated (point-biserial correlation)
   with the CAM (r=.565, P<.001) and with other cognitive assessments.
   Conclusions: This research demonstrates the feasibility of using serious
   games in a clinical setting. Further research is required to demonstrate
   the validity and reliability of game-based assessments for clinical
   decision making.}},

Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{An innovative method was devised to improve copper recovery and
   operational efficiency of the Cu converter slag-cleaning furnace, by
   utilising both carbon and fluoride values of an otherwise environmental
   hazardous material (i.e. spent potlining (SPL)) produced from the
   aluminium industry. Results based on numerical modelling show that 90\%
   Cu recovery could be achieved by adding as little as 3-4 wt-\% of SPL to
   the molten converter slag. The fluorides and sodium-containing compounds
   in the SPL reduced the slag viscosity, resulting in a much faster
   settling rate of matte droplets. In this process, the SPL could be
   detoxified by destroying the cyanides to form harmless N-2 gas, and
   inertising the fluorides in a much diluted form in the ferro-silicate
   slag, ensuring a safe disposal to the environment.}},

Pages = {{968-981}},
Abstract = {{Poor sanitation results in increased spread of diseases and
   environmental pollution. In many parts of the globe, treatment of feces
   needs an urgent solution that ensures elimination of pathogens using
   minimal resources. Self-sustaining smoldering combustion of feces mixed
   with sand has been has been recently studied as a potential technology.
   A combination of different experimental parameters is essential to
   ensure robust operation, where oxidation coexists with pyrolysis and
   water evaporation. This work presents the results of a series of
   thirty-two experiments conducted in order to study the sensitivity of
   the process to the following experimental parameters: moisture content,
   sand-to-feces ratio, airflow, sand grain size and ignition temperature.
   It was found that smoldering temperature and velocity are independent on
   the moisture content and ignition temperature; while are strongly
   dependent on other parameters, specially the airflow. The information
   presented is crucial to control the process, allowing its implementation

Abstract = {{In this paper, an efficient control is proposed and implemented to
   minimize the power fluctuation of grid connected photovoltaic (PV) with
   supercapacitor energy storage system (SCESS). The SCESS is used to
   minimize the power fluctuation caused by changes in temperature and
   irradiation. The optimal size of the SCESS and its control strategy are
   developed for continuously charging and discharging SCESS to achieve its
   objectives. Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Inference System is developed in real
   time using dSPACE to generate the maximum power from the PV system. The
   SCESS is integrated with the system through a bi-directional buck boost
   converter. The system model and the control strategy have been developed
   in Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) that consists of PV array, buck
   converter, buck-boost converter, and voltage source converter (VSC). To
   transfer the available DC power to the grid, an independent P-Q control
   is proposed and implemented for the VSC. The proposed controller is
   examined through hardware in the loop setup using RTDS and dSPACE 1104
   controller. Furthermore, the superiority of the proposed approach has
   been confirmed by comparing the results with those reported in the
   literature. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   preferential orientation of fibers. Consequently, the percolation
   threshold decreased up to four folds from 0.85 to 0.21 vol.\% as the
   void fraction increased from 0 to 35\%. The specific EMI SE was also
   significantly enhanced. A maximum specific EMI SE of 75 dB.g(-1)cm(3)
   was achieved in PP-1.1 vol.\% SSF composite foams, which was highly
   superior to 38 dB.g(-1)cm(3) of the solid PP-1.0 vol.\% SSF composites.
   The results reveal that light and efficient products with a lower fiber
   content can be developed by foam for EMI shielding applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the role of human factors, in particular driving
   behaviour, in managing fleet fuel consumption. The results presented are
   from the Driving Simulator Eco-Drive Training (DSET) project, a
   collaborative project with a municipal fleet in Ontario, Canada, to test
   the effectiveness of simulator-based training in eco-driving techniques.
   Likert-scale questionnaires assessed the drivers' self-reported
   motivation toward the training programme. In the six weeks following
   their simulator training session, we found that the average rate of hard
   acceleration (>= 1.5 m/s(2)) among all acceleration events decreased
   from 13.3 to 11.4 \% and the average rate of hard deceleration (<=-1.5
   m/s(2)) decreased from 10.5 to 9.8 \%. Based on these reductions in
   average acceleration and deceleration, approximately 18 \% savings in
   fuel consumption is possible.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING}},

Abstract = {{Biomedical phantoms are commonly used for various medical imaging
   modalities to improve imaging quality and procedures. Current biomedical
   phantoms fabricated commercially are high in cost and limited in the
   specificity of human environments and structures that can be mimicked.
   This study aimed to control the measurable computed tomography (CT)
   number in Hounsfield units through polymeric biomedical phantom
   materials using controlled amounts of hydroxyapatite (hA). The purpose
   was to fabricate CT phantoms capable of mimicking various coronary
   plaque types while introducing a fabrication technique and basis for a
   numerical model to which the technique may be applied. The CT number is
   tunable based on the controlled material properties of electron density
   and atomic numbers. Three different polymeric matrices of polyethylene
   (PE), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), and polyvinylidene fluoride
   (PVDF) were selected due to their varied specific densities and ease of
   fabrication acting as integral properties for CT phantom fabrication.
   These polymers were processed together with additions of hA in mass
   percentages of 2.5, 5, 10, and 20\% hA as well as a 0\% hA as a control
   for each polymeric material. By adding hA to PE, TPU, and PVDF an
   increasing trend was exhibited between CT number and weight percent of
   hA. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)}},

Abstract = {{Human intervention can be replaced through the development of tools
   resulting from utilization of sensing devices possessing a wide range of
   applications including humanoid robots or remote and minimally invasive
   surgeries. Similar to the five human senses, sensors interface with
   their surroundings to stimulate a suitable response or action. The sense
   of touch which arises in human skin is among the most challenging senses
   to emulate due to its ultra high sensitivity. This has brought forth
   novel challenging issues to consider in the field of biomimetic
   robotics. In this work, using a multiphase reaction, a polypyrrole (PPy)
   based hydrogel is developed as a resistive type pressure sensor with an
   intrinsically elastic microstructure stemming from three dimensional
   hollow spheres. It is shown that the electrical conductivity of the
   fabricated PPy based piezoresistive sensors is enhanced as a result of
   adding conductive fillers and therefore, endowing the sensors with a
   higher sensitivity. A semi-analytical constriction resistance based
   model accounting for the real contact area between the PPy hydrogel
   sensors and the electrode along with the dependency of the contact
   resistance change on the applied load is developed. The model is then
   solved using a Monte Carlo technique and its corresponding sensitivity
   is obtained. Comparing the results with their experimental counterparts,
   the proposed modeling methodology offers a good tracking ability.}},

Pages = {{1130-1143}},
Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are fast-improving materials for
   next-generation solution-processed optoelectronic devices such as solar
   cells, photocatalysis, light emitting diodes, and photodetectors.
   Nanoscale CQDs exhibit a high surface to volume ratio, and a significant
   fraction of atoms making up the quantum dots are thus located on the
   surface. CQD surface states therefore play a critical role in
   determining these materials' properties, influencing luminescence,
   defect energy levels, and doping type and density. In the past five
   years, halide ligands were applied to CQD solar cells, and these not
   only improved charge carrier mobility, but also reduced defects on the
   surface. With the inclusion of halide ligands, CQD solar cell certified
   power conversion efficiencies have increased rapidly from an initial 5\%
   in 2010 to the latest certified values over 10\%. In this perspective
   article, we summarize recent advances in ligand engineering that improve
   the performance of CQD solar cells, focusing on the use of halide
   inorganic ligands to improve CQD surface passivation and film
   conductivity simultaneously.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{1293-1296}},
Abstract = {{We hereby report a solution to the problem of reflections from passive
   lossless refracting metasurfaces that works even at wide deflection
   angles. The phenomenon of reflections is due to not accounting for the
   local wave-impedance mismatch at the source and load faces of the
   metasurface; this cannot be fully mitigated even with an
   impedance-equalized Huygens' (IEH) metasurface. The solution is
   demonstrated to be enabled through the correct application of
   generalized, instead of canonical, scattering parameters. The canonical
   and IEH approaches are compared to the generalized scattering parameter
   approach. It is seen that though the approaches are similar at
   low-to-moderate levels of refraction, at wide-angle refraction only the
   generalized S-matrix approach is capable of good matching. This is
   demonstrated via full-wave simulations, for refraction from normal
   incidence, using an asymmetric structure comprising three cascaded
   admittance surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this research was to better understand chemical pre-treatment
   of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) for subsequent ultraviolet (UV)
   disinfection. Approximately 200 jar tests were completed. Alum
   (Al-2(SO4)(3)center dot 12H(2)O) resulted in a higher UV light
   transmission (UVT), and equivalent total suspended solids (TSS) removal,
   than ferric chloride (FeCl3). An alum dose of 20 mg/L increased the UVT
   of the raw CSO from 30 to 60\% after settling. The addition of 100 mg/L
   of alum maximized UVT reaching approximately 85\%. Flocculation did not
   increase UVT. However, it did improve the removal of TSS. Cationic
   polymers worked quickly compared with metal coagulants, but only reached
   a UVT of 60\%. A high positive charge density on the polymer improved
   the removal of turbidity when compared with low charge, but did not
   affect UVT. If the goal is to maximise UVT, a very high alum dose may be
   preferred. If the goal is to minimize coagulant dose with moderate UV
   performance, cationic polymer at approximately 3 mg/L is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{The climatic impacts of black carbon (BC) aerosol, an important absorber
   of solar radiation in the atmosphere, remain poorly constrained and are
   intimately related to its particle-scale physical and chemical
   properties. Using particle-resolved modelling informed by quantitative
   measurements from a soot-particle aerosol mass spectrometer, we confirm
   that the mixing state (the distribution of co-emitted aerosol amongst
   fresh BC-containing particles) at the time of emission significantly
   affects BC-aerosol optical properties even after a day of atmospheric
   processing. Both single particle and ensemble aerosol mass spectrometry
   observations indicate that BC near the point of emission co-exists with
   hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA) in two distinct particle types:
   HOA-rich and BC-rich particles. The average mass fraction of black
   carbon in HOA-rich and BC-rich particle classes was < 0.1 and 0.8,
   respectively. Notably, approximately 90aEuro-\% of BC mass resides in
   BC-rich particles. This new measurement capability provides quantitative

Abstract = {{Granular activated carbon (GAC) can be used to quench residual hydrogen
   peroxide (H2O2) after ultraviolet (UV)-H2O2 advanced oxidation processes
   in drinking water treatment. Bench-and pilot-scale studies examined the
   possible loss of GAC reactivity due to continuous exposure to natural
   water from a water treatment plant in both the presence and absence of
   H2O2. Six common types of GAC were evaluated. The bench-and pilot-scale
   tests consistently showed that all GACs lost a significant degree of
   reactivity with H2O2 during the first 25,000 bed volumes of water
   treated, but then further deterioration to beyond 100,000 bed volumes
   was minimal. The loss of reactivity was due mostly to exposure to the
   natural water, with continuous exposure to H2O2 having little impact,
   suggesting that the reaction with H2O2 may be catalytic whereas the GAC
   becomes fouled by natural organic matter or other constituents in the
   natural water. The six GACs exhibited different reaction rates with
   H2O2, suggesting that GAC type might be an important consideration for
   process design.}},

Title = {{Apathy and Attentional Biases in Alzheimer's Disease}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{837-846}},
Abstract = {{Background: Apathy, one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric symptoms
   in Alzheimer's disease (AD), can be difficult to assess as cognition
   deteriorates. There is a need for more objective assessments that do not
   rely on patient insight, communicative capacities, or caregiver
   observation.
   Objective: We measured visual scanning behavior, using an eye-tracker,
   to explore attentional bias in the presence of competing stimuli to
   assess apathy in AD patients.
   Methods: Mild-to-moderate AD patients (Standardized Mini-Mental Status
   Examination, sMMSE > 10) were assessed for apathy (Neuropsychiatric
   Inventory {[}NPI] apathy, Apathy Evaluation Scale {[}AES]). Participants
   were presented with 16 slides, each containing 4 images of different
   emotional themes (2 neutral, 1 social, 1 dysphoric). The duration of
   time spent, and fixation frequency on images were measured.
   Results: Of the 36 AD patients (14 females, age = 78.2 +/- 7.8, sMMSE=
   22.4 +/- 3.5) included, 17 had significant apathy (based on NPI apathy =
   4) and 19 did not. These groups had comparable age and sMMSE.
   Repeated-measures analysis of covariance models, controlling for total
   NPI, showed group (apathetic versus non-apathetic) by image (social
   versus dysphoric) interactions for duration (F-1,F-32 = 4.31, p = 0.046)
   and fixation frequency (F-1,F-32 = 11.34, p = 0.002). Apathetic patients
   demonstrated reduced duration and fixation frequency on social images
   compared with non-apathetic patients. Additionally, linear regression
   models suggest that more severe apathy predicted decreasing fixation
   frequency on social images (R-2 = 0.26, Adjusted R-2 = 0.19, F-3,F-32 =
   3.65, p = 0.023).
   Conclusion: These results suggest that diminished attentional bias
   toward social-themed stimuli is a marker of apathy in AD. Measurements
   of visual scanning behavior may have the potential to predict and
   monitor treatment response in apathy.}},

Journal = {{POLYMERS \& POLYMER COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{255-263}},
Abstract = {{The friction coefficients of unidirectional carbon fibre/epoxy
   composites (with the fibres parallel and antiparallel to the sliding
   direction) were measured under severe abrasive conditions. Aluminium
   oxide sandpapers with three different grits (36, 80, and 120) were used
   as the counter surfaces. Three different applied loads (5, 10, 22N) and
   two different sliding speeds (2 m/s, 4 m/s) were selected as the testing
   parameters. Under these conditions, composites with fibres parallel to
   the sliding direction had a significantly lower friction coefficient.
   Using the measured friction coefficients of unidirectional composites, a
   modified rule of mixtures equation was developed to predict the friction
   coefficients of woven carbon fibre/epoxy composites under the
   conditions. The model is based on the hypothesis that the more wear
   resistant regions of the weave (fibres that are parallel to the sliding
   direction in this case) would protect the less wear resistant regions
   (fibres that are antiparallel to the sliding direction), and that the
   load is redistributed to yield equal wear rates for the two zones. It
   was found that the model was able to accurately predict the friction
   coefficients of the woven composites for the abrasive conditions tested
   in this study.}},

   axial-transverse and axial-torsion loadings paths. The numerical results
   demonstrate the strong influence of multiaxial loadings on
   microstructures and thermomechanical response. The variation of
   thermo-mechanical response stems from the nucleation of energetically

Abstract = {{The overall aim of this paper was to establish sulfate resistance of
   cement mortars and pastes incorporating limestone exposed to severe
   sulfate attack at 20 and 4 degrees C. Specimens with 0, 10, 20, and 30
   \% replacement levels of cement by limestone were continually exposed to
   a sodium sulfate solution with 33,800 ppm of SO42- concentration for 44
   weeks. Sulfate exposure tests included compressive and flexural
   strengths, expansion, and mass loss measurements of mortar specimens.
   Additionally, in order to identify products formed by sulfate attack,
   microstructural observations such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed on the paste samples.
   Experimental results indicated that the mortar specimens incorporating
   limestone were much more susceptible to sodium sulfate attack compared
   to those without limestone, especially when exposed to a 4 degrees C
   sulfate solution. It was found that the main deterioration product of
   the damaged samples with higher limestone contents was identified as
   thaumasite, not ettringite or gypsum, by means of XRD and SEM analysis.
   Furthermore, data on mechanical characteristics confirmed that the
   sulfate deterioration of mortar specimens was greatly dependent on the
   replacement levels of limestone.}},

   different methods for setting the global thresholds were tested: one
   based on arithmetic means, and another based on modal location
   parameters derived from type I extreme value distributions. The
   frequency of false-negative errors (failure to detect a defect) was used

Abstract = {{The use of hydrogen fuel to supplement conventional hydrocarbon engine
   fuels is of interest as a means of developing hydrogen supply
   infrastructure, without the challenges of developing dedicated
   hydrogen-fueled vehicles. Mixing hydrogen with natural gas is the most
   straightforward means of implementation as both can be mixed and stored
   in conventional high pressure compressed gas cylinders. The primary
   benefit of hydrogen supplementation for IC engines is to allow leaner
   operation than with operation on natural gas alone while maintaining
   high combustion efficiency. Results from both engine and vehicle studies
   confirm that hydrogen supplementation improves the NOx-hydrocarbon
   emission trade-off compared to natural gas as a result of leaner
   operation. The difference between the leanest air-fuel ratio for
   hydrogen-containing mixtures and the leanest air-fuel ratio for natural
   gas decreases with engine load. Thus, the extent of improvement in the
   NOx-hydrocarbon trade-off diminishes at high loads. As a result, the
   extent of improvement in real-world use will depend on driving cycle.
   Finally, fuel consumption is a third dimension in the NOx-hydrocarbon
   trade-off. As a result, not only the emissions but also the impact on
   fuel consumption must be taken into account in selecting the air-fuel
   ratio, spark timing, and other factors that constitute an engine
   calibration.}},

   We investigated CO2' s ability to synthesize the cyclic carbonates that

   with a biosourced amino-telechelic oligoamide and for NIPU foaming. Our
   study shows that CO2 is not only sequestered in the material for
   long-term application, but is also valorized as a blowing agent in the
   production of NIPU foams. Such foams will contribute to energy

Title = {{Achievable Rate Region for Energy Harvesting Asynchronous Two-Way Relay
   Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{951-958}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider an asynchronous two-way relay network where
   two single-antenna transceivers are using a single carrier communication
   scheme to exchange information and incur different delays. It is assumed
   that the relay nodes can harvest energy from their surrounding
   environment and utilize this harvested energy to forward their received
   messages using harvest-then-forward protocol. Since the
   transceiver-relay paths are subject to different propagation delays, the
   end-to-end channel can be viewed as a multi-path channel, which can
   cause inter-block-interference (IBI) in the signal blocks received by
   the two transceivers. In order to avoid such an IBI, we deploy a relay
   selection scheme where only those relay nodes are selected that
   contribute to a single tap end-to-end channel. Our goal is to maximize
   the sum rate of such a network subject to individual and total power
   constraints as well as energy harvesting profiles of the relays in order
   to obtain the maximum achievable rate region. Numerical results show
   that for a relay selection scheme and considering specific energy
   harvesting profiles for the relay nodes and under the condition that the
   total transmit budget of the transceivers are limited, the so obtained
   achievable rate region is the union of the rate region for each
   individual tap of the end-to-end channel.}},

Title = {{Eliminating Beam-Squinting in Wideband Linear Series-Fed Antenna Arrays
   Using Feed Networks Constructed by Slow-Wave Transmission Lines}},
Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{798-801}},
Abstract = {{A general configuration of linear series-fed antenna arrays is studied,
   and three different approaches for eliminating beam-squinting are
   identified. Two of these approaches result in passive implementations
   and are based on a degree of freedom provided by the lengths and
   propagation constants of the branches connecting the feedline to the
   antenna elements. Specifically, it is proposed that, by either the
   employment of varying-length branches or low-dispersion slow-wave
   transmission lines in equal-length branches, the beam-squinting can be
   eliminated over a very broad frequency range and for any arbitrary angle
   of beamforming between the backfire and endfire directions. Experimental
   results are presented for two feed networks, designed using the passive
   approaches, which can be utilized for a four-element linear series-fed
   array for beamforming at 30 degrees and 38 degrees with respect to the
   broadside direction, respectively. The array-factor results show that
   the beam remains effectively fixed, within +/- 2 degrees, over more than
   two-octave bandwidth for these prototypes.}},

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Graphene was embedded into the structure of mouse embryoid bodies (EBs)
   using the hanging drop technique. The inclusion of 0.2 mg per mL
   graphene in the EBs did not affect the viability of the stem cells.
   However, the graphene decreased the stem cell proliferation, probably by
   accelerating cell differentiation. The graphene also enhanced the
   mechanical properties and electrical conductivity of the EBs.
   Interestingly, the cardiac differentiation of the EB-graphene was
   significantly greater than that of the EBs at day 5 of culture, as
   confirmed by high-throughput gene analysis. Electrical stimulation
   (voltage, 4 V; frequency, 1 Hz; and duration, 10 ms for 2 continuous
   days) further enhanced the cardiac differentiation of the EBs, as
   demonstrated by analyses of the cardiac protein and gene expression and
   the beating activity of the EBs. Taken together, the results
   demonstrated that graphene played a major role in directing the cardiac
   differentiation of EBs, which has potential cell therapy and tissue
   regeneration applications.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray techniques have been used for more than a century to study the
   atomic and electronic structure in practically any type of material. The
   advent of correlated electron systems, in particular complex oxides,
   brought about new scientific challenges and opportunities for the
   advancement of conventional X-ray methods. In this context, the need for
   new approaches capable of selectively sensing new forms of orders
   involving all degrees of freedom-charge, orbital, spin, and
   lattice-paved the way for the emergence and success of resonant X-ray
   scattering, which has become an increasingly popular and powerful tool
   for the study of electronic ordering phenomena in solids. We review the
   recent resonant X-ray scattering breakthroughs in the copper oxide
   high-temperature superconductors, in particular regarding the phenomenon
   of charge order, a broken-symmetry state occurring when valence
   electrons self-organize into periodic structures. After a brief
   historical perspective on charge order, we outline the milestones in the
   development of resonant X-ray scattering as well as the basic
   theoretical formalism underlying its unique capabilities. The rest of
   the review focuses on the recent contributions of resonant scattering to
   the advancements in our description and understanding of charge order.
   To conclude, we propose a series of present and upcoming challenges and
   discuss the future outlook for this technique.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The multiarmed bandit problem is a popular framework for studying the
   exploration versus exploitation trade-off. Recent applications include
   dynamic assortment design, Internet advertising, dynamic pricing, and
   the control of queues. The standard mathematical formulation for a
   bandit problem makes the strong assumption that the decision maker has a
   full characterization of the joint distribution of the rewards, and that
   ``arms{''} under this distribution are independent. These assumptions
   are not satisfied in many applications, and the out-of-sample
   performance of policies that optimize a misspecified model can be poor.
   Motivated by these concerns, we formulate a robust bandit problem in
   which a decision maker accounts for distrust in the nominal model by
   solving a worst-case problem against an adversary ({''}nature{''}) who
   has the ability to alter the underlying reward distribution and does so
   to minimize the decision maker's expected total profit. Structural
   properties of the optimal worst-case policy are characterized by using
   the robust Bellman (dynamic programming) equation, and arms are shown to
   be no longer independent under nature's worst-case response. One
   implication of this is that index policies are not optimal for the
   robust problem, and we propose, as an alternative, a robust version of
   the Gittins index. Performance bounds for the robust Gittins index are
   derived by using structural properties of the value function together
   with ideas from stochastic dynamic programming duality. We also
   investigate the performance of the robust Gittins index policy when
   applied to a Bayesian webpage design problem. In the presence of model
   misspecification, numerical experiments show that the robust Gittins
   index policy not only outperforms the classical Gittins index policy,
   but also substantially reduces the variability in the out-of-sample
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding organic composition of gases and particles is essential to
   identifying sources and atmospheric processing leading to organic
   aerosols (OA), but atmospheric chemical complexity and the analytical
   techniques available often limit such analysis. Here we present
   speciated measurements of semivolatile and intermediate volatility
   organic compounds (S/IVOCs) using a novel dual-use instrument
   (SV-TAG-AMS) deployed at Manitou Forest, CO, during the
   Bio-hydro-atmosphere interactions of Energy, Aerosols, Carbon, H2O,
   Organics \& Nitrogen - Rocky Mountain Biogenic Aerosol Study
   (BEACHON-RoMBAS) 2011 campaign. This instrument provides on-line
   speciation of ambient organic compounds with 2 h time resolution. The
   species in this volatility range are complex in composition, but their
   chemical identities reveal potential sources. Observed compounds of
   biogenic origin include sesquiterpenes with molecular formula C15H24
   (e.g., beta-caryophyllene and longifolene), which were most abundant at
   night. A variety of other biogenic compounds were observed, including
   sesquiterpenoids with molecular formula C15H22, abietatriene and other
   terpenoid compounds. Many of these compounds have been identified in
   essential oils and branch enclosure studies but were observed in ambient
   air for the first time in our study. Semivolatile polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) and alkanes were observed with highest
   concentrations during the day and the dependence on temperature suggests
   the role of an evaporative source. Using statistical analysis by
   positive matrix factorization (PMF), we classify observed S/IVOCs by
   their likely sources and processes, and characterize them based on
   chemical composition. The total mass concentration of elutable S/IVOCs
   was estimated to be on the order of 0.7 mu g m(-3) and their volatility
   distributions are estimated for modeling aerosol formation chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Gene sequences annotated as proteins of unknown or non-specific function
   and hypothetical proteins account for a large fraction of most genomes.
   In the strictly anaerobic and organohalide respiring Dehalococcoides
   mccartyi, this lack of annotation plagues almost half the genome. Using
   a combination of bioinformatics analyses and genome-wide metabolic
   modelling, new or more specific annotations were proposed for about 80
   of these poorly annotated genes in previous investigations of D.
   mccartyi metabolism. Herein, we report the experimental validation of
   the proposed reannotations for two such genes (KB1\_0495 and KB1\_0553)
   from D. mccartyi strains in the KB-1 community. KB1\_0495 or DmIDH was
   originally annotated as an NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase,
   but biochemical assays revealed its activity primarily with NADP(+) as a
   cofactor. KB1\_0553, also denoted as DmPMI, was originally annotated as
   a hypothetical protein/sugar isomerase domain protein. We previously
   proposed that it was a bifunctional phosphoglucose
   isomerase/phosphomannose isomerase, but only phosphomannose isomerase
   activity was identified and confirmed experimentally. Further
   bioinformatics analyses of these two protein sequences suggest their
   affiliation to potentially novel enzyme families within their respective
   larger enzyme super families.}},

Abstract = {{The invasive freshwater mollusc Dreissena bugensis (quagga mussel)
   sticks to underwater surfaces via a proteinacious `anchor' (byssus),
   consisting of a series of threads linked to adhesive plaques. This
   adhesion results in the biofouling of crucial underwater industry
   infrastructure, yet little is known about the proteins responsible for
   the adhesion. Here the identification of byssal proteins extracted from
   freshly secreted byssal material is described. Several new byssal
   proteins were observed by gel electrophoresis. Matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to
   characterize proteins in different regions of the byssus, particularly
   those localized to the adhesive interface. Byssal plaques and threads
   contain in common a range of low molecular weight proteins, while
   several proteins with higher mass were observed only in the plaque. At
   the adhesive interface, a plaque-specific similar to 8.1 kDa protein had
   a relative increase in signal intensity compared to the bulk of the
   plaque, suggesting it may play a direct role in adhesion.}},

Abstract = {{This manuscript describes an approach, based on Laban Movement Analysis,
   to generate compact and informative representations of movement to
   facilitate affective movement recognition and generation for robots and
   other artificial embodiments. We hypothesize that Laban Movement
   Analysis, which is a comprehensive and systematic approach for
   describing movement, is an excellent candidate for deriving a
   low-dimensional representation of movement which facilitates affective
   motion modeling. First, we review the dimensions of Laban Movement
   Analysis most relevant for capturing movement expressivity and propose
   an approach to compute an estimate of the Shape and Effort components of
   Laban Movement Analysis using data obtained from motion capture. Within
   a motion capture environment, a professional actor reproduced prescribed
   motions, imbuing them with different emotions. The proposed approach was
   compared with a Laban coding by a certified movement analyst (CMA). The
   results show a strong correlation between results from the automatic
   Laban quantification and the CMA-generated Laban quantification of the
   movements. Based on these results, we describe an approach for the
   automatic generation of affective movements, by adapting pre-defined
   motion paths to overlay affective content. The proposed framework is
   validated through cross-validation and perceptual user studies. The
   proposed approach has great potential for application in fields
   including robotics, interactive art, animation and dance/acting
   training.}},

   accumulation of the delivered dose based on daily 4DCBCT images.
   However, it is not yet well understood how the uncertainties associated
   with DIR methods affect the dose calculations and resulting clinical
   metrics. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of DIR
   uncertainty on the clinical metrics derived from its use in dose
   accumulation.
   Methods: A biomechanical model based DIR method and a
   biomechanical-intensity-based hybrid method, which reduced the average
   registration error by 1.6 mm, were applied to ten lung cancer patients.
   A clinically relevant dose parameter {[}minimum dose to 0.5 cm(3)
   (Dmin)] was calculated for three dose scenarios using both algorithms.
   Dose scenarios included static (no breathing motion), predicted
   (breathing motion at the time of planning), and total accumulated
   (interfraction breathing motion). The relationship between the dose
   parameter and a combination of DIR uncertainty metrics, tumor volume,
   and dose heterogeneity of the plan was investigated.
   Results: Depending on the dose heterogeneity, tumor volume, and DIR
   uncertainty, in over 50\% of the patients, differences greater than 1.0
   Gy were observed in the Dmin of the tumor in the static dose calculation
   on exhale phase of the 4DCT. Such differences were due to the errors in
   propagating the tumor contours from the reference planning 4DCT phase
   onto a subsequent 4DCT phase using each DIR algorithm and calculating
   the dose on that phase. The differences in predicted dose were more
   subtle when breathing motion was modeled explicitly at the time of
   planning with only one patient exhibiting a greater than 1.0 Gy
   difference in Dmin. Dmin differences of up to 2.5 Gy were found in the
   total accumulated delivered dose due to difference in quantifying the
   interfraction variations. Such dose uncertainties could potentially be
   clinically significant.
   Conclusions: Reductions in average uncertainty in DIR algorithms by 1.6
   mm may have a clinically significant impact on the decision-making
   metrics used in dose planning and dose accumulation assessment. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The procedure for aspiration of bone marrow from the femur of patients
   undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA)
   may vary from an OR (operating room) to OR based on the surgeon's skill
   and may lead to varied extent of clotting of the marrow and this, in
   turn, presents difficulty in the isolation of mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSCs) from such clotted bone marrow. We present a simple detailed
   protocol for aspirating bone marrow from such patients, isolation, and
   characterization of MSCs from the aspirated bone marrow specimens and
   show that the bone marrow presented no clotting or exhibited minimal
   clotting. This represents an economical source and convenient source of
   MSCs from bone marrow for use in regenerative medicine. Also, we
   presented the detailed protocol and showed that the MSCs derived from
   such bone marrow specimens exhibited MSCs characteristics and generated
   micromass cartilages, the recipe for regenerative medicine for
   osteoarthritis. The protocols we presented can be used as standard
   operating procedures (SOPs) by researchers and clinicians.}},

   In this study, the extraction of L-phenylalanine from sodium chloride

   kerosene was newly employed as the diluent of membrane phase. Meanwhile,
   a back propagation neural network (BPNN) improved by genetic algorithm
   (GA) was first established to simulate the concentration of
   L-phenylalanine in external phase and extraction efficiency with the
   time under various operational conditions. The results show that, a
   stable ELM with an extraction efficiency of 94.4\% and a concentration
   ratio of 106.1 can be acquired. The back propagation neural network
   improved by genetic algorithm (GABP) is also demonstrated as an
   effective tool to simulate an ELM process in real-time with average
   residual errors of 0.0722 g/L and 1.6563\% in terms of the concentration

Abstract = {{In order to broaden the applications of bio-epoxy resins in high

   environmentally-friendly biopolymers is essential. This study
   investigates the thermal degradation mechanism of a bio-epoxy resin
   (E-epoxy) derived from bark extractives in comparison with a
   petroleum-based epoxy resin. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
   results show that the activation energy of E-epoxy varied significantly
   with the extent of degradation indicating a multistage degradation
   mechanism involving a variety of compounds. According to Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis, the dehydration and
   crosslinking reactions occurred at low temperatures, while the Claisen
   chain rearrangement and chain-scission reactions dominated at high
   temperatures. The pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (Py-GC/MS) results show that a significant amount of methyl

   2,2'-isopropylidenebis(3,5-dimethylbenzofuran), and epimanool were

Abstract = {{Traffic-related pollutants adversely affect air quality, especially in
   regions near major roadways. The vehicle-induced turbulence (VIT) is a
   significant factor that controls the initial dilution, dispersion, and
   ultimately the chemical and physical fate of pollutants by altering the
   conditions in the microenvironment. This study used a computational
   fluid dynamics (CFD) software FLUENT to model the vehicle-induced
   turbulence (VIT) generated on roadways, with a focus on impact of
   vehicle-vehicle interactions, traffic density and vehicle composition on
   turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). We show, for the first time, that the
   overall TKE from multiple vehicles traveling in series can be estimated
   by superimposing the TKE of each vehicle, without considering the
   distance between them while the distance is greater than one vehicle
   length. This finding is particularly significant since it enables a new
   approach to VIT simulations where the overall TKE is calculated as a
   function of number of vehicles. We found that the interactions between
   vehicles traveling next to each other in adjacent lanes are
   insignificant, regardless the directions of the traffic flow.
   Consequently, simulations of different traffic scenarios can be
   substantially simplified by treating two-way traffic as one-way traffic,
   with less than 5\% difference in the overall volume-averaged TKE. We
   also developed equations that allow the estimation of the overall
   volume-averaged TKE as a function of the number and the type of
   vehicles. (C) 2015 The Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of

Abstract = {{Objective: Feature extraction is one of the most important steps in any
   brain-computer interface (BCI) system. In particular, spatio-spectral
   feature extraction for motor-imagery BCIs (MI-BCI) has been the focus of
   several works in the past decade. This paper proposes a novel method,
   called separable common spatio-spectral patterns (SCSSP), for extraction
   of discriminant spatio-spectral EEG features in MI-BCIs. Methods:
   Assuming a binary classification problem, SCSSP uses a heteroscedastic
   matrix-variate Gaussian model for the multiband EEG rhythms, and seeks
   the spatio-spectral features whose variance is maximized for one brain
   task and minimized for the other task. Therefore, SCSSP can be
   considered as a spatio-spectral generalization of the conventional
   common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm. Results: The experimental
   results on two-class and multiclass motor-imagery data from publicly
   available BCI Competition datasets demonstrate that the proposed
   computationally efficient method competes closely with filter-bank CSP
   (FBCSP), and can even outperform the FBCSP if enough training data are
   available. Furthermore, SCSSP provides us with a simple measure for
   ranking the discriminant power of extracted spatio-spectral features,
   which is not possible in FBCSP. Conclusion: The matrix-variate Gaussian
   assumption allows the SCSSP method to jointly process the EEG data in
   both spatial and spectral domains. As a result, compared to the similar
   solutions in the literature such as FBCSP, the proposed SCSSP method
   requires significantly lower computations. Significance: The proposed
   computationally efficient spatio-spectral feature extractor is
   particularly suitable for applications in which the computational power
   is limited, such as emerging wearable mobile BCI systems.}},

Title = {{Spatial Coherence Profiles of Ictal High-Frequency Oscillations
   Correspond to Those of Interictal Low-Frequency Oscillations in the ECoG
   of Epileptic Patients}},

Abstract = {{Goal: We have previously demonstrated that the coherence of
   high-frequency oscillations (HFOs; 80-300 Hz) increased during
   extratemporal lobe seizures in a consistent and spatially focused
   electrode cluster. In this study, we have investigated the relationship
   between cohered HFO intracranial EEG (iEEG) activity with that of slower
   low-frequency oscillations (LFOs; <80 Hz). Methods: We applied wavelet
   phase coherence analysis to the iEEGs of patients with intractable
   extratemporal lobe epilepsy (ETLE). Results: It was observed that areas
   on the implanted patient subdural grids, which exhibited strong ictal
   HFO coherence were similar to tissue regions displaying strong
   interictal LFO coherence in the 5-12 Hz frequency range, relative to all
   other electrodes. A positive surgical outcome was correlated with having
   the clinically marked seizure onset zone(s) in close proximity to
   HFO/LFO coherence highlighted regions of interest (ROIs). Conclusion:
   Recent studies have suggested that LFOs (in the 8-12 Hz frequency range)
   play an important role in controlling cortical excitability, by exerting
   an inhibitory effect on cortical processing, and that the presence of
   strong theta activity (4-8 Hz) in awake adults is suggestive of abnormal
   and/or pathological activity. We speculate that the overlapping spatial
   regions exhibiting increased coherence in both ictal HFOs and interictal
   LFOs identified local abnormalities that underlie epileptogenic
   networks. Significance: Whereas it is worthwhile to note that the small
   patient group (n = 7) studied here, somewhat limits the clinical
   significance of our study, the results presented here suggest targeting
   HFO activity in the 80-300 Hz frequency range and/or interictal LFO
   activity in the 5-12 Hz frequency range, when defining seizure-related
   ROIs in the iEEGs of patients with ETLE.}},

Abstract = {{The solubility of active pharmaceutical ingredients in various solvents

   solubility on the temperature as well as on the composition of solvent
   mixtures has been simulated by Jouyban-Acree (JA) and nonrandom two
   liquid (NRTL) equations, respectively. The results show that as to the
   solubility simulation of the studied system JA and NRTL give average
   relative deviations of 0.1081 and 0.1064, respectively, suggesting that

Abstract = {{The efficiency of nanostructured photocatalysts continues to improve at
   an impressive pace and is closing in on those needed for commercial
   applications; however, present-day reactor strategies used to deploy
   these nanostructures fail to achieve the sufficient areas (>1 m(2))
   needed for solar application. Here we report the Self-assembled
   Nanoparticle-stabilized Photocatalytic Reactor (SNPR), a fully-scalable
   reactor strategy comprised only of nanoparticles adsorbed at the
   fluid-fluid interfaces of oil-in-water emulsions, water-in-oil
   emulsions, and CO2-in-water foams. We show that SNPRs naturally disperse
   over open water and need no physical substrate, requiring only
   photocatalysts and fluid. In environmental applications the SNPR
   provides more than double the reaction rate of a comparable single-phase
   reactor. In continuous mode, the SNPR achieves 100\% photocatalyst
   retention and processes 96\% of the stream over 20 hours; in contrast,
   the performance of a comparable aqueous suspension declines to zero over
   this interval, losing all photocatalyst to the outlet stream. We further
   characterize the photoactivity of individual photocatalytic droplets,
   with reactants in both the continuous and dispersed phases. These
   results demonstrate SNPRs as a robust and flexible reactor strategy and
   a route-to-scale for nanomaterials.}},

   illumination efficiency from arbitrarily large apertures}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{One of the long-standing problems in antenna engineering is the
   realization of highly directive beams using low-profile devices. In this
   paper, we provide a solution to this problem by means of Huygens'
   metasurfaces (HMSs), based on the equivalence principle. This principle
   states that a given excitation can be transformed to a desirable
   aperture field by inducing suitable electric and (equivalent) magnetic
   surface currents. Building on this concept, we propose and demonstrate
   cavity-excited HMS antennas, where the single-source-fed cavity is
   designed to optimize aperture illumination, while the HMS facilitates
   the current distribution that ensures phase purity of aperture fields.
   The HMS breaks the coupling between the excitation and radiation spectra
   typical to standard partially reflecting surfaces, allowing tailoring of
   the aperture properties to produce a desirable radiation pattern,
   without incurring edge-taper losses. The proposed low-profile design
   yields near-unity aperture illumination efficiencies from arbitrarily
   large apertures, offering new capabilities for microwave, terahertz and
   optical radiators.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{477-497}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this study, an interval-stochastic-based risk analysis (RSRA) method
   is developed for supporting river water quality management in a rural
   system under uncertainty (i.e., uncertainties exist in a number of
   system components as well as their interrelationships). The RSRA method
   is effective in risk management and policy analysis, particularly when
   the inputs (such as allowable pollutant discharge and pollutant
   discharge rate) are expressed as probability distributions and interval
   values. Moreover, decision-makers' attitudes towards system risk can be
   reflected using a restricted resource measure by controlling the
   variability of the recourse cost. The RSRA method is then applied to a
   real case of water quality management in the Heshui River Basin (a rural
   area of China), where chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN),
   total phosphorus (TP), and soil loss are selected as major indicators to
   identify the water pollution control strategies. Results reveal that
   uncertainties and risk attitudes have significant effects on both
   pollutant discharge and system benefit. A high risk measure level can
   lead to a reduced system benefit; however, this reduction also
   corresponds to raised system reliability. Results also disclose that (a)
   agriculture is the dominant contributor to soil loss, TN, and TP loads,
   and abatement actions should be mainly carried out for paddy and dry
   farms; (b) livestock husbandry is the main COD discharger, and abatement
   measures should be mainly conducted for poultry farm; (c) fishery
   accounts for a high percentage of TN, TP, and COD discharges but a has
   low percentage of overall net benefit, and it may be beneficial to cease
   fishery activities in the basin. The findings can facilitate the local
   authority in identifying desired pollution control strategies with the
   tradeoff between socioeconomic development and environmental
   sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the developed
   world, and as such there is a pressing need for treatment options.
   Cardiac tissue engineering emerged from the need to develop alternative
   sources and methods of replacing tissue damaged by cardiovascular
   diseases, as the ultimate treatment option for many who suffer from
   end-stage heart failure is a heart transplant. In this review we focus
   on biomaterial approaches to augmenting injured or impaired myocardium,
   with specific emphasis on: the design criteria for these biomaterials;
   the types of scaffolds - composed of natural or synthetic biomaterials
   or decellularized extracellular matrix - that have been used to develop
   cardiac patches and tissue models; methods to vascularize scaffolds and
   engineered tissue; and finally, injectable biomaterials (hydrogels)
   designed for endogenous repair, exogenous repair or as bulking agents to
   maintain ventricular geometry post-infarct. The challenges facing the
   field and obstacles that must be overcome to develop truly clinically
   viable cardiac therapies are also discussed. Copyright (c) 2014 John

Abstract = {{It is well known that the monotonic behavior of reinforced concrete can
   be improved with the addition of steel fibers. However, available
   literature on the use of steel fibers as shear or flexural reinforcement
   has predominantly focused on non-seismic applications.
   Experiments were performed to characterize the reversed cyclic response
   of steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) and compare its response with
   that of monotonically loaded SFRC and conventionally reinforced
   concrete. Ten concrete panels were constructed and tested under in-plane
   pure-shear loading conditions. The test parameters included fiber volume
   content, fiber aspect ratio, and loading protocol. Results indicate
   that, under reversed cyclic loading, SFRC exhibits stable hysteretic
   response with minimal strength degradation and no noticeable changes in
   ductility. Fiber volume content and fiber aspect ratio are found to
   significantly influence the shear performance of SFRC. Details and
   results are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Stem cells are characterized by a number of useful properties, including
   their ability to migrate, differentiate, and secrete a variety of
   therapeutic molecules such as immunomodulatory factors. As such,
   numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies have utilized stem cell-based
   therapies and demonstrated their tremendous potential for the treatment
   of various human diseases and disorders. Recently, efforts have focused
   on engineering stem cells in order to further enhance their innate
   abilities as well as to confer them with new functionalities, which can
   then be used in various biomedical applications. These engineered stem
   cells can take on a number of forms. For instance, engineered stem cells
   encompass the genetic modification of stem cells as well as the use of
   stem cells for gene delivery, nanoparticle loading and delivery, and
   even small molecule drug delivery. The present Review gives an in-depth
   account of the current status of engineered stem cells, including
   potential cell sources, the most common methods used to engineer stem
   cells, and the utilization of engineered stem cells in various
   biomedical applications, with a particular focus on tissue regeneration,
   the treatment of immunodeficiency diseases, and cancer.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveDimethyl fumarate (DMF), a therapy for relapsing-remitting
   multiple sclerosis (RRMS), is implicated as acting on inflammatory and
   antioxidant responses within both systemic immune and/or central nervous
   system (CNS) compartments. Orally administered DMF is rapidly
   metabolized to monomethyl fumarate (MMF). Our aim was to analyze the
   impact of fumarates on antiinflammatory and antioxidant profiles of
   human myeloid cells found in the systemic compartment (monocytes) and in
   the inflamed CNS (blood-derived macrophages and brain-derived
   microglia).
   MethodsWe analyzed cytokine and antioxidant expression in monocytes from
   untreated or DMF-treated RRMS patients and controls, and in
   monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and microglia isolated from adult
   and fetal human brain tissue.
   ResultsMonocytes from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients receiving DMF had
   reduced expression of the proinflammatory micro-RNA miR-155 and of
   antioxidant genes HMOX1 and OSGIN1 compared to untreated MS patients;
   similar changes were observed in patients receiving FTY720 and/or
   natalizumab. In vitro addition of DMF but not MMF to MDMs and microglia
   inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced production of inflammatory
   cytokines and increased expression of the antioxidant gene HMOX1 in the
   absence of significant cytotoxicity.
   InterpretationOur in vivo-based observations that effects of DMF therapy
   on systemic myeloid cell gene expression are also observed with FTY720
   and natalizumab therapy suggests that the effect may be indirect,
   reflecting reduced overall disease activity. Our in vitro results
   demonstrate significant effects of DMF but not MMF on inflammation and
   antioxidant responses by MDMs and microglia, questioning the mechanisms
   whereby DMF therapy would modulate myeloid cell properties within the
   CNS.}},

Abstract = {{The process of public consultation for planning and construction of
   sustainable urban infrastructure requires a bidirectional communication
   among as many stakeholders of the project as possible. In modern
   infrastructure projects, social web and online social media play an
   important role in involving citizens through what is referred to as
   ``microparticipation.{''} However, the social network which is formed
   behind the scene of microparticipation is usually ignored by both
   researchers and practitioners. This article combines community detection
   in social networks with information retrieval methods, to detect and
   label communities of project followers and cores of interest in the
   network of urban infrastructure project stakeholders. We study dynamics
   of the network and its communities by monitoring them over time. This
   technique is used to analyze followers of a Light Rail Transit (LRT)
   project in microblogging website Twitter and profile them based on their
   interests and ideas they support. Although methods of this article can
   be readily applied to other cases where connectivity of project
   followers and their descriptions are retrievable, our work is mainly
   interested in how to analyze Twitter discussions without any assumption
   that they replace the other online or offline means of public
   involvement in infrastructure projects. This article is an extended

Abstract = {{Brain-computer interface (BCI) spellers could improve access to
   communication for people with profound physical disabilities; however,
   improved speed and accuracy of these spellers is required to make them
   practical for everyday use. Here we introduce the combination of
   P300-speller confidence with the error-related potential (ErrP) to
   improve online single-trial error detection and correction accuracies in
   a BCI speller. First, we present a mechanism for obtaining
   P300-confidence using a real-time Bayesian dynamic stopping framework
   that makes novel use of additional stimuli that occur due to epoch and
   filter delays. Second, we propose an ensemble of decision trees to
   combine ErrP and P300-confidence features. Third, we describe the unique
   attentional differences between error and correct feedback in our
   spelling interface and discuss how these differences affect ErrP
   physiology. We tested online error detection on 11 typically developed
   adults using a BCI system trained on a previous day and found an average
   sensitivity of 86.67\% and specificity of 96.59\%. Automatic correction
   increased selection accuracy by 13.67\% and utility grew by a factor of
   4.48. We found, however, that the improved performance was primarily
   attributable to the inclusion of P300 confidence in error detection,
   calling into question the significance of single-trial ErrP detection.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We conducted a neuroimaging analysis to understand the
   neuroanatomical correlates of gray matter loss in a group of mild
   cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's disease patients who
   developed delusions.
   Methods: With data collected as part of the Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative, we conducted voxel-based morphometry to
   determine areas of gray matter change in the same Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative participants, before and after they developed
   delusions.
   Results: We identified 14 voxel clusters with significant gray matter
   decrease in patient scans post-delusional onset, correcting for multiple
   comparisons (false discovery rate, p< 0.05). Major areas of difference
   included the right and left insulae, left precuneus, the right and left
   cerebellar culmen, the left superior temporal gyrus, the right posterior
   cingulate, the right thalamus, and the left parahippocampal gyrus.
   Conclusions: Although contrary to our initial predictions of enhanced
   right frontal atrophy, our preliminary work identifies several
   neuroanatomical areas, including the cerebellum and left posterior
   hemisphere, which may be involved in delusional development in these
   patients. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The neuropathological correlates of psychosis in Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) is unclear, with some studies reporting a correlation
   between psychosis and increased AD pathology while others have found no
   association.
   Objective: To determine the demographic, clinical, and neuropathological
   features associated with psychotic symptoms in clinically attributed and
   neuropathologically proven AD.
   Method: We separately reviewed two overlapping groups of clinically
   diagnosed (cAD) AD patients with neuropathology data and
   neuropathologically definite (npAD) cases (regardless of clinical
   diagnosis) from the NACC database, and explored the relationships
   between psychosis and clinical variables, neuropathologic correlates,
   and vascular risk factors. Delusions and hallucinations, defined
   according to the NPI-Q, were analyzed separately.
   Results: 1,073 subjects in the database fulfilled our criteria (890 cAD
   and 728 npAD patients). 34\% of cAD and 37\% of npAD had psychotic
   symptoms during their illness. Hallucinations were associated with
   greater cognitive and functional impairments on the MMSE and CDR, while
   delusional patients showed less impairment on CDR, consistent across cAD
   and npAD groups. Burden of AD pathology appears to relate to presence of
   psychotic symptoms in the clinical AD group, but this result is not
   confirmed in the neuropathologically confirmed group suggesting the
   findings in the clinical group were due to misdiagnosis of AD. Lewy body
   pathology, subcortical arteriosclerotic leukoencephalopathy, and
   vascular risk factors, including a history of hypertension and diabetes,
   were associated with the development of psychosis.
   Conclusions: Vascular and Lewy body pathologies and vascular risk
   factors are important modifiers of the risk of psychosis in AD.}},

   effects of exercise on center-of-pressure fluctuations during quiet
   standing in middle-aged and elderly women. J Strength Cond Res 30(1):
   208-216, 2016Acute effects of exercise on postural stability have been
   studied with a focus on fatigue. This study investigated the acute
   effects of moderate-intensity exercise on center-of-pressure (COP)
   fluctuation measures in middle-aged and elderly women. Thirty-five
   healthy women volunteered: 18 women performed a moderate aquatic
   exercise session for 80 minutes and 17 remained calm in a sitting
   position for the same duration. Center-of-pressure fluctuations during
   quiet standing were recorded for 60 seconds with eyes open and closed
   before and after the exercise and sitting tasks. The time- and
   frequency-domain measures of the COP time series were calculated. The
   frequency-domain measures were also calculated for the COP velocity time
   series. According to 2-way analysis of variance and paired t-tests with
   a Bonferroni's correction, mean velocity of COP fluctuations, mean
   velocity of COP fluctuations in the medial-lateral (ML) direction, and
   total power of the COP velocity time series in the ML direction
   exhibited significant reductions after 1 session of exercise. These
   results indicated that a moderate-intensity aquatic exercise decreased
   COP velocity, counteracting age-related and fatigue-inducing postural
   deterioration. Therefore, we concluded that a single session of
   moderate-intensity aquatic exercise has acute positive effects on
   postural stability in middle-aged and elderly women.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{256-260}},
Abstract = {{Hydrothermal liquefaction uses high temperatures and pressures to break
   organic compounds into smaller fractions, and is considered the most
   promising method to convert wet microalgae feedstock to biofuel.
   Although, hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae has received much
   attention, the specific roles of temperature, pressure, heating rate and
   reaction time remain unclear. We present a microfluidic screening
   platform to precisely control and observe reaction conditions at high
   temperature and pressure. In situ observation using fluorescence enables
   direct, real-time monitoring of this process. A strong shift in the
   fluorescence signature from the algal slurry at 675 nm (chlorophyll
   peak) to a post-HTL stream at 510 nm is observed for reaction
   temperatures at 260 degrees C, 280 degrees C, 300 degrees C and 320
   degrees C (P = 12 MPa), and occurs over a timescale on the order of 10
   min. Biocrude formation and separation from the aqueous phase into
   immiscible droplets is directly observed and occurs over the same
   timescale. The higher heating values for the sample are observed to
   increase over shorter timescales on the order of minutes. After only 1
   minute at 300 degrees C, the higher heating value increases from an
   initial value of 21.97 MJ kg(-1) to 33.63 MJ kg(-1). The microfluidic
   platform provides unprecedented control and insight into this otherwise
   opaque process, with resolution that will guide the design of large
   scale reactors and processes.}},

Title = {{Inhibition Plasticity in Older Adults: Practice and Transfer Effects
   Using a Multiple Task Approach}},
Journal = {{NEURAL PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Objective. To examine plasticity of inhibition, as indexed by practice
   effects of inhibition tasks and the associated transfer effects, using a
   multiple task approach in healthy older adults. Method. Forty-eight
   healthy older adults were evenly assigned to either a practice group or
   a no-contact control group. All participants completed pretest (2.5
   hours) and posttest (2 hours) sessions, with a 2-week interval in
   between. During the 2-week interval, only the practice group completed
   six 30-minute practice sessions (three sessions per week for two
   consecutive weeks) of three lab-based inhibition tasks. Results. All
   three inhibition tasks demonstrated significant improvement across
   practice sessions, suggesting practice-induced plasticity. The benefit,
   however, only transferred to near-near tasks. The results are
   inconclusive with regard to the near-far and far-far transfer effects.
   Discussion. This study further extends literature on practice effects of
   inhibition in older adults by using a multiple task approach. Together
   with previous work, the current study suggests that older adults are
   able to improve inhibition performance through practice and transfer the
   practice gains to tasks that overlap in both target cognitive ability
   and task structure (i.e., near-near tasks).}},

   and decreasing the enzyme usage. In this study, a second refining step
   utilizing a Szego mill was introduced, resulting in significant
   improvements in sugar yields in enzymatic hydrolysis at equivalent or
   lower refining energy inputs. The multistage DMR process increased the
   monomeric glucose and xylose yields to approximately 90\% and 84\%,
   respectively, with an energy consumption of 200 kWh/ODMT. SEM imaging
   revealed that Szego milling caused significant surface disruption and
   severe maceration and delamination of the biomass structure. Our results
   show that the DMR process is a very promising process for the
   biorefinery industry in terms of economic feasibility.}},

Abstract = {{The continuously growing rodent incisor is an emerging model for the
   study of renewal of mineralized tissues by adult stem cells. Although
   the Bmp, Fgf, Shh, and Wnt pathways have been studied in this organ
   previously, relatively little is known about the role of Notch signaling
   during incisor renewal. Notch signaling components are expressed in
   enamel-forming ameloblasts and the underlying stratum intermedium (SI),
   which suggested distinct roles in incisor renewal and enamel
   mineralization. Here, we injected adult mice with inhibitory antibodies
   against several components of the Notch pathway. This blockade led to
   defects in the interaction between ameloblasts and the SI cells, which
   ultimately affected enamel formation. Furthermore, Notch signaling
   inhibition led to the downregulation of desmosome-specific proteins such
   as PERP and desmoplakin, consistent with the importance of desmosomes in
   the integrity of ameloblast-SI attachment and enamel formation.
   Together, our data demonstrate that Notch signaling is critical for
   proper enamel formation during incisor renewal, in part by regulating
   desmosome-specific components, and that the mouse incisor provides a
   model system to dissect Jag-Notch signaling mechanisms in the context of
   mineralized tissue renewal. (c) 2015 American Society for Bone and

Volume = {{51}},

Abstract = {{Rock bolting is one of the most effective and economical means of rock
   mass reinforcement. Existing studies of rock bolt reinforcement are
   mostly focused on rock masses without flaw, with a single flaw, or with
   parallel flaws. However in rock masses, cracks or flaws usually exist in
   the form of cross-flaws. In order to understand the impact of
   cross-flaws on rock bolt reinforcement and to further explore the
   differences of bolt reinforcement between rock mass with cross-flaws and
   rock mass with a single flaw, reinforced analog specimens with
   cross-flaws and with a single flaw were tested under uniaxial
   compressive condition. The experimental results show that the uniaxial
   compressive strength of the reinforced rock mass with cross-flaws in
   this research is higher than that of reinforced rock mass with a single
   flaw. This observation can be explained by the difference in the failure
   modes of reinforced specimens: the reinforced rock masses with a single
   flaw fail due to the formation of a shear crack while reinforced rock
   masses with cross-flaws fail as a result of a tensile fracture or
   interaction between tensile fracture and shear fracture. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the feasibility of a combined therapeutic and

   Ultrasound can be used to determine when diseased cardiac tissues have

   that uses acoustic radiation force, displacement tracking and the
   different mechanical properties of viable and ablated tissues. In this
   study, we developed catheters that are capable of LHMI measurements.
   Experiments were conducted in phantoms, ex vivo cardiac samples and the
   in vivo beating hearts of healthy porcine subjects. In vivo experiments
   revealed that four of four epicardial sonications revealed a decrease in
   measured displacements from LHMI experiments and that when lower power
   was used, no lesions formed and there was no corresponding decrease in
   measured displacement amplitudes. In addition, two of three endocardial
   lesions were confirmed and corresponded to a decrease in the measured

Title = {{A glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor delivery system enhances
   nerve regeneration across acellular nerve allografts}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{29}},
Pages = {{62-70}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Acellular nerve allografts (ANAs) are used clinically to bridge nerve
   gaps but these grafts, lacking Schwann cells and therapeutic levels of
   neurotrophic factors, do not support regeneration to the same extent as
   autografts. Here we investigated a local drug delivery system (DDS) for
   glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) controlled release to
   implanted ANAs in rats using drug-loaded polymeric microspheres (MSs)
   embedded in a fibrin gel. In a rat hindlimb nerve gap model, a I 0 mm
   ANA was used to bridge a 5 mm common peroneal (CP) nerve gap.
   Experimental groups received DDS treatment at both suture sites of the
   allografts releasing GDNF for either 2 weeks or 4 weeks. In negative
   control groups, rats received no DDS treatment or empty DDS. Rats
   receiving nerve isografts served as the positive control group. The
   numbers of motor and sensory neurons that regenerated their axons in all
   the groups with GDNF MS and isograft treatment were indistinguishable
   and significantly higher as compared to the negative control groups.
   Nerve histology distal to the nerve graft demonstrated increased axon
   counts and a shift to larger fiber diameters due to GDNF MS treatment.
   The sustained delivery of GDNF to the implanted ANA achieved in this
   study demonstrates the promise of this DDS for the management of severe
   nerve injuries in which allografts are placed.
   Statement of Significance
   This work addresses the common clinical situation in which a nerve gap
   is bridged using acellular nerve allografts. However, these allografts
   are not as effective in supporting nerve regeneration as the gold
   standard method of autografting. The novel local drug delivery system
   used in this study provides sustained and controlled release of glial
   cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), one of the most potent
   neurotrophic factors, which significantly improves nerve regeneration
   following severe nerve injuries. Results from this research will provide
   a mean of improving nerve allografts with locally delivered GDNF. This
   strategy may lead to a novel ``off the shelf{''} alternative to the
   current management of severe nerve injuries. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{In next-generation LTE-advanced cellular networks, device-to-device
   (D2D) communication has emerged as an effective way to offload cellular
   traffic and improve system performance. Conventionally, a device
   exclusively relies on cellular communication to retrieve the content it
   desires. With D2D communication, however, if the same piece of content
   is available in the vicinity of the device, the content can be directly
   retrieved from one of its neighbouring devices. Naturally, the key
   problem becomes how to maximize content sharing via D2D communication.
   Existing works on content sharing are mainly concerned with a multi-hop
   communication setting, while works on D2D communication have primarily
   focused on the communication aspects, including interference avoidance
   and energy efficiency. In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing
   cellular traffic offloading with D2D communication, by selectively
   caching popular content locally, and by exploring maximal matching for
   sender-receiver pairs. Specifically, we consider an interference-aware
   communication model and formulate selective caching as a Knapsack
   problem, and sender-receiver matching as a maximum weighted matching
   problem in a bipartite graph. We propose decentralized algorithms to
   solve both problems, and our simulation results demonstrate that our
   algorithms are effective in maximizing cellular traffic offloading.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a decentralized wide-area coordinated supplementary
   control of multiple line-commutated converter (LCC)-HVDC links to 1)
   prevent interactions among the HVDC links and 2) enhance the damping of
   the inter-area oscillatory modes. The proposed approach is based on the
   sparsity-promoting optimal control. The main features of the proposed
   approach are 1) it requires minimal communication infrastructure to
   achieve the control objectives and thus reduces the impacts of
   communication delays and noise, 2) it entails in an optimal gain which
   preserves the closed-loop stability and 3) it does not require the
   estimates of the system states. The performance of the proposed
   controller is evaluated based on eigen analysis and time-domain
   simulation of an interconnected AC system that includes five LCC-HVDC
   links. Performance of the proposed controller is also compared with
   those of fully centralized and conventional local supplementary
   controllers and its merits are highlighted. The studies indicate the
   proposed controller, based on 13 remotely communicated signals, provides
   similar performance as that of a fully centralized optimal controller
   using 2050 communicated signals and is far superior to the conventional
   local supplementary controllers.}},

Abstract = {{We propose embedding networks-on-chip (NoCs) on field-programmable
   gate-arrays (FPGAs) to implement system-level communication. Amongst
   other benefits, this can alleviate the current challenge of connecting
   the FPGA's fabric to highspeed I/O and memory interfaces, which are a
   crucial component of FPGA designs. Our mixed and hard embedded NoCs add
   only similar to 1\% area to large FPGAs and can run much faster than the
   core logic, thus keeping up with the speed of I/O and memory interfaces.
   A detailed power analysis, per NoC component, shows that routers consume
   14x less power when implemented hard compared with soft, and whether
   hard or soft most of the router's power is consumed in the input modules
   for buffering. For complete systems, hard NoCs consume <6\% (and as low
   as 3\%) of the FPGA's dynamic power budget to support 100 GB/s of
   communication bandwidth. We find that, depending on design choices, hard
   NoCs consume 4.5-10.4 mJ of energy per gigabyte of data transferred.
   Surprisingly, this is comparable with the energy efficiency of the
   simplest traditional interconnect on an FPGA-soft point-to-point links
   require 4.7 mJ/GB. When comparing a hard NoC against soft buses that are
   currently used for interconnection, we find that a typical system is 4x
   smaller, and uses 23\% less energy when implemented using the hard NoC
   even though it is only 43\% utilized.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{473-485}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Fracture tests were conducted on copper-solder-copper joints of various
   lengths using double-cantilever-beam (DCB) specimens under mode I
   loading conditions. The thickness and length of the solder joints were
   large enough to neglect any anisotropy associated with the solder
   microstructure. It was found that the critical strain energy release
   rate at crack initiation, G (ci), was insensitive to the length of the
   solder joint; however, for joints shorter than a characteristic length
   which was a function of the thickness and the mechanical properties of
   the solder layer and the substrates, the fracture load increased with
   increasing solder joint length. A sandwich model was developed for the
   analysis of the stress and strain in solder joints, taking into account
   the influence of both the bending deformation and the shear deformation
   of the substrates on the solder joint stresses. Consistent with the
   experimental results, it was found that solder joints longer than the
   characteristic length have a maximum peel stress that remains unchanged
   with joint length, causing the joint strength to become independent of
   the joint length. A closed-form analytical solution was developed for
   the characteristic length of DCB specimens under mode I loading. The
   experimental results were in good agreement with the analytical model
   and with finite element results. The generality of the G (ci) failure
   criterion was demonstrated by comparing the experimental results and the
   fracture load predictions of mode I DCB solder joints with different
   lengths.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach for pre-dispersing MgO nanoparticles and adding them to
   molten steel during continuous casting operations was established. The
   influence of different mass fractions of MgO nanoparticles on inclusion
   characteristics, steel microstructure, and the ability of inclusions to
   induce acicular ferrite (AF) formation, was investigated. The results
   revealed that after adding different mass fractions of nanoparticles,
   the majority of inclusions contained MgO-Al2O3, and the inclusion size
   was considerably refined. These inclusions promoted AF formation, and
   with increasing inclusion size from 1.0 to 1.8 mu m, the proportion of
   AF progressively increased. The ability of inclusions to induce AF was
   greatly reduced when the inclusion size reached 7.0 mu m. This was
   primarily due to the relationship between the ferrite nucleation rate
   and inclusion size. It was also found that the size of inclusions that
   functioned as pinning particles was larger than that of inclusions that
   served as AF nucleation cores. When the mass fraction of MgO
   nanoparticles reached 0.05 pct, the degree of interlocking of AF within
   the microstructure of billet specimens was maximized and this was
   associated with optimal values for strength and impact properties.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we provide an introduction to machine learning tasks that
   address important problems in genomic medicine. One of the goals of
   genomic medicine is to determine how variations in the DNA of
   individuals can affect the risk of different diseases, and to find
   causal explanations so that targeted therapies can be designed. Here we
   focus on how machine learning can help to model the relationship between
   DNA and the quantities of key molecules in the cell, with the premise
   that these quantities, which we refer to as cell variables, may be
   associated with disease risks. Modern biology allows high-throughput
   measurement of many such cell variables, including gene expression,
   splicing, and proteins binding to nucleic acids, which can all be
   treated as training targets for predictive models. With the growing
   availability of large-scale data sets and advanced computational
   techniques such as deep learning, researchers can help to usher in a new
   era of effective genomic medicine.}},

Abstract = {{The Dehalogenimonas population in a dechlorinating enrichment culture
   referred to as WBC-2 was previously shown to be responsible for
   trans-dichloroethene (tDCE) hydrogenolysis to vinyl chloride (VC). In
   this study, blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE)
   followed by enzymatic assays and protein identification using liquid
   chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) led to the
   functional characterization of a novel dehalogenase, TdrA. This new
   reductive dehalogenase (RDase) catalyzes the dechlorination of tDCE to
   VC. A metagenome of the WBC-2 culture was sequenced, and a complete
   Dehalogenimonas genome, only the second Dehalogenimonas genome to become
   publicly available, was closed. The tdrA dehalogenase found within the
   Dehalogenimonas genome appears to be on a genomic island similar to
   genomic islands found in Dehalococcoides. TdrA itself is most similar to
   TceA from Dehalococcoides sp. strain FL2 with 76.4\% amino acid pairwise
   identity. It is likely that the horizontal transfer of rdhA genes is not
   only a feature of Dehalococcoides but also a feature of other
   Dehalococcoidia, including Dehalogenimonas. A set of primers was
   developed to track tdrA in WBC-2 subcultures maintained on different
   electron acceptors. This newest dehalogenase is an addition to the short
   list of functionally defined RDases sharing the usual characteristic
   motifs (including an AB operon, a TAT export sequence, two iron-sulfur
   clusters, and a corrinoid binding domain), substrate flexibility, and
   evidence for horizontal gene transfer within the Dehalococcoidia.}},

Abstract = {{The abrasive slurry-jet erosion of a talc-filled thermoplastic olefin
   (TPO) (60\% PP, 25\% EP rubber and 15\% talc) was measured as a function
   of the impact angle and the talc filler content. A ductile erosion
   response was observed, showing a maximum erosion rate at 45 degrees. A
   superposition model was then developed to predict the cross-sectional
   shapes of small-scale flat-bottomed pockets and curved edges machined in
   TPO using abrasive slurry-jet micro-machining (ASJM). The model was
   based on the spatial distribution of the erosion across the jet
   footprint measured during a shallow ``first pass{''} channel at a
   specific angle. The model predictions of planar depth and waviness were
   in close agreement with experimental measurements. The measured
   dependence of the erosion rate on the impact angle was used to develop
   novel machining configurations to increase the slope of bounding
   sidewalls. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   diameters are adjusted after each cycle according to anticipated
   capital, energy, and damage costs. Accounting for risks of low- and

Title = {{Performance Index for Water Distribution Networks under Multiple Loading
   Conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have naturally related water distribution network
   performance to the ability to deliver sufficient pressure and flow. The
   present paper emphasizes that performance also depends on the efficiency
   of delivering these requirements. Accordingly, an efficiency-based
   performance index is proposed. It is the geometric average of four
   performance metrics: reliability, vulnerability, resilience, and
   connectivity. These are themselves based on the energy efficiency,
   hydraulic capacity, and structural ability of the system to deliver
   water under a range of conditions. The metrics are applied to two
   example networks and variations of these, enabling the assessment of
   their relevance, their sensitivity to system changes, and permitting a
   comparison to existing metrics. Variations represent different
   redundancy increasing strategies, recognized for improving performance.
   The proposed performance index generally follows a similar trend as the
   previous indices, increasing with network pressure. Nevertheless, it
   varies differently and penalizes networks with unnecessarily high
   pressures. Because the index is based on energy and demand efficiency
   metrics, it automatically complies with the energy and mass balances of
   the network. Moreover, the new metric is easily interpreted and can be
   applied to various systems, whether complex or involving multiple
   scenarios. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   confined in two separate layers, their properties can be controlled
   independently. The PBS is formed using an asymmetric multimode
   interference (MMI) section. The TM mode is directed to an output port by
   the ALIG waveguide, while the TE mode is coupled to the other output
   port via the multimode interferometer. Such a PBS has a very small

Abstract = {{Based on the results of the study of convex object motion(1) (J.
   Hopcroft and G. Wilfong, ``Motion of objects in contact,{''} Int. J.
   Robot. Res., 4(4), 32-46 (1986)), this paper addresses the problem of
   exact collision detection of a pair of scaled convex polyhedra in
   relative motion, and determines the contact conditions of tangential
   contact features, arbitrary relative motion involving translation and
   rotation, and uniform scaling of the objects about a fixed point. We
   propose a new concept of the decision curve based on analytical contact
   equations that characterize a continuum of scaling factors (or a single
   scaling factor), which ensures that a pair of objects undergoing a
   scaling transformation will maintain the same tangential contact feature
   pair (or make instantaneous tangential contact feature transitions). We
   propose a reliable simulation-based approach to construct the decision
   curve by hybridizing analytical contact equations and conventional
   collision detection method, called the Fast Collision Detection Method
   (FCDM). This method can determine whether two scaled objects will make
   contact at specific tangential contact features (vertices, edges, or
   faces) under particular uniform scaling factors and after distinctive
   relative motion with better accuracy and less computational time than
   the existing collision detection methods. Finally, we demonstrate our
   approach for solving motion design in simple assembly/disassembly
   problems.}},

Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{131-138}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we investigated the influence of nano-particle orientation
   in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell microporous layer (MPLs)
   on heat transfer behavior. In practical applications,
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is added as binding and hydrophobic
   agents to the MPL. However, the thermal conductivity of PTFE is
   significantly lower than that of carbon, and the impact of PTFE content
   on the thermal conductivity of the MPL has not been reported. In this
   work, we considered a phase-differentiated model with carbon, PTFE, and
   air as separate phases, and heat transfer was modeled through the
   nano-particles using Fourier's law of heat conduction. Particle
   separation was found to have the strongest impact on the thermal
   conductivity of the MPL. The thermal conductivity decreased by over 50\%
   when the particles were separated by 10 nm. The thermal conductivity was
   not largely impacted by particle radii, but the thermal conductivity
   increased by 8\% when the PTFE filling radius increased from 10 nm to 30
   nm. The same methodology was also used to calculate the electrical
   conductivity of the MPL. The increase in particle separation resulted in
   a linear decrease in the electrical conductivity, with a decrease of
   16.4\% when the particle separation increased from 0 nm to 10 nm.
   Introducing a fluid phase has an insignificant effect (less than 1\%) on
   the electrical conductivity, and the impact of changing the filling
   radii was also significantly less than for the case of thermal
   conductivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Predicting heavy oil/water relative permeability using modified
   Corey-based correlations}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{163}},
Pages = {{196-204}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the effect of various parameters such as operating
   temperature, crude oil viscosity, injection flow rate, and operating
   pressure on heavy oil/water relative permeability were investigated
   followed by proposing new correlations for calculating heavy oil/water
   relative permeability. The experimental results obtained in this study
   showed that both water and oil relative permeabilities are significantly
   temperature dependent and they increase when temperature increases. It
   was also found that relative permeability to oil and water increase with
   decrease in oil viscosity. Additionally, tests results indicated that
   increase in injection flow rate results in higher oil relative
   permeability and lower water relative permeability. Unsteady state core
   flooding experiments carried out at various operating pressures showed
   that the relative permeability to oil in heavy oil/water system is
   independent of operating pressure. The heavy oil/water relative
   permeability data obtained in this study was used to develop new heavy
   oil/water relative permeability correlations by modifying the original
   Corey's correlations. The comparative evaluation of the new correlations
   with the original Corey's correlations indicated significant improvement
   in both heavy oil and water relative permeability estimation.
   Statistical analysis of the results showed that the new correlations
   facilitate reliable calculation of heavy oil/water relative permeability
   values by decreasing the root mean square magnitude from 0.167 and 0.178
   to 0.004 and 0.061 for water and oil relative permeability,
   respectively. In addition, the accuracy of newly developed correlations
   was tested against five sets of experimental data obtained from
   literature. Results of this comparison also showed that heavy oil/water
   relative permeability predicted by new correlations is in better
   agreement with experimental data compared to those predicted by Corey's
   model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{359-370}},

Abstract = {{Recently the environmental impact of onshore wind farms is receiving
   major attention from both governments and wind farm designers. As land
   is more extensively exploited for wind farms, it is more likely for wind
   turbines to be in proximity with human dwellings, infrastructure (e.g.
   roads, transmission lines), and natural habitats (e.g. rivers, lakes,
   forests). This proximity makes significant portions of land unusable for
   the designers, introducing a set of land-use constraints. In this study,
   we conduct a constrained and continuous-variable multi-objective
   optimization that considers energy and noise as its objective functions,
   based on Jensen's wake model and the ISO-9613-2 noise standard. A
   stochastic evolutionary algorithm (NSGA-II) solves the optimization
   problem, while the land-use constraints are handled with static and
   dynamic penalty functions. Results of this study illustrate the effect
   of constraint severity and spatial distribution of unusable land on the
   trade-off between energy generation and noise production. (C) 2015

Journal = {{APPLIED ERGONOMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{275-284}},

Abstract = {{The incidence of stairway falls and related injuries remains
   persistently high; however, the risk of stair injuries could be reduced
   through improved stairway design. The current study investigated dynamic
   balance control during stair descent and the effects of varying the step
   geometry. Data were collected from 20 healthy young and 20 older adults
   as they descended three staircases (riser heights of 7, 7.5 and 8 inches
   (178, 190 and 203 mm, respectively)). At each riser height, the tread
   run length was varied between 8 and 14 inches (203 mm and 356 mm) in
   one-inch (25 mm) increments. Kinematic data provided measures of
   segmental and whole-body dynamic control. Results demonstrated that
   older adults had greater lateral tilt of the upper body than young
   adults, but actually had larger margins of stability than the young in
   the antero-posterior direction as a result of their slower cadence.
   Nonetheless, for both age groups, the longer run lengths were found to
   provide the largest margins of stability. In addition, increase in run
   length and decrease in riser height tended to reduce forward upper body
   tilt. These results help to explain the underlying biomechanical factors
   associated with increased risk of falls and the relationship with step
   geometry. Considering the importance of stair ambulation in maintaining
   independence and activity in the community, this study highlights the
   definite need for safer stair design standards to minimize the risk of
   falls and increase stair safety across the lifespan. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous reactions of trace atmospheric gases on solid surfaces
   play an important role in atmospheric chemistry. In this study, we
   investigate the reaction of NO2 with solid surfaces of TiO2 covered with
   a thin layer of an alumina-silica mixture over a range of different
   compositions. The reactions were conducted in the presence of oxygen
   under dark or ultraviolet light (UV) illumination conditions. The
   results show that coating TiO2 with alumina-silica greatly affects the
   formation of gas-phase products NO and N2O both with or without
   illumination using UV light. A thick shell of alumina silica enhances
   the formation of NO in the dark, whereas adding a small amount of
   alumina on the surface of rutile TiO2 significantly enhances the
   conversion of NO2 to NO under UV illumination. Overall rates of
   conversion (on the order of mg/m(2) paint/year) suggest that these
   materials shoud have negligible impact on NOx levels in the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) use physical ion
   adsorption in the capacitive electrical double layer of high specific
   surface area (SSA) materials to store electrical energy. Previous work
   shows that the SSA-normalized capacitance increases when pore diameters
   are less than 1 nm. However, there still remains uncertainty about the
   charge storage mechanism since the enhanced SSA-normalized capacitance
   is not observed in all microporous materials. In previous studies, the
   total specific surface area and the chemical composition of the
   electrode materials were not controlled. The current work is the first
   reported study that systematically compares the performance of activated
   carbon prepared from the same raw material, with similar chemical
   composition and specific surface area, but different pore size
   distributions. Preparing samples with similar SSAs, but different pores
   sizes is not straightforward since increasing pore diameters results in
   decreasing the SSA. This study observes that the microporous activated
   carbon has a higher SSA-normalized capacitance, 14.1 mu F cm(-2),
   compared to the mesoporous material, 12.4 mu f cm(-2). However, this
   enhanced SSA-normalized capacitance is only observed above a threshold
   operating voltage. Therefore, it can be concluded that a minimum applied
   voltage is required to induce ion adsorption in these sub-nanometer
   micropores, which increases the capacitance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The process of neurogenesis, through which the entire nervous system of
   an organism is formed, has attracted immense scientific attention for
   decades. How can a single neural stem cell give rise to astrocytes,

   choose between the hundreds of different neuronal subtypes that the
   vertebrate CNS contains? Traditionally, niche signals and transcription
   factors have been on the spotlight. Recent research is increasingly

Abstract = {{We studied the foaming behavior of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) and
   microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) composites in a batch process using
   supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) and water as co-blowing agents.
   In PVOH/MFC composites, water is an economical plasticizer. It not only
   suppresses the potential thermal degradation of PVOH but also extends
   the processing window. A uniform cell structure and a high cell density
   were achieved in the PVOH/MFC foams. The results showed that cell
   density was increased by increased water content. Further, the MFC
   contained both micro-and nano-sized fibers. These created numerous
   heterogeneous nucleation sites and caused local pressure variations.
   However, cell density decreased when the MFC was overdosed. Due to the
   high crystallinity that then developed around the MFC, the gas content
   was too low, and the stiffness was too high. The experimental results
   also showed that the cell morphology and density could both be
   controlled by the water and the MFC content. The effects of the foaming
   temperature and pressure on the cellular morphology of the PVOH/MFC
   composite foams were examined systematically. (C) 2015 Wiley

Title = {{Enhanced degradation of softwood versus hardwood by the white-rot fungus
   Pycnoporus coccineus}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: White-rot basidiomycete fungi are potent degraders of plant
   biomass, with the ability to mineralize all lignocellulose components.
   Recent comparative genomics studies showed that these fungi use a wide
   diversity of enzymes for wood degradation. Deeper functional analyses
   are however necessary to understand the enzymatic mechanisms leading to
   lignocellulose breakdown. The Polyporale fungus Pycnoporus coccineus
   BRFM310 grows well on both coniferous and deciduous wood. In the present
   study, we analyzed the early response of the fungus to softwood (pine)
   and hardwood (aspen) feedstocks and tested the effect of the secreted
   enzymes on lignocellulose deconstruction.
   Results: Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that P.
   coccineus grown separately on pine and aspen displayed similar sets of
   transcripts and enzymes implicated in lignin and polysaccharide
   degradation. In particular, the expression of lignin-targeting
   oxidoreductases, such as manganese peroxidases, increased upon
   cultivation on both woods. The sets of enzymes secreted during growth on
   both pine and aspen were more efficient in saccharide release from pine
   than from aspen, and characterization of the residual solids revealed
   polysaccharide conversion on both pine and aspen fiber surfaces.
   Conclusion: The combined analysis of soluble sugars and solid residues
   showed the suitability of P. coccineus secreted enzymes for softwood
   degradation. Analyses of solubilized products and residual surface
   chemistries of enzyme-treated wood samples pointed to differences in
   fiber penetration by different P. coccineus secretomes. Accordingly,
   beyond the variety of CAZymes identified in P. coccineus genome,
   transcriptome and secretome, we discuss several parameters such as the
   abundance of manganese peroxidases and the potential role of cytochrome
   P450s and pectin degradation on the efficacy of fungi for softwood
   conversion.}},

Abstract = {{In this effort, we examined the piezoelectric properties of the
   multi-walled boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), and the influence of the
   tube layer number on these properties using molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations. The results reveal that the piezoelectric coefficient is
   positive for BNNTs with odd numbers of layers but negative for those
   with even numbers of layers. For both, odd and even cases, the magnitude
   of the piezoelectric coefficient is found to decrease with increasing
   layer number of BNNTs. A simple continuum mechanics model is developed
   and reveals that the observed layer number-dependent piezoelectric
   coefficient of the multi-walled BNNTs mainly originates from their
   unique inversely stacked structure. In addition, integrating the
   continuum mechanics model with the MD data leads to an explicit
   expression for the piezoelectric coefficient of multi-walled BNNTs,
   which can be easily used to predict the piezoelectric coefficient of
   BNNTs with various layer numbers.}},

Abstract = {{In the mineralized bone matrix, mechanical loading causes
   micrometer-sized cracks. These cracks trigger targeted remodeling along
   the micro-crack. Physical damage to osteocytes was shown to be involved
   in the initiation of this remodeling process. However, the role of
   subsequent mechanical loading osteocyte response to physical damage is
   unclear. In this study, we have designed and developed an in vitro cell
   model to study the impact of mechanical loading on osteocytes with
   physical damage. Specifically, a system was developed to create
   sub-cellular physical damage on MLO-Y4 osteocytes in vitro. This model
   re-created the spatial distribution of non-viable cells and VEGF
   expression around microdamage as reported in vivo. Using this system,
   the short term (24 h) effects of fluid shear stress in regulation of
   osteocyte response to physical damage were investigated. We have
   observed that the mechanical stimuli had an additive effect in terms of
   COX-2, VEGF mRNA expressions, as well as PGE(2), VEGF concentrations in
   the media. Interestingly, other inflammatory signals such as IL-6 and
   TNE-alpha did not change with these stimuli, at this time point.
   Moreover, fluid shear also had a modulating effect in regulation of
   osteoclast differentiation by osteocyte with physical damage. These
   results show that (1) subcellular physical damage upregulates remodeling
   signals in osteocytes at early time point, (2) mechanical loading
   substantially upregulates these signals for remodeling in osteocytes
   with physical damage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Optimizing the turbine layout in a wind farm is crucial to minimize wake
   interactions between turbines, which can lead to a significant reduction
   in power generation. This work is motivated by the need to develop wake
   interaction models that can accurately capture the wake losses in an
   array of wind turbines, while remaining computationally tractable for
   layout optimization studies. Among existing wake interaction models, the
   SS (sum of squares) model has been reported to be the most accurate.
   However, the SS model is unsuitable for wind farm layout optimization
   using mathematical programming methods, as it leads to non-linear
   objective functions. Hence, previous work has relied on approximated
   power calculations for optimization studies. In this work, we propose a
   mechanistic linear model for wake interactions based on energy balance,
   with coefficients determined based on publicly available data from the
   Horns Rev wind farm. A series of numerical experiments was conducted to
   assess the performance of the wake interaction model. Results show that
   the proposed model is compatible with standard mathematical programming
   methods, and resulted in turbine layouts with higher energy production
   than those found using previous work. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the nuclear industry, the equivalent-linear frequency domain analysis
   method has been the de facto standard procedure primarily due to the
   method's computational efficiency. This study explores the feasibility
   of applying the nonlinear time domain analysis method for the soil
   structure-interaction analysis of nuclear power facilities. As a first
   step, the equivalency of the time and frequency domain analysis methods
   is verified through a site response analysis of one-dimensional soil, a
   dynamic impedance analysis of soil foundation system, and a seismic
   response analysis of the entire soil structure system. For the
   verifications, an idealized elastic soil structure system is used to
   minimize variables in the comparison of the two methods. Then, the
   verified analysis methods are used to develop time and frequency domain
   models of Hualien Large-Scale Seismic Test. The predicted structural
   responses are compared against field measurements. The models are also
   analyzed with an amplified ground motion to evaluate discrepancies of
   the time and frequency domain analysis methods when the soil structure
   system behaves beyond the elastic range. The analysis results show that
   the equivalent-linear frequency domain analysis method amplifies certain
   frequency bands and tends to result in higher structural acceleration
   than the nonlinear time domain analysis method. A comparison with field
   measurements shows that the nonlinear time domain analysis method better
   captures the frequency distribution of recorded structural responses
   than the frequency domain analysis method. However, the time domain
   analysis method requires significantly larger modeling efforts and
   computing time than the equivalent linear frequency domain analysis
   method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of entrained air in abrasive water jet micro-machining: Reduction
   of channel width and waviness using slurry entrainment}},
Journal = {{WEAR}},

Abstract = {{The erosion produced by abrasive water jets is a result of the complex
   interaction of the three-phase jet (water-air-abrasive) and the target.
   The objective of the present work was to isolate the effect of the
   entrained air in abrasive water jet micro-machining (AWJM) by comparing
   milled surfaces made by AWJM with those produced by high-pressure slurry
   jet micro-machining (HASJM) while maintaining a constant particle
   velocity. An existing model developed for abrasive particle velocities
   in AWJM was modified and used to predict the particle velocity in HASJM,
   and then verified using a double disc apparatus (DDA). The model allowed
   prediction of the conditions required to achieve average particle
   velocities of similar to 255 m/s using the two systems with the same 38
   mu m garnet particles. Under this condition of equal particle velocity,
   there was a very large reduction in the centerline waviness, W-a, of
   microchannels made in SS316L and A160661-T6 using HASJM; typically 3.4
   times smaller waviness than found in channels made with AWJM using the
   same dose of particles. This was found to be mainly due to the much
   larger variation in abrasive flow rate in AWJM brought about by the
   air/particle entrainment system, rather than any fundamental change in
   erosion mechanism due to the impact of the non-homogeneous three phase
   air/particle/water in AWJM. The centerline roughness, R-a, was
   approximately the same in both processes at a traverse velocity of V-t =
   4572 mm/min and a nozzle angle of 90 degrees. For both processes, Wa and
   Ra increased with an increase in pressure and abrasive particle dose,
   and decreased with an increase in nozzle angle. For micro-channels of a
   given depth, the widths of those made with HASJM were 26\% narrower than
   those produced with AWJM, mainly due to the wider jet that resulted from
   the entrained air in AWJM, again at the same particle velocity. The
   erosion rate in HASJM was found to be about 27\% lower mainly because of
   a smaller width of micro-channels in HASJM. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   of FWs, which led to beams endowed with a static envelope, through a
   dynamic modeling of the FWs whose shape is now allowed to evolve in time
   in a predetermined way. Further, we experimentally create such dynamic
   FWs (DFWs) in optics via a computational holographic technique and a
   spatial light modulator. Experimental results are presented here for two
   cases of DFWs, one of zeroth order and the other of higher order, the
   latter being the most interesting exhibiting a cylindrical surface of
   light whose geometry changes in space and time. (C) 2015 Optical Society

Abstract = {{Two-directional (2D) variants of the linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
   algorithin have been widely used to extract features of matrix-variate
   signals. This paper derives the theoretical relationship between 2DLDA
   and one-directional (1D) LDA based on the separable transformation
   framework. Separable transforms such as separable 2DDCT are widely used
   for image compression in the JPEG standard; therefore, a similar
   framework for 2DLDA provides the corresponding parallel foundation for
   separable image feature extraction. There are existing 2DLDA methods
   providing a separable transformation, however they are not directly
   related to the 1DLDA solution. We will derive a 2DLDA method as a
   matrix-variate representation of a separable 1DLDA operator.
   Furthermore, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for
   separability of 1DLDA. These conditions will be helpful to clarify both
   limitations and advantages of 2DLDA. Also, a 2DLDA framework in parallel
   to 2DDCT allows us to exploit related techniques developed for 2DDCT,
   such as the feature selection procedure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and synchrotron X-ray

   studying the relationship between the presence of liquid water and cell
   performance. X-ray radiography was used to quantify liquid water in the
   anode and cathode fibrous carbon paper substrate and microporous layer
   (MPL). EIS was used as a complementary diagnostic tool to quantify the
   equivalent resistances of the fuel cell. Two fuel cell cases with
   varying MPL thicknesses were compared under constant current density
   operation. The fuel cell with a 150 mu m-thick MPL resulted in an
   equivalent mass transport resistance that was 13\% lower than the fuel
   cell with a 100 mu m-thick MPL. This notable difference in mass
   transport resistance was attributed to the smaller quantity of liquid
   water in the cathode substrate, particularly in the transition region
   between the MPL and carbon paper. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy

Title = {{Atypical sympathetic arousal in children with autism spectrum disorder
   and its association with anxiety symptomatology}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR AUTISM}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been associated with
   autonomic atypicalities, although the nature of these differences
   remains largely unknown. Moreover, existing literature suggests large
   variability in autonomic function in ASD, motivating the need to examine
   the existence of subgroups that exhibit more homogeneous autonomic
   features.
   Methods: Electrodermal activity (EDA), a non-invasive physiological
   indicator of autonomic activity, was measured in typically developing
   children (n = 33) and those with ASD (n = 38) as participants performed
   tasks that elicit anxiety, attention, response inhibition, and social
   cognition processes. The ASD group was divided into low-(n = 18) and
   high-anxiety (n = 20) participants, and the groups were compared to mean
   EDA level and electrodermal reactions frequency (EDR).
   Results: The ASD group had a significantly blunted mean EDA response to
   the anxiety tasks (p < 0.004). The EDR response to all tasks, except
   response inhibition, was also blunted in the ASD group (p < 0.04). For
   this group, EDR frequency during the anxiety and social cognition tasks
   was negatively correlated with behavioral scores in the domains that
   were probed by each task (p < 0.002). The high-anxiety ASD group showed
   significantly decreased mean EDA compared to both the low-anxiety ASD
   group (p = 0.02) and the typically developing control group (p = 0.04).
   The high-anxiety ASD group also had significantly more severe symptoms
   than the low-anxiety ASD group on domains related to anxiety, attention,
   rule breaking, aggression, obsessions and compulsions, and depression.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest atypical autonomic function in children
   with ASD, specifically with respect to sympathetic activity. Moreover,
   anxiety symptomatology defined subgroups with distinct physiological and
   behavioral profiles. Overall, the results add to the body of literature
   supporting autonomic dysfunction in ASD and highlight the role of
   anxiety and autonomic features in explaining the variability in the
   autism spectrum.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{46}},

Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{A big challenge in cell culture is the non-natural environment in which
   cells are routinely screened, making in vivo phenomena, such as cell
   invasion, difficult to understand and predict. To study cancer cell
   invasion, extracellular matrix (ECM) analogs with decoupled mechanical
   and chemical properties are required. Hyaluronic acid ( HA)-based
   hydrogels crosslinked with matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP)-cleavable
   peptides are developed to study MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell invasion.
   Hydrogels are synthesized by reacting furan-modified HA with
   bismaleimide peptide crosslinkers in a Diels-Alder click reaction. This
   new hydrogel takes advantage of the biomimetic properties of HA, which
   is overexpressed in breast cancer, and eliminates the use of nonadhesive
   crosslinkers, such as poly( ethylene glycol) ( PEG). The crosslink (
   mechanical) and ligand ( chemical) densities are varied independently to
   evaluate the effects of each parameter on cell migration. Increased
   crosslink density correlates with decreased MDA-MB- -231 cell invasion
   whereas incorporation of MMP-cleavable sequences within the peptide
   crosslinker enhances invasion. Increasing the ligand density of pendant
   GRGDS groups induces cell proliferation, but has no significant impact
   on invasion. By independently tuning the mechanical and chemical
   environment of ECM mimetic hydrogels, a platform is provided that
   recapitulates variable tissue properties and elucidates the role of the
   microenvironment in cancer cell invasion.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate flow-directed production of nanoparticles of the
   photoresponsive block copolymer poly(o-nitrobenzyl
   acrylate)-b-polydimethylacrylamide in a gas-liquid microfluidic reactor.
   Microfluidic formation produced a variety of morphologies dependent on
   flow rate, with spheres and short cylinders, then large compound
   micelles, then unique spooled cylinders appearing as flow rate
   increased. The higher excess free energy of spooled cylinders relative
   to the quiescent equilibrium state is evidenced by their faster off-chip
   relaxation times (similar to 1 day) as compared to other flow-directed
   structures. Comparison of light-triggered dissociation of flow-directed
   nanoparticles prepared at two different flow rates shows faster
   disruption of nanoparticles prepared at the higher flow rate. The

Title = {{Moisture parameters and fungal communities associated with gypsum
   drywall in buildings}},
Journal = {{MICROBIOME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Uncontrolled excess moisture in buildings is a common problem that can
   lead to changes in fungal communities. In buildings, moisture parameters
   can be classified by location and include assessments of moisture in the
   air, at a surface, or within a material. These parameters are not
   equivalent in dynamic indoor environments, which makes moisture-induced
   fungal growth in buildings a complex occurrence. In order to determine
   the circumstances that lead to such growth, it is essential to have a
   thorough understanding of in situ moisture measurement, the influence of
   building factors on moisture parameters, and the levels of these
   moisture parameters that lead to indoor fungal growth. Currently, there
   are disagreements in the literature on this topic. A literature review
   was conducted specifically on moisture-induced fungal growth on gypsum
   drywall. This review revealed that there is no consistent measurement
   approach used to characterize moisture in laboratory and field studies,
   with relative humidity measurements being most common. Additionally,
   many studies identify a critical moisture value, below which fungal
   growth will not occur. The values defined by relative humidity
   encompassed the largest range, while those defined by moisture content
   exhibited the highest variation. Critical values defined by equilibrium
   relative humidity were most consistent, and this is likely due to
   equilibrium relative humidity being the most relevant moisture parameter
   to microbial growth, since it is a reasonable measure of moisture
   available at surfaces, where fungi often proliferate. Several sources
   concur that surface moisture, particularly liquid water, is the
   prominent factor influencing microbial changes and that moisture in the
   air and within a material are of lesser importance. However, even if
   surface moisture is assessed, a single critical moisture level to
   prevent fungal growth cannot be defined, due to a number of factors,
   including variations in fungal genera and/or species, temperature, and
   nutrient availability. Despite these complexities, meaningful
   measurements can still be made to inform fungal growth by making
   localised, long-term, and continuous measurements of surface moisture.
   Such an approach will capture variations in a material's surface
   moisture, which could provide insight on a number of conditions that
   could lead to fungal proliferation.}},

Abstract = {{W-state is an important resource for many quantum information processing
   tasks. In this paper, we for the first time propose a multi-party
   measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD)
   protocol based on W-state. With linear optics, we design a W-state
   analyzer in order to distinguish the four-qubit W-state. This analyzer
   constructs the measurement device for four-party MDI-QKD. Moreover, we
   derived a complete security proof of the four-party MDI-QKD, and
   performed a numerical simulation to study its performance. The results
   show that four-party MDI-QKD is feasible over 150 km standard telecom
   fiber with off-the-shelf single photon detectors. This work takes an
   important step towards multi-party quantum communication and a quantum

Abstract = {{Advances in precision microirradiators for small animal radiation
   oncology studies have provided the framework for novel translational
   radiobiological studies. Such systems target radiation fields at the
   scale required for small animal investigations, typically through a
   combination of on-board computed tomography image guidance and fixed,
   interchangeable collimators. Robust targeting accuracy of these
   radiation fields remains challenging, particularly at the millimetre
   scale field sizes achievable by the majority of microirradiators.
   Consistent and reproducible targeting accuracy is further hindered as
   collimators are removed and inserted during a typical experimental
   workflow. This investigation quantified this targeting uncertainty and
   developed an online method based on a virtual treatment isocenter to
   actively ensure high performance targeting accuracy for all radiation
   field sizes. The results indicated that the two-dimensional field
   placement uncertainty was as high as 1.16 mm at isocenter, with
   simulations suggesting this error could be reduced to 0.20 mm using the
   online correction method. End-to-end targeting analysis of a ball
   bearing target on radiochromic film sections showed an improved
   targeting accuracy with the three-dimensional vector targeting error
   across six different collimators reduced from 0.56 +/- 0.05 mm (mean +/-
   SD) to 0.05 +/- 0.05 mm for an isotropic imaging voxel size of 0.1 mm.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, two different rapid solidification techniques; vacuum
   plasma spraying and vacuum copper boat induction melting, were performed
   to synthesize Ti0.72Zr0.28Mn1.6V0.4 hydrogen storage alloy. The
   structure and electrochemical properties of the produced samples were
   comparatively investigated. The chemical and phase compositions of the
   samples were characterized by XRD and SEM analysis. The electrochemical
   hydrogen storage characteristics including the cyclic stability, the
   maximum discharge capacity, the high rate dischargeability, and the
   electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured. Results indicated
   that both samples consisted of a hexagonal C14 Laves phase matrix and a
   body centered cubic (BCC) structure of V-based solid solution phase. The
   electrochemical results showed that in the alloy prepared by induction
   melting, the maximum discharge capacity was higher, while the cyclic
   stability of the vacuum plasma sprayed sample was much better. These
   results were attributed to the quantity and distribution of the presence
   phases and the anti-corrosion performance of the alloys. Moreover, the
   results from the electrochemical kinetic experiments showed that the
   vacuum plasma sprayed sample had superior kinetic parameters, including
   the hydrogen diffusion rate and charge-transfer resistance, than that
   for the vacuum induction melted sample. Thus, vacuum plasma spraying
   could be an efficient production method for preparation of hydrogen
   storage alloys with improved properties which could be used for Ni-MH
   secondary batteries as negative electrodes. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen
