Abstract = {{Rapid urbanization, climate change and energy security warrant a more
   detailed understanding of how cities today consume energy. Agent-based,
   integrated microsimulation models of urban systems provide an excellent
   platform to accomplish this task, as they can capture both the short-
   and long-term decisions of firms and households which directly affect
   urban energy consumption. This paper presents the current effort towards
   developing an urban energy model for the Integrated Land Use,
   Transportation, Environment (ILUTE) modelling system.
   As a first step, a model for the residential space heating system
   evolution of the Greater Toronto-Hamilton Area was developed. A
   bottom-up approach, where individual uses are aggregated, was then
   employed to estimate the region's space heating demand. Conventional
   bottom-up methodologies often suffer from insensitivity to either
   technological or behavioral factors. It is argued that coupling a
   discrete choice model with building energy simulation software solves
   this problem. A joint logit model of heating fuel and equipment choice
   was developed and estimated using Toronto household microdata. The
   HOT2000 software was then used to compute individual dwelling unit space
   heating use. The entire residential energy analysis was performed in
   tandem with the housing market and demographic evolution processes. This
   allows the endogenous formation of the required inputs as well as
   adherence to the core ILUTE framework of integrated modelling.
   This residential space heating model is a first step towards a
   comprehensive urban energy end-use model. Further steps include
   developing similar models for other residential end-uses, such
   electricity and hot water consumption, as well as extensions to the
   commercial and transportation sectors. The entire effort aims to
   introduce an alternate methodology to modelling urban energy consumption
   that takes advantage of agent-based microsimulation to enhance and
   address issues with current approaches. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper describes the first fundamental frequency single-chip
   transceiver operating at D-band. The low-IF monostatic transceiver
   integrates on a single chip two 120-GHz voltage-controlled oscillators
   (VCOs), a 120-GHz divide-by-64 chain, two in-phase/quadrature (IQ)
   receivers with phase-calibration circuitry, a variable gain transmit
   amplifier, an antenna directional coupler, a patch antenna, bias
   circuitry, a transmit power detector, and a temperature sensor. A quartz
   antenna resonator with 6-dBi gain and simulated 50\% efficiency is
   placed directly above the on-chip patch to transmit and receive the
   120-GHz signals. The circuit with the above-integrated-circuit antenna
   occupies an area of 2.2 mm x 2.6 mm, consumes 900 mW from 1.2- and 1.8-V
   supplies, and was wire-bonded in an open-lid 7 mm 7 mm quad-flat
   no-leads package. Some transceiver performance parameters were
   characterized on the packaged chip, mounted on an evaluation board,
   while others, such as receiver noise figure and VCO phase noise at the
   120-GHz output were measured on circuit breakouts. The AMOS-varactor
   VCOs have a typical phase noise of 100 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset and a
   tuning range of 115.2-123.9 GHz. The receiver gain and the transmitter
   output power are each adjustable over a range of 15 dB with a maximum
   transmitter output power of 3.6 dBm. The receiver IQ phase difference,
   measured at the IF outputs of the packaged transceiver, is adjustable
   from 70 degrees to 110 degrees, while the amplitude imbalance remains
   less than 1 dB. The receiver breakout gain and double-sideband noise
   figure are 10.5-13 and 10.5-11.5 dB, respectively, with an input
   compression point of -20.5 dBm. Several experiments were conducted
   through the air over distances of up to 2.1 m with a focusing lens
   placed above the packaged chip.}},

Abstract = {{A D-band SiGe HBT total power radiometer is reported with a peak
   responsivity of 28 MV/W, a noise equivalent power (NEP) of 14-18
   fW/Hz(1/2), and a temperature resolution better than 0.35 K for an
   integration time of 3.125 ms. The 1/f noise corner of the radiometer is
   lower than 200 Hz. Fabricated in a developmental technology with 270-GHz
   f(T) and 330-GHz f(MAX), it includes a five-stage low-noise amplifier
   (LNA) with 4-7-GHz bandwidth and over 35 dB of gain centered at 165 GHz,
   along with a square-law detector with an NEP below 6 pW/Hz(1/2) up to
   170 GHz. An average system noise temperature of 1645 K is obtained using
   the Y-factor method and a noise bandwidth of 10 GHz calculated from the
   measured S21(f) characteristics of the radiometer. The reduced 1/f noise
   corner frequency in the presence of the amplifier, compared to that of
   the detector, appears to indicate that, unlike in III-V radiometers, LNA
   gain fluctuations are not a problem in SiGe HBT radiometers. The circuit
   consumes 95 mW and occupies 765 x 490 mu m(2). Wafer mapping of the
   radiometer sensitivity and of the amplifier gain was performed across
   different process splits. The mapping results demonstrate that the
   radiometer can be employed as a relatively simple and area-efficient
   transistor noise-measure monitor, useful in SiGe HBT vertical profile
   optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogels are networks of hydrophilic polymer chains that are swollen
   with water, and they are useful for a wide range of applications because
   they provide stable niches for immobilizing proteins and cells. We
   report here the marriage of hydrogels with digital microfluidic devices.
   Until recently, digital microfluidics, a fluid handling technique in
   which discrete droplets are manipulated electromechanically on the
   surface of an array of electrodes, has been used only for homogeneous
   systems involving liquid reagents. Here, we demonstrate for the first
   time that the cylindrical hydrogel discs can be incorporated into
   digital microfluidic systems and that these discs can be systematically
   addressed by droplets of reagents. Droplet movement is observed to be
   unimpeded by interaction with the gel discs, and gel discs remain
   stationary when droplets pass through them. Analyte transport into gel
   discs is observed to be identical to diffusion in cases in which
   droplets are incubated with gels passively, but transport is enhanced
   when droplets are continually actuated through the gels. The system is
   useful for generating integrated enzymatic microreactors and for
   three-dimensional cell culture. This paper demonstrates a new
   combination of techniques for lab-on-a-chip systems which we propose
   will be useful for a wide range of applications. (C) 2012 American

Title = {{Development of a Robust Stereo-PIV System for 3-D Soil Deformation

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust stereo-particle image velocimetry
   (Stereo-Ply) system developed for three-dimensional (3-D) soil
   deformation measurement in geotechnical engineering. Also known as
   digital image correlation, PIV is a popular image processing technique
   to measure two-dimensional (2-D) fluid velocity in fluid dynamics. The
   Stereo-PIV technique extends 2-D deformation measurement to 3-D based on
   a binocular vision model, where two cameras with a well posed
   geometrical setting, are utilized to image the same object. Although
   commercial Stereo-PIV systems are available in the market, the
   applications of this technique are still limited by their high cost and
   special hardware requirements. This study presents a robust Stereo-PIV
   system, which utilizes two standard complementary metal oxide
   semiconductor (CMOS) cameras and two open software packages to apply
   this technique to geotechnical engineering testing.
   In order to apply this technique, three steps have to be performed: the
   first step is the calibration for the system to get the parameters of
   the two cameras with respect to the region of interest (ROI); the second
   step is to obtain a series of paired images of the ROI during
   deformation and calculate the corresponding 2-D displacement fields from
   these images; and the last step is to construct a 3-D displacement field
   based on the camera parameters calculated in the first step and the
   corresponding 2-D displacement vector pairs from the second step.
   The developed system is applied in a model test to measure 3-D sand
   deformation around a laterally loaded pile. The results demonstrate that
   the system can obtain a reasonable result and can be readily adjusted
   for more advanced 3-D deformation measurement in geotechnical
   engineering research.}},

Journal = {{NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Peptide recognition domains and transcription factors play crucial roles
   in cellular signaling. They bind linear stretches of amino acids or
   nucleotides, respectively, with high specificity. Experimental
   techniques that assess the binding specificity of these domains, such as
   microarrays or phage display, can retrieve thousands of distinct
   ligands, providing detailed insight into binding specificity. In
   particular, the advent of next-generation sequencing has recently
   increased the throughput of such methods by several orders of magnitude.
   These advances have helped reveal the presence of distinct binding
   specificity classes that co-exist within a set of ligands interacting
   with the same target. Here, we introduce a software system called MUSI
   that can rapidly analyze very large data sets of binding sequences to
   determine the relevant binding specificity patterns. Our pipeline
   provides two major advances. First, it can detect previously
   unrecognized multiple specificity patterns in any data set. Second, it
   offers integrated processing of very large data sets from
   next-generation sequencing machines. The results are visualized as
   multiple sequence logos describing the different binding preferences of
   the protein under investigation. We demonstrate the performance of MUSI
   by analyzing recent phage display data for human SH3 domains as well as
   microarray data for mouse transcription factors.}},

Abstract = {{To identify a lead skeleton structure for optimization of
   scyllo-inositol-based inhibitors of amyloid-beta peptide (A beta)
   aggregation, we have synthesized aldoxime, hydroxamate, carbamate, and
   amide linked scyllo-inositol derivatives. These structures represent
   backbones that can be readily expanded into a wide array of derivatives.
   They also provide conservative modifications of the scyllo-inositol
   backbone, as they maintain the display of the equatorial polar atoms,
   preserving the stereochemical requirement necessary for maximum
   inhibition of A beta(142) fiber formation. In addition, a reliable work
   plan for screening derivatives was developed in order to preferentially
   identify a backbone(s) structure that prevents fibrillogenesis and
   stabilizes nontoxic small molecular weight oligomers, as we have
   previously reported for scyllo-inositol. In the present studies, we have
   adapted a high throughput ELISA-based oligomerization assay followed by
   atomic force microscopy to validate the results screen compounds. The
   lead compounds were then tested for toxicity and ability to rescue A
   beta(1-42) induced toxicity in vitro and the affinity of the compounds
   for A beta(142) compared by mass spectrometry. The data to suggest that
   compounds must maintain a planar conformation to exhibit activity
   similar to scyllo-inositol and that the oxime derivative represents the
   lead backbone for future development}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the diurnal, seasonal and annual variation of
   ultrafine particles (UFP) in a large city. Particle number (PN)
   concentrations were measured in Toronto, Canada on a major arterial
   roadway between March 2006 and May 2011 using a Fast Mobility Particle
   Sizer. The PN in the size range of 8-300 nm decreased during the
   measurement period primarily due to changes in the vehicle fleet. PN50
   (particles with diameters less than 50 nm) decreased by 21\% between
   2006 and 2010. Notably, the majority of the reduction occurred during
   the winter months. PN50 exhibited the strongest seasonality and diurnal
   trend. PN50-100 (particles between 50 and 100 nm) and PN100-300
   (particles between 100 and 300 nm) decreased by 17\% and 24\%,
   respectively. Correlation analysis between gas phase criteria pollutants
   showed good correlation between PN50-100 and NO2, SO2, and PM2.5. In
   contrast, PN50 exhibited the highest correlation with temperature, NO
   and NO2. A multiple linear regression model was developed for each size
   fraction. The model adequately explained the annual, seasonal and
   day-to-day variability of PN50-100 (R-2 = 0.64) and PN100-300 (R-2 =
   0.83). The model captured the annual and seasonal variability of PN50
   but only partially explained the day-to-day variability (R-2 = 0.52).
   The long-term reductions in PN50 indicate that policy interventions are
   having some success in slowly decreasing UFT, concentrations in Toronto.

Abstract = {{Trigger-inducible transcription-control devices that reversibly

   When designed for use in future geneand cell-based therapies the trigger

   Caulobacter crescentus to metabolize vanillic acid originating from
   lignin degradation that occurs in its oligotrophic freshwater habitat,
   we have designed synthetic devices that specifically adjust transgene
   expression in mammalian cells when exposed to vanillic acid. Even in
   mice transgene expression was robust, precise and tunable in response to
   vanillic acid. As a licensed food additive that is regularly consumed by
   humans via flavoured convenience food and specific fresh vegetable and

Abstract = {{Drug delivery to the brain is challenging because systemic delivery
   requires high doses to achieve diffusion across the blood-brain barrier
   and often results in systemic toxicity. Intracerebroventricular
   implantation of a minipump/catheter system provides local delivery, yet
   results in brain tissue damage and can be prone to infection. An
   alternate local delivery strategy, epi-cortical delivery, releases the
   biomolecule directly to the brain while causing minimal tissue
   disruption. We pursued this strategy with a hyaluronan/methyl cellulose
   (HAMC) hydrogel for the local release of erythropoietin to induce
   endogenous neural stem and progenitor cells of the subventricular zone
   to promote repair after stroke injury in the mouse brain. Erythropoeitin
   promotes neurogenesis when delivered intraventricularly, thereby making
   it an ideal biomolecule with which to test this new epi-cortical
   delivery strategy. We investigated HAMC in terms of the host tissue
   response and the diffusion of erythropoeitin therefrom in the
   stroke-injured brain for neural repair. Erythropoietin delivered from
   HAMC at 4 and 11 days post-stroke resulted in attenuated inflammatory
   response, reduced stroke cavity size, increased number of both neurons
   in the pen-infarct region and migratory neuroblasts in the
   subventricular zone, and decreased apoptosis in both the subventricular
   zone and the injured cortex. We demonstrate that HAMC-mediated
   epi-cortical administration is promising for minimally invasive delivery
   of erythropoeitin to the brain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Recent advancements in phase-matching second-order nonlinear processes
   by using matching-layer-enhanced Bragg reflection waveguides (ML-BRWs)
   in AlxGa1-xAs material system are discussed. The limitations on the
   choice of the AlxGa1-xAs layers for applications that require high pump
   power operation are highlighted. Multilayer-core ML-BRWs are proposed as
   a new waveguide design with relaxed constraints over the choice of the
   AlxGa1-xAs layers composition. The tradeoffs associated with material
   bandgap on the efficiency of second-order nonlinear processes are
   examined by using this novel structure. The interplay among the various
   factors, including the nonlinear overlap factor, the effective
   second-order nonlinearity, and the third-order nonlinear effects result
   in the presence of an optimum detuning of the core bandgap from the
   operating wavelength for maximum conversion efficiency. Two different
   wafer structures are examined by using second-harmonic generation to
   elucidate these tradeoffs. The conversion efficiency is examined by
   using 30-ps, 2-ps, and 250-fs pulses at various pump average power
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose to improve the range resolution in a
   conventional radar system by employing a superoscillatory pulse as the
   radar pulse. A superoscillatory waveform is a waveform which contains,
   across a finite time interval, faster variations than its highest
   constituent frequency component. As such, radar imaging using a
   superoscillatory pulse allows one to detect an object with a range
   resolution improved beyond a fundamental bandwidth limitation. In this
   work, we experimentally compare the radar resolution performance of a
   500 MHz superoscillatory pulse with that of a sinc pulse of the same
   bandwidth, and demonstrate that the superoscillatory pulse reduces
   distance uncertainty by 36\%. We also suggest future directions of
   development to our proposed radar system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the automation of a parallel microassembly process
   for the construction of out-of-plane microstructures. Images from two
   vision systems were utilized to automate the grasping and the insertion
   of three microparts simultaneously. A modified microgripper design and
   guiding beams were introduced to minimize the possible shift of the
   micropart and their effectiveness was confirmed experimentally. Parallel
   microassembly experiments were conducted with success rates of 93\% and
   61\% for the automatic grasping and insertion, respectively. Orientation
   shifting, experienced by the microparts during the fracture of the
   supporting tethers, is the suspected cause of failure.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of new interventions targeted at both acute and chronic
   spinal cord injury (SCI), it is critical that techniques and protocols
   are developed that reliably evaluate changes in upper limb
   impairment/function. The Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength
   Sensibility and Prehension (GRASSP) protocol, which includes five
   subtests, is a quantitative clinical upper limb impairment measure
   designed for use in acute and chronic cervical SCI. The objectives of
   this study were to: (1) establish the inter-rater and test-retest
   reliability, and (2) establish the construct and concurrent validity
   with the International Standards of Neurological Classification of
   Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI), Spinal Cord Independence Measure II
   (SCIM), and the Capabilities of Upper Extremity Questionnaire (CUE). The
   study protocol included repeated administration of the GRASSP to a
   cross-section of individuals with tetraplegia who were neurologically
   stable (n = 72). ISNCSCI, CUE, and SCIM assessments were also
   administered. Two assessors examined the individuals over a 7-day
   period. Reliability was tested with intra-class correlation
   coefficients; construct validity was established with
   agreement/discordance analysis between the GRASSP and ISNCSCI sensory
   and motor items; and concurrent validity was tested with Spearman
   correlation coefficients. Inter-rater and test-retest reliability for
   all subtests within the GRASSP were above the hypothesized value of 0.80
   (0.84-0.96 and 0.86-0.98, respectively). The GRASSP is about 50\% more
   sensitive (construct validity) than the ISNCSCI when defining sensory
   and motor integrity of the upper limb; the subtests showed concurrence
   with the SCIM, SCIM self-care subscale, and CUE. The strongest
   concurrence to impairment was with self-perception of function (CUE)
   (0.57-0.83, p < 0.0001). The GRASSP was found to demonstrate
   reliability, construct validity, and concurrent validity for use as a
   standardized upper limb impairment measure for individuals with
   tetraplegia.}},

Title = {{Zebra mussel adhesion: Structure of the byssal adhesive apparatus in the

Abstract = {{The freshwater zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) owes a large part of
   its success as an invasive species to its ability to attach to a wide
   variety of substrates. As in marine mussels, this attachment is achieved
   by a proteinaceous byssus, a series of threads joined at a stem that
   connect the mussel to adhesive plaques secreted onto the substrate.
   Although the zebra mussel byssus is superficially similar to marine
   mussels, significant structural and compositional differences suggest
   that further investigation of the adhesion mechanisms in this freshwater
   species is warranted. Here we present an ultrastructural examination of
   the zebra mussel byssus, with emphasis on interfaces that are critical
   to its adhesive function. By examining the attached plaques, we show
   that adhesion is mediated by a uniform electron dense layer on the
   underside of the plaque. This layer is only 10-20 nm thick and makes
   direct and continuous contact with the substrate. The plaque itself is
   fibrous, and curiously can exhibit either a dense or porous morphology.
   In zebra mussels, a graded interface between the animal and the
   substrate mussels is achieved by interdigitation of uniform threads with
   the stem, in contrast to marine mussels, where the threads themselves
   are non-uniform. Our observations of several novel aspects of zebra
   mussel byssal ultrastructure may have important implications not only
   for preventing biofouling by the zebra mussel, but for the development
   of new bioadhesives as well. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Mechanism of extensional stress-induced cell formation in polymeric
   foaming processes with the presence of nucleating agents}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{187-198}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Addition of nucleating agents (e.g., talc) is a common way to promote
   the cell density in polymeric foaming process. It is widely believed
   that such enhancement is caused by the decrease in free energy barrier
   for the nucleation to initiate heterogeneously as well as the reduction
   in gas loss with the existence of the inorganic fillers. In this paper,
   in situ visualization of the cell formation phenomena during polymeric
   foaming processes of polystyrene-talc composites blown with carbon
   dioxide revealed that the expansion of nucleated cells triggered the
   formation of secondary cells around them. Subsequently, the expansion of
   the secondary cells also promoted the formation of tertiary cells around
   them similar to a chain reaction. These observations provided evidences
   to support the theoretical simulation of stress-induced cell formation
   around expanding bubbles. A series of parametric studies were conducted
   to correlate the stress-induced cell formation and various processing
   and material parameters. The elucidation of the aforementioned cell
   formation mechanism with the presence of nucleating agents would provide
   additional guidelines for polymeric foam manufacturers to control the
   cell morphologies of their products in order to optimize and tailor the
   desired physical properties. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Study design: Multi-center pilot study.
   Objectives: To investigate the use of an upper limb robotic
   rehabilitation device (Armeo Spring, Hocoma AG, Switzerland) in a
   subacute cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) population.
   Setting: Two Canadian inpatient rehabilitation centers.
   Methods: Twelve subjects (motor level C4-C6, ASIA Impairment Scale A-D)
   completed the training, which consisted of 16.1 +/- 4.6 sessions over
   5.2 +/- 1.4 weeks. Two types of outcomes were recorded: (1) feasibility
   of incorporating the device into an inpatient rehabilitation program
   (compliance with training schedule, reduction in therapist time required
   and subject questionnaires) and (2) efficacy of the robotic
   rehabilitation for improving functional outcomes (Graded and Redefined
   Assessment of Strength, Sensibility and Prehension (GRASSP), action
   research arm test, grip dynamometry and range of motion).
   Results: By the end of the training period, the robot-assisted training
   was shown to require active therapist involvement for 25 +/- 11\% (mean
   +/- s.d.) of the total session time. In the group of all subjects and in
   a subgroup composed of motor-incomplete subjects, no statistically
   significant differences were found between intervention and control
   limbs for any of the outcome measures. In a subgroup of subjects with
   partial hand function at baseline, the GRASSP-Sensibility component
   showed a statistically significant increase (6.0 +/- 1.6 (mean +/-
   s.e.m.) point increase between baseline and discharge for the
   intervention limbs versus 1.9 +/- 0.9 points for the control limbs).
   Conclusion: The pilot results suggest that individuals with some
   preserved hand function after SCI may be better candidates for
   rehabilitation training using the Armeo Spring device. Spinal Cord

Abstract = {{M-LWWF/M-LWDF scheduling schemes have attracted much interest due to
   their ability to both stabilize queues whenever possible and control
   delay through parameter selection. However, a good implementation of
   these schedulers would require a mechanism to minimize the required
   fraction of the bandwidth while satisfying its stability and delay
   requirements. To the best of our knowledge, previous works on these
   scheduling policies did not address the problem of minimizing the
   bandwidth utilization while satisfying delay constraints.
   In this paper, we explore the solution of this problem using a joint
   bandwidth and weight adaptation approach. We characterize the problem
   solution space for M-LWWF and M-LWDF scheduling, assuming time-varying
   traffic. We also show that, starting from any point in the solution
   space, simple dynamic bandwidth and weight updates can surely lead to
   the convergence to the optimal operation point in this space. Based on
   these characteristics, we propose a dynamic parameter adaptation
   algorithm that is able to track the time-varying optimal operation
   points for dynamic traffic and channel conditions. Simulation results
   show the efficiency of our proposed algorithm in tracking the optimal
   operation points in dynamic traffic and channel settings.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The study presented here evaluated the usability of the
   audio description software Live Describe and explored the acceptance
   rates of audio description created by amateur describers who used Live
   Describe to facilitate the creation of their descriptions. Methods:
   Twelve amateur describers with little or no previous experience with
   audio description used the software Live Describe to describe a single
   episode of a 20-minute comedy show. Seventy-five reviewers who were
   blind, had low vision, or were sighted then rated the descriptions using
   a number of criteria, including overall quality and entertainment value.
   Results: Live Describe was found to be easy to use and useful. Three of
   the 12 describers produced descriptions that were rated as of good
   overall quality, 6 produced descriptions that were rated as of medium
   quality, and 3 produced descriptions that were rated as of poor quality.
   Discussion: These findings indicate that amateur description is feasible
   even with minimal training in either description itself or Live
   Describe. Audiences' preferences for description seem to be based on
   various characteristics of describers, such as the describers'
   vernacular and tone of voice and the length and timing of the
   descriptions. Implications for practitioners: If amateur description is
   indeed feasible, the quantity of audio descriptions that are available
   to the general public could be increased significantly. A great deal of
   informal description is already created by families and friends of
   individuals who are visually impaired through the ``whisper method.{''}
   If this description process could be captured and formalized through a
   tool such as Live Describe and shared through the Internet, many more
   descriptions could be made available.}},

Abstract = {{In Cont (2006){[}1], a convex risk measure was proposed to measure the
   impact of uncertainty resulting from the misspecification of derivative
   models. Evaluation of the risk measures was illustrated on finite
   families of probability measures. In this paper, we consider the case of
   infinite families of measures that share common moments, e.g. mean and
   variance for European-style options. We show that the risk measure can
   still be efficiently evaluated based on semi-infinite programming.
   Examples are given that illustrate the benefits of evaluating the risk
   measure with infinite families of measures and shed light on the
   limitations of considering only finite families of measures. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Myocardial infarction (MI) results in the death of cardiomyocytes (CM)
   followed by scar formation and pathological remodeling of the heart. We
   propose that chitosan conjugated with the angiopoietin-1 derived
   peptide, QHREDGS, and mixed with collagen I forms a thermoresponsive
   hydrogel better suited for the survival and maturation of transplanted
   cardiomyocytes in vitro compared to collagen and chitosan-collagen
   hydrogels alone. Conjugation of QHREDGS peptide to chitosan does not
   interfere with the gelation, structure or mechanical properties of the
   hydrogel blends. The storage modulus of 2.5 mg ml(-1) 1:1 mass:mass
   (m:m) chitosan-collagen was measured to be 54.9 +/- 9.1 Pa, and the loss
   modulus 6.1 +/- 0.9 Pa. The dose-response of the QHREDGS peptide was
   assessed and it was found that CMs encapsulated in High-peptide gel (651
   +/- 8 nmol peptide ml-gel(-1)) showed improved morphology, viability and
   metabolic activity in comparison to the Low-peptide (100 +/- 30 nmol
   peptide ml-gel(-1)) and Control (No Peptide) groups. Construct (CMs in
   hydrogel) functional properties were not significantly different between
   the groups; however, the success rate of obtaining a beating construct
   was improved in the hydrogel with the High amount of QHREDGS peptide
   immobilized compared to the Low and Control groups. Subcutaneous
   injection of hydrogel (Control, Low and High) with CMs in the back of
   Lewis rats illustrated its ability to localize at the site of injection
   and retain cells, with CM contractile apparati identified after seven
   days. The hydrogel was also able to successfully localize at the site of
   injection in a mouse MI model. (c) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

   related to an entropy function. The time derivative of the entropy
   function is made strictly negative by an appropriate choice of boundary
   conditions. A unique classical solution is shown to exist globally in

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{The hydrophobicity of alkyl-polypropylene oxide sulfate surfactants was
   evaluated via their characteristic curvature (Cc) using the
   hydrophilic-lipophilic difference (HLD) framework. A close examination
   of the relationship between the molecular structure of the surfactants
   considered (structure of the alkyl group and the number of propylene
   oxide groups in each surfactant) and their Cc led to a group
   contribution model that, for the first time, takes into consideration
   the geometry of the alkyl tail group. Based on this group contribution
   model, branching at the C2 (beta-carbon) position of the alkyl group
   produces the largest increase in characteristic curvature. This
   observation is consistent with the notion that the Cc is associated with
   the packing factor for anionic surfactants. Branching at the C2 position
   tends to produce cylindrical or inverse cone shape packing, typical of
   more hydrophobic (positive Cc) surfactants. This study also confirms
   previous observations that, different from conventional anionic
   surfactants, the phase behavior of alkyl polypropylene oxide sulfates is
   less sensitive to electrolyte concentration and that these formulations
   turn hydrophobic with increasing temperature, akin to the behavior of
   nonionic surfactants.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a comprehensive investigation of the behaviour of
   carsharing members through the analysis of administrative datasets of a
   dominant carsharing program in Toronto. The key objective of the
   investigation is to enhance our understanding on carsharing behaviour in
   the City of Toronto. Unlike other studies on carsharing, this paper
   intends to build a comprehensive understanding of the multiple
   dimensions of users' behaviour including attitude towards environment,
   attitude towards safety, frequency of usage, membership duration,
   vehicle type choice and monthly demand, in terms of total
   vehicle-kilometre and vehicle-hour travel. The paper uses both
   descriptive and econometric approaches for in-depth investigations. One
   of the key contributions of the paper is linking carsharing with carbon
   offsetting. Investigations reveal that carsharing members are in general
   environmentally conscious people and are willing to pay for carbon
   offsetting if given an option. However, having the carbon offsetting
   option also encouraged a higher amount of driving per month. Results
   show that carsharing is most often used for off-peak period travel or on
   weekends, when transit service is poor and traffic congestion is low.
   The majority of trips made by carsharing members are short-distance
   trips. It is clear that carsharing is providing a segment of the
   population with enhanced accessibility and mobility and thus playing an
   important role in providing a seamless, integrated transportation
   service in the City of Toronto. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Plants display an immense diversity of specialized metabolites, many of
   which have been important to humanity as medicines, flavors, fragrances,
   pigments, insecticides and other fine chemicals. Apparently, much of the
   variation in plant specialized metabolism evolved through events of gene
   duplications followed by neo- or sub-functionalization. Most of the
   catalytic diversity of plant enzymes is unexplored since previous
   biochemical and genomics efforts have focused on a relatively small
   number of species. Interdisciplinary research in plant genomics,
   microbial engineering and synthetic biology provides an opportunity to
   accelerate the discovery of new enzymes. The massive identification,
   characterization and cataloguing of plant enzymes coupled with their
   deployment in metabolically optimized microbes provide a high-throughput
   functional genomics tool and a novel strain engineering pipeline.}},

Title = {{A novel approach to predict the electrical conductivity of
   multifunctional nanocomposites}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{129-138}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the effect of uniformly dispersed, aligned
   and agglomerated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) upon the electrical
   conductivity of multifunctional nanocomposites. Unlike earlier Monte
   Carlo simulations, the current work employs a novel network recognition
   approach to determine current continuity. We employed periodically
   connective paths and these led to the reduction of the finite size of
   the representative volume element containing the CNTs. An improved
   description of the contact and the intrinsic resistance network is
   adopted in the determination of the critical percolation of the
   considered multifunctional nanocomposite. Furthermore, agglomeration of
   CNTs was modeled in terms of periodic clusters. The diameter of the
   cluster and distance between adjacent clusters were used to characterize
   the agglomeration extent. Three aspects of the work were accordingly
   examined: (i) the effect of idealized uniformly dispersed CNTs on the
   resulting percolation characteristics, (ii) the effect of partially and
   fully aligned CNTs on the resulting percolation characteristics and
   (iii) the effect of agglomerated CNTs, as defined by cluster diameter
   and distance between clusters, upon the critical percolation level. The
   results of our work, which are in good agreement with existing
   experimental works, reveal that the highest electrical conductivity
   occurs when the CNTs are partially rather than perfectly aligned. They
   further reveal that the presence of agglomerated CNT results in a higher
   conductivity at and close to the percolation threshold, but limits the
   increase in the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite with
   increased fractions of CNTs. In view of its robustness and computational
   efficiency, we believe that this newly developed model can be adopted as
   a predictive tool to characterize and evaluate electrical conductivity
   in multi-functional nanocomposites. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published

Abstract = {{Drug delivery to solid tumours remains a challenge because both tumour
   physiology and drug solubility are unfavourable. Engineered materials
   can provide the basis for drug reformulation, incorporating active
   compounds and modulating their pharmacokinetic and biodistribution
   behaviour. To this end, we encapsulated docetaxel, a poorly soluble
   taxane drug, in a self-assembled polymeric nanoparticle micelle of
   poly(2-methyl-2-carboxytrimethylene
   carbonate-co-D,L-lactide)-graft-poly(ethylene glycol)
   (poly(TMCC-co-LA)-g-PEG). This formulation was compared with its
   conventional ethanolic polysorbate 80 formulation in terms of plasma
   circulation and biodistribution in an orthotopic mouse model of breast
   cancer. Notably, the polymeric nanoparticle formulation achieved greater
   tumour retention, resulting in prolonged exposure of cancer cells to the
   active drug. This behaviour was unique to the tumour tissue. The active
   drug was eliminated at equal or greater rates in all other tissues
   assayed when delivered in the polymeric nanoparticles vs. the free drug
   formulation. Thus, these polymeric nanoparticles are promising vehicles
   for solid tumour drug delivery applications, offering greater tumour
   exposure while eliminating the need for toxic solvents and surfactants
   in the dosing formulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses a white matter lesion (WML) segmentation scheme for
   fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI. The method computes
   the volume of lesions with subvoxel precision by accounting for the
   partial volume averaging (PVA) artifact. As WMLs are related to stroke
   and carotid disease, accurate volume measurements are most important.
   Manual volume computation is laborious, subjective, time consuming, and
   error prone. Automated methods are a nice alternative since they
   quantify WML volumes in an objective, efficient, and reliable manner.
   PVA is initially modeled with a localized edge strength measure since
   PVA resides in the boundaries between tissues. This map is computed in
   3-D and is transformed to a global representation to increase robustness
   to noise. Significant edges correspond to PVA voxels, which are used to
   find the PVA fraction a (amount of each tissue present in mixture
   voxels). Results on simulated and real FLAIR images show high WML
   segmentation performance compared to ground truth (98.9\% and 83\%
   overlap, respectively), which outperforms other methods. Lesion load
   studies are included that automatically analyze WML volumes for each
   brain hemisphere separately. This technique does not require any
   distributional assumptions/parameters or training samples and is applied
   on a single MR modality, which is a major advantage compared to the
   traditional methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes new color local texture features, i.e., color local
   Gabor wavelets (CLGWs) and color local binary pattern (CLBP), for the
   purpose of face recognition (FR). The proposed color local texture
   features are able to exploit the discriminative information derived from
   spatiochromatic texture patterns of different spectral channels within a
   certain local face region. Furthermore, in order to maximize a
   complementary effect taken by using both color and texture information,
   the opponent color texture features that capture the texture patterns of
   spatial interactions between spectral channels are also incorporated
   into the generation of CLGW and CLBP. In addition, to perform the final
   classification, multiple color local texture features (each
   corresponding to the associated color band) are combined within a
   feature-level fusion framework. Extensive and comparative experiments
   have been conducted to evaluate our color local texture features for FR
   on five public face databases, i.e., CMU-PIE, Color FERET, XM2VTSDB,
   SCface, and FRGC 2.0. Experimental results show that FR approaches using
   color local texture features impressively yield better recognition rates
   than FR approaches using only color or texture information.
   Particularly, compared with grayscale texture features, the proposed
   color local texture features are able to provide excellent recognition
   rates for face images taken under severe variation in illumination, as
   well as for small-(low-) resolution face images. In addition, the
   feasibility of our color local texture features has been successfully
   demonstrated by making comparisons with other state-of-the-art color FR
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{We leverage properties of the logic synthesis netlist to define both a
   new field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) logic element (function
   generator) architecture and an associated technology mapping algorithm
   that together provide improved logic density. We demonstrate that an
   ``extended{''} logic element with slightly modified K-input lookup
   tables (LUTs) achieves much of the benefit of an architecture with K +
   1-input LUTs, while consuming silicon area close to a K-LUT (a K-LUT
   requires half the area of a K + 1-LUT). We introduce the notion of
   ``non-inverting paths{''} in a circuit's AND-inverter graph (AIG) and
   show their utility in mapping into the proposed logic element
   architectures. We propose a general family of logic element
   architectures, and present results showing that they offer a variety of
   area/performance tradeoffs. One of our key results demonstrates that
   while circuits mapped to a traditional 5-LUT architecture need 15\% more
   LUTs and have 14\% more depth than a 6-LUT architecture, our extended
   5-LUT architecture requires only 7\% more LUTs and 5\% more depth than
   6-LUTs, on average. Nearly all of the depth reduction associated with
   moving from K-input to K + 1-input LUTs can be achieved with
   considerably less area using extended K-LUTs. We further show that 6-LUT
   optimal mapping depths can be achieved with a small fraction of the LUTs
   in hardware being 6-LUTs and the remainder being extended 5-LUTs,
   suggesting that a heterogeneous logic block architecture may prove to be
   advantageous.}},

Abstract = {{Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) has been widely employed as a hydrophobic
   coating for the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) gas
   diffusion layer (GDL). Despite a number of application techniques
   available, a method of quantifying the distribution of PTFE in the
   through-plane direction of the GDL has not been well established. In
   this work, we present a novel method for measuring heterogeneous
   through-plane PTFE distributions within the bulk of the GDL using
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry
   (EDS) imaging. To the authors' best knowledge, this work represents the
   first direct experimental investigation of the through-plane
   distributions of PTFE for various commercially available GDLs. SEM EDS
   imaging of typical PTFE distributions for paper, felt, and cloth GDLs
   are presented and discussed. SEM backscatter electron images (SEI) are
   also provided to enable the comparison of PTFE distributions with the

Title = {{Detailed numerical modeling of PAH formation and growth in non-premixed

Abstract = {{A chemical kinetic mechanism for C-1 and C-2 fuel combustion and PAH
   growth, previously validated for laminar premixed combustion, has now
   been modified and applied to opposed flow diffusion flames. Some
   modifications and extensions have been made to the reaction scheme to
   take into account recent kinetic investigations, and to reduce the
   stiffness of the reaction model. Updates have been made to the
   cyclopentadienyl reactions, indene formation reactions, and aromatic
   oxidation and decomposition reactions. Reverse reaction rate parameters
   have been revised to account for numerical stiffness. Opposed flow
   diffusion flame simulation data for ethylene and ethane flames with the
   present mechanism are compared to data computed using two other
   mechanisms from the literature and to experimental data. Whereas the
   fuel oxidation chemistry in all three mechanisms are essentially the
   same, the PAH growth pathways vary considerably. The current mechanism
   considers a detailed set of PAH growth routes, and includes hydrogen
   atom migration, possible free radical addition schemes, methyl
   substitution/acetylene addition pathways, cyclopentadienyl moiety in
   aromatic ring formation, and numerous reactions between aromatic
   radicals and molecules. It is shown that while bulk flame properties and
   major species profiles are the same for the three mechanisms, the
   enhanced PAH growth routes in the present mechanism are necessary to
   numerically predict the correct order of magnitude of PAHs that were
   measured in the experimental studies. In particular, predicting
   concentrations of naphthalene, phenanthrene, and pyrene, to within the
   correct order of magnitude with the present mechanism show a significant
   improvement over predictions obtained using mechanisms in the
   literature. Sensitivity and production rate analyses show that this
   improvement is attributable to the enhanced PAH growth pathways and
   updated reaction rates in the present mechanism. The overreaching goal
   of this research is to generate and fully validate a detailed chemical
   kinetic mechanism, with as few fitted rates as possible, that can be
   applied to premixed or diffusion systems, and used with any type of soot
   model. To that end, in recently published works, the present mechanism
   has been used to simulate premixed flames, while coupled to a method of
   moments to determine soot formation, and to simulate diffusion flames,
   while coupled to a sectional representation for soot formation. The
   present work extends the validation of the mechanism by applying it to
   counterflow diffusion flames, for which measurements of large PAH
   molecules are uniquely available. The validation of PAH growth
   predictions are of key interest to soot modeling studies as soot
   inception from PAH combination and PAH condensation are often major
   constituents of soot production. (C) 2011 The Combustion Institute.

Abstract = {{It is well known that the optical response of a medium depends on the
   local field acting on an individual emitter rather than on the
   macroscopic average field in the medium. The local field depends very
   sensitively on the microcopic environment in an optical medium. It is
   thus possible to achieve a significant control over the local field by
   intermixing homogeneous materials on a nanoscale to produce composite
   optical materials. A combination of local-field effects and
   nanostructuring provides new degrees of freedom for manipulating the
   optical properties of photonic materials. Especially interesting
   opportunities open up in the nonlinear optical regime where the material
   response depends on the local-field correction as a power law. The goal
   of this review is to present a conceptual overview of the influence of
   local-field effects on the optical properties of photonic materials,
   both homogeneous and composite. We also give a summary of recent
   achievements in controlling the optical properties by local-field
   effects and nanostructuring. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{A deeper understanding of the mechanical behavior of ultra-fine (UF) and
   nanocrystalline (NC) grained metals is necessary with the growing
   interest in using UF and NC grained metals for structural applications.
   The cyclic deformation response and behavior of UF and NC grained metals
   is one aspect that has been gaining momentum as a major research topic
   for the past ten years. Severe Plastic Deformation (SPD) materials are
   often in the spotlight for cyclic deformation studies as they are
   usually in the form of bulk work pieces and have UF and NC grains. Some
   well known techniques in the category of SPD processing are High
   Pressure Torsion (HPT), Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP), and
   Accumulative Roll-Bonding (ARB). In this report, the literature on the
   cyclic deformation response and behavior of SPDed metals will be
   reviewed. The cyclic response of such materials is found to range from
   cyclic hardening to cyclic softening depending on various factors.
   Specifically, for SPDed UF grained metals, their behavior has often been
   associated with the observation of grain coarsening during cycling.
   Consequently, the many factors that affect the cyclic deformation
   response of SPDed metals can be summarized into three major aspects: (1)
   the microstructure stability; (2) the limitation of the cyclic lifespan;
   and lastly (3) the imposed plastic strain amplitude.}},

Abstract = {{Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are an important source of cardiomyocytes
   for regenerating injured myocardium. The successful use of ESC-derived
   cardiomyocytes in cardiac tissue engineering requires an understanding
   of the important scaffold properties and culture conditions to promote
   cell attachment, differentiation, organization, and contractile
   function. The goal of this work was to investigate how scaffold
   architecture and coculture with fibroblasts influences the
   differentiated phenotype of murine ESC-derived cardiomyocytes (mESCDCs).
   Electrospinning was used to process an elastomeric biodegradable
   polyurethane (PU) into aligned or unaligned fibrous scaffolds.
   Bioreactor produced mESCDCs were seeded onto the PU scaffolds either on
   their own or after pre-seeding the scaffolds with mouse embryonic
   fibroblasts (MEFs). Viable mESCDCs attached to the PU scaffolds and were
   functionally contractile in all conditions tested. Importantly, the
   aligned scaffolds led to the anisotropic organization of rod-shaped
   cells, improved sarcomere organization, and increased mESCDC aspect
   ratio (length-to-diameter ratio) when compared to cells on the unaligned
   scaffolds. In addition, pre-seeding the scaffolds with MEFs improved
   mESCDC sarcomere formation compared to mESCDCs cultured alone. These
   results suggest that both fiber alignment and pre-treatment of scaffolds
   with fibroblasts improve the differentiation of mESCDCs and are
   important parameters for developing engineered myocardial tissue

Abstract = {{Local (cell-level) signaling environments, regulated by autocrine and
   paracrine signaling, and modulated by cell organization, are
   hypothesized to be fundamental stem cell fate control mechanisms used
   during development. It has, however, been challenging to demonstrate the
   impact of cell-level organization on stem cell fate control and to
   relate stem cell fate outcomes to autocrine and paracrine signaling. We
   address this fundamental problem using a combined in silico and
   experimental approach in which we directly manipulate, using laminar
   fluid flow, the local impact of endogenously secreted gp130-activating
   ligands and their activation of signal transducer and activator of
   transcription3 (STAT3) signaling in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC).
   Our model analysis predicted that flow-dependent changes in autocrine
   and paracrine ligand binding would impact heterogeneity in cell-and
   colony-level STAT3 signaling activation and cause a gradient of cell
   fate determination along the direction of flow. Interestingly, analysis
   also predicted that local cell density would be inversely proportional
   to the degree to which endogenous secretion contributed to cell fate
   determination. Experimental validation using functional activation of
   STAT3 by secreted factors under microfluidic perfusion culture
   demonstrated that STAT3 activation and consequently mESC fate were
   manipulable by flow rate, position in the flow field, and local cell
   organization. As a unique demonstration of how quantitative control of
   autocrine and paracrine signaling can be integrated with spatial
   organization to elicit higher order cell fate effects, this work
   provides a general template to investigate organizing principles due to
   secreted factors.}},

Abstract = {{When using stereographic image pairs to create three-dimensional (3D)
   images, a deep depth of field in the original scene enhances the depth
   perception in the 3D image. The omnifocus video camera has no depth of
   field limitations and produces images that are in focus throughout. By
   installing an attachment on the omnifocus video camera, real-time super
   deep stereoscopic pairs of video images were obtained. The deeper depth
   of field creates a larger perspective image shift, which makes greater
   demands on the binocular fusion of human vision. A means of reducing the
   perspective shift without harming the depth of field was found. (C) 2012

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{FEB 17}},
Abstract = {{Communication barriers often result in exclusion of children and youth
   with disabilities from activities and social settings that are essential
   to their psychosocial development. In particular, difficulties in
   describing their experiences of activities and social settings hinder
   our understanding of the factors that promote inclusion and
   participation of this group of individuals. To address this specific
   communication challenge, we examined the feasibility of developing a
   language-free measure of experience in youth with severe physical
   disabilities. To do this, we used the activity of the peripheral nervous
   system to detect patterns of psychological arousal associated with
   activities requiring different patterns of cognitive/affective and
   interpersonal involvement (activity engagement). We demonstrated that
   these signals can differentiate among patterns of arousal associated
   with these activities with high accuracy (two levels: 81\%, three
   levels: 74\%). These results demonstrate the potential for development
   of a real-time, motor-and language-free measure for describing the
   experiences of children and youth with disabilities.}},

Abstract = {{New liquid triarylamine-siloxane hybrid materials are produced using the
   Piers-Rubinsztajn reaction. Under mild conditions, liquid analogues of
   conventional and commonly crystalline triarylamines are easily
   synthesized from readily available or accessible intermediates. Using a
   diverse selection of triarylamines, we explored the effects of siloxane
   group and substitution pattern on the physical properties of these
   materials, and we have demonstrated that relatively large molecular
   liquids with desirable electrochemical properties can be produced. The
   interactions between the strongly Lewis acidic catalyst used for this
   transformation, tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF), and the Lewis basic
   triarylamine substrates were studied. Through UV-vis-NIR and F-19 NMR
   spectroscopy, we have proposed that the catalyst undergoes a reversible
   redox reaction with the substrates to produce a charge transfer complex.
   The formation of this charge transfer complex is sensitive to the
   oxidation potential of the triarylamine and can greatly affect the
   kinetics of the Piers-Rubinsztajn reaction.}},

   approach addresses two challenges in studies of gas liquid reactions: a

Title = {{Transition to Seizure: Ictal Discharge Is Preceded by Exhausted

Abstract = {{How the brain transitions into a seizure is poorly understood. Recurrent
   seizure-like events (SLEs) in low-Mg2+/high-K+ perfusate were measured
   in the CA3 region of the intact mouse hippocampus. The SLE was divided
   into a ``preictal phase,{''} which abruptly turns into a higher
   frequency ``ictal{''} phase. Blockade of GABA(A) receptors shortened the
   preictal phase, abolished interictal bursts, and attenuated the slow
   preictal depolarization, with no effect on the ictal duration, whereas
   SLEs were blocked by glutamate receptor blockade. In CA3 pyramidal cells
   and stratum oriens non-fast-spiking and fast-spiking interneurons,
   recurrent GABAergic IPSCs predominated interictally and during the early
   preictal phase, synchronous with extracellularly measured recurrent
   field potentials (FPs). These IPSCs then decreased to zero or reversed
   polarity by the onset of the higher-frequency ictus. However,
   postsynaptic muscimol-evoked GABA(A) responses remained intact.
   Simultaneously, EPSCs synchronous with the FPs markedly increased to a
   maximum at the ictal onset. The reversal potential of the compound
   postsynaptic currents (combined simultaneous EPSCs and IPSCs) became
   markedly depolarized during the preictal phase, whereas the
   muscimol-evoked GABA(A) reversal potential remained unchanged. During
   the late preictal phase, interneuronal excitability was high, but IPSCs,
   evoked by local stimulation, or osmotically by hypertonic sucrose
   application, were diminished, disappearing at the ictal onset. We
   conclude that the interictal and early preictal states are dominated by
   GABAergic activity, with the onset of the ictus heralded by exhaustion
   of presynaptic release of GABA, and unopposed increased glutamatergic
   responses.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In order to evaluate nerve regeneration in clinically
   relevant hindlimb surgical paradigms not feasible in fluorescent mice
   models, we developed a rat that expresses green fluorescent protein
   (GFP) in neural tissue.
   Methods: Transgenic Sprague-Dawley rat lines were created using
   pronuclear injection of a transgene expressing GFP under the control of
   the thy1 gene. Nerves were imaged under fluorescence microscopy and
   muscles were imaged with confocal microscopy to determine GFP expression
   following sciatic nerve crush, transection and direct suturing, and
   transection followed by repair with a nerve isograft from nonexpressing
   littermates.
   Results: In each surgical paradigm, fluorescence microscopy demonstrated
   the loss and reappearance of fluorescence with regeneration of axons
   following injury. Nerve regeneration was confirmed with imaging of
   Wallerian degeneration followed by reinnervation of extensor digitorum
   longus (EDL) muscle motor endplates using confocal microscopy.
   Conclusion: The generation of a novel transgenic rat model expressing
   GFP in neural tissue allows in vivo imaging of nerve regeneration and
   visualization of motor endplate reinnervation. This rat provides a new
   model for studying peripheral nerve injury and regeneration over
   surgically relevant distances. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{Nanowire field-effect transistors (nano-FETs) are nanodevices capable of
   highly sensitive, label-free sensing of molecules. However, significant
   variations in sensitivity across devices can result from poor control
   over device parameters, such as nanowire diameter and the number of
   electrode-bridging nanowires. This paper presents a fabrication approach
   that uses wafer-scale nanowire contact printing for throughput and uses
   automated nanomanipulation for precision control of nanowire number and
   diameter. The process requires only one photolithography mask. Using
   nanowire contact printing and post-processing (i.e. nanomanipulation
   inside a scanning electron microscope), we are able to produce devices
   all with a single-nanowire and similar diameters at a speed of similar
   to 1 min/device with a success rate of 95\% (n = 500). This technology
   represents a seamless integration of wafer-scale microfabrication and
   automated nanorobotic manipulation for producing nano-FET sensors with
   consistent response across devices.}},

Title = {{Immiscible displacement of oil by water in a microchannel: Asymmetric
   flow behavior and nonlinear stability analysis of core-annular flow}},

Abstract = {{The immiscible displacement of oil by water in a circular microchannel
   was investigated. A fused silica microchannel with an inner diameter of
   250 mu m and a length of 7 cm was initially filled with a viscous
   silicone oil. Only water then was injected into the channel. We describe
   our flow observations based on the two-dimensional images captured in
   the middle of the channel. The water finger displaced the oil and left
   an oil film on the channel wall. While the oil was being displaced at
   the core, the flow resistance decreased, which resulted in increases in
   water flow rate and inertia. Eventually, the water finger reached the
   channel exit and formed a core-annular flow pattern. The wavelength of
   the waves formed at the oil-water interface also increased with the
   increase in inertia. The initially symmetric interfacial waves became
   asymmetric with time. Also, the water core shifted from the center of
   the channel and left a thinner oil film on one side of the microchannel.
   Under all flow rates tested in this study, as long as the water was
   continuously injected, the water core was stable and no breakup into
   droplets was observed. We also discuss the flow stability based on
   nonlinear and linear stability analyses performed on the core-annular
   flow. Compared to the linear analysis, which ignores the inertia
   effects, the nonlinear analysis, which includes the inertia effects,
   predicts longer interfacial wavelengths by a factor of 1/root
   1-u/2(We(w)+ We(o) a(o)(2)/1-a(o)(2)) where We(w) and We(o) are the
   Weber numbers of the water and the oil phases, respectively, and a(o) is
   the unperturbed water core radius made dimensionless by the channel
   radius.}},

Title = {{Monitoring Biodegradation of Ethene and Bioremediation of Chlorinated

Abstract = {{Chlorinated ethenes are commonly found in contaminated groundwater.
   Remediation strategies focus on transformation processes that will
   ultimately lead to nontoxic products. A major concern with these
   strategies is the possibility of incomplete dechlorination and
   accumulation of toxic daughter products (cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE),
   vinyl chloride (VC)). Ethene mass balance can be used as a direct
   indicator to assess the effectiveness of dechlorination. However, the
   microbial processes that affect ethene are not well characterized and
   poor mass balance may reflect biotransformation of ethene rather than
   incomplete dechlorination. Microbial degradation of ethene is commonly
   observed in aerobic systems but fewer cases have been reported in
   anaerobic systems. Limited information is available on the isotope
   enrichment factors associated with these processes. Using
   compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) we determined the enrichment
   factors associated with microbial degradation of ethene in anaerobic
   microcosms (epsilon = -6.7 parts per thousand +/- 0.4 parts per thousand
   , and 4.0 parts per thousand +/- 0.8 parts per thousand ) from cultures
   collected from the Twin Lakes wetland area at the Savannah River site in
   Georgia (United States), and in aerobic microcosms (epsilon = -3.0 parts
   per thousand +/- 0.3 parts per thousand) from Mycobacterium sp. strain
   JS60. Under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, CSIA can be used to
   determine whether biotransformation of ethene is occurring in addition
   to biodegradation of the chlorinated ethenes. Using delta C-13 values
   determined for ethene and for chlorinated ethenes at a contaminated
   field site undergoing bioremediation, this study demonstrates how CSIA
   of ethene can be used to reduce uncertainty and risk at a site by
   distinguishing between actual mass balance deficits during reductive
   dechlorination and apparent lack of mass balance that is related to
   biotransformation of ethene.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical hematopoietic transplantation outcomes are strongly correlated
   with the numbers of cells infused. Anticipated novel therapeutic
   implementations of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their derivatives
   further increase interest in strategies to expand HSCs ex vivo. A
   fundamental limitation in all HSC-driven culture systems is the rapid
   generation of differentiating cells and their secreted inhibitory
   feedback signals. Herein we describe an integrated computational and
   experimental strategy that enables a tunable reduction in the global
   levels and impact of paracrine signaling factors in an automated
   closed-system process by employing a controlled fed-batch media dilution
   approach. Application of this system to human cord blood cells yielded a
   rapid (12-day) 11-fold increase of HSCs with self-renewing, multilineage
   repopulating ability. These results highlight the marked improvements
   that control of feedback signaling can offer primary stem cell culture
   and demonstrate a clinically relevant rapid and relatively low culture
   volume strategy for ex vivo HSC expansion.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Infrared Optical up-conversion devices are attracting more and more
   attentions for their greater capability to convert infrared light to
   visible light via optical-electrical-optical process, compared with
   other existing converting technology. The basic idea is to integrate an
   infrared photodetector with a light-emitting diode (LED) or an organic
   light-emitting device (OLED), connected in series. The infrared
   photo-generated electron hole pairs within the absorbing layer of
   photodetector are injected to the LED (or OLED), resulting in an
   increase in optical emission at a shorter wavelength and therefore
   achieving optical up conversion. This paper presents our research and
   development effort in realizing and perfecting such devices, and mainly
   focuses on the design, internal semiconductor physics, fabrications, and
   performances of different optical up-conversion device structures.
   Moreover, based on the analysis of experimental results, the paper
   explains the close relationship between internal coefficient and overall
   upconversion power efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Dental caries is the leading cause of tooth loss, which can promptly be
   prevented if detected in early stages of progression. Unfortunately,
   conventional diagnostic modalities currently used in dentistry lack the
   sensitivity to detect early caries. The authors' intention is to compare
   the ability of polarized Raman spectroscopy and thermophotonic imaging
   to make early caries diagnosis. Extracted human teeth with no visible
   stain or defects were artificially demineralized in accordance to a
   well-known protocol in dentistry for simulated early caries development
   at several demineralization stages. Samples were then inspected using
   polarized Raman spectroscopy and thermophotonic imaging. The
   sensitivities of these two diagnostic modalities are compared, and the
   results are verified using transverse micro-radiography. It was found
   that compared to polarized Raman spectroscopy, thermophotonic imaging
   exhibits superior sensitivity to very early stages of demineralization.

Abstract = {{The effect of the substrate material on mode-I fatigue behavior of a
   toughened epoxy adhesive system was examined in terms of the substrate
   stiffness and curing residual stress. It was found that a change in
   adherend material from aluminum to steel caused a reduction in the
   fatigue performance; i.e. the threshold energy release rate decreased
   and the crack growth rate increased for a given applied energy release
   rate. The possibility that these observations were a result of adhesive
   curing residual stresses was studied experimentally and analytically,
   but it was found that such effects were relatively small. Finite element
   modeling showed that the fatigue results could be explained in terms of
   an increase in the crack tip stresses and an enlarged plastic zone due
   to the greater modulus of steel compared with aluminum. The local
   influence of the adherend modulus proved to be much more significant
   than the global effect of the adherend stiffness (product of modulus and
   moment of inertia). The effects of adherend modulus are expected to
   diminish as the phase angle increases. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Static Mohr-Coulomb Failure Criterion for rocks has been used
   extensively in various rock engineering applications. In this model, the
   compressive strength, tensile strength, and shear strength are related.
   To investigate the applicability of the Mohr-Coulomb model to dynamic
   failures, we studied the correlation of the three dynamic rock
   properties: compressive strength, tensile strength and punch shear
   strength. The strengths are quantified using a split Hopkinson pressure
   bar (SHPB) system. The methods for acquiring these strengths were
   briefly discussed. A fine-grained sandstone, Longyou sandstone (LS) was
   studied using these methods. The results showed that the compressive
   strength calculated from the punch shear strength of LS matched well
   with the experimental UCS results, thus the punch shear strength could
   be effectively used to predict the UCS of rocks. The tensile strength
   calculated from the punch shear strength of LS also has exhibited a good
   trend with the experimental results of Brazilian tensile strength. We
   concluded that the famous Mohr-Coulomb criterion can be extended to the
   dynamic range. However, caution has to be taken in determining the
   loading rates for different strength results.}},

Abstract = {{Delivery and toxicity are critical issues facing nanomedicine research.
   Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the
   physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a
   physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally
   synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications.
   It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a
   nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its ``synthetic identity{''}, are
   not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and
   interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and
   interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct
   ``biological identity{''}. Here, we investigate the role of size and
   surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold
   nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using
   label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that
   over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the
   surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these
   adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol)
   grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with
   differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a
   macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of
   nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of
   nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity. This study
   establishes principles for the rational design of clinically useful
   nanomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Polymeric micelles provide a platform that can be carefully tuned for
   drug delivery. The nano-scale aggregates form spontaneously in aqueous
   solution and can be used to overcome drug insolubility and increase
   circulation half life. Self-assembled polymeric micelles are dynamic in

   equilibrium, while kinetics characterizes the system's behavior over
   time. In this review, we discuss factors that affect the stability of
   self-assembled polymeric micelle systems for drug delivery and methods
   used to study stability. Considerations of polymer composition, drug
   encapsulation, and environmental conditions influence polymeric micelle
   stability. Ultimately, we emphasize the importance of investigating
   micelle systems in physiologically relevant media to improve therapeutic
   efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity in clinical applications. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We introduce and study a new class of linear control systems called
   patterned systems. Mathematically, this class has the property that the
   state, input and output transformations of the linear state space model

   studying such systems arises from their interpretation as a collection
   of identical subsystems with a pattern of interaction between subsystems
   that is imprinted by the base transformation. From a control
   perspective, the objective is to provide synthesis methods for feedbacks
   that preserve the system pattern. Patterned systems may provide a
   template for the development of a more unified framework for dealing
   with systems, typically distributed, that consist of subsystems

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine whether brand-name glaucoma drops differ from
   generic equivalents in bottle design, viscosity, surface tension. and
   volume in North America.
   Design: Experimental study.
   Participants: We studied 5 bottles each of 11 kinds of glaucoma drops.
   Methods: Density-based calculations of drop volume were assessed using
   0.1 mg analytic balance. Viscosity was measured using rotational
   rheometery. Bottle tip diameter was measured using 0.05 mm Vernier
   calipers. Surface tension was measured using a Fisher Scientific
   (Ottawa, ON) tensiometer.
   Results: For the American brand-name Timoptic XE, the average drop
   volume was 38 +/- 3.1 mu L versus 24 +/- 1.5 mu L of Timolol GFS (p <
   0.0001). For the Canadian brand-name Timoptic XE, the average drop
   volume was 42 +/- 4.0 mu L versus 25 +/- 2 mu L of timolol maleate EX (p
   < 0.0001). The Canadian brand-name Timoptic drop volume was 28 +/- 1.4
   mu L versus 35 +/- 1.9 mu L Apo-Timop (p < 0.01). At a 0.1 per second
   shear rate, the viscosity of Canadian Timoptic XE was 20 times higher
   than that of its generic equivalent, whereas the viscosity of American
   Timoptic XE differed from the generic by a factor of 100. The surface
   tension of Canadian Timoptic XE was 31\% higher than that of the generic
   (p < 0.001), whereas the surface tension of American Timoptic XE was
   21\% higher than that of the generic (p < 0.001). The bottle tips of the
   Canadian and American Timoptic XE measured about 3.5 times larger than
   those of their generics.
   Conclusion: American and Canadian Timoptic XE eye drops vary
   significantly from the generics in drop volume, viscosity, surface
   tension, and bottle tip. Canadian brand-name Timoptic delivered
   significantly smaller drop volumes than generic Apo-Timop. Careful
   consideration should be given to drop viscosity and bottle design when
   generic ophthalmic products are evaluated for interchangeability and
   market entry.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence of a non-specific effect of balance training on postural
   control mechanisms suggests that balance training during mechanically
   unperturbed standing may improve postural corrective responses following
   external perturbations. The purpose of the present study was to examine
   kinematics of the trunk as well as muscular activity of the lower leg
   and paraspinal muscles during postural responses to support-surface
   rotations after short-term balance training. Experiments were performed
   in control (n = 10) and experimental (n = 11) groups. The experimental
   group participated in the 3-day balance training program. During the
   training, participants stood on a force platform and were instructed to
   voluntarily shift their center of pressure in indicated directions as
   represented by a cursor on a monitor. Postural perturbation tests were
   executed before and after the training period: the slow and fast 100
   dorsiflexions were induced at angular velocities of approximately 50
   degrees s(-1) and 200 degrees s(-1), respectively. In the experimental
   group, the amplitude of the trunk displacements during slow and fast
   perturbations was up to 33.4\% and 26.7\% lower, respectively, following
   the training. The magnitude of the muscular activity was reduced in both
   the early and late components of the response. The kinematic parameters
   and muscular responses did not change in the control group. The results
   suggest that balance training during unperturbed standing has the
   potential to improve postural corrective responses to unexpected balance
   perturbation through (1) improved neuromuscular coordination of the
   involved muscles and (2) adaptive neural modifications on the spinal and
   cortical levels facilitated by voluntary activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier By.

Abstract = {{Activated monocytes can promote inflammation or wound repair, depending
   on the nature of the implant environment. Recent work showed that a
   degradable, polar-hydrophobic-ionic polyurethane (D-PHI) induced an
   anti-inflammatory monocyte phenotype. In the current study it is
   hypothesized that wound-healing phenotype monocytes (activated by D-PHI
   material chemistry) will promote human vascular smooth muscle cells
   (hVSMC) to attach and migrate into porous D-PHI scaffolds. hVSMC
   migration is necessary for hVSMC population of the scaffold and tissue
   formation to occur, and then, once tissue formation is complete, the
   monocyte should promote contractile phenotype markers in the hVSMC.
   hVSMC were cultured for up to 28 days with or without monocytes and
   analyzed for cell viability, attachment (DNA) and migration. Lysates
   were analyzed for the hVSMC contractile phenotype markers calponin and
   alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) as well as urokinase plasminogen
   activator (uPA: pro-migration marker) using immunoblotting analysis.
   Histological staining showed that hVSMC alone remained around the
   perimeter of the scaffold, whereas co-culture samples had
   co-localization of monocytes with hVSMC in the pores, a more even cell
   distribution throughout the scaffold and increased total cell attachment
   (P < 0.05). Co-culture samples had higher cell numbers and more DNA than
   the addition of both single cell cultures. The water-soluble
   tetrazolium-1 data suggested that cells were not dying over the 28 day
   culture period. Calponin, also linked to cell motility, was maintained
   up to 28 days in the co-culture and hVSMC alone, whereas alpha-SMA
   disappeared after 7 days. Co-cultures on D-PHI showed that monocytes
   were activated to a wound-healing phenotype (low TNF-alpha, elevated
   IL-10), while promoting uPA expression. In summary, this study showed
   that, by co-culturing monocytes with hVSMC, the latter showed increased
   total cell attachment and infiltration into the D-PHI scaffold compared
   with hVSMC alone, suggesting that monocytes may promote hVSMC migration,
   a condition necessary for ultimately achieving uniform tissue formation
   in porous scaffolds. (C) 2011 Acts Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Microscopic strains associated with stress corrosion cracks have been
   investigated in stressed C-rings of Ni-16 Cr-9 Fe (Alloy 600) boiler
   tubing. Polychromatic X-ray microdiffraction was used to measure
   deviatoric strain tensors and the distribution of dislocations near
   cracks that had been propagated in electrochemically accelerated
   corrosion tests. An associated investigation of the C-ring-induced
   strains prior to corrosion showed significant tensile strain in the
   stress axis direction by the torsional closure of the alloy tube section
   in the C-ring test. Significant grain lattice rotation and pronounced
   plastic strain at some grain boundaries were noted.
   Stress-corrosion-cracking-generated intergranular cracks were produced
   in two Alloy 600 specimens after 6 h and 18 h tests. The diffraction
   patterns and resultant strain tensors were mapped around the cracked
   area to a 1 mu m spatial resolution. The strain tensor transverse to the
   crack growth direction showed tensile strain at the intergranular region
   just ahead of the crack tip for both specimens. Both cracks were found
   to follow grain boundary pathways that had the lowest angle of
   misorientation. Dislocation distributions within each grain were
   qualitatively obtained from the shapes of the diffraction spots and the
   effect of ``hard{''} and ``soft{''} grains on the crack pathway was
   explored for both 6 h and 18 h specimens. The Schmid factor of one of
   the grains adjacent to the crack at the 6 h and 18 h initiation sites

Abstract = {{Renewable forms of energy, such as biofuels, have the potential to
   displace fossil fuels in a wide variety of applications. Further benefit
   can be achieved through the use of combined heat and power devices, as
   this is accompanied with a considerable increase in energy efficiency
   and lower costs associated with fuel consumption. In this study, we
   examined the performance of a residential microcogeneration system based
   on a Stirling engine and fueled by diesel and ethanol. Run on diesel,
   and on a lower heating value basis, the system achieved a power
   efficiency of 12.1\%, a thermal efficiency of 73.3\%, and a total
   efficiency of 85.4\%. Powered by ethanol, the corresponding efficiencies
   were 11.8\%, 73.9\%, and 85.7\%, respectively. During steady state
   operation, the total unburned hydrocarbon emissions for both fuels were
   negligible, while the particulate emissions for ethanol and diesel were
   found to be 0.40 mg/kWh and 0.42 mg/kWh, respectively. Emissions were
   extremely low, as the combustor features a continuous premixed flame
   that facilitates the complete burnout of already evaporated fuel. Though
   emissions of nitrogen dioxide, methane, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde
   were also negligible for both fuels, carbon monoxide and nitric oxide
   emissions for diesel (71 and 67 mg/m(3), respectively) were much higher
   than those observed for ethanol (50 and 19 mg/m(3), respectively). Lower
   nitric oxide emission levels for ethanol were attributed to its lower
   flame temperature, whereas reductions in carbon monoxide emissions were
   likely a result of a higher degree of fuel/air mixing with ethanol, due
   to higher gas jet velocities of the fuel exiting the orifices of the
   evaporator. Lastly, parametric studies on primary engine set points,
   including coolant temperature and exhaust temperature, were conducted to
   understand their effect on engine performance.}},

Title = {{Bounding the Coding Advantage of Combination Network Coding in

Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{We refer to network coding schemes in which information flows propagate
   along a combination network topology as combination network coding
   (CNC). CNC and its variations are the first network coding schemes
   studied in the literature, and so far still represent arguably the most
   important class of known structures where network coding is nontrivial.
   Our main goal in this paper is to seek a thorough understanding on the
   advantage of CNC in undirected networks, by proving a tight bound on its
   potential both in improving multicast throughput (the coding advantage)
   and in reducing multicast cost under a linear link flow cost model (the
   cost advantage). We prepare three results towards this goal. First, we
   show that the cost advantage of CNC is upper-bounded by 9/8 under the
   uniform link cost setting. Second, we show that achieving a larger cost
   advantage is impossible by considering an arbitrary instead of uniform
   link cost configuration. Third, we show that in a given network
   topology, for any form of network coding, the coding advantage under
   arbitrary link capacity configurations is always upper-bounded by the
   cost advantage under arbitrary link cost configurations. Combining the
   three results together, we conclude that the potential for CNC to
   improve throughput and to reduce routing cost are both upper-bounded by
   a factor of 9/8. The bound is tight since it is achieved in specific
   networks. This result can be viewed as a natural step towards improving
   the bound of 2 proved for the coding advantage of general multicast
   network coding.}},

Abstract = {{We study the secret-key capacity in a joint source-channel coding
   setup-the terminals are connected over a discrete memoryless channel and
   have access to side information, modelled as a pair of discrete
   memoryless source sequences. As our main result, we establish the upper
   and lower bounds on the secret-key capacity. In the lower bound
   expression, the equivocation terms of the source and channel components
   are functionally additive even though the coding scheme generates a
   single secret-key by jointly taking into account the source and channel
   equivocations. Our bounds coincide, thus establishing the capacity, when
   the underlying wiretap channel can be decomposed into a set of
   independent, parallel, and reversely degraded channels. For the case of
   parallel Gaussian channels and jointly Gaussian sources we show that
   Gaussian codebooks achieve the secret-key capacity. In addition, when
   the eavesdropper also observes a correlated side information sequence,
   we establish the secret-key capacity when both the source and channel of
   the eavesdropper are a degraded version of the legitimate receiver. We
   finally also treat the case when a public discussion channel is
   available, propose a separation based coding scheme, and establish its
   optimality when the channel output symbols of the legitimate receiver
   and eavesdropper are conditionally independent given the input.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic with self-similar and heavy-tailed characteristics has been
   widely reported in communication networks, yet, the state-of-the-art of
   analytically predicting the delay performance of such networks is
   lacking. This work addresses heavy-tailed traffic that has a finite
   first moment, but no second moment, and presents end-to-end delay bounds
   for such traffic. The derived performance bounds are non-asymptotic in
   that they do not assume a steady state, large buffer, or many sources
   regime. The analysis follows a network calculus approach where traffic
   is characterized by envelope functions and service is described by
   service curves. The system model is a multi-hop path of fixed-capacity
   links with heavy-tailed self-similar cross traffic at each node. A key
   contribution of the paper is a probabilistic sample-path bound for
   heavy-tailed arrival and service processes, which is based on a
   scale-free sampling method. The paper explores how delay bounds scale as
   a function of the length of the path, and compares them with lower
   bounds. A comparison with simulations illustrates pitfalls when
   simulating self-similar heavy-tailed traffic, providing further evidence
   for the need of analytical bounds.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To explore the influence of taste and trigeminal irritation
   (chemesthesis) on durational aspects of tongue movement in liquid
   swallowing, controlling for the influence of perceived taste intensity.
   Method: Electromagnetic midsagittal articulography was used to trace
   tongue movements during discrete liquid swallowing with 5 liquids:
   water, 3 moderate concentration tastants without odor (sweet, sour,
   sweet-sour), and a high concentration of citric acid (sour taste plus
   chemesthesis). Participants were 33 healthy adults in 2 gender-balanced,
   age-stratified groups (under/over 50). Perceived taste intensity was
   measured using the Generalized Labeled Magnitude Scale (Bartoshuk, 2000;
   Bartoshuk et al., 2004). Tongue movement sequencing and durations of the
   composite tongue movement envelope and component events (rise phase,
   location of first movement peak, release phase) were calculated.
   Results: No obligate sequence of tongue segment movement was observed.
   Overall durations and the timing of the first movement peak were
   significantly longer with water than with the moderate concentration of
   sweet-sour liquid. Perceived taste intensity did not modulate stimulus
   effects in a significant way. The expected pattern of shorter movement
   durations with the high concentration of citric acid was not seen.
   Conclusions: A chemesthetic-taste stimulus of high citric acid did not
   influence the durations of tongue movements compared with those seen
   during the swallowing of moderate concentration tastants and water.}},

Abstract = {{Aiming at the problems of the traditional method of assessing
   distribution of particle size in bench blasting, a support vector
   machines (SVMs) regression methodology was used to predict the mean
   particle size (X-50) resulting from rock blast fragmentation in various

   of blast design parameters, explosive parameters, modulus of elasticity
   and in-situ block size. The seven input independent variables used for
   the SVMs model for the prediction of X-50 of rock blast fragmentation
   were the ratio of bench height to drilled burden (H/B), ratio of spacing
   to burden (S/B), ratio of burden to hole diameter (B/D), ratio of
   stemming to burden (T/B), powder factor (P-f), modulus of elasticity (E)
   and in-situ block size (X-B). After using the 90 sets of the measured
   data in various mines and rock formations in the world for training and
   testing, the model was applied to 12 another blast data for validation
   of the trained support vector regression (SVR) model. The prediction
   results of SVR were compared with those of artificial neural network

Title = {{Diagnosing Network-Wide P2P Live Streaming Inefficiencies}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA COMPUTING COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Large-scale live peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming applications have been
   successfully deployed in today's Internet. While they can accommodate
   hundreds of thousands of users simultaneously with hundreds of channels
   of programming, there still commonly exist channels and times where and
   when the streaming quality is unsatisfactory. In this paper, based on
   more than two terabytes and one year worth of live traces from UUSee, a
   large-scale commercial P2P live streaming system, we show an in-depth
   network-wide diagnosis of streaming inefficiencies, commonly present in
   typical mesh-based P2P live streaming systems. As the first highlight of
   our work, we identify an evolutionary pattern of low streaming quality
   in the system, and the distribution of streaming inefficiencies across
   various streaming channels and in different geographical regions. We
   then carry out an extensive investigation to explore the causes to such
   streaming inefficiencies over different times and across different
   channels/regions at specific times, by investigating the impact of
   factors such as the number of peers, peer upload bandwidth, inter-peer
   bandwidth availability, server bandwidth consumption, and many more. The
   original discoveries we have brought forward include the two-sided
   effects of peer population on the streaming quality in a streaming
   channel, the significant impact of inter-peer bandwidth bottlenecks at
   peak times, and the inefficient utilization of server capacities across
   concurrent channels. Based on these insights, we identify problems
   within the existing P2P live streaming design and discuss a number of
   suggestions to improve real-world streaming protocols operating at a

Abstract = {{This paper is focused on the effect of limestone and calcium sulfate
   content on sulfate resistance of ground granulated blast furnace slag
   (GGBS) blended cement. Sulfate resistance was evaluated using ASTM C
   1012, and a variety of mechanisms of the sulfate resistance of GGBS
   blended cement were revealed by the analyses of hydration products and
   sulfate ion ingress. Although GGBS suppresses sulfate ion ingress, it is
   probable that alumina in GGBS tends to form ettringite with externally
   supplied sulfate ions. Addition of limestone and increase in calcium
   sulfate content allow both monocarboaluminate and ettringite to form
   prior to immersion in sulfate solution. These hydration products remain
   in the hardened cement matrix and act to suppress further formation of
   ettringite with external sulfate ions during immersion in sulfate
   solution. GGBS blended cement with a suitable amount of limestone powder
   and a controlled content of calcium sulfate exhibits markedly long term
   sulfate resistance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable effort has been placed on the development of reliable and
   practical tests to reflect segregation behavior because it is a critical
   property for successful application of self-consolidating concrete
   (SCC). This investigation examines segregation performance measured
   based on the column method, visual stability index and V-funnel
   (t(5)-t(0)) tests and assesses their correlation to mortar band
   thickness, compressive strength, rapid chloride permeability, initial
   sorptivity coefficient, freeze-thaw and salt scaling performance. The
   primary outcomes from this study reveal that: (i) freeze-thaw resistance
   of the studied SCC mixtures is controlled by air entrainment
   irrespective of the extent of segregation; (ii) a wide range of mortar
   band thicknesses occurs at the specified acceptable segregation limit;
   (iii) accurate mortar band analysis using digital images requires strong
   contrast and brightness at the aggregate-paste boundary, and an
   experimental approach for sample preparation and analysis is proposed;
   and (iv) the correlation between mortar band thickness, sorptivity and
   salt scaling mass loss is directly proportional. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A method for achieving electrospray ionization directly from a droplet
   is reported. The electrospray is formed at the tip of a capillary wick
   bonded to a glass substrate with patterned electrodes. The droplet of
   sample solution is delivered to the base of the wick, forming a
   reservoir. Capillary action draws the solution from the reservoir to the
   tip of the wick, continuously replenishing the sample as it is emitted
   via electrospray. No external pressure source is required to drive the
   flow. The glass surface of the substrate is made hydrophobic to ensure
   the integrity of the reservoir. An 8 mu L droplet of 0.4\% (w/v) bovine
   serum albumin solution maintains a steady spray for 1-2 min operating in
   cone-jet mode. The electrospray emitter is compatible with digital
   microfluidic schemes that employ single-plate droplet actuation. (C)

Title = {{Comparative cardiopulmonary effects of size-fractionated airborne

Journal = {{INHALATION TOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{161-171}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Context: Strong epidemiological evidence exists linking particulate
   matter (PM) exposures with hospital admissions of individuals for
   cardiopulmonary symptoms. The PM size is important in influencing the
   extent of infiltration into the respiratory tract and systemic
   circulation and directs the differential physiological impacts.
   Objective: To investigate the differential effects of the
   quasi-ultrafine (PM0.2), fine (PM0.15-2.5), and coarse PM (PM2.5-10)
   size fractions on pulmonary and cardiac function.
   Methods: Female BALB/c mice were exposed to HEPA-filtered laboratory air
   or concentrated coarse, fine, or quasi-ultrafine PM using Harvard
   Ambient Particle Concentrators in conjunction with our nose-only
   exposure system. These exposures were conducted as part of the ``Health
   Effects of Aerosols in Toronto (HEAT){''} campaign. Following a 4 h
   exposure, mice underwent assessment of respiratory function and
   recording of electrocardiograms using the flexiVent (R) system.
   Results: Exposure to coarse and fine PM resulted in a significant
   reduction in quasistatic compliance of the lung. Baseline total
   respiratory resistance and maximum responsiveness to methacholine were
   augmented after coarse PM exposures but were not affected by
   quasi-ultrafine PM exposures. In contrast, quasi-ultrafine PM alone had
   a significant effect on heart rate and in reducing heart rate
   variability.
   Conclusion: These findings indicate that coarse and fine PM influence
   lung function and airways responsiveness, while ultrafine PM can perturb
   cardiac function. This study supports the hypothesis that coarse and
   fine PM exerts its predominant physiologic effects at the site of
   deposition in the airways, whereas ultrafine PM likely crosses the
   alveolar epithelial barrier into the systemic circulation to affect
   cardiovascular function.}},

Title = {{Enzymatic modification of secondary sludge by lipase and laccase to

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF REINFORCED PLASTICS AND COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Secondary sludge from pulp and paper mills can be considered as
   potential filler for composite industry. Enzymatic modifications of the
   waste secondary sludge from pulp and paper mills to reduce the
   hydrophobicity and increase the molecular weight have been carried out
   by lipase and laccase, respectively. The enzymatic modification was
   performed to enhance the reinforcing capability of the secondary sludge
   for further composite production. The lipid content of the secondary
   sludge, which was measured to be 6 +/- 0.5\%, was hydrolyzed by lipase
   from Candida rugosa and the structural changes were followed by Fourier
   transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Laccase from Trametes versicolor
   was tested for its activity and reaction rate in the secondary sludge
   and the alkali-extracted lignin. Characterization of the sludge before
   and after the laccase treatment was carried out by FTIR spectroscopy.
   High pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was applied to
   determine the molecular weight distribution of the lignin samples and
   also as a means for comparing modified and unmodified samples.
   Biokinetic parameters for the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model as a
   function of dissolved oxygen concentrations were determined the K-m
   values to be 3.491 and 2.318 g/m(3) for sludge and the alkali extract,
   respectively. The FTIR results on the laccase-treated secondary sludge
   showed clear changes in the molecular structure, which was mainly
   attributed to the crosslinking reactions and generation of new bonds.
   Moreover, the HPSEC results revealed that laccase modifies the sludge by
   increasing the molecular weight. The manufactured nylon/sludge
   composites showed lower tensile strength for the lipase treated
   sludge/nylon composite. However, the laccase-treated sludge/nylon
   composite showed a statistically significant increase in the mechanical
   strength, which is attributed to the increase in the components
   molecular weight.}},

Abstract = {{The size-effect tunability of colloidal quantum dots enables facile
   engineering of the bandgap at the tune of nanoparticle synthesis. The
   dependence of effective bandgap on nanoparticle size also presents a
   challenge if the size dispersion, hence bandgap variability, is not
   well-controlled within a given quantum dot solid. The impact of this
   polydispersity is well-studied in luminescent devices as well as in
   unipolar electronic transport; however, the requirements on
   monodispersity have yet to be quantified in photovoltaics. Here we carry
   out a series of combined experimental and model-based studies aimed at
   clarifying, and quantifying, the importance of quantum dot
   monodispersity in photovoltaics. We successfully predict, using a simple
   model, the dependence of both open-circuit voltage and photoluminescence
   behavior on the density of small-bandgap (large-diameter) quantum dot
   inclusions. The model requires inclusion of trap states to explain the
   experimental data quantitatively. We then explore using this same
   experimentally tested model the implications of a broadened quantum dot
   population on device performance. We report that present-day colloidal
   quantum dot photovoltaic devices with typical inhomogeneous linewidths
   of 100-150 meV are dominated by surface traps, and it is for this reason
   that they see marginal benefit from reduction in polydispersity. Upon
   eliminating surface traps, achieving inhomogeneous broadening of 50 meV
   or less will lead to device performance that sees very little
   deleterious impact from polydispersity.}},

   emergence of hematopoietic progenitor cells from embryonic stem cells
   (ESCs). First, we assessed the expression of early phenotypic markers of
   mesoderm differentiation (E-cadherin, brachyury (T-GFP). PDGFR alpha,
   and Flk1: +/-ETPF) to reveal that E-T+P+F+ cells have the highest
   capacity for hematopoiesis. Second, we determined how initial aggregate
   size influences the emergence of mesodermal phenotypes (E-T+P+F+,
   E-T-P+/-F+, and E-T-P+F-) and discovered that colony forming cell (CFC)
   output was maximal with similar to 100 cells per PSC aggregate. Finally,
   we introduced these 100-cell PSC aggregates into a low oxygen
   environment (5\%; to upregulate endogenous VEGF secretion) and delivered
   two potent blood-inductive molecules, BMP4 and TPO (bone morphogenetic
   protein-4 and thrombopoietin), locally from microparticles to obtain a
   more robust differentiation response than soluble delivery methods
   alone. Approximately 1.7-fold more CFCs were generated with localized
   delivery in comparison to exogenous delivery, while combined growth
   factor use was reduced 14.2-fold. By systematically engineering the
   complex and dynamic environmental signals associated with the in vivo
   blood developmental niche we demonstrate a significant role for
   inductive endogenous signaling and introduce a tunable platform for
   enhancing PSC differentiation efficiency to specific lineages. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Stem cell transplantation has been suggested as a treatment for
   myocardial infarction, but clinical studies have yet to demonstrate
   conclusive, positive effects. This may be related to poor survival of
   the transplanted stem cells due to the inflammatory response following
   myocardial infarction. To address this, a scaffold-based stem cell
   delivery system was functionalised with anti-inflammatory plasmids
   (interleukin-10) to improve stem cell retention and recovery of cardiac
   function. Myocardial infarction was induced and these functionalised
   scaffolds were applied over the infarcted myocardium. Four weeks later,
   stem cell retention, cardiac function, remodelling and inflammation were
   quantified. Interleukin-10 gene transfer improved stem cell retention by
   more than five-fold and the hearts treated with scaffold, stem cells and
   interleukin-10 had significant functional recovery compared to the
   scaffold control (scaffold: -10+/-7\%, scaffold, interleukin-10 and stem
   cells: +7 +/-6\%). This improved function was associated with increased
   infarcted wall thickness and increased ratios of collagen type III/type
   I, decreased cell death, and a change in macrophage markers from mainly
   cytotoxic in the scaffold group to mainly regulatory in scaffold, stem
   cells and interleukin-10 group. Thus, treatment of myocardial infarction
   with stem cells and interleukin-10 gene transfer significantly improved
   stem cell retention and ultimately improved overall cardiac function.

   Phys Med Rehabil 2012;93:358-66.
   Objectives: To examine the safety, feasibility, and balance performance
   effects of a 4-week home-based balance therapy program using a
   commercially available videogame system.
   Design: A pilot study involving a preintervention and postintervention
   design was conducted with measurements taken at baseline, immediately
   postintervention (week 5), and at follow-up (week 13) for retention.
   Setting: University hospital outpatient clinic and participants' places
   of residence.
   Participants: Children and adolescents with unilateral lower limb
   amputation (n=6; 3 transfemoral {[}TF] and 3 Van Ness) and age-matched,
   typically developing individuals (n=10) for baseline comparison.
   Intervention: Two videogames involving weight shifting in standing were
   each played at home for 20min/d, 4d/wk for a period of 4 weeks. A
   physical therapist provided initial instruction and monitoring.
   Main Outcome Measures: Postural control characteristics using center of
   pressure (COP) displacements during quiet standing; functional balance
   using the Community Balance and Mobility Scale (CB \& M); and
   compliance, safety, and feasibility using custom questionnaires.
   Results: Average playing times for the first 3 weeks ranged from 16.0 to
   21.1 minutes for the 2 games. At baseline, the children and adolescents
   with TF amputation had substantially greater COP displacements than the
   Van Ness group and typically developing children and adolescents.
   Immediately postintervention, the COP displacements decreased in the TF
   amputees, resulting in values that were closer to those of the typically
   developing children. The average increase in CB\&M score from baseline
   to follow-up was 6 points across participants.
   Conclusions: In-home, videogame-based balance training therapies can
   achieve excellent compliance in children and adolescents with lower limb
   amputation. With proper instructions and monitoring, the therapeutic
   intervention can be safely administered. Some improvements in postural
   control characteristics were seen in children and adolescents with
   balance deficits immediately postintervention, but long-term retention
   remains unclear.}},

Abstract = {{From a small 12-station system in 1954 to a full network of four lines
   and 69 stations today, the Toronto metro has become an integral part of
   the city's transportation system. From the opening of the second line in
   1967, ridership and vehicle kilometres operated have increased at
   similar rates at around 4.3\%. After a decrease in the 1990s, ridership
   now increases by 2.59\% annually with more than 200 million passengers
   (i.e., fares collected) in 2008. Transit mode share, however, has nearly
   stagnated at around 22\%, notably due to the significant population
   growth. Today, the system is mainly used for the home to work and home
   to school trips (69\%), which is clearly exhibited from a conventional
   bimodal passenger distribution. Finally, it seems to have performed
   relatively well to date compared to its North American peers.
   Nevertheless, it will likely need to be improved and expanded in the
   near future to accommodate the substantial population growth forecast.}},

Abstract = {{As the dependence on fossil fuel increases in the transportation sector,
   more attention has been paid to the energy management control of proton
   exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
   (PHEVs). In this paper, the energy management control problem for a
   series plug-in PEMFC/Li-ion battery hybrid midsize sedan is formulated
   and investigated using a two-stage controller (TSC). The control
   objective is to minimize hydrogen consumption and simultaneously protect
   PEMFC health. The proposed TSC consists of two controllers designed in
   two stages with different control functions. During the first design
   stage, a predictive controller is developed using the telemetry
   equivalent consumption minimization strategy (T-ECMS) approach to
   predict the global battery state-of-charge (SOC) optimality trend and
   local control reference, without regard for the PEMFC health
   constraints. During the second stage of design, a tracking controller is
   designed to track the local control reference with respect to the PEMFC
   health constraints and other physical limitations at the current control
   step, which ensures that the system follows the optimal battery SOC
   reference over a long time horizon. Finally, the effectiveness of the
   proposed TSC is compared with the T-ECMS and an electric vehicle
   controller (EVC) under the Matlab/Simulink software environment. The
   results demonstrate that the TSC achieves a reasonable tradeoff between
   hydrogen fuel consumption and PEMFC health protection.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorinated solvents are among the most prevalent groundwater
   contaminants in the industrialized world. Biodegradation with
   Dehalococcoides-containing mixed cultures is an effective remediation
   technology. To elucidate transcribed genes in a
   Dehalococcoides-containing mixed culture, a shotgun metagenome
   microarray was created and used to investigate gene transcription during
   vinyl chloride (VC) dechlorination and during starvation (no chlorinated
   compounds) by a microbial enrichment culture called KB-1. In both
   treatment conditions, methanol was amended as an electron donor.
   Subsequently, spots were sequenced that contained the genes most
   differentially transcribed between the VC-degrading and methanol-only
   conditions, as well as spots with the highest intensities. Sequencing
   revealed that during VC degradation Dehalococcoides genes involved in
   transcription, translation, metabolic energy generation, and amino acid
   and lipid metabolism and transport were overrepresented in the
   transcripts compared to the average Dehalococcoides genome. KB-1 rdhA14
   (vcrA) was the only reductive dehalogenase homologous (RDH) gene with
   higher transcript levels during VC degradation, while multiple RDH genes
   had higher transcript levels in the absence of VC. Numerous hypothetical
   genes from Dehalococcoides also had higher transcript levels in
   methanol-only treatments, indicating that many uncharacterized proteins
   are involved in cell maintenance in the absence of chlorinated
   substrates. In addition, microarray results prompted biological
   experiments confirming that electron acceptor limiting conditions
   activated a Dehalococcoides prophage. Transcripts from Spirochaetes,
   Chloroflexi, Geobacter, and methanogens demonstrate the importance of
   non-Dehalococcoides organisms to the culture, and sequencing of
   identified shotgun clones of interest provided information for follow-on
   targeted studies.}},

Abstract = {{The electro-osmotic flow limit of detection and separation efficiency of
   glass channels machined using abrasive jet micromachining (AJM) were
   measured and compared with those for channels machined using
   conventional wet etching with hydrofluoric acid. It was found that the
   electro-osmotic mobility in AJM channels was similar to that in
   wet-etched channels, similar to 4 x 10(-4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for 20 mu m
   channels, despite a two-decade difference in surface roughness.
   Similarly, limits of detection measured on the two types of chips were
   roughly comparable to each other and on the order of 1 nM (injected
   sample concentration). The separation efficiency calculated from TAMRA
   dye injections in AJM channels, however, was found to be significantly
   lower, similar to 0.2-0.25 times, than that in wet-etched channels. The
   effect of surface roughness on the separation efficiency and
   electro-osmotic mobility in micro-channels is discussed in the context
   of the literature. Furthermore, experimental data concerning the effect
   of the AJM process conditions on the surface roughness are presented and
   discussed with the aim of exploring methods to improve surface quality
   in AJM. Commercially available self-adhesive elastomeric masks were
   found to be particularly suitable for rapid prototyping as they provided
   reasonably high resolution and machining flexibility.}},

   users. The econometric model is developed to jointly forecast membership

Abstract = {{Recent advances in wireless communications and mobile networking have
   dramatically increased the popularity of multimedia services for mobile
   users, with wireless video streaming at their fingertips. To facilitate
   efficient acquisition of video content, proxy caching has been widely
   used by wireless service providers (WSPs), which typically deploy cache
   servers at mobile switching centers (MSCs). However, capacity
   provisioning of cache servers is challenging, given the dynamic user
   demands and the limited cache server resources. With increased densities
   of wireless service deployment, it is increasingly common that mobile
   users are covered by more than one WSP within an area. This brings
   opportunities of a collaborative caching paradigm among the cache
   servers deployed at different MSCs. In this paper, we explore the
   benefits of collaborative caching in wireless streaming services,
   addressing both challenges of incentives and truthfulness of selfish
   WSPs. We propose a collaborative mechanism that maximizes the social
   welfare in the context of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auctions, in which
   cache servers cooperate in the trading of their resources in a
   self-enforcing manner. Experimental results demonstrate that superior
   performance can be achieved with respect to the quality of video
   streaming.}},

Abstract = {{An evolutionary algorithm, the estimation of distribution algorithm
   (EDA), is used to reconstruct the objects that buried in planar layered
   media. It is essential that fast forward solvers be used to solve the
   forward scattering problem for the nonlinear inverse scattering methods,
   since it can avoid errors by approximation. The EDA is a predominant
   all-round optimizing method in the macroscopic simulation of evolution
   process species of nature. Recent studies have shown that the EDA
   provides better solution for nonlinear problems than the microscopic
   evolutionary algorithm, such as genetic algorithm (GA) in some cases.
   The EDA is simpler, both computationally and theoretically, than the GA.
   We discuss how this can be used to calculate the permittivity and
   conductivity of the targets. We show preliminary results indicating the
   potential of reconstruction for buried objects. Compared with other
   methods, the experiment result shows that the EDA algorithm reduces the
   number of iteration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes and evaluates a strategy to mitigate the transients

   takes advantage of an approximate model of the system to calculate the
   intermediate set points. SPAACE monitors the trajectory of the variable
   of interest and bases its decisions on the trend of variations of that
   variable and accounts for the inaccuracies and unmodeled dynamics by
   switching the command input between alternative set points. Case studies
   are presented to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of the

Abstract = {{In this paper, an integrated simulation-optimization approach is
   proposed for annual planning of power restoration workforce related to
   an electricity distribution company in a province of Canada. Internal
   and external workforces are employed to perform maintenance actions and
   restore power after interruptions throughout the province. According to
   the electricity distribution network, the province is divided into a
   number of work locations (WL), each having local crews to perform
   maintenance actions and fix power interruptions. However, determining
   the size of the crew in each WL over the year is challenging because of
   high fluctuation in interruption frequency and consequently in projected
   demand during the year. The frequency of interruptions is affected by
   various factors such as geographical location, time calendar, and
   particularly weather conditions. The objective is to determine the
   optimal combination of internal and external workforce over the year to
   cover the interruptions across the province with minimum cost and
   minimum customer interruption duration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the joint design of power control and
   beamforming codebooks for limited-feedback multiple-input single-output
   (MISO) wireless systems. The problem is formulated as the minimization
   of the outage probability subject to the transmit power constraint and
   cardinality constraints on the beamforming and power codebooks. We show
   that the two codebooks need to be designed jointly in this setup, and
   provide a numerical method for the joint optimization. For independent
   and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh channel, we also propose a
   low-complexity approach of fixing a uniform beamforming codebook and
   optimizing the power codebook for that particular beamformer, and show
   that it performs very close to the optimum. Further, this paper
   investigates the optimal tradeoffs between beamforming and power
   codebook sizes. We show that as the outage probability decreases,
   optimal joint design should use more feedback bits for power control and
   fewer feedback bits for beamforming. The jointly optimized beamforming
   and power control modules combine the power gain of beamforming and
   diversity gain of power control, which enable it to approach the
   performance of the system with perfect channel state information as the
   feedback link capacity increases something that is not possible with
   either beamforming or power control alone. (C) 2011 The Franklin

Abstract = {{With lower supply voltages, increased integration densities and higher
   operating frequencies, power grid verification has become a crucial step
   in the very large-scale integration design cycle. The accurate
   estimation of maximum instantaneous power dissipation aims at finding
   the worst-case scenario where excessive simultaneous switching could
   impose extreme current demands on the power grid. This problem is highly
   input-pattern dependent and is proven to be NP-hard. In this paper, we
   capitalize on the compelling advancements in satisfiability (SAT)
   solvers to propose a pseudo-Boolean SAT-based framework that reports the
   input patterns maximizing circuit activity, and consequently peak
   dynamic power, in combinational and sequential circuits. The proposed
   framework is enhanced to handle unit gate delays and output glitches. In
   order to disallow unrealistic input transitions, we show how to
   integrate input constraints in the formulation. Finally, a number of
   optimization techniques, such as the use of gate switching equivalence
   classes, are described to improve the scalability of the proposed
   method. An extensive suite of experiments on ISCAS85 and ISCAS89
   circuits confirms the robustness of the approach compared to
   simulation-based techniques and encourages further research for
   low-power solutions using Boolean SAT.}},

Abstract = {{Stem cell behavior is orchestrated as a multilayered, concert of gene
   regulatory mechanisms collectively referred to as the gene regulatory
   network (GRN). Via cooperative mechanisms, transcriptional, epigenetic,
   and post-transcriptional regulators activate and repress gene expression
   to finely regulate stem cell self-renewal and commitment. Due to their
   tractability, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) serve as the model stem cell
   to dissect the complexities of the GRN, and discern its relation to stem
   cell fate. By way of high-throughput genomic analysis, targets of
   individual gene regulators have been established in ESCs. The
   compilation of these discrete networks has revealed convergent,
   multi-dimensional gene regulatory mechanisms involving transcription
   factors, epigenetic modifiers, non-coding RNA (ncRNA), and RNA-binding
   proteins. Here we highlight the seminal genomic studies that have shaped
   our understanding of the ESC GRN and describe alternate
   post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms that require in depth
   analyses to draft networks that fully model ESC behavior. J. Cell.

Title = {{Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Enhance Chimeric Vessel
   Development Driven by Endothelial Cell-Coated Microtissues}},
Journal = {{TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{285-294}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Adding bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (bmMSCs) to
   endothelialized collagen gel modules resulted in mature vessel
   formation, presumably caused in part by the observed display of
   pericyte-like behavior for the transplanted GFP(+) bmMSCs. A previous
   study determined that rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) delivered on
   the surface of small (similar to 0.8mm long x 0.5mm diameter) collagen
   gel cylinders (microtissues, modular tissue engineering) formed vessels
   after transplantation into immunosuppressed Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats.
   Although the RAECs formed vessels in this allogeneic transplant model,
   there was a robust inflammatory response and the vessels that formed
   were leaky as shown by microcomputed tomography (microCT) perfusion
   studies. In vitro assays showed that SD rat bmMSCs embedded into the
   collagen gel modules increased the extent of EC proliferation and
   enhanced EC sprouting. In vivo, although vessel number was not affected,
   the new vessels formed by the bmMSCs and RAECs were more stable and
   leaked less in the microCT perfusion analysis than vessels formed by
   implanted RAECs alone. Addition of the bmMSCs also decreased the total
   number of CD68(+) macrophages that infiltrated the implant and changed
   the distribution of CD163(+) (M2) macrophages so that they were found
   within the newly developed vascularized tissue. Most interestingly, the
   bmMSCs became smooth muscle actin positive and migrated to surround the
   EC layer of the vessel, which is the location typical of pericytes. The
   combination of these two effects was presumed to be the cause of
   improved vascularity when bmMSCs were embedded in the EC-coated modules.
   Further exploration of these observations is warranted to exploit
   modular tissue engineering as a means of forming large vascularized
   functional tissues using microtissue components.}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we concentrate on the usage of uncertainty associated
   with the level of fuzziness in determination of the number of clusters
   in FCM for any data set. We propose a MiniMax epsilon-stable cluster
   validity index based on the uncertainty associated with the level of
   fuzziness within the framework of interval valued Type 2 fuzziness. If
   the data have a clustered structure, the optimum number of clusters may
   be assumed to have minimum uncertainty under upper and lower levels of
   fuzziness. Upper and lower values of the level of fuzziness for Fuzzy
   C-Mean (FCM) clustering methodology have been found as m = 2.6 and 1.4,
   respectively, in our previous studies. Our investigation shows that the
   stability of cluster centers with respect to the level of fuzziness is
   sufficient for the determination of the number of clusters. (C) 2011

   discriminance in heteroscedastic data, while it reduces to the commonly
   used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in the homoscedastic case.
   Compared to similar heteroscedastic methods, WLSS imposes a low

Abstract = {{The temperature dependence of the solid particle erosion of
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using aluminum oxide particles was
   investigated between the temperatures of -178 and 17 degrees C for a
   variety of angles of attack using a novel cryogenic abrasive jet
   machining apparatus. It was found that the most efficient machining of
   PDMS (volume removed per kinetic energy of erodent) occurred at
   approximately -178 degrees C, at angles of attack between 30 degrees and
   60 degrees from the surface. A previously developed surface evolution
   model was used to predict the size and shape of unmasked channels at
   various temperatures. A good agreement between the predicted and
   measured channel profiles was obtained when the average blasting
   temperature was between approximately -127 and -178 degrees C. At -82
   degrees C, the fit was poorer, probably because of an increase in
   particle embedding. Although it was demonstrated that PDMS could be
   machined at temperatures above its glass transition, the erosion rate
   increased by a factor of more than 10 when the machining temperature was
   below this point. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of Piers-Rubinsztajn conditions was explored for the synthesis
   of silicone polymers bearing pendant triarylamine functionality. We have
   found that up to 60\% of the hydride groups of a silicone copolymer can
   be successfully substituted with a triarylamine moiety, without
   metathesis or redistribution of the silicone. The resulting polymers are
   hydrolytically stable. The functionalization procedure is
   straightforward, conducted under ambient conditions with a simple
   one-step work-up, and avoids the use of a metal-based catalyst. The
   resulting phenylated triarylamine-silicone hybrid polymer was
   characterized by optical absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, CV,
   and differential scanning calorimetry. The hybrids maintain the physical
   appearance of a silicone polymer while adopting the photophysical and
   electrochemical characteristics of the triarylamine.}},

Abstract = {{Phonon transport across a silicon/vacuum-gap/silicon structure is
   modeled using lattice dynamics calculations and Landauer theory. The
   phonons transmit thermal energy across the vacuum gap via atomic
   interactions between the leads. Because the incident phonons do not
   encounter a classically impenetrable potential barrier, this mechanism
   is not a tunneling phenomenon. While some incident phonons transmit
   across the vacuum gap and remain in their original mode, many are
   annihilated and excite different modes. We show that the heat flux due
   to phonon transport can be 4 orders of magnitude larger than that due to
   photon transport predicted from near-field radiation theory.}},

Abstract = {{Current sustained delivery strategies of protein therapeutics are
   limited by the fragility of the protein, resulting in minimal quantities
   of bioactive protein delivered. In order to achieve prolonged release of
   bioactive protein, an affinity-based approach was designed which
   exploits the specific binding of the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain with
   short proline-rich peptides. Specifically, methyl cellulose was modified
   with SH3-binding peptides (MC-peptide) with either a weak affinity or
   strong affinity for SH3. The release profile of SH3-rhFGF2 fusion
   protein from hyaluronan MC-SH3 peptide (HAMC-peptide) hydrogels was
   investigated and compared to unmodified controls. SH3-rhFGF2 release
   from HAMC-peptide was extended to 10 days using peptides with different
   binding affinities compared to the 48 h release from unmodified HAMC.
   This system is capable of delivering additional proteins with tunable
   rates of release, while maintaining bioactivity, and thus is broadly
   applicable.}},

Abstract = {{The first Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) program in North America was recently
   implemented in Ontario, Canada to stimulate the generation of
   electricity from renewable sources. The life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions and economics of electricity generation through anaerobic
   digestion (AD) of household source-separated organic waste (HSSOW) are
   investigated within the FiT program. AD can potentially provide
   considerable GHG emission reductions (up to 1 t CO(2)eq/t HSSOW) at
   relatively low to moderate cost (-\$35 to 160/t CO(2)eq) by displacing
   fossil electricity and preventing the emission of landfill gas. It is a
   cost-effective GHG mitigation option compared to some other FiT
   technologies (e.g., wind, solar :photovoltaic) and provides unique
   additional benefits (waste diversion, nutrient recycling). The
   combination of electricity sales at a premium rate, savings in waste
   management costs, and economies of scale allow AD facilities processing
   >30,000 t/yr to be cost-competitive against landfilling. However, the
   FIT does not sufficiently support smaller-scale facilities that are
   needed as a transition to larger, more economically viable facilities.
   Refocusing of the FiT program and waste policies are needed to support
   the adoption of AD of HSSOW, which has not yet been developed in the
   Province, while more costly technologies (e.g., photovoltaic) have been
   deployed.}},

Abstract = {{The beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases form a large family of ubiquitous
   enzymes that catalyze oxidation of various beta-hydroxy acid substrates
   to corresponding semialdehydes. Several known enzymes include
   beta-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase,
   2-(hydroxymethyl)glutarate dehydrogenase, and phenylserine
   dehydrogenase, but the vast majority of beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases
   remain uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that the predicted
   beta-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase PA0743 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa
   catalyzes an NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of L-serine and methyl-L-serine
   but exhibits low activity against beta-hydroxyisobutyrate. Two crystal
   structures of PA0743 were solved at 2.2-2.3-angstrom resolution and
   revealed an N-terminal Rossmann fold domain connected by a long
   alpha-helix to the C-terminal all-alpha domain. The PA0743 apostructure
   showed the presence of additional density modeled as HEPES bound in the
   interdomain cleft close to the predicted catalytic Lys-171, revealing
   the molecular details of the PA0743 substrate-binding site. The
   structure of the PA0743-NAD(+) complex demonstrated that the opposite
   side of the enzyme active site accommodates the cofactor, which is also
   bound near Lys-171. Site-directed mutagenesis of PA0743 emphasized the
   critical role of four amino acid residues in catalysis including the
   primary catalytic residue Lys-171. Our results provide further insight
   into the molecular mechanisms of substrate selectivity and activity of
   beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases.}},

Abstract = {{The microstrip/negative-refractive-index transmission-line (MS/NRI-TL)
   coupler is constructed by edge coupling a regular microstrip line to a
   backward wave negative-refractive-index transmission line. This coupler
   is primarily operated in the complex-mode band in which the eigenmodes
   are characterised by simultaneous phase progression and attenuation (in
   a lossless structure) and is accompanied by contra-directional power
   flow on the two lines. The complex modes that are excited by the sources
   in this coupler can be controlled independently and by examining the
   multiple reflections of these modes between the two terminal planes, the
   scattering parameters of the corresponding four-port device can be
   derived. Under a first-order approximation, it is determined that the
   MS/NRI-TL coupler is capable of achieving arbitrary coupling levels (by
   increasing the length of the coupler) and very high directivity (by
   making the coupler length equal to an odd multiple of half a guided
   wavelength). Useful nomographs that enable the realisation of MS/NRI-TL
   couplers to meet arbitrary design specifications are included and
   several applications of the coupler are also presented.}},

   structures by barnacle cyprids and other marine organisms is a
   troublesome and costly phenomenon, for which controlling strategies are
   actively sought. In this work, we expand previous investigations about
   the susceptibility of cyprid adhesives to unpurified proteases in
   solution by evaluating the interplay between these secreted biomolecules
   and a surface-confined purified protease. The strategy involved the
   covalent immobilization of the enzyme Subtilisin A to maleic anhydride
   copolymer thin films through the spontaneous reaction of anhydride
   moieties with lysine side chains. This enabled the production of
   bioactive layers of tunable enzyme surface concentration and activity,
   which were utilized to systematically evaluate the effect of the
   immobilized enzyme on cyprid settlement and exploratory behavior.
   Surfaces of increasing enzyme activity displayed a gradual decrease in
   cyprid settlement levels (approaching inhibition) as well as an increase
   in post-settlement adhesion failure (evidenced by significant numbers of
   detached metamorphosed individuals). High activities of the bound enzyme
   also affected pre-settlement behavior of cyprids, reducing the velocity
   and total distance moved while increasing the amount and speed of
   meander compared to the controls. The here-reported low enzyme surface
   concentrations found to be remarkably effective at reducing cyprid
   settlement hold promise for the use of immobilized enzymes in the
   control of marine biofouling.}},

Abstract = {{Structural adaptation of the bone tissue is mediated by loading-induced
   interstitial fluid flow within the bone microstructure. Within this
   framework, osteocytes fulfill the central mechanotransductive role in
   the bone remodeling process. While osteocytes have been demonstrated to
   be exquisitely sensitive to various forms of fluid flow stimulus in
   vitro, the effect of different oscillating fluid flow (OFF) parameters
   on osteocyte activity has yet to be systematically characterized. In
   this study, we investigate the effect of three OFF parameters on
   osteocyte activity in vitro and hypothesize that COX-2. RANKL, and OPG
   mRNA expression in osteocytes are sensitive to the OFF parameters: peak
   shear stress amplitude (0.5 Pa, 1 Pa, 2 Pa, and 5 Pa), oscillating
   frequency (0.5 Hz, 1 Hz, and 2 Hz), and total flow duration (1 h, 2 h,
   and 4 h). Our findings demonstrate that COX-2 mRNA levels are elevated
   in osteocytes subjected to higher peak shear stress amplitudes and
   longer flow durations, while RANKL/OPG mRNA levels decreased to a
   minimum threshold in response to higher peak shear stress amplitudes,
   faster oscillating frequencies, and longer flow durations. These
   findings suggest that dynamic fluid flow with higher peak shear stress
   amplitudes, faster oscillating frequencies, and longer loading durations
   provide the best conditions for promoting bone formation. (C) 2011

   geomaterials incorporating actual material heterogeneity}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Month = {{JAN 6}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical response of geomaterials is highly influenced by
   geometrical and material heterogeneity. To date, most modeling practices
   consider heterogeneity qualitatively and their choice of input
   parameters can be subjective. In this study, a novel approach to combine
   a detailed micro-scale characterization with modeling of heterogeneous
   geomaterials is presented. By conducting grid micro-indentation and
   micro-scratch tests, the instrumented indentation modulus and fracture
   toughness of the constituent phases of a crystalline rock were obtained
   and used as accurate input parameters for the numerical models.
   Additionally, X-ray micro Computed Tomography (CT) was used to obtain
   the spatial distribution of minerals, and thin section analysis was
   performed to quantify the microcrack density. Finally, a Brazilian disc
   test was modeled using a Combined Finite-Discrete element method
   (FEM/DEM) code. Compared with the laboratory results of a sample that
   was initially CT scanned, the simulation results showed that by
   incorporating accurate micromechanical input parameters and the
   intrinsic rock geometric features such as spatial phase heterogeneity
   and microcracks, the numerical simulation could more accurately predict
   the mechanical response of the specimen, including the fracture patterns
   and tensile strength. It is believed that the proposed micromechanical
   approach for evaluating the material properties and the sample geometry
   can be readily applied to other problems to accurately model the
   mechanical behavior of heterogeneous geomaterials. Citation: Mahabadi,

   increases the line tension, dipole density difference, and the

Abstract = {{Force-induced deformation of tissues is transduced to the cytoskeletal
   (CSK) network within cells via focal adhesions. Previous studies have
   characterized transfer of strains of less than 15\% from the substrate
   to the cell, using mitochondria as surrogate markers for CSK
   deformation. However, it is unclear if intracellular strains determined
   from mitochondrial displacement accurately reflect CSK network
   deformation. Furthermore, previous studies have not characterized
   substrate-CSK network strain transfer for strain magnitudes exceeding
   15\%, as can occur in vivo and in cell culture studies. Here, we
   developed and characterized a texture correlation algorithm to address
   the image distortion problem caused by large strain. We then used this
   algorithm to characterize large compressive strain (-40\%) transfer from
   the substrate to the CSK in living cells, using fluorescently tagged
   actin to perform the tracking and both fluorescently tagged actin and
   talin to make validation measurements. With this approach, we were able
   to demonstrate explicitly that substrate strain transfers directly to
   CSK deformation in living cells undergoing large compressive
   deformation, and that the strain transfer ratios are independent of cell
   alignment. The tools and approaches developed here enable improved
   characterization of cell-matrix interactions under large deformation and
   in doing so, may reveal new insights into mechanotransduction mechanisms
   in such circumstances. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An important goal for improved diagnosis and management of infectious
   disease is the development of rapid and accurate technologies for the
   decentralized detection of bacterial pathogens. Most current clinical
   methods that identify bacterial strains require time-consuming culture
   of the sample or procedures involving the polymerase chain
   reaction.(1-3) Neither of these approaches has enabled testing at the
   point-of-need because of the requirement for skilled technicians and
   laboratory facilities. Here, we demonstrate the performance of an
   effective, integrated platform for the rapid detection of bacteria that
   combines a universal bacterial lysis approach and a sensitive
   nanostructured electrochemical biosensor. The lysis is rapid, is
   effective at releasing intercellular RNA from bacterial samples, and can
   be performed in a simple, cost-effective device integrated with an
   analysis chip. The platform was directly challenged with these
   unpurified lysates in buffer and urine. We successfully detected the
   presence of bacteria with high sensitivity and specificity and achieved
   a sample-to-answer turnaround time of 30 min. We have met the clinically
   relevant detection limit of 1 cfu/mu L, indicating that uncultured
   samples can be analyzed. This advance will greatly reduce time to
   successful detection from days to minutes.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, we showed using a computational agent-based model that a
   group of animals moving together can make a collective decision on
   direction of motion, even if there is a conflict between the directional
   preferences of two small subgroups of ``informed{''} individuals and the
   remaining ``uninformed{''} individuals have no directional preference.
   The model requires no explicit signaling or identification of informed
   individuals; individuals merely adjust their steering in response to
   socially acquired information on relativemotion of neighbors. In this
   paper, we show how the dynamics of this system can be modeled
   analytically, and we derive a testable result that adding uninformed
   individuals improves stability of collective decision making. We first
   present a continuous-time dynamic model and prove a necessary and
   sufficient condition for stable convergence to a collective decision in
   this model. The stability of the decision, which corresponds to most of
   the group moving in one of two alternative preferred directions, depends
   explicitly on the magnitude of the difference in preferred directions;
   for a difference above a threshold the decision is stable and below that
   same threshold the decision is unstable. Given qualitative agreement
   with the results of the previous simulation study, we proceed to explore
   analytically the subtle but important role of the uninformed individuals
   in the continuous-time model. Significantly, we show that the likelihood
   of a collective decision increases with increasing numbers of uninformed
   individuals.}},

Abstract = {{This study involves employing solvent refining as a purification process
   in which silicon recrystallization takes place from an iron-silicon
   melt. It is believed that iron will act as the impurity ``getter{''} and
   purified silicon crystals will grow from the alloy melt, while the
   impurities are segregated to the liquid alloy. Phosphorous is a
   problematic impurity to remove since its segregation coefficient in pure
   silicon is relatively large. To assess the feasibility and efficiency of
   phosphorous removal through solvent refining, it is critical to study
   its equilibrium distribution between solid Si and the Fe-Si alloy phase.
   The distribution of phosphorous between solid silicon and iron-silicon
   melt at 1210-1310 degrees C was measured to evaluate the impurity
   removal potential of each alloy. Interaction parameter between
   phosphorous and iron was calculated by varying the concentration of
   phosphorous in silicon.}},

Abstract = {{The paper studies the reach control problem (RCP) to make an affine
   system defined on a polytopic state space reach and exit a prescribed
   facet of the polytope in finite time without first leaving the polytope.
   We introduce the notion of generalized flow conditions, which give a
   necessary and sufficient condition for closed-loop trajectories to exit
   the polytope. In analogy with Lyapunov stability theory, the generalized
   flow condition comprises a functional that decreases along closed-loop
   trajectories. We provide a set of results to analyze whether an instance
   of RCP is solved, without resorting to exhaustive simulation of the
   closed-loop system. This includes a variant of the LaSalle principle
   tailored to RCP. An open problem is to identify suitable classes of
   functionals that give rise to a generalized flow condition. We explore
   functions of the form V (x) = max\{V-i(x)\}, and we give evidence that
   these functions arise naturally when RCP is solved using continuous
   piecewise affine feedbacks.}},

   continuous time by observing a (noisy) stimulus. Their task is to make a

   It is shown that common structural centrality measures based on nodal
   degree or geodesic distance cannot be used to rank the units according
   to their certainty in integrating information. Instead, the variance

   a class of vehicles in SE(3) that are propelled by a thrust vector along
   a single body axis and incorporate some mechanism to induce torques

   signals for an attitude control inner loop. The main result of this
   paper is a set of conditions under which a position controller designed
   for a point-mass system and an attitude controller can be combined to
   form a position controller that almost globally asymptotically
   stabilizes the vehicle to a desired position with desired heading. As
   opposed to the classical backstepping framework, the proposed approach
   is modular, in that position control and attitude control designs are
   completely separate. Thus, for instance, with the proposed technique one
   can employ any attitude controller from the vast literature on attitude
   stabilization, provided it enjoys a basic almost global stability
   property.}},

   distributed control of discrete-event systems in the Ramadge-Wonham
   supervisory control framework. Its essence is the decomposition of
   monolithic (global) control action into local control strategies for the
   individual agents. In this paper, we establish a counterpart supervisor
   localization theory in the framework of State Tree Structures, known to
   be efficient for control design of very large systems. As before, we
   prove that the collective localized control behavior is identical to the
   monolithic optimal (i.e. maximally permissive) and nonblocking
   controlled behavior. Further, we propose a new and more efficient
   localization algorithm which exploits BDD computation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we introduce a continuous-time version of a recently
   proposed decentralized multi-agent optimization scheme. In this scheme,
   a number of networked agents cooperate in locating the optimum of the
   sum of their individual objective functions. Each agent has access only
   to its own objective function and its neighbors' estimates of the
   collective optimum. Under mild assumptions, we derive explicit
   expressions for a lower bound on the algorithm's convergence rate and an
   upper bound on the agents' ultimate estimation error, in terms of
   relevant problem parameters. We build on the analytic techniques we
   previously introduced, in which we treat the evolution of the mean and
   deviation of agents' estimates as two coupled dynamic subsystems, and
   provide a Lyapunov argument for the practical asymptotic stability of
   their interconnection. More generally, this approach turns out to be
   useful in deriving sharper convergence results under weaker assumptions
   in the continuous-time case, as well as in providing an elegant way to
   account for the effects of positive projections that might need to be
   employed by each agent in some applications. Finally, we propose an
   application of this scheme to the design of fully decentralized dual
   resource allocation algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Nickel slags obtained from various smelting furnaces and converters
   differ in terms of their chemical composition and microstructure. The
   microstructure of the slag is largely affected by how fast the slag is
   cooled after being discharged from the furnace. Slow cooling is known to
   promote crystallization and growth of phases such as crystalline
   fayalite (Fe2SiO4), magnetite (Fe3O4) and vitreous silica (SiO2). Slag
   granulation causes rapid solidification of the melt in the form of
   either an amorphous solid or highly intergrown crystalline silicate and
   oxide phases. Smelter slags contain entrapped Ni, Co and Cu in the form
   of dissolved oxides and matte inclusions. Extraction of the entrapped
   metals by high pressure oxidative acid leaching (250 degrees C, 70 g/L
   initial H2SO4, up to 90 psi O-2, 45 min) relies on the dissolution of
   the metal bearing minerals. The impact of the slag microstructure on the
   accessibility of these minerals to leaching, as well as the morphology
   of the produced residues is discussed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{The growing interest for location-based services motivates many
   researchers to study different localization techniques for indoor
   environments. The main objective of these studies is to find a balance
   point between the accuracy of the scheme and its deployment/training
   cost. RSS-based schemes and in particular Graph-based Semi-Supervised
   Learning (G-SSL) constitute a group of techniques which has low setup
   cost and good localization accuracy. In this paper, we analyze the G-SLL
   scheme and show that, despite its high performance, the G-SSL method (in
   its original format) is not a very accurate model for a localization
   problem. Based on this observation and to improve the accuracy of
   localization, we propose an alternative approach which incorporates our
   knowledge of wireless signal propagation into the label propagation
   mechanism. Experimental results are then used to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed scheme compared to the original G-SSL.}},

Abstract = {{Employing centralized resource management schemes is generally
   infeasible in large-scale networks. The deployment of heterogeneous
   Femtocell Access Points (FAPs) over the cellular licensed spectrum is
   therefore challenging. In particular, the resulting inter-node
   interference inhibits the network performance. In this paper, we design
   a hierarchical, distributed, interference management scheme that
   exploits the benefits of clustering. First, in order to reduce the
   cross-tier interference, each FAP independently identifies vacant
   subbands for potential transmission. Then, by exchanging some simple
   messages with its immediate neighbors in an iterative fashion, coalition
   clusters are formed. Given the small population of each group,
   centralized resource management is subsequently performed to avoid
   intra-cluster interference. Different clusters, however, may still share
   a fraction of common idle channels, which degrades system performance.
   Therefore, this paper further considers inter-cluster interference
   management to determine the set of privileged FAPs that can share a
   subband via solving a binary power control optimization problem. While
   the optimal solution requires prohibitive complexity, this paper
   provides tight bounds on the sum rate of the binary power control
   problem. The simulation results show that, in a high interference
   regime, inter-cluster coordination provides a significant performance
   improvement compared to the case of no coordination.}},

Abstract = {{The placement of the access points (APs) has a significant impact on the
   wireless system performance, especially for irregular heterogeneous
   networks with hierarchical APs such as macro/micro base-stations,

   optimization are based on the regular 2D hexagonal cellular topology and
   a set of predefined large-scale propagation models, which is highly
   abstract and may be inaccurate. This paper considers the AP placement
   optimization problem in realistic deployment environments, where
   radio-wave propagation characteristics are accurately modeled using
   ray-tracing techniques. Toward this end, this paper proposes a novel
   concept of area proportional fairness utility for the entire network
   under a given user geographic distribution, and proposes an iterative
   method to optimize the placement of the APs for utility improvement
   while taking into account the mutual interference between the APs. The
   significant benefit of the placement optimization is shown in a

Abstract = {{Complexity and hardware constraints are two essential considerations in
   applying interference mitigation techniques to practical wireless
   systems. This paper considers a practical wireless backhaul network
   composed of several access nodes (AN), each serving several remote
   terminals (RT), and where the transmit frame structure at each AN is
   comprised of multiple zones, with different RTs scheduled on different
   zones. The objective of this paper is to design power control strategies
   to mitigation inter-AN interference in the downlink. Unlike prior
   studies, this paper adopts a practical constraint whereby every AN
   maintains the same power level across the different zones within one
   transmitted frame. The main advantage of imposing this new constraint,
   called the one-power-zone (OPZ) constraint in this paper, is that for a
   class of scheduling policies under which the number of zones assigned to
   each RT is fixed, the power optimization and the scheduling subproblems
   are decoupled under the OPZ constraint. This allows the design of
   efficient power control methods independent of scheduling. Further, it
   also simplifies the design of radio-frequency (RF) front-end. The main
   contribution of this paper is a set of efficient algorithms to solve
   this constrained power control problem based on an iterative function
   evaluation technique. The proposed algorithms have low computational
   complexity, and can be implemented in a distributed fashion. Some of
   these algorithms can be further implemented asynchronously at each AN.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies an uplink multicell joint processing model in which

   interference. This results in an achievable rate region that is easily

   rate regions can only be characterized by exponential number of rate
   constraints. Under the per-base-station SIC framework, this paper
   further studies the impact of the limited-capacity backhaul links on the
   achievable rates and establishes that in order to achieve to within
   constant number of bits to the maximal SIC rate with infinite-capacity
   backhaul, the backhaul capacity must scale logarithmically with the
   signal-to-interference-andnoise ratio (SINR) at each base-station.
   Finally, this paper studies the optimal backhaul rate allocation problem
   for an uplink multicell joint processing model with a total backhaul
   capacity constraint. The analysis reveals that the optimal strategy that
   maximizes the overall sum rate should also scale with the log of the
   SINR at each base-station.}},

Abstract = {{A scanning reference electrode technique (SRET) apparatus has been

   spot welds (FSSW) made in AZ31 magnesium alloys. The operational
   parameters of the apparatus have been calibrated to give adequate
   spatial resolution. By combining the SRET data with material flow data
   and immersion test data it was found that the FSSW process causes the
   formation of distinct noble and active regimes within the weld area. The
   noble region is aligned with the stir zone (SZ) and is caused by a
   dynamically recrystallized grain structure which are void of
   dislocations/twins, and beta Mg17Al12. Localized corrosion attack was
   observed in both SRET and immersion testing along the
   thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ). The same effect was
   consistently observed with a flat versus concave shoulder tool, and
   dwell times of 1s and 4s.}},

Abstract = {{A combined numerical and experimental investigation of coalescence of
   droplets of highly viscous liquids dropped on a surface has been carried
   out. Droplets of 87 wt\% glycerin-in-water solutions with viscosity 110
   centistokes were deposited sequentially in straight lines onto a flat,
   solid steel plate and droplet impact photographed. Impacting droplets
   spread on the surface until liquid surface tension and viscosity
   overcame inertial forces and the droplets recoiled, eventually reaching
   equilibrium. Droplet center-to-center distance was varied and droplet
   line length was measured from photographs. As droplet spacing was
   increased there was less interaction between the droplets. A three
   dimensional parallel code has been developed to simulate fluid flow and
   free surface interaction by solving the continuity, momentum and
   volume-of-fluid (VOF) equations. The two-step projection method was
   employed to solve the governing equations for the whole domain including
   both liquid and air phases. The continuum-surface-force (CSF) scheme was
   applied to model surface tension and the
   piecewise-linear-interface-construction (PLIC) technique used to
   reconstruct the free surface. Computer generated images of impacting
   droplets modeled droplet shape evolution correctly and compared well
   with photographs taken during experiments. Accurate predictions were
   obtained for droplet line length during spreading and at equilibrium.}},

Abstract = {{A parallel GPU compatible Lagrangian mesh free particle solver for
   multiphase fluid flow based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
   scheme is developed and used to capture the interface evolution during

   domain is discretized using fluid particles. Surface tension is modeled
   employing the multiphase scheme of Hu et al. In order to precisely
   simulate the wetting phenomena, a method based on the work of Sikalo et
   al. is used and compared to ensure accurate dynamic contact angle
   calculation. Using this method, accurate perditions were obtained for
   droplet contact angle during equilibrium and spreading. A simple
   analytical model is developed to predict maximum droplet spread diameter
   after impact. Solver predictions agreed well to analytical results. To
   improve stability and performance of the solver, a customized reduction
   algorithm is used on the shared memory of GPU. Speedup using a variety
   of different memory management algorithms on GPU-CPU is studied. The
   proposed algorithm is validated using the Rayleigh-Taylor instability
   test. Droplet impact simulations are compared side by side against a
   Volume of Fluid (VOF) solver to ensure accuracy and robustness. GPU
   speed ups of up to 120 times faster than a single processor CPU were

Abstract = {{In this work, we use the lattice Boltzmann method to study inertial flow
   in three-dimensional random fibrous porous materials. In order to
   validate the methodology, inertial flow in two-dimensional hexagonal
   arrangements of circular cylinders is simulated, and the results are
   compared against those previously reported in the literature. The
   three-dimensional fibrous porous materials are then constructed by
   randomly placing straight cylindrical fibers inside the computational
   domain. Inertial effects are studied systematically for a wide range of
   pore Reynolds numbers in materials with porosities between 0.60 and
   0.95. A previously proposed semi-empirical relation is modified to
   represent the inertial effects in three-dimensional fibrous materials.
   Three distinct regimes of constant, quadratic, and linear relations
   between the inverse of the permeability and pore Reynolds number are
   observed for both two- and three-dimensional simulations. The critical
   Reynolds number, beyond which the inertial effects are strong and this
   relation is linear, is shown to be smaller in three-dimensional
   simulations, when compared to the critical Reynolds number in
   two-dimensional simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The adhesion of solid wax ink droplets to porous polyethylene and Teflon
   substrates was studied experimentally. Wax droplets with a diameter of 3
   mm and an initial temperature of 110 degrees C were dropped onto test
   surfaces from heights varying from 20-50 mm The Teflon surfaces had
   holes drilled in them to create idealized porous surfaces while the
   porous polyethylene sheets had mean pore sizes of either 35 or 70 mu m.
   The force required to remove the wax splats from the substrates was
   measured by a pull test. The detachment force increased with droplet
   impact velocity. A simple analytical model is proposed to predict the
   force attaching the wax splat to the surface: it has an adhesive
   component, calculated by multiplying the contact area between the splat
   and substrate by the strength of adhesion; and a cohesive component,
   calculated by multiplying the area of the pores into which wax
   penetrates by the ultimate tensile strength of wax. Predictions from the
   model agreed reasonably well with measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Pneumatic flow focusing technology is a relatively new atomizing process
   first introduced in 1998. A liquid microjet is formed by a high speed
   co-flowing gas stream when a pressure drop is applied across an orifice.
   The microjet eventually disintegrates into fine droplets by the
   perturbing gas downstream of the atomizer exit. Under certain controlled
   flow regimes the resulting spray demonstrates strong monodispersity. In
   the present study, the gas flow is numerically modeled by a compressible
   turbulent flow solver and the liquid jet evolution is captured using
   Volume of Fluid (VOF) interface tracking method. Jet breakup parameters
   and drop size distribution are studied for different liquids and flow
   rates. Results are in good agreement with experiments and theoretical
   models.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a comprehensive analytical and numerical study of
   conductive and convective heat transfer through high porosity metal
   foams is presented. In the first part a novel theoretical model for
   determination of effective thermal conductivity of metal foams is
   introduced. This general analysis can be applied to any complex array of
   interconnected foam cells. Assuming dodecahedron unit cell for modeling
   the structure of metal foams, an approximate equation for evaluation of
   effective thermal conductivity of foam with a known porosity is
   obtained. In this approximation method, unlike the previous
   two-dimensional (2D) models, porosity is the only geometric input
   parameter used for evaluation of effective thermal conductivity, while
   its predictions of effective thermal conductivity are in excellent
   agreement with the previous models. In the second part a 3D numerical
   model for conduction in metal foam is constructed. The foam has a square
   cross section and is exposed to constant temperature at both ends and
   constant heat flux from the sides. We assume local thermal equilibrium
   (LTE), i.e., the solid and fluid temperatures are to be locally equal.
   Comparison of the 3D numerical results to the experiments shows very
   good agreement. The last part of the study is concerned with the 3D
   numerical modeling of convective heat transfer through metal foams.
   Experimentally determined values of permeability and Forchheimer
   coefficient for 10 pores per inch (PPI) nickel foam are applied to the
   Brinkman-Forchheimer equation to calculate fluid flow through the foam.
   Local thermal equilibrium (LTE) and local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE)
   methods were both employed for heat transfer simulations. While LTE
   method resulted in faster calculations and also dia not need surface
   area to volume ratio (a(sf)) and internal convective coefficient
   (h(sf/)) as its input, it was not accurate for high temperatures. LTNE
   should be used to obtain distinct local solid and fluid temperatures.}},

   X-ray radiography to quantify liquid water in gas diffusion layers

   micro-porous layers (MPLs), were employed and imaged during the
   operation. Performance data and x-ray images of these GDLs are compared
   to determine the impact of an MPL on water management. At low current
   density (<0.4A/cm(2)) under high stoichiometric ratio, the MPL has
   little overall effect, but may behave as a diffusion barrier for
   reactants. At higher current density (0.6A/m(2)) and under low
   stoichiometric ratios, the MPL is observed to significantly affect the
   water management of the PEMFC and is credited for increased cell
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Socially assistive robots can engage in assistive human-robot
   interactions (HRI) by providing rehabilitation of cognitive, social, and
   physical abilities after a stroke, accident or diagnosis of a social,
   developmental or cognitive disorder. However, there are a number of
   research issues that need to be addressed in order to design such
   robots. In this paper, we address one main challenge in the development
   of intelligent socially assistive robots: A robot's ability to identify
   human non-verbal communication during assistive interactions. In this
   paper, we present a unique non-contact automated sensory-based approach
   for identification and categorization of human upper body language in
   determining how accessible a person is to a robot during natural
   real-time HRI. This classification will allow a robot to effectively
   determine its own reactive task-driven behavior during assistive
   interactions. The types of interactions envisioned include providing
   reminders, health monitoring, and social and cognitive therapies.
   Preliminary experiments show the potential of integrating the proposed
   body language recognition and classification technique into socially
   assistive robotic systems partaking in HRI scenarios.}},

   MU-MIMO system with imperfect channel state information (CSI) feedback.
   The CSI feedback for scheduling is considered as a channel direction
   quantization with feedback delay effect. Inspired by the conventional
   zeroforcing (ZF) based user scheduling, we present an improved user
   selection scheme by using a modified signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio
   (SLNR) based metric under only quantized CSI feedback with a channel
   quality information (CQI) indicator. Different from the traditional
   ZF-based beamforming(BF), we find that a simple channel-norm based CQI
   feedback will be sufficient for our modified SLNR-based scheduling.
   Numerical results show the effectiveness of our proposed scheduling
   under outdated and quantized CSI feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Lead user methods were applied to develop product design principles that
   encourage environmentally conscious behaviours in individuals. Old Order
   Mennonites (OOMs) were chosen as lead users because of their low
   resource consumption lifestyles. Ethnographic analysis revealed that
   discretizing resource consumption facilitates and encourages
   conservation behaviours in OOMs. An experimental study demonstrated the
   effectiveness of discretization in reducing water consumption. We
   postulate several distinct ways in which discretization encourages
   conservation behaviours. We conclude with insights on how discretization
   can be integrated into the design of modern products to encourage
   environmentally conscious behaviour in the general population.}},

Abstract = {{An emerging research trend has seen concepts from cognitive psychology
   applied to enhance the creative design process through a more detailed
   understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms. However, the
   physiological processes by which the human element achieves creative
   solutions have only recently received significant attention.
   Understanding the mechanisms that allow the brain to change in response
   to experience may have implications for creative thought processes.
   Long-term potentiation (LTP) is one such mechanism, and has already been
   implicated in learning and memory development. This paper presents a
   theoretical-physiological explanation of creativity, implicating LTP as
   a modulator of neural networks. The proposed model is applied to explain
   existing creativity phenomena, including fixation, incubation, and
   obstacles in design-by-analogy. The model is then used to describe
   existing, and propose new methods for overcoming obstacles to creativity
   in design. The results of a study, which tested one application of the
   theory the effect of physical activity on fixation, are also discussed.}},

   Subsequent work explored the use of affordances, defined as
   context-dependent relations between artifacts and users, in lieu of
   functions as a basis for design. While others have also developed
   detailed deductive methods of discovering affordances in products, we
   present affordance listing as an expedient technique for inductively
   discovering relevant affordances. We also present affordance transfer, a
   method for redesigning products to encourage environmentally significant
   behavior. We conclude by discussing insights gained from applying our
   two approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Categorizing biological information can be subjective and ambiguous,
   which poses challenges for indexing potentially useful biological
   information for design. Therefore, we explored collective categorization
   to study the categorization task. After gathering 163 examples of
   biological transformation, we asked four participants to independently
   categorize the examples using self-selected approaches. A computational
   algorithm was used to quantify the relatedness between the groups that
   each participant created. The results confirmed that participants had
   different perspectives in interpreting and categorizing biological
   information. However, the collective categorization method could reveal
   meaningful semantics in biological information such as hierarchical,
   synonymous, or causal relations. The relations discovered could lead to
   developing formal representations or learning unique patterns in
   biological phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{The desire to better understand design cognition has led to the
   application of literature from psychology to design research, e.g., in
   learning, analogical reasoning, and problem solving. Psychological
   research on cognitive heuristics and biases offers another relevant body
   of knowledge for application. Cognitive biases are inherent, biases in
   human information processing, which can lead to suboptimal reasoning.
   Cognitive heuristics are unconscious rules utilized to enhance the
   efficiency of information processing and are possible antecedents of
   cognitive biases. This paper presents two studies that examined the role
   of confirmation bias, which is a tendency to seek and interpret evidence
   in order to confirm existing beliefs. The results of the first study, a
   protocol analysis involving novice designers engaged in a biomimetic
   design task, indicate that confirmation bias is present during concept
   generation and offer additional insights into the influence of
   confirmation bias in design. The results of the second study, a
   controlled experiment requiring participants to complete a concept
   evaluation task, suggest that decision matrices are effective tools to
   reduce confirmation bias during concept evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion modeling and recognition has drawn extensive attention from
   disciplines such as psychology, cognitive science, and, lately,
   engineering. Although a significant amount of research has been done on
   behavioral modalities, less explored characteristics include the
   physiological signals. This work brings to the table the ECG signal and
   presents a thorough analysis of its psychological properties. The fact
   that this signal has been established as a biometric characteristic
   calls for subject-dependent emotion recognizers that capture the
   instantaneous variability of the signal from its homeostatic baseline. A
   solution based on the empirical mode decomposition is proposed for the
   detection of dynamically evolving emotion patterns on ECG.
   Classification features are based on the instantaneous frequency
   (Hilbert-Huang transform) and the local oscillation within every mode.
   Two experimental setups are presented for the elicitation of active
   arousal and passive arousal/valence. The results support the
   expectations for subject specificity, as well as demonstrating the
   feasibility of determining valence out of the ECG morphology (up to 89
   percent for 44 subjects). In addition, this work differentiates for the
   first time between active and passive arousal, and advocates that there
   are higher chances of ECG reactivity to emotion when the induction
   method is active for the subject.}},

Abstract = {{The method of analysis is a combination of Sander's thin shell theory
   and the classic finite element method where the nodal displacements are
   found from the exact solution of shell governing equations rather than
   approximated by polynomial functions. Piston theory with and without a
   correction factor for curvature is applied to derive aerodynamic damping
   and stiffness matrices. The influence of stress stiffness due to
   internal pressure and axial loading is also taken into account.
   Aeroelastic equations in hybrid finite element formulation are derived
   and solved numerically. Different boundary conditions of the shell,
   geometries and flow parameters are investigated. In all study cases the
   shell loses its stability due to coupled-mode flutter. The present study
   shows efficient and reliable results which can be applied for
   aeroelastic design and analysis of shells of revolution in aerospace

Abstract = {{This paper studies the development of new multifunctional liquid crystal
   polymeric composites filled with graphene nano platelets (GNPs) for
   electronic packaging applications. A series of parametric studies were
   conducted to study the effect of GNP content on the thermal conductivity
   of LCP-based nanocomposites. Graphene, ranging from 10 wt. \% to 50 wt.
   \%, were melt-compounded with LCP using a twin-screw compounder. The
   extrudates were ground and compression molded into small disc-shaped
   specimens. The thermal conductivity of LCP matrix was observed to have
   increased by more than 1000\% where as the electrical conductivity
   increased by 13 orders of magnitude with the presence of 50 wt\% GNP
   fillers. The morphology of the composites was analyzed using SEM
   micrographs to observe the dispersion of filler within the matrix. These
   thermally conductive composites represent potential cost-effective
   materials. to injection mold three-dimensional, net-shape
   microelectronic enclosures with superior heat dissipation performance.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the piezoresistive behavior of polyethylene (PE)
   composites containing different types of nano-particle fillers. The

   dispersed in PE through melt blending in concentrations ranging between
   0.5-10 wt\%. The lowest percolation threshold and highest electrical
   conductivity was found for SWNT composites, followed by MWNT and GNP.
   The piezoresistance of the nano-particle-PE composites was investigated
   and a negative piezoresistance behavior was observed signifying a
   reducing mean inter-particulate distance in the composites. The highest
   sensitivity was exhibited by MWNT and SWNT composites at compositions
   closer to the percolation threshold. The time dependence of
   piezoresistivity was also investigated through stress relaxation and

Abstract = {{Software investments are increasingly important to remain competitive in
   modern manufacturing. However, wood product industries generally make
   minimal information technology (IT) investments and are slow adopters.
   This study determines the types of software that could contribute the
   most to the future competitiveness of the Canadian cabinet industry
   using industry and IT expert input into an Analytic Network Process
   model. Findings include the following. The Quality strategy is the most
   crucial for the industry's future competitiveness, with a normalized
   weight of 0.332, and the Delivery strategy is the least important
   (0.111). For software, Operations \& Engineering and Enterprise Resource
   Management applications are the most important, having final priorities
   of 0.227 and 0.222, respectively. Content applications are relatively
   unimportant (0.087). The sensitivity analysis indicates that the results
   are robust for varying weights of all strategies except Customer
   Service. A higher emphasis on the Customer Service strategy increases
   the priority of the Customer Relationship Management and Collaboration
   applications to the first and the second-highest priority, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional blind image iterative algorithms are designed for Gaussian
   noise by using the L-2-norm error term. For robustness against the
   influence of non-Gaussian noise, an efficient projected subgradient
   algorithm for blind image deconvolution is developed, based on a TV cost
   function with the L-1-norm error term. Because of using the subgradient
   technique, the proposed subgradient algorithm can minimize the L-1-TV
   cost function directly. By contrast, existing L-1 norm-based image
   restoration algorithms only minimize the approximate L-1 cost function
   and assume a known blur. Illustrative examples show that under
   suboptimal regularization parameters, the projected subgradient
   algorithm is efficient in producing better image estimate than two
   traditional blind image iterative algorithms in terms of both ISNR and

Abstract = {{The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is a power generating technology that
   can enable the utilization of waste heat to generate electric power from
   different sources, including geothermal hot springs, other power
   generating technologies, and industrial applications. There is a
   significant technical challenge in producing financially viable ORC
   plants, due to the high costs associated with custom heat exchange
   components and turbo-machinery. In the last few years, however, packaged
   systems have been developed from commercially available refrigeration
   systems, which significantly reduce cost. The goal of this project was
   to evaluate the feasibility of generating electricity using the waste
   heat from industrial air compression equipment. A simulation program was
   written to model the thermodynamics of the ORC. Several potential
   working fluids were surveyed and ranked based on their applicability to
   the industrial operating conditions. In particular, refrigerant R-236fa
   has been determined to be the most appropriate working fluid. The
   decision was made by weighing its thermal properties, as well as
   environmental and health considerations. Two types of heat rejection
   technology were considered, namely water-cooling and air-cooling, with
   emphasis on the effect of ambient conditions on ORC performance. It is
   concluded that water-cooling can be used for a plant located in Ontario,
   Canada, with the possibility of utilizing air-cooling during the cooler
   seasons of the year. An installation cost of U.S. \$1,300/kW is
   feasible, yielding a simple payback period of 6.35 years. The results of
   this research project encourage further work to be done on this
   application of waste heat recovery.}},

Abstract = {{A feasibility study has been conducted for an organic Rankine cycle
   (ORC) system coupled to the exhaust of a Diesel engine generator. The
   objective of this study was to determine the possible electrical
   generation of the ORC using the exhaust gas of a 78 kW diesel engine as
   its energy input. A thermodynamic model was developed to predict the
   possible electricity generation of the ORC. Using this model it was
   determined that the preferred working fluid for the ORC was R245ca. The
   calculated maximum ORC thermal efficiency was 14.3\%. The net electrical
   power generated from the ORC was 5.36 kWe. The ORC would require no
   additional fuel and would not generate any additional emissions. The
   most cost-effective and simple means to develop a small packaged ORC
   system is to high volume production HVAC system components. An ORC
   system consisting of air conditioning system components, including a
   scroll expander, yielded a projected ORC efficiency of 10.7\%, and a net
   electrical power of 4.02 kWe. The total capital cost of the ORC system
   was \$2,140 CAD. Three engine usage scenarios were developed, with the
   time to payback of the initial capital cost of the ORC ranging from 12.8
   to 0.58 years, depending on low or high usage.}},

Abstract = {{In current and next-generation semiconductor electronic devices,
   sub-continuum heat transfer effects and non-uniform power distribution
   across the die surface lead to large temperature gradients and localized
   hot spots on the die. These hot spots can adversely affect device
   performance and reliability. In this work, we propose an enhanced method
   for thermal map prediction that considers sub-continuum thermal
   transport effects and show their impact in floor plan optimization.
   Sub-continuum effects are expressed in terms of an effective thermal
   conductivity. We introduce and calibrate a 2D thermal model of the die
   for fast simulation of thermal effects under non-uniform power
   generation scenarios. The calibrated 2D model is then used to study the
   impact of the effective thermal conductivity on the thermal map
   prediction and floor plan optimization. Results show that sub-continuum
   effects radically change both the predicted thermal performance and the
   optimal floor plan configurations.}},

Abstract = {{An unstructured, three-dimensional pore network model is employed to
   describe the effect of through-plane porosity profiles on liquid water
   saturation within the gas diffusion layer (GDL) of the polymer
   electrolyte membrane fuel cell. Random fibre placements are based on the
   porosity profiles of six commercially available GDL materials recently
   obtained through x-ray computed tomography experiments. The pore space
   is characterized with a maximal ball algorithm, and invasion
   percolation-based simulations are performed. It is shown that water
   tends to accumulate in regions of relatively high porosity due to the
   lower associated capillary pressures. It is predicted that GDLs tailored
   to have smooth porosity profiles will have fewer pockets of high
   saturation levels within the bulk of the material. The results provide a
   more detailed picture of the possible water distributions in GDLs during
   operation.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering is an emerging alternative treatment for various
   diseases and injuries. The use of hydroxapatite composites for
   bioscaffolds has shown to improve the osteoconductivity. Studies in the
   literature have been performed to examine the advantages of using this
   composite in the biological aspects of tissue engineering; however, few
   studies have been on the synthesis and mechanical properties of these
   bioscaffolds. These properties are especially important in load bearing
   applications like in bone tissue engineering. In this study,
   poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) acid (PLGA) and hydroxyapatite (HA) were
   used to fabricate gas-foamed/salt leached scaffolds. Micro and
   nano-scaled HA particles were melt-compounded with PLGA using a
   twin-screw compounder. The composite material was dry blended with salt
   particles at a salt-to-polymer mass ratio of 5:1. From observations of
   micrographs taken with a scanning electron microscope, both the micro
   and nano-HA particles were shown to be well dispersed within the polymer
   matrix. The thermal properties were examined using differential scanning
   calorimetry, and the effect of the compositions on the glass transition
   temperature, T-g, was studied. The T-g was not significantly changed
   with the addition of HA particles from 0 to 20 wt\%. Similarly,
   thermogravimetric analysis showed that the thermal degradation
   temperature remained at approximately 320 degrees C. The mechanical
   properties of the scaffolds were tested in compression. At the same
   composition, the scaffolds fabricated with the nano-HA showed an
   increase in modulus and strength. The results found in this study are
   important in developing novel biodegradable scaffolds with a focus on
   improving the mechanical properties of the scaffolds for bone tissue
   engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{Current tissue engineering scaffolds created by electrospinning
   techniques are mostly limited to a 2D membrane. In this study, a novel
   method to fabricate 3D fibrous scaffolds is presented, and a parametric
   study to identify the optimal processing parameters was performed. The
   fabrication technique uses a batch foaming setup to saturate the fibrous
   scaffolds with CO2 to lower the glass transition temperature of PLGA to
   allow for the sintering of the fibers. When a mechanical pressure was
   applied to multiple layers of the thin films in the presence of gas, the
   layers of PLGA scaffolds sinter to form a thick 3D fibrous structure.
   This study was divided into three parts. First, the effect of gas
   saturation on the scaffolds was examined. Three saturation pressures of
   200, 300, and 400 psi and multiple saturation times of 1, 3, 5, 30, 60,
   and 120 minutes were used. At the lowest pressure of 200 psi, the
   morphology and mechanical properties of the scaffolds were not affected.
   As saturation pressure and time were increased, the fibers sintered, and
   eventually the fibrous structure was lost because the polymer was
   over-sintered. The second part of the study was to determine the
   adhesion properties of the scaffolds using gas pressure. The same
   processing pressures and times were used for this set of experiments,
   and a higher pressure was found to better adhere the layers of PLGA
   films together. From the first two parts of this study, the optimal
   combination of processing parameters was determined to be saturating the
   samples under 400 psi of pressure for three minutes. This set of
   parameters was then used in the third part of the study to fabricate 3D
   fibrous scaffolds. The demonstration of this ability to fabricate 3D
   scaffolds improves on current electrospinning techniques while
   maintaining a desirable fibrous structure for tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{An aneurysm is a bulge or localized dilation of an artery that can
   result in rupture, rapid blood loss, and death. Endovascular aneurysm
   repair (EVAR) is a minimally-invasive surgical technique that involves
   delivery of a stent-graft from within the blood vessels. The metallic
   stents anchor and support the graft (fabric tube), through which blood
   flow is contained and directed. This relieves the pressure on the
   weakened aneurysm wall. When the stent-graft is too long for a given
   patient, the redundant (extra) length adopts a convex configuration in
   the aneurysm. Based on clinical experience, we hypothesize that
   redundant stent-graft configurations increase the downward force acting
   on the device thereby increasing the risk of device dislodgement and
   failure.
   This work numerically studies both steady-state and physiologic
   pulsatile blood flow in redundant stent-graft configurations.
   Computational fluid dynamics simulations predicted peak downward
   displacement force for the zero-, moderate- and severe-redundancy
   configurations of 7.49, 7.65 and 8.04 N, respectively for steady-state
   flow; and 7.55, 7.70 and 8.31 N, respectively for physiologic pulsatile
   flow.
   These results suggest that redundant stent-graft configurations in EVAR
   do increase the downward force acting on the device, but the clinical
   consequence depends significantly on device-specific resistance to
   dislodgement.}},

Abstract = {{The bulk thermal conductivity of Lennard-Jones argon and
   Stillinger-Weber silicon is predicted using the Green-Kubo (GK) and
   direct methods in classical molecular dynamics simulations. While
   system-size independent thermal conductivities can be obtained with less
   than 1000 atoms for both materials using the GK method, the linear
   extrapolation procedure {[}Schelling et al. Phys. Rev. B 65, 144306
   (2002)] must be applied to direct method results for multiple system
   sizes. It is found that applying the linear extrapolation procedure in a
   manner consistent with previous researchers can lead to an
   underprediction of the GK thermal conductivity (e.g., by a factor of 2.5
   for Stillinger-Weber silicon at a temperature of 500 K). To understand
   this discrepancy, phonon properties are predicted from lattice dynamics
   calculations, and from these, length-dependent thermal conductivities.
   These results show that the linear extrapolation procedure is only
   accurate when the minimum system size used in the direct method
   simulations is comparable to the largest mean free paths of the phonons
   that dominate the thermal transport. This condition has not typically
   been satisfied in previous works.}},

Abstract = {{The process of microassembly often involves the manipulation and
   grasping of complex micro-sized objects. These micro-objects are
   generally initially placed at random orientations in the plane when
   transferred to an assembly workstation. The part orientations must be
   corrected in order for the gripper to grasp them. Visual monitoring
   feedback is commonly used to assist in the re-orientation and
   manipulation process. However, due to the very limited field of view of
   imaging systems used in micro-assembly, the target micro-object may not
   remain within the viewable area during the re-orientation processes.
   This paper presents an integrated controller algorithm to automatically
   rotate micro-objects to the desired orientation in the plane for
   grasping. This novel algorithm incorporates the technique of dynamic
   tracking to prevent the target micro-object from shifting outside of the
   viewable area during the re-orientation process. As the micro-object is
   rotated to correct its orientation, the algorithm will evaluate the
   required translational inputs in order to maintain the micro-object
   within the field of view. To minimize the delay due to feedback control,
   the proposed algorithm employs the principle of Kalman filter estimation
   to track and project the motion at the next sampling interval. The
   proposed algorithm was evaluated experimentally with a microassembly
   operation using an in-house micro-manipulator. Results from the
   experiments showed that the proposed tracking algorithm was capable of
   tracking and maintaining the targeted micropart at the specified
   location with an error of within +1-15 pixels.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the loss due to distributed nature of relay beamforming in an
   amplify-and-forward relay network. The optimal relay beamforming in both
   centralized multi-antenna single relay scenario and distributed
   single-antenna multi-relay scenario are compared in terms of SNR, where
   individual antenna/relay power budgets are assumed to account for the
   realistic practical constraints. For centralized relay beamforming, we
   show that the optimal beamforming for SNR maximization can be obtained
   by relay per-antenna power minimization along with bi-section search.
   Comparing the SNR under distributed and centralized relay beamforming,
   we show that distributed beamforming incurs no loss when relaying is
   noiseless. For noisy relaying, numerical results show that the loss due
   to distributed processing is around 1-2dB for two to eight relays (or
   antennas) at the practical SNR of interests. Next, we consider the total
   in-network power minimization of the source and the multi-antenna relay
   under pernote per-antenna power constraints, disallowing ``power
   sharing{''} among nodes and/or antennas. We proposed a heuristic
   iterative approach. Simulation shows that significant power saving can
   be made for joint in-network power minimization at both source and
   relay.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been increasingly considered an
   attractive solution for a plethora of applications, such as unattended
   event monitoring and tracking. Energy consumption is one of the looming
   challenges that threaten the successful deployment of these networks,
   especially when they are designed to operate unattended for long periods
   of time. In this paper, we are introducing an Energy-Aware Opportunistic
   Routing protocol (EAOR), for Wireless Sensor Networks, which keeps a
   balance between the Quality of Service (QoS) and the energy efficiency.
   The main objective is to maximize network lifespan without increasing
   the packet delay. We conduct experiments by simulations to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed protocol against existing ones, in terms of
   throughput and energy consumption. The experimental results demonstrated
   that the proposed protocol can deliver better energy distribution,
   extends the network lifetime up to 25\% compared to simple opportunistic
   routing protocols and decreases the total energy consumption by 35\%
   compared to traditional routing.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a theoretical model is developed to simulate the process
   of vaporization and burning of emulsion droplets and the evolution and
   the formation of micro- and nano- particles via the Emulsion Combustion
   Method (ECM). In ECM, a precursor solution is mixed and stirred with a
   fuel to form an emulsion of micro-solution droplets suspended in the oil
   phase. The emulsion liquid is sprayed into in emulsion droplets that are
   therefore composed of a fuel and tiny micro solution droplets. Spray
   droplets are ignited and burn to form final micro- or nanoparticles. In
   this paper, the principles of the method and the main governing
   equations of the developed model are discussed. Model equations are
   solved numerically and the results will be presented. The model predicts
   that depending on the operating and processing conditions, such as the
   initial size and concentration of the suspended micro solution droplets
   in emulsion droplets, the fuel fraction of the emulsion droplets, and
   the fuel combustion enthalpy, the final particles may be mono-dispersed
   nanoparticles, or larger agglomerate particles. Due to the similarity of
   the emulsion combustion method with spray pyrolysis and flame spray
   pyrolysis, most of the equations presented here are applicable to those
   methods, as well.}},

Abstract = {{Widespread technological development and deployment have created an
   abundance of data sources for traffic monitoring. A database that
   integrates data from all these technologies would maximize coverage of
   the network, given the available data. Sometimes, however, there are
   multiple independent measurements of the current traffic conditions for
   a particular portion of the network. In these cases, a variety of data
   fusion techniques can be used to achieve better estimates while helping
   to overcome information overload. This paper discusses several
   techniques for fusing data from competitive sensor configurations,
   describes the analytical foundation of these techniques, and interprets
   how each technique might be used most appropriately. In addition, these
   data fusion techniques are implemented and compared relative to their
   ability to accurately and reliably estimate traffic speeds. A real-world
   case study in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, demonstrates that estimates from
   data fusion techniques that pull loop detector data and probe vehicle
   data from an integrated database are more accurate and reliable than
   estimates based on individual data sources. Consequently, these data
   fusion-based estimates can be taken with greater certainty and
   confidence.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in electronic packaging have led to small, lightweight
   and highly efficient heat sink designs. Some of these attempts are
   aiming to integrate the heat sink with the packaging wall structure. In
   this paper, a three-dimensional multiphysics numerical model is
   developed for the integrated heat sink to carry out CFD and thermal
   analyses, stress analyses due to thermal expansion and modal analyses.
   Finite volumes were used to model the conjugate heat transfer (CHT) for
   the coupled fluid-structure fields representing the air and heat sink
   fin walls and base, respectively. In this analysis, both natural and
   forced convection analyses were considered. The predicted temperature
   distribution was then used to calculate the mechanical stresses due to
   thermal expansion, using finite elements. Lastly, modal analyses were
   conducted to calculate the natural frequencies of the model. The effect
   of varying the source heat generation rate, air flow speed, and some
   geometry features such as number of fins and fin's height on the
   performance and structural integrity of the assembly have been studied.}},

Abstract = {{This study introduces the current application of transit signal priority
   (TSP) in the City of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and focuses on the
   following: traffic signal operations, constraints of the current signal
   control system and TSP technology, evaluation metrics, and models for
   simulating transit priority operation. In Toronto, 335 traffic signals
   have transit priority, 321 of which are under the control of the main
   traffic signal system (MTSS). Active transit priority unconditionally
   allows an extension of up to 30 s per cycle in addition to the normal
   signal green time on transit routes. The extension generates complaints
   about traffic delays for vehicles on side streets, long pedestrian wait
   times, and poor signal coordination. Field tests were conducted on a
   section of a downtown Toronto arterial bus route. Actual MTSS logs and
   signpost data obtained by the transit agency during field tests were
   used to investigate three scenarios along Bathurst Street at six
   signalized intersections. An analysis of signal timing changes that
   encompassed selection and determination of traffic operation performance
   measures was conducted on a per-cycle basis in the morning peak,
   afternoon peak, and off-peak periods. Green-band effectiveness was one
   of the evaluation measures used to assess signal progression.
   Subsequently, a performance assessment frame based on a model for the
   analytic hierarchy process was built to determine the best scenario and
   to help develop simulation models. The analysis shows that the TSP
   strategy of unconditional extension up to 30 s in signal green time is
   not recommended for use with the existing system of traffic signal
   control. The approaches described can apply to different transit routes
   with variable situations in Toronto.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing public awareness of environmental issues, there is
   growing interest in plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) which can be
   charged from the power grid. Consequently, the large numbers of PEVs
   could lead to considerable power demand from the power system, which
   poses a great threat to the power grid security (especially at the
   distribution level) if the PEV charging strategy is not properly
   regulated. In this paper, taking advantage of the vehicle to grid (V2G)
   service, the coordinated PEV charging control problem is studied at a
   distribution transformer level using the proposed virtual time of use
   rate dynamic programming (vTOU-DP) approach. For each PEV, the
   coordinated control problem is formulated as a constrained optimal
   control problem based on a self-defined concept of virtual time of use
   rate (vTOU), which reflects the distribution transformer load level.
   Then, the optimal charging rate is solved using the dynamic programming
   (DP) technique. The vTOU-DP, which is a plug-and-play control, can be
   implemented in real time. Simulation results show that the vTOU-DP
   provides better control performance than two commonly used baseline
   controllers in terms of transformer peak reduction and transformer load
   profile smoothness. Compared with the non-PEV base load, by charging
   PEVs at the transformer using the vTOU-DP, the transformer peak load is
   reduced by over 20\%, and the variance of the transformer load profile
   is reduced from about 9 kW(2) to less than 0.01 kW(2).}},

Abstract = {{Laser scanning, whether airborne or terrestrial is being used nowadays
   for wide spectrum of applications. In addition, many advances have been
   introduced to the laser scanning technology in the last decade; thus
   resulting into increased performance in terms of the point density,
   scanner range, and expected point accuracy. On the other hand, users are
   encountering scenarios where the integration of various laser datasets
   becomes essential in order to avoid data gaps (e. g., missing building
   roofs in the terrestrial scans, or missing structure facades in the
   airborne case). This problem is usually solved seamlessly through a
   classical transformation when the average point accuracy is relatively
   homogeneous over a given dataset. However, this is not usually the case;
   in this work, we propose a workflow for the optimal registration of
   multisource point clouds using weighted conformal transformation. First,
   the individual scans are filtered and the local point attributes are
   populated through a data characterization step. Then, an ICPP-based
   weighted registration algorithm is performed over the entire datasets

   performed in a simultaneous fashion to ensure exploiting the full

Abstract = {{It is typical for enterprises to rely on services from cloud providers
   in order to build a scalable platform with abundant available resources
   to satisfy user demand, and for cloud providers to deploy a number of
   datacenters interconnected with high-capacity links, across different
   geographical regions. In this paper, we propose that video conferencing,
   even with its stringent delay constraints, should also be provided as a
   cloud service, taking full advantage of the inter-datacenter network in
   the cloud. We design Airlift, a new protocol designed for the
   inter-datacenter network, tailored to the needs of a cloud-based video
   conferencing service. Airlift delivers packets in live video conferences
   to their respective destination datacenters, with the objective of
   maximizing the total throughput across all conferences, yet without
   violating end-to-end delay constraints. In order to simplify our
   protocol design in Airlift, we use intra-session network coding and the
   concept of conceptual flows, such that the optimization problem that can
   be conveniently formulated as a linear program. Our real-world
   implementation of Airlift has been deployed over the Amazon EC2 cloud.
   We show that Airlift delivers a substantial performance advantage over
   state-of-the-art peer-to-peer solutions.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of distributed energy resources has prompted interest
   in the expansion of DC power systems. One critical technological
   limitation that hinders this expansion is the absence of high step-down
   and high step-up DC converters for interconnecting DC systems. This work
   attempts to address the latter of these limitations.
   This paper presents a new transformerless high boost DCDC converter
   intended for use as an interconnect between DC systems. With a
   conversion ratio of 1: 10, the converter offers significantly higher
   boost ratio than the conventional non-isolated boost converter. It is
   designed to operate at medium to high voltage (> lkV), and provides high
   voltage dc/ dc gain (> 5). Based on a current fed resonant topology, the
   design is well matched to available IGBT switch technology that enables
   use of relatively high switching frequencies yet accommodates the IGBTs
   inability to provide reverse blocking functionality. An advanced steady
   state model suitable for analysis of this converter is presented
   together with an experimental evaluation of the converter.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a Wireless Sensor Node (WSN) architecture with solar
   power generation and a hybrid energy storage scheme. The WSN is composed
   of three key modules: Energy Harvesting, Energy Storage, and the
   Control/Processing unit. The harvesting module consists of a miniature
   179 m W solar array and MPPT hardware. A rechargeable 350 mAh
   Lithium-Ion battery and an ultra-capacitor are used as the energy
   storage elements. The low-ESR ultra-capacitor efficiently supplies the
   load power, which can reach as high as 295 m W peak, while the battery
   provides high-density storage. These elements are interfaced through a
   digitally controlled bi-directional dc-dc converter, which efficiently
   regulates the power-flow in the WSN. Multiple sensors and circuitry are
   implemented to measure positional and environmental data, as well as
   receiving and transmitting data via RF communication. A long-term test
   of the WSN is conducted to demonstrate the effective system
   functionality.}},

Abstract = {{A tutorial introduction is given to network coding, with particular
   emphasis on the single-source multicasting problem. Many now-standard
   results are reviewed; in particular: (a) the multicast capacity of a
   network is given by the least-capacity cut separating the source from
   any of its destinations; (b) the multicast capacity is achievable with
   linear network coding over a finite field of sufficiently large size,
   and there exists a computationally efficient algorithm to find a set of
   capacity-achieving linear network coding coefficients; (c) the multicast
   capacity is achieved with high probability over a sufficiently large
   field when the linear network coding coefficients are chosen at random.
   Also discussed is the practically important case of noncoherent random
   network coding, where neither the source nor any of the destinations has
   a priori knowledge of the specific linear network coding operations
   performed by the network. Finally, several ``diabolical{''}
   counterexamples are discussed that demonstrate that linear network
   coding is not sufficient to achieve maximum throughput for general
   network flow problems.}},

Abstract = {{Instability and poor performance are two well-known problems encountered
   in bilateral teleoperation over a communication channel with variable
   time delays, where force feedback from the slave side is provided to the
   master side. When unknown disturbances or external forces act on the
   master and/or the slave manipulators, the teleoperation system will be
   even more prone to stability and performance degradation. By adopting a
   Lyapunov approach, we present a novel nonlinear disturbance observer
   based control scheme for teleoperation systems that are subject to
   variable time delays and disturbances. Lumping the effects of dynamic
   uncertainties, unknown forces/torques exerted by the human operator and
   the remote environment, and external disturbances into a single
   disturbance term enables us to use a disturbance observer and suppress
   these disturbances in order to alleviate their adverse effects on the
   teleoperation system stability and performance. The proposed disturbance
   observer based control laws guarantee asymptotic disturbance tracking,
   asymptotic position tracking, and stability of teleoperation system in
   both constrained and free motions. Experimental results are presented to
   verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Congestion in a transportation network is usually the result of either
   an increase in traffic demand, i.e. the desire of drivers to use the
   transportation network, or a decrease in traffic supply, i.e. the
   traffic capacity, which is affected by weather conditions, incidents,
   etc. In either case, congestion reduces the efficiency of the
   transportation network and increases the travel time of vehicles in the
   network. In this paper, we leverage the benefits that Vehicle-to-Vehicle
   (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications provide in
   Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), to optimize traffic assignment
   in transportation networks. In particular, we formulate a convex
   optimization problem for a transportation network and minimize network
   criticality, a new graph metric that measures centrality. The robustness
   of this solution is studied and compared to that of the System Optimal
   Equilibrium (SOE) Optimization. The results show that using network
   criticality provides robustness (lack of sensitivity) to both increases
   in traffic demand and decreases in traffic supply, thus reducing traffic
   congestion.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient technique for cooperative
   spectrum sensing in cognitive sensor networks. In cooperative spectrum
   sensing, information is collected from different sensors to make a final
   decision. We use an ``on/off{''} method for cognitive wireless sensor
   networks and also formulate the determination of the number of sensing
   nodes, such that energy consumption in spectrum sensing reduces and
   satisfies the constraint on the detection performance. The constraint on
   the detection performance is given by a minimum global probability of
   detection and a maximum global probability of false alarm. We use the
   energy detector as the spectrum sensing technique and solve the problem
   using the convex optimization methods while consider the computational
   complexity. Simulation results show that our proposed technique saves
   significant energy in different conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Thread-Level Speculation (TLS) was researched to automatically
   parallelize portions of serial programs for execution, and transactional
   memory (TM) was studied as a promising alternative of lock for parallel
   programming due to its simplicity. Both TLS and TM require similar
   underlying support. In the paper, we present SeTM (Sequential
   Transactional Memory), a hardware enhanced TM system which supports TLS
   at minor extra cost. Signature is an effective way to buffer speculative
   states in TM and TLS. But it cripples TM and TLS performance due to its
   false-positive in terms of conflict detection, especially for
   conflict-intensive TLS. SeTM adopts R/W bits and signature concurrently
   to ameliorate this bad influence. Additionally, SeTM introduces fast
   rollback mechanism, which provides fast abort recovery for eager
   log-based HTM and TLS. The most important contribution of SeTM is
   conflict-tolerant mechanism, which tolerates some ambiguous data
   conflicts in TLS. Six representative benchmarks have been adopted to
   evaluate our model. Our experimental results show that our scheme
   improves the execution performance of most tested codes at a modest
   hardware cost. For a set of important scientific loops, we report the
   highest speedup of 6.5 with 15 cores. Besides, experimental results also
   show good scalability of SeTM system.}},

Abstract = {{We present a compact wireless headset system for simultaneous multi-site
   neural recording and neurostimulation in the rodent brain. The system
   comprises flexible-shaft microelectrodes, neural amplifiers,
   neurostimulators, a digital time-division multiplexer (TDM), a
   micro-controller and a ZigBee wireless transceiver. The system is built
   by parallelizing up to four 0.35 mu m CMOS integrated circuits (each
   having 256 neural amplifiers and 64 neurostimulators) to provide a total
   maximum of 1024 neural amplifiers and 256 neurostimulators. Each bipolar
   neural amplifier features 54dB-72dB adjustable gain, 1Hz-5KHz adjustable
   bandwidth with an input-referred RMS noise of 7.99 mu V and dissipates
   12.9 mu W. Each current-mode bipolar neurostimulator generates arbitrary
   waveform programmable biphasic currents in the range of 20-250 mu A and
   dissipates 2.6 mu W in the stand-by mode. Reconfigurability is enabled
   by stacking a set of dedicated mini-PCBs that share a common signaling
   bus within as small as 22x30x15mm(3) volume. The system features
   flexible polyimide-based microelectrode array design that maximizes pad
   packing density. Electrodeposition pad nanotexturing reduces the
   electrode-tissue interface impedance from an average of 2M Omega to 30K
   Omega at 100Hz. The system has been validated in vivo in Sprague-Dawley
   rats.}},

   The amplifier consists of two stages of amplification using capacitive

   resulting in flicker noise contribution from the input differential pair

Abstract = {{There is a growing demand for high-performance computation cores in
   embedded devices built over reconfigurable hardware. As a result,
   various soft core architecture techniques have been proposed, each
   targeting different application classes. This work presents SPREX, an
   FPGA-friendly Runahead soft processor architecture that targets
   applications with unstructured instruction level parallelism. The
   architecture of choice for such applications has traditionally relied on
   a mix of superscalar, out-of-order, and speculative execution.
   Unfortunately, the implementation of these techniques does not map well
   on reconfigurable hardware. This work shows that by exploiting the key
   characteristics of reconfigurable fabrics, and by tuning the
   architecture for the embedded environment, a fast and practical Runahead
   soft processor is viable. Runahead has been shown to offer many of the
   benefits of conventional architectures for the applications this work
   targets. We show that the proposed Runahead architecture improves
   performance of a simple 5-stage pipeline by 9\% on the average and by as
   much as 36\%.}},

Title = {{Power spectrum optimization for interference mitigation via iterative
   function evaluation}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Power spectrum optimization is a well-known difficult nonconvex
   optimization problem for which only local optimality can typically be
   assured. This paper unifies several classes of local optimization
   methods and proposes efficient and new methods for power spectrum
   optimization by observing that methods for reaching the local optimal
   points can often be expressed in the form of an iterative function
   evaluation. This proposed new approach is based on the fact that the
   gradient of the objective function is zero at a local optimum, and that
   different manipulations of the optimality condition can then lead to
   different power update equations. As a practical application, this paper
   examines the benefit of dynamic power spectrum optimization for
   interference mitigation in a wireless backhaul network in which remote
   radio units are deployed to serve mobile users in areas with high data
   traffic demand. The remote radio units, called remote terminals (RT),
   are connected to access nodes (AN) via orthogonal frequency division
   multiple access (OFDMA) over a fixed bandwidth with one RT active in
   each frequency tone. The system performance is thus limited by internode
   interference solely, and no intranode interference. This paper shows
   that iterative function evaluation based methods provide a significant
   improvement in the overall network throughput in this setting as
   compared to a conventional network with fixed transmit power spectrum.
   The proposed methods have computationally fast convergence and can be
   implemented in a distributed fashion assuming reasonable amount of
   internode information exchange. Further, some of the proposed methods
   can be implemented asynchronously at each AN, which makes them amenable
   to practical utilization.}},

Abstract = {{At the beginning of 2011, the first generation of more than 77 million
   baby boomers began to turn 65. In this study, researchers explore the
   situation in which those baby boomers who are currently 55 to 64 years
   old will replace current senior citizens, 65- to 74-year-olds. This
   study presents a detailed descriptive analysis of activity generation
   and the planning and scheduling behavior of these two age groups. Global
   Positioning System based data from a prompted recall activity-travel
   survey (the Urban Travel Route and Activity Choice Survey) are used in
   this study. This highly disaggregate survey with detailed activity
   attributes has made it possible to distinguish the preferences and
   flexibilities of preretirement baby boomers (55 to 64) and senior
   citizens (65 to 74) with respect to their daily activities. The study
   focuses on a diverse set of activity categories that include the
   following: work, school, personal, religious, health care, services,
   errands, discretionary, and shopping. For these activities, activity
   durations, times of day, and planning time horizons were studied,
   compared, and analyzed for both age groups. It was revealed that the
   main difference between these two age groups was the difference in the
   participation in mandatory activities. Although the two age groups had
   very similar behavior in choice of activity duration, their time-of-day
   choice behavior was very different. In addition, both age groups
   executed a major part of their activities impulsively. Seniors and baby
   boomers planned 61.6\% and 56.9\%, respectively, of their activities on
   ``less than 1h{''} and ``same-day{''} planning time horizons.}},

Abstract = {{Incorporating Networks-on-Chip (NoC) within FPGAs has the potential not
   only to improve the efficiency of the interconnect, but also to increase
   designer productivity and reduce compile time by raising the abstraction
   level of communication. By comparing NoC components on FPGAs and ASICs
   we quantify the efficiency gap between the two platforms and use the
   results to understand the design tradeoffs in that space. The crossbar
   has the largest FPGA vs. ASIC gaps: 85x area and 4.4x delay, while the
   input buffers have the smallest: 17x area and 2.9x delay. For a soft NoC
   router, these results indicate that wide datapaths, deep buffers and a
   small number of ports and virtual channels (VC) are favorable for FPGA
   implementation. If one hardens a complete state-of-the-art VC router it
   is on average 30x more area efficient and can achieve 3.6x the maximum
   frequency of a soft implementation. We show that this hard router can be
   integrated with the soft FPGA interconnect, and still achieve an area
   improvement of 22x. A 64-node NoC of hard routers with soft interconnect
   utilizes area equivalent to 1.6\% of the logic modules in the latest
   FPGAs, compared to 33\% for a soft NoC.}},

Abstract = {{We present a hardware architecture for efficient implementation of a
   Gaussian random number generator (GRNG), using the Monty Python method.
   To maximize the performance/complexity efficiency, an efficient
   word-length optimization model is proposed to find out both the optimal
   integer and fractional word-lengths for signals. Experimental results
   show that our optimized Fixed-Point design achieves a throughput of
   almost 1 sample-per-cycle and runs as fast as 375.9 MHz on a Xilinx
   XC6VLX240T FPGA device. This performance is 23.4-fold faster than a
   dedicated software version running on a 2.67-GHz Intel core i5
   processor. It takes 1976 LUTs, 1785 Flip-Flops, 12 BRAMs and 35 DSPs,
   which is only about 1\% of the device as well as a great reduction
   compared to its corresponding Floating-Point implementations.
   Furthermore, we develop a framework that is capable of partitioning the
   Gaussian distribution stream into an arbitrary number of parallel
   sub-streams. With support from software, this framework can obtain
   speedup roughly linearly with the number of parallel cores. The quality
   of the variables produced by our design are verified via the standard
   Gaussian statistical test suit, the chi-square (X-2) test.}},

Abstract = {{The mass transport of species, including diffusion, convection and
   migration, involved in the electro-oxidation of oxalic acid was
   investigated. A rotating-disk electrode technique was used as a tool to
   investigate the influence of convection. The effect of pH and potential
   on the degradation rate of oxalic acid was also investigated by
   measuring oxalic acid oxidation over the pH range 0 to 7 and potential
   1.6 to 2.4 vs. Ag/AgCl. The results showed that higher degradation rates
   were achieved by increasing the convection, using higher pH and E. The
   results also showed that the local pH at the electrode surface had a
   significant impact on electrolysis in a neutral non-buffered solution.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of the infographic in mainstream media presents an
   important challenge to the ways in which technical communication
   instructors teach visualization and visual rhetoric. Nicholas Felton's
   work, in both his Annual Reports and Facebook Timeline, is
   representative of how modern visualization techniques disrupt
   traditional approaches to teaching visual communication. However, this
   explosion of interest around visualization also offers a strong
   opportunity for dialogue about visual genres, communities of practice,
   and aesthetics that can help move the teaching of visualization beyond
   heuristics and push students towards a deeper understanding of visual
   design. This paper examines Felton's graphic design work in order to
   demonstrate how it both challenges and enriches visual design pedagogy.}},

Abstract = {{In 2010, the Engineering Communication Program (ECP) teamed up with
   Engineering Strategic Communication to find a visual way to resolve
   ECP's identity issues. Not only was the program a kind of outsider to
   the world of math, hard science and research which were identified with
   University of Toronto Engineering, but the instructors themselves had a
   difficult time differentiating themselves from Teaching Assistants.
   Students did not have a conventional way to identify instructors who
   taught interactively in small classes scheduled during tutoring times or
   who tutored in one-on-one or one-on-team settings. The situation was
   further complicated by the fact that the university had recently
   completed a branding exercise and was centrally determining what kinds
   of symbolic representations or typefaces could be used. We wanted to
   utilize the university new ``brand{''} as well as our own faculty's in
   order to represent ourselves visibly as part of the engineering world.
   Our answer, within what was currently permitted by the university, had
   two components: a type treatment of our name, matching the type
   treatments used by engineering departments, and an insignia that
   introduced an acronym for communication instructors - MyCI. In future,
   we will be conducting a study to determine the associations the insignia
   evokes for students.}},

Abstract = {{A custom-made imaging reflectometer was used to study the microgloss
   properties of coated papers. To quantify the relative contributions of
   surface and bulk scattering to the total intensity of reflected light, a
   pair of polarizer lenses was employed. The mean value and the standard
   deviation of local grey level of captured images at micro-scale (with a
   spatial resolution of 16 mu mx16 mu m) were determined to quantify the
   average microgloss and microgloss nonuniformity of samples,
   respectively. It was found that surface microgloss; i.e. local light
   reflection in the specular direction due to surface light scattering,
   increased linearly with increasing the total microgloss of paper.
   However, bulk microgloss; i.e. local light reflection in the specular
   direction due to the bulk scattering, remained nearly constant for a
   wide range of coated papers with varying coating weight, formulation and
   calendering condition. The relative contribution of bulk scattering to
   the total microgloss increased as the sheet progressively became less
   glossy. On the other hand, microgloss nonuniformity was governed by the
   local variation in surface light scattering and was affected by pigment
   particle size, pigment morphology and calendering conditions. Finally,
   both surface microgloss and surface microgloss nonuniformity were
   power-law functions of the surface texture parameter
   (L-c/lambda)/(sigma(h)/lambda)(2) where L-c, sigma(h) and lambda are
   correlation length, RMS surface roughness, and wavelength of incident
   light, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiopene): poly (styrene-sulfonate), or PEDOT:
   PSS, as well as single-walled carbon nanotubes, were incorporated into
   an inkjet ink. Handsheets were prepared which contained varying amounts
   of TiO2 filler, internal sizing agent, fixation agent, and either
   softwood or hardwood kraft pulp. The ink was jetted onto the handsheets
   to form conductive layers with apparent conductivity as high as 0.018
   S/cm on internally alkyketene dimer-sized softwood kraft handsheets with
   no other additives. Internal sizing increased conductivity at low filler
   loadings by preventing PEDOT: PSS from penetrating into the substrate,
   resulting in a conductive ink film on the surface of the sample. Unsized
   handsheets allowed more rapid absorption, and therefore deeper
   penetration, of the PEDOT: PSS ink, which resulted in a more diffuse
   conductive layer. The inclusion of a polyethyleneimine retention aid for
   TiO2 filler decreased conductivity significantly even in unfilled sheets
   by interaction with PSS- counterions. A positively charged fixation
   agent, poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride, reduced PEDOT
   conductivity through the retention of non-conductive PSS- anions.}},

Pages = {{257-292}},
Abstract = {{Surface active molecules such as polar lipids and surfactants
   self-assemble into association colloids that include micelles, liquid
   crystals and microemulsions that are used to design delivery systems for
   nutraceuticals, vitamins and minerals. The first part of the chapter
   provides a general overview of lipid absorption and the role of bile
   salt micelles and lipoprotein assemblies in the process, as an example
   of how nature uses association colloids. The second part of the chapter
   summarizes the thermodynamic principles and main features of the phase
   behavior leading to the formation of micelles, liquid crystals and
   microemulsions, and the role that molecular structure and formulation
   conditions play in modifying this phase behavior. The third part
   describes the processes used to produce dispersed association colloid
   delivery systems, including solid lipid particles, dispersed liquid
   crystal systems, self-microemulsifying systems, and protein assemblies.
   Finally examples of these delivery systems in food applications are
   provided along with a summary of challenges and opportunities for this
   field. The overall outlook for association colloids is positive due to
   the numerous formulation alternatives for self-assembled systems and the
   fact that recent examples teach the use of safe food grade ingredients
   like proteins and polar lipids to produce ingenious assemblies. Safety
   and regulatory issues around association colloids are important to be
   considered in this rapidly evolving field.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the impact of paper and printer type on the quality
   of xerographic prints. Ten different uncoated paper substrates were
   printed using three different commercial xerographic printers. The print
   quality of the samples (print microgloss, print microgloss
   nonuniformity, print density, print and gloss mottle, and visual
   ranking) and the physical and surface characteristics of the papers were
   measured. It was found that relationship between print mottle and print
   gloss nonuniformity was dominated by the printer type. While for some
   printers, these two parameters were positively correlated, in other
   cases printer appeared to ``mask{''} variations in the paper properties.
   Multivariate analysis also showed that brightness, opacity, basis
   weight, 75 degrees Tappi gloss, and roughness were the top five paper
   properties that had the most significant effect on the visual ranking
   and print mottle. Finally, as expected, print roughness was found to be
   a better predictor of the perceived print quality, however, paper
   roughness was poorly correlated with the visual ranking of printed
   samples (R-2 approximate to 0.5).}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) have undergone
   remarkable development from both academia and industry in the past
   decade. Nevertheless, devices with higher efficiency remain highly
   desirable for energy-efficient general lighting as well as low power
   consumption LED backlight applications. In this respect, several groups
   have conducted complex device engineering designs such as doping of the
   trans-port layers to increase charge carrier mobility, incorporation of
   blocking layers to confine excitons/charge carriers, or use of multiple
   emissive layers to widen the emission zone, in order to achieve higher
   device performances. In this work, we report an alternative and
   relatively simple approach to improve the efficiency of red PHOLEDs by
   exciton management to attain a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of
   >20\%. (C) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{Traditional near infrared (NIR) imaging is realized by a two dimensional
   InGaAs photodetector (PD) array integrated with a Si readout integrated
   circuit active matrix. The integration between the two different
   semiconductor arrays seriously restrains the device size-scalability and
   leads to high manufacture cost. One alternative approach is to
   up-convert infrared photons to a shorter wavelength (e.g., 1 mu m or
   below) that can be effectively detected by a conventional Si detector.
   Herein, we report a highly simplified single-mesa (pixel-less) hybrid
   organic/inorganic up-conversion imaging device through the integration
   of a large area inorganic PD with an organic light emitting diode, which
   can up-convert a NIR scene to a visiblelight image. By combining the
   fabricated device with a commercially available camera, we demonstrate
   the first time pixel-less up-conversion NIR imaging with a spatial
   resolution of better than 6 mu m. This device has great potential for
   making low-cost, large-area and high resolution NIR cameras. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{2D axisymmetric numerical calculations are conducted to model the
   thermo-fluid fields and chemical reactions leading to the formation of
   SWCNTs in an RF plasma system. A modified version of the SWCNT
   ``reduced{''} chemical model is used to estimate the formation of SWCNT
   in an RF plasma system for the first time. The ``reduced{''} model
   incorporates 14 species and 36 chemical reactions to predict the
   formation of metal and carbon clusters and SWCNTs. By combing the
   chemistry model into the RF plasma CFD code, the formation and
   development of carbon and metal catalyst clusters and their reactions
   which produce SWCNTs are shown. The chemistry model is shown to
   under-predict the yield rate of SWCNT. In order to better predict the
   yield rate, a sensitivity analysis is performed to modify the dominant
   reaction rates. The modified model predicts the yield of SWCNTs
   correctly within the range reported experimentally. However, more
   studies should be conducted to validate the accuracy of the model for

Abstract = {{This chapter describes an experimental protocol for single cell
   pick-place using a general-purposed micromanipulator and a micropipette.
   The micromanipulation system uses computer vision and motion control
   approaches to accurately pick up a single cell, transfer it to a desired
   substrate/location, and deposit it at a specified location. A
   traditional glass micropipette having a diameter larger than the cell is
   used to aspirate a whole cell into the micropipette for pick-place. This
   protocol is designed to manipulate and position single cells within a
   variety of microenvironments. The system is broadly applicable to any
   type of substrate and can manipulate multiple cell types in an end-user
   customizable manner. The presented protocol is for aspirating and
   transferring single cells after trypsinization. Additional steps are
   required for pick-place cells in their adherent state, such as local
   trypsinization or mechanical cutting. The tool for pick-place of cells
   can be useful as a stand-alone or bolstering technology for single-cell
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Tracheal respiratory sound analysis is a simple and non-invasive way to
   study the pathophysiology of the upper airways; it has recently been
   used for acoustical flow estimation and sleep apnea diagnosis. However
   in none of the previous studies, the accuracy of acoustical flow
   estimation was investigated neither during sleep nor in people with
   obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In this study, we recorded tracheal
   sound, flow rate and head position from 11 individuals with OSA during
   sleep and wakefulness. We investigated two approaches for calibrating
   the parameters of acoustical flow estimation model based on the known
   data recorded during wakefulness and sleep. The results show that the
   acoustical flow estimation parameters change from wakefulness to sleep.
   Therefore, if the model is calibrated based on the data recorded during
   wakefulness, although the estimated flow follows the relative variations
   of the recorded flow, the quantitative flow estimation error would be
   high during sleep. On the other hand, when the calibration parameters
   are extracted from tracheal sound and flow recordings during sleep, the
   flow estimation error is less than 5\%. These results confirm the
   reliability of acoustical methods for estimating breathing flow during
   sleep and detecting the partial or complete obstructions of the upper
   airways during sleep.}},

Abstract = {{Respiratory sound analysis is a simple and non-invasive way to study the
   pathophysiology of the upper airway (UA). Recently, it has been used to
   diagnose partial or complete UA collapse in patients with obstructive
   sleep apnea (OSA). In this study, we investigated whether fluid
   accumulation in the neck alters the properties of respiratory sounds in
   temporal and spectral domains and whether the respiratory sounds
   analysis can be used to monitor variations in the physiology of the UA,
   as reflected by UA resistance (R-U (A)). We recorded respiratory sounds
   and R-U (A) from 19 individuals while awake. We applied lower body
   positive pressure (LBPP) to shift fluid out of the legs and into the
   neck, which increased R-U (A). We calculated first and second formants
   and energy of inspiratory sound segments. Our results show that during
   both control (no LBPP) and LBPP arms of the study, the extracted
   features were different for the sound segments corresponding to low and
   high R-U (A). Also, the features were different during control and LBPP
   arms of the study. With the application of support vector machine (SVM)
   based classifier, we were able to classify the sound segments into two
   groups of high/low resistance during control and LBPP arms and into two
   groups of control/LBPP when including all sound segments. The accuracies
   of non-linear SVM classifier were 74.5 +/- 19.5\%, 75.0 +/- 15.4\% and
   77.1 +/- 12.3\% for the control arm, LBPP arm and between the arms,
   respectively. We also showed that during the LBPP arm, the variations in
   first formant of the sound segments corresponding to low and high R-U
   (A) was much less than during the control arm. This indicates that with
   application of LBPP and accumulation of fluid in the neck, there are
   less variations in the morphology of the UA in response to changes in
   R-U (A), than during the control arm. These results indicate that
   acoustic analysis of respiratory sounds can be used to investigate
   physiology of the UA and how interventions can alter UA properties.}},

Abstract = {{Classification of mental states from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals
   is used for many applications in areas such as brain-computer
   interfacing (BCI). When represented in the frequency domain, the
   multichannel EEG signal can be considered as a two-directional
   spatio-spectral data of high dimensionality. Extraction of salient
   features using feature extractors such as the commonly used linear
   discriminant analysis (LDA) is an essential step for the classification
   of these signals. However, multichannel EEG is naturally in
   matrix-variate format, while LDA and other traditional feature
   extractors are designed for vector-variate input. Consequently, these
   methods require a prior vectorization of the EEG signals, which ignores
   the inherent matrix-variate structure in the data and leads to high
   computational complexity. A matrix-variate formulation of LDA have
   previously been proposed. However, this heuristic formulation does not
   provide the Bayes optimality benefits of LDA. The current paper proposes
   a Bayes optimal matrix-variate formulation of LDA based on a
   matrix-variate model for the spatio-spectral EEG patterns. The proposed
   formulation also provides a strategy to select the most significant
   features among the different rows and columns.}},

Abstract = {{One of the drawbacks of current Computer-aided Detection (CADe) systems
   is a high number of false-positive (FP) detections, especially for
   detecting mass abnormalities. In a typical CADe system, classifier
   design is one of the key steps for determining FP detection rates. This
   paper presents the effective classifier ensemble system for tackling FP
   reduction problem in CADe. To construct ensemble consisting of correct
   classifiers while disagreeing with each other as much as possible, we
   develop a new ensemble construction solution that combines data
   resampling underpinning AdaBoost learning with the use of different
   feature representations. In addition, to cope with the limitation of
   weak classifiers in conventional AdaBoost, our method has an effective
   mechanism for tuning the level of weakness of base classifiers. Further,
   for combining multiple decision outputs of ensemble members, a weighted
   sum fusion strategy is used to maximize a complementary effect for
   correct classification. Comparative experiments have been conducted on
   benchmark mammogram dataset. Results show that the proposed classifier
   ensemble outperforms the best single classifier in terms of reducing the
   FP detections of masses.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the main requirements and challenges regarding the
   application of a Matrix Converter (MC) for aerospace power conversion.
   The challenges are reviewed in terms of (i) the input-filter (and
   output-filter) design, (ii) the selection of semiconductor switches and
   commutation-strategy, and (iv) the PWM strategy. The aerospace
   application of the MC requires operation at an input-frequency of 360Hz
   to 800Hz. The required output-frequency is either 400Hz to operate as a
   power supply or variable frequency of a few Hz up to 1200 Hz for drive
   applications such as fans and air compressors. Operation at 800Hz
   input-frequency imposes restrictions on the selection of the
   input-filter component values. These restrictions require the MC to
   operate at a high switching-frequency. Consequently, the switches,
   commutation strategy, and PWM strategy should be selected properly to
   enable MC operation at the higher switching-frequency. This paper uses
   MOSFET switches and demonstrates suitable commutation and
   modulation-strategies that enable a MOSFET-based MC to properly operate
   at around a switching-frequency of 40kHz, single-sided or 20kHz,
   double-sided.}},

Abstract = {{A new LED driver architecture is presented for increasing the lifetime
   and reliability of solid-state lighting modules. The architecture
   targets indoor/outdoor industrial applications, where the overhead cost
   of a smart LED driver is outweighed by the added value of improved
   lifetime and fault tolerance. The system includes two complete sets of
   white LEDs and associated current-mode drivers. The digitally controlled
   dc-dc converters communicate with each-other to smoothly transfer
   current from one set of LEDs to another at a regular commutation
   interval. A low-power pulse-frequency-modulation mode is used to
   conserve power in the LED set that is off. The redundancy is also
   exploited to perform precise current balancing and health monitoring of
   the individual LED strings, while the total light output remains
   constant at all times. The architecture is demonstrated on a 25 W module
   with 154 white LEDs, which forms 1/4 of a full luminaire.}},

   pair of source and destination under per-antenna power constraints. Our
   objective is to obtain the optimal relay processing matrix to minimize
   the maximum individual antenna power for a given received SNR target.
   The problem is not convex, but it can be shown to satisfy strong
   Lagrange duality. We reveal a prominent structure of this problem, by
   establishing its duality with direct point-to-point SIMO beamforming
   with an uncertain noise. This enables us to derive a semi-closed form
   expression for the optimal relay processing matrix that depends on a set
   of dual variables, thus converting the original optimization of a NxN
   matrix with (N+1) constraints, to a dual problem with (N+1) variables
   and three constraints. We further show that the dual problem has a
   semi-definite programming form, so that the proposed solution has
   polynomial worst-case complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, the development of resource allocation algorithms
   for cooperative communication networks has focused on optimal, or
   acceptable suboptimal, solutions assuming full knowledge of channel
   state information (CSI) in the network. This assumption is,
   unfortunately, unlikely to be satisfied in practice. Here we turn our
   attention to the effects of limited CSI on the performance of a
   cooperative network. We show that the performance gap between the fully
   centralized approaches and fully distributed algorithms falls
   exponentially with the number of CSI bits per link available at the
   central node. We use this to show that, for a large class of objective
   functions, a close-to-optimal solution is achievable with limited CSI.
   We also show that proper allocation of the CSI bits to different links
   in the network is a crucial issue. We propose a simple upper bound on
   the performance gap and a bit allocation algorithm that minimizes the
   upper bound. Our numerical results confirm that through optimal bit
   allocation considerable savings in CSI bits is achieved.}},

Abstract = {{We study a joint source-channel decoding scheme that exploits the
   channel's statistical memory and soft-decision information in fading
   channels. The channel considered is a recently introduced binary input
   2(q)-ary output channel with Markovian ergodic noise based on a finite
   queue (called NBNDC-QB). This model has been shown to effectively
   represent soft-decision demodulated correlated Rayleigh fading channels.
   The coding scheme consists of a scalar quantizer, a proper index
   assignment, and a sequence maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoder designed
   to harness the redundancy left in the quantizer's indices, the channel's
   soft-decision output, and correlation in the channel noise process. We
   first consider the simple case where the qunatized indices form a binary
   symmetric Markov source and establish a necessary and sufficient
   condition under which the sequence MAP decoder is reduced to a simple
   instantaneous symbol-by-symbol decoder. We next assess the
   signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) performance of our general system. Our
   numerical results confirm that this system can successfully take
   advantages of the channel memory and outperforms system that use channel
   interleaving by as much as 2.6 dB in SDR. In addition, SDR gains of up
   to 2.8 dB are achieved using as few as 2 buts for soft-decision
   quantization over hard qunatized output schemes. Finally, the NBNDC-QB
   channel model is validated in terms of SDR performance by fitting the
   NBNDC-QB model to a discrete correlated Rayleigh fading channel,
   designing a system for this matched NBNDC-QB model, and comparing this
   system's performance over both the NBNDC-QB and the Rayleigh fading
   channels.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an efficient two-stage beamforming and scheduling
   algorithm for the limited-feedback cooperative multi-point (CoMP)
   systems. The system includes multiple base-stations cooperatively
   transmitting data to a pool of users, which share a rate-limited
   feedback channel for sending back the channel state information (CSI).
   The feedback mechanism is divided into two stages that are used
   separately for scheduling and beamforming. In the first stage, the users
   report their best channel gain from all the base-station antennas and
   the base-stations schedule the best user for each of their antennas. The
   scheduled users are then polled in the second stage to feedback their
   quantized channel vectors. The paper proposes an analytical framework to
   derive the bit allocation between the two feedback stages and the bit
   allocation for quantizing each user's CSI. For a total number of
   feedback bits B, it is shown that the number of bits assigned to the
   second feedback stage should scale as logB. Furthermore, in quantizing
   channel vectors from different base-stations, each user should allocate
   its feedback budget in proportion to the logarithm of the corresponding
   channel gains. These bit allocation are then used to show that the
   overall system performance scales double-logarithmically with B and
   logarithmically with the transmit SNR. The paper further presents
   several numerical results to show that, in comparison with other
   beamforming-scheduling algorithms in the literature, the proposed scheme
   provides a consistent improvement in downlink sum rate and network
   utility. Such improvements, in particular, are achieved in spite of a
   significant reduction in the beamforming-scheduling computational
   complexity, which makes the proposed scheme an attractive solution for
   practical system implementations.}},

   find an optimal pricing policy, in face of stochastic demand arrivals

Abstract = {{One of the major challenges in deploying femtocells is the management of
   interference between neighboring femtocells and between the femtocells
   and the macrocells. This paper explores the use of opportunistic
   multiuser detection for interference mitigation in the downlink of an
   orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) femtocell network.
   In particular, we focus on the use of joint decoding (JD) at the
   receiver, where a macro or femto user may jointly decode both the
   desired message and the message from a selected interfering user in
   order to achieve a higher overall transmission rate. It is shown that to
   take the full advantage of opportunistic multiuser detection, the
   selection of JD pairs needs to be jointly optimized with scheduling,
   power allocation, and rate adaptation. This paper adopts a network
   utility maximization framework and proposes an iterative algorithm for
   such a joint optimization across the network. Simulation results show
   that multiuser detection can significantly benefit the femto-users,
   while maintaining the performance of macro-users. Further, although the
   lower-complexity successive interference cancellation (SIC) scheme can
   already reap significant benefit of multiuser detection, JD can further
   improve upon SIC.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, photocatalytic splitting of water to produce hydrogen
   has attracted significant attention. Crystalline forms of titanium
   dioxide (TiO2) have been investigated for decades. Amorphous TiO2,
   although less expensive, has not been studied as thoroughly. This study
   investigates the structural and electronic properties of amorphous TiO2.
   Molecular dynamics simulations are used to prepare multiple amorphous
   TiO2 samples having different number of atoms. The structural analysis
   agrees well with the experimental data. Electronic properties of
   amorphous TiO2 are investigated through density functional theory
   calculations. Band gap characteristics of amorphous TiO2 are compared
   with experimental data for amorphous as well as crystalline (rutile and
   anatase) TiO2 phases. Analysis of electronic properties suggests that
   amorphous TiO2 may prove as a cheaper, more abundant, but somewhat less
   efficient photocatalyst as compared to crystalline TiO2. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Emotion states greatly influence many areas in our daily lives, such as:
   learning, decision making and interaction with others. Therefore, the
   ability to detect and recognize one's emotional states is essential in
   intelligence Human Machine Interaction (HMI). The aim of this study was
   to develop a new system that can sense and communicate emotion changes
   expressed by the Central Nervous System (CNS) through the use of EEG
   signals. More specifically, this study was carried out to develop an
   EEG-based subject-dependent affect recognition system to quantitatively
   measure and categorize three affect states: Positively excited, neutral
   and negatively excited. In this paper, we discussed implementation
   issues associated with each key stage of a fully automated affect
   recognition system: emotion elicitation protocol, feature extraction and
   classification. EEG recordings from 5 subjects with IAPS images as
   stimuli from the eNTERFACE06 database were used for simulation purposes.
   Discriminating features were extracted in both time and frequency
   domains (statistical, narrow-band, HOC, and wavelet entropy) to better
   understand the oscillatory nature of the brain waves. Through the use of
   k Nearest Neighbor classifier (kNN), we obtained mean correct
   classification rates of 90.77\% on the three emotion classes when K
   equals 5. This demonstrated the feasibility of brain waves as a mean to
   categorize a user's emotion state. Secondly, we also assessed the
   suitability of commercially available EEG headsets such as Emotive Epoc
   for emotion recognition applications. This study was carried out by
   comparing the sensor location, signal integrity with those of Biosemi
   Active II. A new set of recognition performance was presented with
   reduced number of channels.}},

Abstract = {{In collaborative spectrum sensing, the presence of the primary user is
   detected at a central entity, known as the fusion center. This center
   collects the information from the secondary users and decides on the
   occupancy of the desired frequency band. In the conventional strategy,
   the secondary users transmit their initial observations toward the
   fusion center with their maximum transmit powers. In this paper,
   however, we consider the problem of beamforming among the secondary
   users with individual power constraints. Correlated shadow fading has
   been considered in the channel gains between the primary transmitter and
   the secondary users as well as the channel gains between the secondary
   users and the fusion center. We consider the problem of maximizing the
   probability of detection for a required probability of false alarm. Most
   previous works have considered the total power constraint while in
   practical scenarios, each secondary user has a limited battery lifetime.
   An algorithm is developed which efficiently solves the problem via
   second order cone programming (SOCP) in an iterative manner. An
   approximation of the original problem is studied which reduces the
   computational complexity of the iterative procedure. The Monte Carlo
   simulations confirm the effectiveness of the spectrum sensing framework
   compared to the conventional strategy.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of designing a microwave pulse to minimize its attenuation
   in dispersive media is solved by formulating an optimization problem at
   a given point. The solution that maximizes the total energy of the pulse
   is the impulse response of the medium and its time-reverse. This method
   is applied to a good conductor, a medium described by the
   Rocard-Powles-Debye model, and a two-layer medium. This method of
   solving the pulse design problem using optimization theory can be
   extended to include other optimization criteria and applied to design
   pulses for propagation in arbitrary dispersive media.}},

Abstract = {{Many real world optimization problems are dynamic in which the fitness
   landscape is time dependent and the optima change over time such as
   dynamic economic modeling, dynamic resource scheduling, and dynamic
   vehicle routing. Such problems challenge traditional optimization
   methods as well as conventional evolutionary optimization algorithms.
   For such environments, optimization algorithms not only have to find the
   global optimum but also closely track its trajectory. In this paper, we
   propose a collaborative version of cellular PSO, named Two Phased
   cellular PSO to address dynamic optimization problems. The proposed
   algorithm introduces two search phases in order to create a more
   efficient balance between exploration and exploitation in cellular PSO.
   The conventional PSO in cellular PSO is replaced by a proposed PSO to
   increase the exploration capability and an exploitation phase is added
   to increase exploitation is the promising cells. Moreover, the cell
   capacity threshold which is a key parameter of cellular PSO is
   eliminated due to these modifications. To demonstrate the performance
   and robustness of the proposed algorithm, it is evaluated in various
   dynamic environment modeled by Moving Peaks Benchmark. The results show
   that for all the experimented dynamic environments, TP-CPSO outperforms
   all compared algorithms including cellular PSO.}},

Abstract = {{Recent findings in neuroscience have shown that the spectral components
   of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals convey information regarding the
   mental task not only in their power but also in their phase. This calls
   for the utilization of complex-valued spectrum, instead of the commonly
   used power spectral density, in designing the brain computer interfaces.
   This paper studies the complex-valued spectrum of the EEG signal
   recorded during mental imagery tasks, and provides a statistical model
   for the EEG spectral components. Motivated by the results of a recent
   work by the authors, this paper proposes a time-varying
   noncircularly-symmetric Gaussian model for complex-valued EEG spectrum
   during a mental imagery trial. It will be shown that the mean of this
   Gaussian model is constant over time, whereas its variance and
   pseudo-variance follow an autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic
   (ARCH) model. The validity of this model is then verified using
   statistical tests.}},

   of orthogonal codes from the conventional Walsh-Hadamard matrix which
   has the special property of ``cyclic orthogonality{''}. This property
   ensures that the asynchronous nature of the WBAN does not produce MAI
   amongst the multiple on-body sensors. The work investigates the

Abstract = {{Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), a conventional feature extraction
   technique, is a homoscedastic solution and ignores the second order
   information of the data. A heteroscedastic extension of LDA has been
   previously proposed which relies on the average pairwise Chernoff
   distances of the classes. However, in a multi-class scenario with number
   of classes C > 2, the average of pairwise distances is not directly
   related to the classification error rate. Furthermore, the corresponding
   method imposes a high computational complexity of order O(C(C - 1)).
   This paper proposes an inherently multi-class heteroscedastic extension
   of LDA based on Matusita's separability measure, a multi-class
   generalization of the Chernoff distance which is related to multi-class
   error bounds. The proposed feature extractor can be trained
   non-iteratively with computational complexity of O(C). Experimental
   comparisons with the Chernoff method demonstrate both a performance
   improvement when estimated parameters are used, and a reduction of
   factor C - 1 in the computational load as predicted.}},

   (NCD) has been utilized for the realization of a high frequency SAW
   nano-resonators. In this work, we report on the development, fabrication
   and testing of SAW devices based on aluminum nitride (AlN) and NCD

   fine resolution SAW nano-resonators on AlN/NCD bilayer. The fabricated

Abstract = {{Due to the high costs of natural gas and fuel oil in recent years, many
   Kraft pulp mills now use lower-cost fuels with high sulphur content in
   their lime kilns. Depending on the total sulphur input to the kiln,
   burning high-sulphur fuels in lime kilns may increase SO2 emissions,
   decrease lime availability and reactivity, and aggravate ring formation.
   The sulphur absorbed in the product lime ends up as Na-2 SO4 deadload in
   the liquor cycle, which is reduced to Na2S in the recovery boiler,
   leading to an increase in liquor sulphidity. These effects, however, are
   manageable.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic congestion in Greater Toronto Area costs Canada \$ 6 billion
   /year and is expected to grow up to \$ 15 billion /year in the next few
   decades. Adaptive Traffic Signal Control(ATSC) is a promising technique
   to alleviate traffic congestion. For medium-large transportation
   networks, coordinated ATSC is becoming a challenging problem because the
   number of system states and actions grows exponentially as the number of
   networked intersections grows. Efficient and robust controllers can be
   designed using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach in
   which each controller (agent) is responsible for the control of traffic
   lights around a single traffic junction. This paper presents a novel,
   decentralized and coordinated adaptive real-time traffic signal control
   system using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Integrated Network
   of Adaptive Traffic Signal Controllers (MARLIN-ATSC) that aims to
   minimize the total vehicle delay in the traffic network. The system is
   tested using microscopic traffic simulation software (PARAMICS) on a
   network of 5 signalized intersections in Downtown Toronto. The
   performance of MARLIN-ATSC is compared against two approaches: the
   conventional pretimed signal control (B1) and independent RL-based
   control agents (B2), i.e. with no coordination. The results show that
   network-wide average delay savings range from 32\% to 63\% relative to
   B1 and from 7\% to 12\% relative to B2 under different demand levels and
   arrival profiles.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we introduce a new approach to Freeway Ramp Metering (RM)
   based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) with focus on real-life experiments
   in a case study in the City of Toronto. Typical RL methods consider
   discrete state representation that lead to slow convergence in complex
   problems. Continuous representation of state space has the potential to
   significantly improve the learning speed and therefore enables tackling
   large-scale complex problems. A robust approach based on local
   regression, named k nearest neighbors temporal difference (kNN-TD), is
   employed to represent state space continuously in the RL environment.
   The performance of the new algorithm is compared against the ALINEA
   controller and typical RL methods using a micro-simulation testbed in
   Paramics. The results show that RM using the kNN-TD method can reduce
   total network travel time by 44\% compared to the do-nothing case
   (without RM) and by 17\% compared to ALINEA.}},

   mismatches, under a quadratic distortion measure. Specifically we study
   the tradeoff between the achievable distortion pairs between the two
   users. The case when the bandwidth-expansion factors of the two users
   are identical has been well studied in the literature and to our best

   bandwidth expansion factor. In other cases, we propose an achievable

Abstract = {{Compute-and-forward (C\&F) relaying usually requires channel state
   information (CSI) at the receivers so that an ``optimal{''} scale factor
   can be computed for the purposes of decoding. In this paper, a blind
   C\&F scheme-i.e., one not requiring CSI-is developed. Rather than
   attempting to compute the optimal scale factor, this new scheme seeks
   one (or more) ``good{''} scalars, i.e., scalars which allow correct
   decoding despite possibly being sub-optimal. The region of all such good
   scalars is characterized. To find a good scalar, a computationally
   efficient scheme, involving error-detection and a hierarchically
   organized list, is proposed. Simulation results show that this blind
   C\&F scheme achieves-for a class of lattices admitting an efficient
   trellis decoder-the same throughput as its CSI-enabled counterpart, at
   the expense of, approximately, a ten-fold increase in computational
   complexity in the high-throughput region.}},

Abstract = {{We study computation of a modulo-sum of two binary source sequences over
   a two-user erasure multiple access channel. Each sender observes an
   independent and equiprobable binary sequence and the receiver is
   interested in computing the modulo-sum of these two sequences. The
   channel is modelled as a binary-input, erasure multiple access channel,
   which can be in one of three states - either the channel output is a
   modulo-sum of the two input symbols, or the channel output equals the
   input symbol on the first link and an erasure on the second link, or it
   equals the input symbol on the second link and an erasure on the first
   link. The associated state sequence is independent and identically
   distributed. We establish upper and lower bounds on the modulo-sum
   capacity. Our coding scheme uses either the compute-and-forward or the
   decode-and-forward techniques. The upper bound is obtained by a genie
   aided argument that reduces the setup to a compound multiple-access
   channel. It is in general is tighter than a simple upper bound obtained
   by revealing one of the messages to the decoders. We also briefly
   consider the case when a strictly causal state feedback is available to
   the encoders and establish that such feedback can increase the
   modulo-sum capacity.}},

   and thermal specifications of the PCM are fixed. All simulations
   consider Toronto-716240 weather conditions. Although indoor air
   temperature swing is neither much sensitive to the melting range nor to

Abstract = {{In this paper, the existing numerical methods to simulate phase change
   materials (PCMs) in building simulations are reviewed and two forms of
   the modeling scheme are explained in detail. The first formulation is a
   non-iterative temperature formulation which suffers from the requirement
   of extremely small time steps to produce accurate results. The second
   formulation is an iterative enthalpy formulation which through the use
   of an iterative correction scheme at every time step, can produce fairly
   accurate results for comparatively much larger time step values. A
   customized building simulation code was developed in MATLAB to
   incorporate the correction scheme. The simulation results were compared
   with ESP-r for the standard BESTEST Case 600 model. It was found that
   there was significant discrepancy in temperature profiles at large time
   step values when PCMs were introduced. However, the difference became
   smaller when the time steps in ESP-r was reduced while maintaining the
   large time step in the MATLAB model.}},

   tube formation from epicardial explants that were cultivated on top of
   the hydrogel, compared to T beta 4-free hydrogel and soluble T beta 4 in
   the culture medium. In vivo, subcutaneously injected T beta 4-containing
   collagen-chitosan hydrogel in rats led to enhanced vascularization
   compared to T beta 4-free hydrogel and collagen hydrogel with T beta 4.
   Furthermore, the injection of the T beta 4-encapsulated hydrogel in the

   left ventricular wall thickness after myocardial infarction in rats.}},

Abstract = {{Random Utility Maximization (RUM)-based mode choice models are
   criticized for their poor characterization of several behavioral aspects
   including habit and inertia in mode choice. As a result, traditional
   models may end up with a misleading estimation of modal shift in cases
   where strong habits towards a specific mode exist. In addition, given
   the cross-sectional nature of traditional choice models, it is hard to
   address individuals' sensitivity to various policy scenarios and to
   determine the period of time required to reap the benefits of the
   proposed policies. In order to contribute to this critical issue, this
   paper presents a review of existing literature on mode choice modeling
   focusing on capturing behavioral aspects related to habit and inertia
   formation. The paper then proposes a novel conceptual framework for a
   microsimulation learning-based mode shift model that compiles both
   reinforcement learning techniques with random utility maximization
   concepts. The proposed approach utilizes various elements of
   reinforcement learning methods to simultaneously integrate habit
   formation, level of information provision and awareness limitations. A
   numerical example is provided to illustrate the differences between
   traditional and learning-based modeling frameworks. The simulation
   results are in line with the prior expectations which can be considered
   a first step towards the model's credibility.}},

Abstract = {{Synchrotron X-ray radiography was utilized to study the time evolution
   of liquid water in an operating polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel
   cell. A high aspect ratio fuel cell designed with offset anode and
   cathode flow field channels was operated at conditions that produced
   critical water management issues. The X-ray beam was directed along the
   plane of the fuel cell, and was therefore employed to elucidate the
   through-plane distribution of liquid water in the porous materials. Due
   to the offset between the anode and cathode gas channels, the membrane
   electrode assembly exhibited sinusoidal warping, and liquid water
   accumulated in possible areas of delamination. Liquid water first
   appeared near the cathode catalyst layer, and then traveled laterally
   within the porous gas diffusion layer. The experiment provides a basis
   for future design considerations, including membrane thickness and
   attenuation estimates. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society.

Abstract = {{In the present work, the anisotropic effective thermal conductivity of
   the gas diffusion layer (GDL) of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM)
   fuel cell is determined using a thermal lattice Boltzmann model. Using
   saturation patterns obtained from three-dimensional pore network
   modeling simulations with invasion percolation, the thermal conductivity
   of the GDL containing liquid water is determined. For a GDL modeling
   domain with a total saturation of 24.4\% (flooded inlet condition),
   increases of 20.8\% and 5.4\% are noted for the through-plane and
   in-plane thermal conductivities, respectively. As the GDL plays an
   important role in thermal and water management within a PEM fuel cell,
   the simulated thermal conductivities determined in this work can provide
   insight into the effect of the GDL on the thermal management required

Abstract = {{We have recently proposed a ``surplus-based{''} algorithm which solves
   the multi-agent average consensus problem on general strongly connected
   and static digraphs. The essence of that algorithm is to employ an
   additional variable to keep track of the state changes of each agent,
   thereby achieving averaging even though the state sum is not preserved.
   In this paper, we extend this approach to the more challenging case of
   dynamic digraphs, and consider both deterministic and randomized (of the
   gossip type) time-varying scenarios. For each scenario, we design an
   extended surplus-based algorithm and derive a necessary and sufficient
   graphical condition which guarantees state averaging. In the
   deterministic time-varying case, the digraphs should be strongly
   connected in a joint sense; and in the randomized gossip case, the
   digraphs in the mean should be strongly connected. In particular, these
   conditions do not impose ``balanced{''} or ``symmetric{''} requirements
   on the network topology, and are therefore more general than those
   previously reported in the literature.}},

   that the order of the resulting controller obtained can be specified by
   the designer. Implementation of the proposed controller design approach

   channel power can oscillate within a loop. Due to the difference of time
   scale between pump control and channel power equalization, we treat the
   amplifiers in the loop as static nonlinear function mappings. Based on
   this mapping and considering transmission delay, we show that a specific
   type of channel flattening control by a output-average tracking WSS/DGE
   can cause oscillations in the quasi-ring network. Theoretical results

Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline metals are often produced in a state of stress which can
   adversely affect certain properties, e.g. corrosion resistance, wear,
   fatigue strength, etc. This stress is referred to as internal or
   ``intrinsic{''} stress since it is not directly caused by applied loads.
   The structural causes of these stresses in nanocrystalline materials are
   not fully understood and are therefore an area of particular interest.
   The internal stresses of nanocrystalline Ni and Ni-16wt\%Fe were
   measured and found to increase with the addition of iron.
   Characterization using HR-TEM revealed no signs of porosity, second
   phase particles, or a high density of dislocations. Both materials
   possessed well defined high-angle grain boundaries. The main structural
   difference between the two materials was found to be grain size and
   correspondingly, a decrease in grain size resulted in an increase in
   internal stress which supports the applicability of the coalescence
   theory. The current study also provides evidence to rule out the effect
   of voids (or porosity), dislocations, and second phases as possible
   causes of internal stress.}},

Abstract = {{The literature on queueing systems with finite buffers addresses mostly
   asymptotic performance metrics on an aggregate flow, and/or generally
   relies on a convenient, but provably inaccurate, approximation of the
   loss probability by the overflow probability in an infinite size buffer.
   This paper addresses non-asymptotic per-flow metrics in a multi-flow
   queueing system with finite buffer and FIFO scheduling. The analysis
   dispenses with the above approximation, and lends itself to several
   interesting insights on the impact of finite buffers on per-flow
   metrics. Counterintuitively, the per-flow delay distribution is not
   monotonous in the buffer size, and such an effect is especially visible
   in high burstiness regimes. Another observation is that buffer
   dimensioning becomes insensitive to the type of SLA constraint, e.g.,
   fixed violation probability on either loss or delay, in high
   multiplexing regimes. In the particular case of aggregate scheduling,
   the results on the aggregate input flow significantly improve upon
   existing results by capturing the manifestation of bufferless
   multiplexing in regimes with many flows.}},

Abstract = {{In traditional cellular networks the base stations (BSs) are more or
   less regularly deployed. In the channel model for such networks,
   correlated channel gains are only considered between a BS and multiple
   terminals (or one terminal and multiple BSs). Although the literature
   has introduced efficient techniques to produce correlated channel gains,
   to our knowledge it has not reported on the correlation between pairs of
   links with no common end. This may be a reasonable model for large cell
   sizes (or equivalently the large inter-site-distances) in the
   traditional networks. In future networks, however, it is expected that a
   large number of BSs will be deployed in random positions. With the dense
   deployment of BSs, appropriate correlation channel models should be
   developed. This paper proposes a novel shadow fading model which enables
   the generation of correlated shadow fading gains between all links in
   the network.}},

Abstract = {{Significant development has been made on phosphorescent organic light
   emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) over the past decade, which eventually
   resulted in the commercialization of widely distributed active-matrix
   organic light emitting diode displays for mobile phones. However, higher
   efficiency PHOLEDs are still needed to further reduce the cost and lower
   the power consumption for general lighting and LED backlight
   applications. In particular, red PHOLEDs currently have in general the
   lowest efficiencies among the three primary colors, due most likely to
   the energy-gap law. Therefore, a number of groups have of made use of
   various device configurations, including insertion of a carrier blocking
   or exciton confining layer, doping the transport layers, as well as
   employing multiple emissive zone structures to improve the device
   efficiency. However, these approaches are rather inconvenient for
   commercial applications. In this work, we have developed a simpler way
   to boost the performance of red PHOLEDs by incorporating an exciton
   harvesting green emitter, which transfers a large portion of the energy
   to the co-deposited red emitter. A high external quantum efficiency
   (EQE) of 20.6\% was achieved, which is among the best performances for
   red PHOLEDs.}},

Abstract = {{A major barrier to commercial adoption of organic light emitting diode
   (OLED) based devices is their often unacceptably fast rate of
   degradation. Typically, to estimate device lifetime, electrical
   parameters such as driving voltage and luminance are periodically
   measured while constant current is applied to the OLED. Due to the
   repetitive nature and long timescales involved in lifetime testing, the
   procedure is an ideal candidate for automation. An automated
   lifetime-testing system and accompanying software was developed to
   simultaneously drive multiple OLED devices and collect lifetime
   parameters while the entire system is under ultra-high vacuum
   conditions. The system is connected to a larger vacuum chamber so that
   devices can be synthesized and then analyzed in situ without exposure to
   atmosphere. The system was developed with the aim of facilitating rapid
   discovery and understanding of OLED degradation mechanisms.}},

   (OLEDs) for display and lighting applications has attracted considerable
   research interest from both academia and industry. In this work, the
   designs of simplified phosphorescent OLEDs with exceptionally high
   efficiency are discussed. It is found that discrete blocking layers and
   a double emission zone are unnecessary to achieve high efficiency in
   optimized phosphorescent OLEDs. Due to the elimination of these
   redundant layers, the device structure can be highly simplified. It is
   also shown that single-layer, two organic component devices are feasible
   with state-of-the-art efficiency.}},

   to challenges in numerically modeling the prevalent multiphase flow and

   morphology and microstructural heterogeneity on the two-phase transport
   behavior. Pore-scale modeling, namely the pore network model and the

Abstract = {{Incorporating an internal cellular architecture of open space is one
   strategy to increase the potential functionality of aluminum alloys.
   Stretch-dominated microtruss cellular architectures, which are designed
   such that externally applied loads are resolved axially along the
   internal struts, provide enhanced strength and stiffness at low
   densities when compared to conventional metal foams. In this study we
   introduce the idea of using a structural coating to reinforce AA3003
   aluminum alloy microtrusses. Because the internal surface area is large
   and the strut cross-sectional dimensions can be as small as hundreds of
   microns, only a 40 urn thick hard anodized alumina coating was needed to
   induce a four-fold increase in compressive strength and a six-fold
   increase in energy absorption at virtually no additional weight penalty.
   Backscatter electron microscopy was used to examine the failure
   mechanisms of the structural coatings and the cores in order to explain
   such a large change in behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{New types of cellular nanocomposites can be created by carburizing the
   external surface of low carbon steel microtruss materials. Microtruss
   architectures are designed to resist externally applied loads through
   axial deformation and as such can exhibit significantly enhanced
   strength and stiffness when compared to conventional metal foams. They
   can also exhibit multifunctional characteristics such as energy
   absorption and thermal management. This study used the high formability
   of simple low carbon sheet steels to create an initial microtruss
   cellular architecture by plastic deformation. Mechanical strength was
   imparted via a graded composite structure wherein an external skin of
   ultrafine internal length scale martensite was created by carburizing.
   The microtruss nanocomposites exhibited up to a five-fold increase in
   compressive strength when compared to the conventional low carbon steel
   microtruss reference. The failure mechanisms were investigated in order
   to determine an optimal composite structure.}},

Abstract = {{Low temperature processing of silicon photovoltaic (PV) solar cells with
   excellent passivation quality enables the effective use of ultra-thin
   wafers for solar cell manufacturing, thus paving the way for
   high-efficiency low-cost silicon photovoltaics. This article presents
   Back Amorphous-Crystalline Silicon Heterojunction (BACH) cell
   performance using low temperature (<= 400 degrees C) facile native
   oxide-PECVD silicon nitride (SiNx) dual layer passivation scheme. The
   cell performance is also compared with the BACH cells fabricated using
   intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon (i-aSi:H) and PECVD SiNx layer
   passivation. Reduced optical absorption in the native oxide-SiNx
   passivation layer resulted in a higher shortcircuit current, J(SC),
   compared to the i-aSi:H-SiNx passivated cells. The fill-factor also
   improved for the native oxide-SiNx passivated cells owing to the
   improved transport properties. The i-aSi:H-SiNx passivated cells
   exhibited optimum cell performance of 10.9\% efficiency with V-OC of
   598.7 mV, J(SC) of 34.3 mA/cm(2) and fill-factor of 0.531. In contrast,
   a maximum cell efficiency of 16\% is obtained for native oxide-SiNx
   passivated cells with V-OC of 651 mV, J(SC) of 35.4 mA/cm(2) and
   fill-factor of 0.694 for a 1 cm(2) untextured cell (all measurements
   having been performed under AM 1.5 global spectrum illumination). The
   above untextured cell performance is a record efficiency for a back
   amorphous-crystalline silicon heterojunction PV device synthesized using
   all low temperature processes, exceeding the previously reported highest
   cell efficiency of similar to 15\%.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic cloaking refers to the ability to prevent an object from

   in recent works by specially designed materials. Another way of cloaking

   we introduce a prescription for canceling the electromagnetic scattering
   of an object by using an array of sources. By using the equivalence
   principle, we show that by superimposing magnetic and electric surface
   current densities at the boundary of an object, the scattered fields
   from that object can be canceled. These magnetic and electric surface
   currents can be discretized into electric and magnetic dipoles that are
   physically implementable by straight and loop wire antennas. Finally, we

   iodine and more than 93\% of the ferrous iron after 3 months storage at
   35 degrees C and 60\% relative humidity (RH). Hydrophilic coatings such
   as hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) offered more protection at the
   10\% encapsulation level compared to other coating materials studied.
   All iron premix formulations exhibited high particle density, good

   have uniform rectangular cross-section and are sufficiently thin to (1)
   reduce cost, (2) enable rapid temperature control, and (3) provide
   optical transparency. The chips can be fabricated without a cleanroom
   from start to finish in less than 2 h. We demonstrate the potential of
   this approach by measuring the displacement of an oil solution by carbon
   dioxide in a nine-layer thin-film Teflon chip modelling porous media.
   Optical transparency through the 9-layers enables the determination of
   an oil recovery rate. We also demonstrate a thin-film chip measurement
   of the viscosity of heavy oil/toluene mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Novel cone-shaped carbon nanofiber (CNF)/silicon carbide (SiC)-coated
   Si-nanocone (Si-NC) composite structures with excellent field emission
   (FE) performance have been fabricated by a simple microwave plasma
   chemical vapour deposition process. Transmission electron microscopy
   analyses reveal that the newly developed cone-shaped composite
   structures are composed of bamboo-like herringbone CNFs grown vertically
   on the tips of conical SiC layers with a flat-top Si cone embedded
   underneath. For this CNF/SiC-coated Si-NC composite array, a ultra-low
   threshold field of 0.32 V mu m(-1) (at 10 mA cm(-2)), a large emission
   current density of 668 mA cm(-2) at 1.05 V mu m(-1), and a field
   enhancement factor as high as similar to 48 349 are obtained. In
   addition, the FE lifetime test performed at a large emission current
   density of 200 mA cm(-2) under an applied field of 1 V mu m(-1) shows no
   discernible decay during a period of over 260 minutes. We deduce that
   this superior FE performance can be attributed to the specific
   bamboo-like herringbone CNFs with numerous open graphitic edges and a
   faceted top end, and the conical base SiC/ Si structures with sufficient
   adhesion to the substrate surface. Such a novel structure with promising
   emission characteristics makes it a potential material for electron
   field emitters.}},

Abstract = {{We model a partially observable deteriorating system subject to random
   failure. The state process follows an unobservable continuous time
   homogeneous Markov chain. At equidistant sampling times vector-valued
   observations having multivariate normal distribution with
   state-dependent mean and covariance matrix are obtained at a positive
   cost. At each sampling epoch a decision is made either to run the system
   until the next sampling epoch or to carry out full preventive
   maintenance, which is assumed to be less costly than corrective
   maintenance carried out upon system failure. The objective is to
   determine the optimal control policy that minimizes the long-run
   expected average cost per unit time. We show that the optimal preventive
   maintenance region is a convex subset of Euclidean space. We also
   analyze the practical three-state version of this problem in detail and
   show that in this case the optimal policy is a control limit policy. An
   efficient computational algorithm is developed for the three-state
   problem, illustrated by a numerical example.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an agent based modeling (ABM) study oriented
   towards simulating crowds and movements of agents within a confined
   area. The region of interest is a rectangular room with one or two
   exits, where the sounding of an alarm triggers agents to move towards
   the exit(s). The agent based model is built around a game framework with
   emphasis on visualization of agent behavior. Agent interactions are
   local, well defined and approximate behaviors modeled in other crowd
   simulations. Agents have six behavioral modes, which control the agents'
   target(s), their capacity to make decisions regarding which path to
   take, and their ability to communicate to one another. The initial
   intent was to observe the behaviors during egress where crowding occurs
   at the exit bottleneck. Behaviors of agents leaving are typically as
   expected as all interactions were coded to precipitate the events. The
   accidental or serendipitous behavior was a consequence of extending the
   simulation beyond the observations of crowd formation associated with
   the exodus. It is the visualization afforded by a serious game
   development framework and visualization which facilitated the
   observation of emergent behavior. This accidental emergence or
   spontaneous order was observed and not explicitly controlled or
   programmed.}},

Abstract = {{A coarse-fine time-to-digital converter (TDC) is presented with a
   calibrated course stage followed by a stochastic fine stage. On
   power-up, calibration algorithm based on a code density test is used to
   minimize nonlinearities in the coarse TDC. By using a balanced mean
   method, the number of registers required for calibration algorithm is a
   reduced by 30\%. Based upon the coarse TDC resuls, the appropriate clock
   signals are multiplexed into a stochastic fine TDC. The TDC is
   incorporated into a 1.9-2.54 GHz digital phase locked loop (DPLL) in
   0.13 mu m CMOS. The DPLL consumes a total of 15.2 mW of which 4.4 mW are
   consumed in the TDC. Measurements show an in-band phase noise of -107
   dBc/Hz which is equivalent to 4 ps TDC resolution, approximately an
   order of magnitude better than an inverter delay in this process
   technology. The integrated random jitter is 213 fs. The calibration
   reduces worst-case spurs by 16 dB.}},

Abstract = {{At nanoscale, surface and interface have significant effects on the
   physical and mechanical properties of solids, due to the increasing
   ratio of surface/interface area to volume. The diffraction of plane
   compressional and shear waves by a cylindrical nano-inclusion are
   investigated in this paper. To account for the effect of
   surface/interface energy at nanoscale, the surface/interface elasticity
   is adopted in analysis. The mathematical modeling shows that
   surface/interface parameter has significant effect on the diffraction of
   elastic waves when the radius of the inclusion decreases to nanometers.
   However, the numerical results show that beyond a critical interfacial
   parameter, the surface/interface effect does not affect on the
   diffracted wave from the nano-inclusion and the form function becomes
   independent of variation of the surface/interface energy.}},

Abstract = {{An AlGaN/GaN high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) with a novel
   source-connected Air-bridge Field Plate (AFP) is simulated, optimized
   and experimentally verified. The device features a metal field plate
   that jumps from the source over the gate region and lands between gate
   and drain. The fabrication process is based on a commercially available
   RF GaN on SiC technology. Device characteristics for this work were
   optimized via layout changes only. An extensive analysis on the surface
   electrical field distribution was used to study the effect of varying
   AFP dimension. Simulation results indicated a breakdown voltage of 425 V
   for the AFP device can be achieved at V-GS = -5 V. The gate to drain
   distance is 6 mu m and the gate length is 0.8 mu m. The fabricated
   results for AFP device are in relatively good agreement with the
   simulation results and exhibit improvement in forward blocking voltage
   of 375 V at V-GS = -5 V. This is a factor of 3x improvement when
   compared to the best device that can be fabricated using conventional
   field plate (FP) for this particular process. The measured specific
   on-resistance for the device with the proposed AFP is 0.58 m Omega.cm(2)
   at V-GS = 0 V, which compares favorably with 0.79 m Omega.cm(2) for the
   device with a conventional FP.}},

   using a commercially available mechanical testing platform and clearly

Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{6574-6580}},
Abstract = {{Studies on the self-assembly of metal nanoparticles (NPs) in the
   presence of ions are motivated by the biosensing applications of NP
   clusters and the capability to control the morphology of clusters of
   oppositely charged NPs. The effect of ions has been explored for the
   self-assembly of metal NPs capped solely with ionic ligands, whereas, in
   general, the surface of NPs can be coated with a mixture of ligands
   interacting with each other by non-electrostatic forces. In the present
   work, we examined the kinetics of self-assembly of gold nanorods capped
   with a mixture of low-molecular weight ionic molecules and nonpolar
   polymer ligands. We show that in contrast with earlier reports on the
   effect of electrolytes on NP self-assembly, the driving force for the
   accelerated self-assembly of nanorods is the reduction in polymer
   solubility in the presence of ions, rather than the screening of the
   electric double layer of the charged ligands. The reported results are
   important for NP self-assembly occurring in mixed solvents, in which
   attraction forces between nonpolar ligands are governed by the balance
   between solvent-solvent and solvent-salt interactions. Furthermore, the
   addition of salts can be used to increase the rate of nanorod
   self-assembly, which, otherwise, is an intrinsically slow process.}},

Abstract = {{There has been a recent trend that video-on-demand (VoD) providers such
   as Netflix are leveraging resources from cloud services for multimedia
   streaming. In this paper, we consider the scenario that a VoD provider
   can make reservations for bandwidth guarantees from cloud service
   providers to guarantee the streaming performance in each video channel.
   We propose a predictive resource auto-scaling system that dynamically
   books the minimum bandwidth resources from multiple data centers for the
   VoD provider to match its short-term demand projections. We exploit the
   anti-correlation between the demands of video channels for statistical
   multiplexing and for hedging the risk of under-provision. The optimal
   load direction from channels to data centers is derived with provable
   performance. We further provide suboptimal solutions that balance
   bandwidth and storage costs. The system is backed up by a demand
   predictor that forecasts the demand expectation, volatility and
   correlations based on learning. Extensive simulations are conducted
   driven by the workload traces from a commercial VoD system.}},

Abstract = {{We aim to enhance the end-to-end rate of a general dual-hop relay
   network with multiple channels and finite modulation formats, by jointly
   optimizing channel pairing, power allocation, and integer bit loading.
   Such an optimization problem has both a discrete feasible region, due to
   the combinatoric nature of channel pairing, and a discrete objective,
   due to the bit loading requirement. For this type of mixed-integer
   programming problems, the Lagrange dual method generally is
   inapplicable, due to the non-zero duality gap. However, by exploring the
   structure of our problem, we are able to bound the gap to within one
   bit, allowing the extraction of an exact optimal integer solution. We
   further present complexity reduction techniques, and demonstrate that
   the proposed solution only requires a computational complexity that is
   polynomial in the number of channels, realizing efficient implementation
   in practical systems. Through numerical experiments, we show that the
   jointly optimal solution can significantly outperform common sub-optimal
   alternatives.}},

   consider a new type of service where VoD providers, such as Netflix and

   negotiable prices to support continuous media streaming. We argue that
   it is beneficial to multiplex such bandwidth reservations in the market
   using a profit-making broker while controlling the performance risks. We
   ask the question-in such a market, how much should each VoD provider pay
   for bandwidth reservation? We prove that the market has a unique Nash
   equilibrium where the bandwidth reservation price for a VoD provider
   critically depends on its demand correlation to the market. Real-world
   traces verify that our theory can significantly lower the market price

Abstract = {{Opportunistic wireless channel access by non-licensed users has emerged
   as a promising solution for addressing the bandwidth scarcity challenge.
   Auctions represent a natural mechanism for allocating the spectrum,
   generating an economic incentive for the licensed user to relinquish
   channels. A severe limitation of existing spectrum auction designs lies
   in the over-simplifying assumption that every non-licensed user is a
   single-node or single-link secondary user. While such an assumption
   makes the auction design easier, it does not capture practical scenarios
   where users have multihop routing demands. For the first time in the
   literature, we propose to model non-licensed users as secondary networks
   (SNs), each of which comprises of a multihop network with end-to-end
   routing demands. We aim to design truthful auctions for allocating
   channels to SNs in a coordinated fashion that maximizes social welfare
   of the system. We use simple examples to show that such auctions among
   SNs differ drastically from simple auctions among single-hop users, and
   previous solutions suffer severely from local, per-hop decision making.
   We first design a simple, heuristic auction that takes inter-SN
   interference into consideration, and is truthful. We then design a
   randomized auction based on primal-dual linear optimization, with a
   proven performance guarantee for approaching optimal social welfare. A
   key technique in our solution is to decompose a linear program (LP)
   solution for channel assignment into a set of integer program (IP)
   solutions, then applying a pair of tailored primal and dual LPs for
   computing probabilities of choosing each IP solution. We prove the
   truthfulness and performance bound of our solution, and verify its
   effectiveness through simulation studies.}},

Abstract = {{Datacenters can be used to host large-scale video services with better
   operational efficiency, as the multi-achieved by virtualization
   technologies allows different to share resources at the same physical

   under-utilized may be a solution to handle a flash crowd in the form of
   virtual machines (VMs). However, such has to be performed with a
   well-designed mechanism to utilize available resources in all three
   resource dimensions: bandwidth and CPU cycles. In this paper, we show
   the challenge of maximizing resource utilization in a video datacenter
   is equivalent to maximizing the joint profit context of Nash bargaining
   solutions, by defining utility properly. Having servers participating as
   players to with each other, and VMs as commodities in the game,
   conducted after bargaining govern VM migration decisions server. With
   extensive simulations driven by real-world from UUSee Inc., we show that

   productivity, or gaming applications. In this paper, we make a case that
   such social interactions should be much more spontaneous to users in
   these applications. We design and implement a new system framework,
   Reflex, to provide the required system support to achieve spontaneous
   social interaction with other users in the same mobile application, be
   they in the same living room or around the world. Reflex features a
   simple and intuitive application programming interface (API), and uses
   cloud computing services from Google App Engine to offer the scalability
   and performance required to support spontaneous social networking at a
   large scale. Reflex is able to transparently switch to local
   interactions over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi interfaces, available on mobile
   devices, whenever possible. In order to evaluate Reflex in the iOS
   platform, we developed a real-world music composition application,
   called MusicScore, from scratch on the iPad, which takes advantage of
   Reflex to let music composers collaborate in real time.}},

   size drops with three different fluid properties of water, mercury and
   tetradecane are presented. Various drop diameters ranging from 200 pm to
   5 mm are considered. A separation criterion based upon deformation data
   is found. The lower critical Weber numbers are found for mercury and
   water drops while tetradecane drops did not result in separation for the
   range of Weber numbers considered. The effect of Reynolds number is
   investigated and regions of permanent coalescence and separation are
   plotted in the Weber-Reynolds number plane. The role of viscosity and
   its effect on dissipation is also investigated. Finally, the validity of
   the assumptions made in some of the collision models is assessed.}},

Abstract = {{The detection performance of a high frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR)
   system is primarily limited by clutter, especially ionospheric clutter.
   Therefore, in order to analyze and/or simulate the capabilities of an
   HFSWR system a model for the clutter is required. This paper develops
   and tests a new radio wave propagation theory to model ionospheric
   clutter. The model is based on path integrals of ray tracing equations
   which predict the phase power spectrum of clutter due to irregularities
   in the plasma. This power spectrum is then used to simulate
   three-dimensional space-time-range radar data cubes. The accuracy of the
   model is tested by comparing the simulated data to measured data cubes.
   As an application, the data is then used to evaluate the performance of
   the newly developed fast fully adaptive processing scheme to mitigate
   clutter.}},

Abstract = {{Space-time adaptive processing (STAP) algorithms generally address
   interference, whether homogeneous or not, and are tested in environments
   with a single target or with targets that do not interact with each
   other. However, a high frequency surface-wave radar (HFSWR) monitoring
   off-shore activity likely sees many targets closely spaced in angle,
   Doppler and range. Target detection in HFSWR is further complicated by
   the nonhomogeneous sea clutter. In this paper we develop a two-stage
   STAP algorithm, based on the previously developed fast fully adaptive
   (FFA) approach, for the dense target scenarios of interest. The proposed
   algorithm is tested on measured data provided by Raytheon Canada. Our
   results show that the modified FFA scheme is able to detect targets not
   seen by the current scheme used to generate the provided track data.}},

Pages = {{246-258}},
Abstract = {{As the world's elderly population drastically increases, aging-related
   cognitive impairments have become one of the biggest healthcare
   concerns. In this paper, we present the design of an assistive kitchen
   system consisting of a user interface with two-way speech communication
   and an automated cabinet system to help promote aging-in-place. The
   assistive kitchen system incorporates a cognitive assistance feature
   that helps the user in overcoming initiation, planning, attention, and
   memory deficits, while performing kitchen-based activities of daily
   living (ADLs) such as storing and retrieving items, and obtaining
   recipes for meal preparation. This feature works synchronously with the
   automated kitchen cabinet to directly provide the location of an item to
   a user, bring the item in closer reach and also prompt the user to
   retrieve the item. An initial prototype of the assistive kitchen system
   has been developed and performance testing has been conducted. The
   testing has shown high success rates for users' retrieving and storing
   specified kitchen items. A small scale study was also conducted
   measuring the acceptance and use of the proposed system by older adults.
   The results show promise for the further development and use of the
   system for the outlined kitchen ADLs.}},

Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by a class of contact vibration control problems in mechanical
   systems, this paper considers a regulation problem for discrete-time
   switched bimodal linear systems where it is desired to achieve output
   regulation against partially known deterministic and unknown random
   exogenous signals. First, a set of observer-based Youla parameterized
   stabilizing controllers is constructed, based on which the regulation
   conditions for the switched system against the deterministic signals
   along with an H-2 performance constraint against the unknown random
   signals are derived. Then a corresponding regulator synthesis algorithm
   is developed based on solving properly formulated linear matrix
   inequalities. The proposed regulator is successfully evaluated on an
   experimental setup involving a switched bimodal mechanical system
   subject to contact vibrations, hence, demonstrating the effectiveness of
   the proposed regulation approach.}},

Abstract = {{Total ordering is a messaging guarantee increasingly required of
   content-based pub/sub systems, which are traditionally focused on
   performance. The main challenge is the uniform ordering of streams of
   publications from multiple publishers within an overlay broker network
   to be delivered to multiple subscribers. Our solution integrates total
   ordering into the pub/sub logic instead of offloading it as an external
   service. We show that our solution is fully distributed and relies only
   on local broker knowledge and overlay links. We can identify and isolate
   specific publications and subscribers where synchronization is required:
   the overhead is therefore contained to the affected subscribers. Our
   solution remains safe under the presence of failure, where we show total
   order to be impossible to maintain. Our experiments demonstrate that our
   solution scales with the number of subscriptions and has limited
   overhead for the non-conflicting cases. A holistic comparison with group
   communication systems is offered to evaluate their relative scalability.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud resources are usually priced in multiple markets with different
   service guarantees. For example, Amazon EC2 prices virtual instances
   under three pricing schemes - the subscription option (a.k.a., Reserved
   Instances), the pay-as-you-go offer (a.k.a., On-Demand Instances), and
   an auction-like spot market (a.k.a., Spot Instances) - simultaneously.
   There arises a new problem of capacity segmentation: how can a provider
   allocate resources to different categories of pricing schemes, so that
   the total revenue is maximized? In this paper, we consider an EC2-like
   pricing scheme with traditional pay-as-you-go pricing augmented by an
   auction market, where bidders periodically bid for resources and can use
   the instances for as long as they wish, until the clearing price exceeds
   their bids. We show that optimal periodic auctions must follow the
   design of m+1-price auction with seller's reservation price. Theoretical
   analysis also suggests the connections between periodic auctions and EC2
   spot market. Furthermore, we formulate the optimal capacity segmentation
   strategy as a Markov decision process over some demand prediction
   window. To mitigate the high computational complexity of the
   conventional dynamic programming solution, we develop a near-optimal
   solution that has significantly lower complexity and is shown to
   asymptotically approach the optimal revenue.}},

Abstract = {{Across many architectures and parallel programming paradigms, collective
   communication plays a key role in performance and correctness. Hardware
   support is necessary to prevent important collective communication from
   becoming a system bottleneck. Support for multicast communication in
   Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) has achieved substantial throughput improvements
   and power savings. In this paper, we explore support for reduction or
   many-to-one communication operations. As a case study, we focus on
   acknowledgement messages (ACK) that must be collected in a directory
   protocol before a cache line may be upgraded to or installed in the
   modified state. This paper makes two primary contributions: an efficient
   framework to support the reduction of ACK packets and a novel Balanced,
   Adaptive Multicast (BAM) routing algorithm. The proposed message
   combination framework complements several multicast algorithms. By
   combining ACK packets during transmission, this framework not only
   reduces packet latency by 14.1\% for low-to-medium network loads, but
   also improves the network saturation throughput by 9.6\% with little
   overhead. The balanced buffer resource configuration of BAM improves the
   saturation throughput by an additional 13.8\%. For the PARSEC
   benchmarks, our design offers an average speedup of 12.7\% and a maximal
   speedup of 16.8\%.(1)}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel synchronization mechanism called versioning. It
   dynamically establishes a deterministic order of memory accesses in
   parallel programs that have serial semantics, in a way that is
   transparent to the program m er. This order is created in a distributed
   manner and is enforced by monitoring memory accesses and stalling
   threads if necessary. Versioning gives rise to parallel programming
   models in which programmers need not explicitly synchronize threads and
   only need to specify shared data, which greatly simplifies parallel
   programming. However, versioning introduces overheads and thus demands
   architectural support. We describe versioning and the architectural
   support it needs. We also propose one parallel programming model that
   utilizes versioning and use it to parallelize 13 benchmark applications.
   We build an FPGA prototype of a multiprocessor system with versioning
   support and show that good parallel speedups are obtained. Our analysis
   shows minimal impact of versioning, both in terms of timing over-heads
   and in terms of additional hardware.}},

Abstract = {{Routing algorithms for networks-on-chip (NoCs) typically only have a
   small number of virtual channels (VCs) at their disposal. Limited VCs
   pose several challenges to the design of fully adaptive routing
   algorithms. First, fully adaptive routing algorithms based on previous
   deadlock-avoidance theories require a conservative VC re-allocation
   scheme: a VC can only be re-allocated when it is empty, which limits
   performance. We propose a novel VC reallocation scheme, whole packet
   forwarding (WPF), which allows a non-empty VC to be re-allocated. WPF
   leverages the observation that the majority of packets in NoCs are
   short. We prove that WPF does not induce deadlock if the routing
   algorithm is deadlock-free using conservative VC re-allocation. WPF is
   an important extension of previous deadlock-avoidance theories. Second,
   to efficiently utilize WPF in VC-limited networks, we design a novel
   fully adaptive routing algorithm which maintains packet adaptivity
   without significant hardware cost. Compared with conservative VC
   re-allocation, WPF achieves an average 88.9\% saturation throughput
   improvement in synthetic traffic patterns and an average 21.3\% and
   maximal 37.8\% speedup for PARSEC applications with heavy network loads.
   Our design also offers higher performance than several partially
   adaptive and deterministic routing algorithms.(1)}},

Abstract = {{This work targets non-isolated, bi-directional dc-dc converters for
   hybrid energy-storage systems in light electric vehicles. Three
   operating modes are used to achieve high-efficiency over the full load
   range based on the inductor current constraints. The highest switching
   frequency is used near the rated current in order to limit the peak
   inductor current and avoid saturation. Soft-switching ZVS turn-on is
   achieved on both transistors in the mid-load range, where the frequency
   is automatically controlled to maintain a fixed dead-time and
   near-constant negative inductor valley-current.
   Pulse-frequency-modulation is used at light-load conditions for improved
   efficiency. A 2 kW two-phase bi-directional dc-dc converter prototype
   was implemented to demonstrate the tri-mode operation. The converter
   operates with an input voltage of 50 V and an output voltage of 100 V.
   Using the proposed tri-mode control scheme, a peak efficiency of 97.5\%

   minimize the size of the CSC, the size of the input-filter/output-filter

   operation at high switching-frequencies, e. g., above 40kHz. A
   four-quadrant CSC operating at high-switching frequency requires: (i) a
   new ac-switch and (ii) a new commutation-strategy. To achieve these
   requirements the IGBT-diode-based CSC is not a suitable option, because:
   (i) it cannot provide bidirectional power flow and (ii) it cannot
   provide a fast turn-on and turn-off switching process; therefore, the
   switching-frequency is limited. This paper proposes a new CSC, operating
   based on MOSFET switches to provide: (i) the capability of operation at
   above 40kHz switching-frequency and (ii) providing a bidirectional power

Abstract = {{Adult central mammalian axons show minimal regeneration after spinal
   cord injury due to loss of oligodendrocytes, demyelination of surviving
   axons, absence of growth-promoting molecules, and inhibitors of axonal
   outgrowth. In the present study, we attempted to address these
   impediments to regeneration by using a combinatory strategy to enhance
   cell survival and regeneration after complete spinal cord transection
   (SCT) in adult rats. The strategy comprised: 1) adult rat brain-derived
   neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) preseeded on laminin-coated
   chitosan channels; 2) extramedullary chitosan channels to promote axonal
   regrowth and reduce the barrier caused by scarring; 3) local delivery of
   a novel rat soluble Nogo-66 receptor protein {[}NgR(310)ecto-Fc,
   referred to as NgR] to block the inhibitory effect of myelin-based
   inhibitors; and 4) local delivery of basic fibroblast growth factor,
   epidermal growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor to enhance
   survival and promote differentiation of transplanted cells. Compared
   with our previous studies where brain-derived NSPCs preseeded in
   extramedullary chitosan channels were implanted in the same SCT model
   but without growth factors and NgR, the present channel-growth factor
   combination produced greater numbers of surviving NSPCs after SCT. Also,
   the growth factors promoted preferential differentiation of NSPCs toward
   oligodendrocytes, while NgR significantly decreased astrocytic
   differentiation of NSPCs. NgR alone or in combination with NSPCs
   significantly enhanced the total number of myelinated fibers in the
   bridge and increased the area of the bridging tissue between the cord
   stumps. The combination of NgR, growth factors, and NSPCs had
   synergistic effect on bridge formation. However, only a small number of
   descending corticospinal tract axons grew into the central portions of
   the bridges as shown by anterograde tracing of the corticospinal tract
   with BDA. The majority of the regenerated axons in the channels
   originated from local host neurons adjacent to the tissue bridges. In
   conclusion, we showed that growth factors increased survival of
   transplanted NSPCs whereas NgR enhanced axonal regeneration, but the
   combination did not have additive effects on functional recovery or
   regeneration.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{12, SI}},
Pages = {{1100-1114}},
Abstract = {{This article investigates the effect of equipment replacement on the
   design phase of multi-machine manufacturing systems, given a finite
   horizon and discounted costs. For the most part, the manufacturing
   system design literature has focused on the design issue, ignoring
   equipment replacement and its economic impact. The design phase
   generally consists of equipment selection, process routing, and layout
   decisions. The authors propose an explicit mathematical form for the
   operating costs of equipment and their salvage values based on their
   previous experience of life cycle costing projects. The design phase of
   cellular manufacturing systems, the so-called cell formation problem, is
   used. The problem is formulated as a non-linear mixed-integer
   programming model and solved using a proposed branch-and-bound
   algorithm. The algorithm employs a depth-first branching strategy in
   conjunction with a bounding procedure with a heuristic method. Selected
   numerical examples demonstrate the applicability of the model and verify
   the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results enable the best
   equipment mix and product process routes to be chosen based on the given
   horizon and economic factors; in addition, information is obtained about
   which equipment should be replaced and at what time point this
   replacement should occur.}},

Abstract = {{With the goal of controlling stem cell fate, for ultimate application in
   cell delivery, we synthesized a cell delivery vehicle comprised of an
   injectable hydrogel of hyaluronan (HA) and methyl cellulose (MC) wherein
   the MC is modified to allow bio-orthogonal coupling chemistry.
   Specifically, MC was modified using thiol-maleimide and
   biotin-streptavidin chemistry to covalently conjugate the cell adhesive
   peptide, glycine-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine (GRGDS), and the
   oligodendrocyte-differentiating factor, recombinant platelet-derived
   growth factor A (rPDGF-A). NSPCs differentiated into significantly more
   oligodendrocytes when cultured in a HAMC hydrogel modified with both
   PDGF-A and GRGDS compared to controls of unmodified HAMC hydrogel and
   HAMC modified with only GRGDS. These results demonstrate both the
   ability to influence NSPC fate with immobilized growth factor and a

   et al. {[}J. Molina, B. A. Hoyos, Electrochim. Acta, 54, 1784-1790
   (2009)] and Milchev {[}A. Milchev, ``Electrocrystallization:

   Publishers, 189-215] for galvanostatic pulse electrodeposition of nickel
   on metallic substrates employing four different waveforms was developed
   and compared with experimental results. The model is based on
   progressive nucleation and, unlike other reported models, considers
   contributions from both nucleation and growth currents. A comparison
   between the model and experimental results revealed a reasonably good
   agreement at low peak deposition current densities and low pulse
   on-times, where the average grain diameter was greater than 50 nm.
   However, as the pulse on-time or peak deposition current density
   increased, leading to a decrease in average grain size, the difference
   between the model and experimental results became more pronounced. At
   high peak deposition current densities-greater than 400 mA cm(-2)-the
   ramp-down waveform yielded the highest nucleation rates, confirming the
   experimental findings in which nickel electrodeposits generated with
   ramp-down waveform produced the smallest average grain size. (C) 2012

Number = {{10, SI}},
Pages = {{1253-1269}},
Abstract = {{The switching of market regimes has a significant impact on derivative
   pricing that exposes investors to an additional level of risk. However,
   deriving the exact price of exotic options under regime switching is
   still at the early stages of development. In this article, we consider
   deriving tight upper and lower bounds for the price of a wide class of
   exotic options under regime switching. We show that the additional
   complexity introduced by the regime-switching dynamics can be greatly
   reduced by exploiting the additive structure of the infinitesimal
   generator of the regime-switching process. As a result, the problem of
   bounding the option price under regime switching can be reformulated as
   a semidefinite programming problem, which can be solved efficiently in
   practice. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated through
   numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{Hazard-based stop duration models for the stop duration of commercial
   vehicles in urban areas are presented. Passively collected GPS data were
   used to estimate two hazard-survival models to predict the stop duration
   of commercial vehicles undertaking urban pickup and delivery tours. The
   first was an accelerated failure-time parametric hazard model, and the
   second was a proportional nonparametric hazard model. Explanatory
   variables included time of day, population or employment density, number
   of stops, distance of inbound and outbound trips, and attributes of
   destination establishments, such as sales volume and industry
   classification. Models were estimated with and without establishment
   data because these data may not always be available for model
   application. Results showed that passively collected GPS data could be
   used to estimate stop duration models when linked with other data
   sources that provided appropriate explanatory variables. The parametric
   models were shown to outperform the nonparametric models and had higher
   measures of goodness of fit and better hazard distributions for stop
   duration.}},

Abstract = {{The proton exchange membrane fuel cell offers an exceptional potential
   for a clean, efficient, and reliable power source. The bipolar plate is
   a key component in this device, as it connects each cell electrically,
   supplies reactant gases to both anode and cathode, and removes reaction
   products from the cell. Bipolar plates have been fabricated primarily
   from high-density graphite, but in recent years, much attention has been
   paid to developing cost-effective and feasible alternative materials.
   Two different classes of materials have attracted attention: metals and
   composites. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the current

Abstract = {{This article proposes a model to find an optimal periodic inspection
   interval over a finite time horizon for a multi-component system. The
   system's components are subject to either hard or soft failures. Hard
   failures are detected and fixed instantaneously. Soft failures are
   unrevealed and can only be detected at inspections. Soft failures do not
   stop the system from operating; however, they may reduce its level of
   performance from its designed value. The system is inspected
   periodically to detect soft failures; however, a hard failure instance
   also provides an opportunity called opportunistic inspection to inspect
   and fix soft failures. Two models are discussed in this article. The
   first model assumes that components with soft and hard failures are
   minimally repaired. The second model assumes the possibility of either
   minimal repair or replacement of a component with soft failure, with
   some age-dependent probabilities. Recursive procedures are developed to
   calculate the expected number of minimal repairs and replacements and
   expected downtimes of components with soft failure. Examples of the
   calculation of the optimal inspection intervals are given. The data used
   in the examples are adapted from a hospital's maintenance data for
   general infusion pump.}},

   Enhanced stability and water uptake were observed for the cross-linked

   Thermal analysis revealed an increase of water content with the
   percentage of cross-linking. Structural analyses suggested that SiWA in
   the cross-linked polymer electrolyte was more hydrated than SiWA in the
   non-cross-linked polymer electrolyte. In addition, a stronger hydrogen

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{169-209}},
Abstract = {{From its inception, the focus of ontological engineering has been to
   support the reusability and shareability of ontologies, as well as
   interoperability of ontology-based software systems. Among the
   approaches employed to address these challenges have been ontology
   repositories and the modularization of ontologies. In this paper we
   combine these approaches and use the relationships between first-order
   ontologies within a repository (such as non-conservative extension and
   relative interpretation) to characterize the criteria for modularity. In
   particular, we introduce the notion of core hierarchies, which are sets
   of theories with the same non-logical lexicons and which are all
   non-conservative extensions of a unique root theory. The technique of
   relative interpretation leads to the notion of reducibility of a theory
   to a set of theories in different core hierarchies. We show how these
   relationships support a semi-automated procedure that decomposes an
   ontology into irreducible modules. We also propose a semi-automated
   procedure that can use the relationships between modules to characterize
   which modules can be shared and reused among different ontologies.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that both crack spacings and crack widths in members
   with conventional reinforcement can be reduced by adding steel fibers to
   the concrete mix. This behavior is important not only for predictions of
   the tensile behavior including tensile stresses due to tension
   stiffening and fibers, but also for evaluations of the serviceability or
   ultimate capacity of FRC members containing conventional reinforcement
   (R/FRC). Since test results for the tensile behavior of R/FRC members
   are scarce in comparison to those for ordinary reinforced concrete
   members (RC) or FRC members without rebar, an experimental program was
   undertaken to better understand the effect of fibers in conjunction With
   conventional reinforcement. In this research, direct tensile tests were
   conducted on 12 RC and 48 R/FRC specimens of 1.0 m length. The variables
   included steel fiber type, fiber volumetric ratio, and reinforcement
   ratio. From the test results it was observed that cracks were more
   finely distributed in R/FRC members, and that the average crack spacing
   decreased until the rebar yielded. After yielding of the rebar, the
   tensile deformation was dominated by one or two cracks. It was also
   determined that currently available formulae significantly overestimate
   the average crack spacing in R/FRC members. Based on the test results, a
   new crack spacing formula is developed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{In process plants, most pipelines are subject to erosion and/or
   corrosion due to the presence of aggressive agents, turbulence, or high
   fluid velocity. Among other causes, changes in process parameters can be
   considered as an important cause of changes in pipe wall
   erosion/corrosion rate. Quick detection of these changes by continuous
   monitoring of the thinning rate of the pipe wall can help prevent
   further wall damage at early stages of development. In this paper, we
   apply the cross-correlation technique to ultrasonic signals for accurate
   estimation of fine changes in the erosion/corrosion rate. The resolution
   of the cross-correlation technique is increased by combining it with
   curve fitting methods. The technique is applied to experimental data
   obtained from a test rig designed for simulating accelerated corrosion
   in pipes. The results of the new approach are compared with results
   obtained from a model-based estimation method and very good agreement is
   observed. The new approach is simple and fast and can be easily
   incorporated in ultrasonic measurement systems used in process plants.}},

   time-frequency dictionaries based on modulated discrete prolate
   spheroidal sequences}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring physiological functions such as swallowing often generates
   large volumes of samples to be stored and processed, which can introduce
   computational constraints especially if remote monitoring is desired. In
   this article, we propose a compressive sensing (CS) algorithm to
   alleviate some of these issues while acquiring dual-axis swallowing
   accelerometry signals. The proposed CS approach uses a time-frequency
   dictionary where the members are modulated discrete prolate spheroidal
   sequences (MDPSS). These waveforms are obtained by modulation and
   variation of discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS) in order to
   reflect the time-varying nature of swallowing acclerometry signals.
   While the modulated bases permit one to represent the signal behavior
   accurately, the matching pursuit algorithm is adopted to iteratively
   decompose the signals into an expansion of the dictionary bases. To test
   the accuracy of the proposed scheme, we carried out several numerical
   experiments with synthetic test signals and dual-axis swallowing
   accelerometry signals. In both cases, the proposed CS approach based on
   the MDPSS yields more accurate representations than the CS approach
   based on DPSS. Specifically, we show that dual-axis swallowing
   accelerometry signals can be accurately reconstructed even when the
   sampling rate is reduced to half of the Nyquist rate. The results
   clearly indicate that the MDPSS are suitable bases for swallowing
   accelerometry signals.}},

Abstract = {{Instead of allowing the recovery of original passwords, forgotten
   passwords are often reset using online mechanisms such as password
   verification questions (PVQ methods) and password reset links in email.
   These mechanisms are generally weak, exploitable, and force users to
   choose new passwords. Emailing the original password exposes the
   password to third parties. To address these issues, and to allow
   forgotten passwords to be securely restored, we present a scheme called
   Mercury. Its primary mode employs user-level public keys and a personal
   mobile device (PMD) such as a smart-phone, netbook, or tablet. A user
   generates a key pair on her PMD; the private key remains on the PMD and
   the public key is shared with different sites (e.g., during account
   setup). For password recovery, the site sends the (public key)-encrypted
   password to the user's pre-registered email address, or displays the
   encrypted password on a webpage, e.g., as a barcode. The encrypted
   password is then decrypted using the PMD and revealed to the user. A
   prototype implementation of Mercury is available as an Android
   application.}},

Abstract = {{Chitosan (CHT)-based polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) have been
   receiving great attention for tissue engineering approaches. These
   hydrogels are held together by ionic forces and can be disrupted by
   changes in physiological conditions. In this study, we present a new
   class of CHT-based PEC hydrogels amenable to stabilization by chemical
   crosslinking. The photocrosslinkable anionic methacrylated gellan gum
   (MeGG) was complexed with cationic CHT and exposed to light, forming a
   PEC hydrogel. The chemical characterization of the photocrosslinkable
   PEC hydrogel by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed
   absorption peaks specific to the raw polymers. A significantly higher
   swelling ratio was observed for the PEC hydrogel with higher CHT
   content. The molecular interactions between both polysaccharides were
   evaluated chemically and microscopically, indicating the diffusion of
   CHT to the interior of the hydrogel. We hypothesized that the addition
   of MeGG to CHT solution first leads to a membrane formation around MeGG.
   Then, migration of CHT inside the MeGG hydrogel occurs to balance the
   electrostatic charges. The photocrosslinkable feature of MeGG further
   allowed the formation of cell-laden microscale hydrogel units with
   different shapes and sizes. Overall, this system is potentially useful
   for a variety of applications including the replication of microscale
   features of tissues for modular tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of dimethyl ether (DME) addition to fuel on polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAH) and soot formation in laminar coflow ethylene/air
   diffusion flames were revisited numerically. Calculations were conducted
   using two gas-phase reaction mechanisms with PAH formation and growth:
   one is the C-2 chemistry of the Appel, Bockhorn, and Frenklach (ABF)
   mechanism with PAH growth up to A4 (pyrene); the other is also a C-2
   chemistry-mechanism newly developed at the German Space Center (DLR)
   with PAH growth up to A5 (corannulene). Soot was modeled based on the
   assumptions that soot inception is due to the collision of two pyrene
   molecules, and soot surface growth and oxidation follow a hydrogen
   abstraction carbon addition (HACA) sequence. The DLR mechanism predicted
   much higher concentrations of pyrene than the ABF mechanism. A much
   smaller value of a in the surface growth model associated with the DLR
   mechanism must be used to predict the correct peak soot volume fraction.
   Both reaction mechanisms are capable of predicting the synergistic
   effect of DME addition to fuel on PAH formation. The locations of high
   PAH concentrations predicted by the DLR mechanism are in much better
   agreement with available experimental observations. A weak synergistic
   effect of DME addition on soot formation was predicted by the ABF
   mechanism. The DLR mechanism failed to predict the synergistic effect on
   soot. The likely causes for such a failure and the implications for
   future research on soot inception and surface growth were discussed.}},

Pages = {{561-576}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid choice modelling approaches allow latent variables in mode choice
   utility functions to be addressed. However, defining attitude and
   behavior as latent variables is influenced by the researcher's
   assumptions. Therefore, it is better to capture the effects of latent
   behavioral and attitudinal factors as latent variables than defining
   behaviors and attitudes per se. This article uses a hybrid choice model
   for capturing such latent effects, which will herein be referred to as
   modal captivity effects in commuting mode choice. Latent modal captivity
   refers to the unobserved and apparently unexplained attraction towards a
   specific mode of transportation that is resulting from latent attitude
   and behavior of passengers in addition to the urban transportation
   system. In empirical models, the latent modal captivity variables are
   explained as functions of different observed variables. Empirical models
   show significant improvement in fitting observed data as well as
   improved understanding of travel behavior.}},

   Bragg-grating air-slot waveguide is designed (using Finite Domain Time
   Difference modeling (FDTD)) and fabricated (using Electron beam
   lithography and Reactive ion etching) on a silicon-on-insulator
   substrate to develop a label-free optical sensor. The Bragg gratings
   constitute of recesses in the 140 nm wide air-slot waveguide. The
   grating structures generate a band-gap for certain frequencies and the
   spectral shift of the lower band-edge is used as the mechanism to sense
   fluids or bio-molecules in the air-slot. Based on the 3-D FDTD and
   experimental results, the sensitivity of the device is 620 nm/RIU, which
   is higher than other recently reported sensors. Due to the high electric
   field intensity in the air slot, this area becomes very sensitive to
   index variations caused by bio-molecules or fluids in the air-slot.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is often used as a
   scientific instrument for providing high magnification images and
   analytical capability for microstructural analysis. In recent years
   different applications for SEM has been developed and is gaining
   popularity in doing characterizations of fine-scale materials such as
   in-situ annealing, cryo-microscopy, micro-tensile testing, electrical
   resistivity measurements and grain boundary/texture analysis (EBSD).
   With the increasing demand in these sub-micron to nano-scale
   characterizations, there's an increasing need to have a more
   sophisticated stage within the microscope. In other word, a stage that
   would have ``hands{''} built onto the SEM stage to allow operator to
   manipulate objects and execute different tasks under high magnification.
   In this paper we presented a compact nanomanipulation system that is
   designed to be retrofitted easily onto many SEMs. Capabilities and
   potential applications of using such manipulation system will be
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Stimulated by state-of-the-art robotic and computer technology, cell
   injection automation aims to scale and seamlessly transfer the human
   hand movements into more precise and fast movements of the micro
   manipulator. This chapter presents a robotic cell-injection system for
   automatic injection of batch-suspended cells. To facilitate the process,
   these suspended cells are held and fixed to a cell array by a specially
   designed cell holding device, and injected one by one through an
   ``out-of-plane{''} cell injection process. Starting from image
   identifying the embryos and injector pipette, a proper batch cell
   injection process, including the injection trajectory of the pipette, is
   designed for this automatic suspended cell injection system. A
   micropipette equipped with a PVDF micro force sensor to measure real
   time injection force, is integrated in the proposed system. Through
   calibration, an empirical relationship between the cell injection force
   and the desired injector pipette trajectory is obtained in advance.
   Then, after decoupling the out-of-plane cell injection into a position
   control in X - Y horizontal plane and an impedance control in the Z-
   axis, a position and force control algorithm is developed for
   controlling the injection pipette. The depth motion of the injector
   pipette, which cannot be observed by microscope, is indirectly
   controlled via the impedance control, and the desired force is
   determined from the online X - Y position control and the cell
   calibration results. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a microfluidic system for biophysical
   characterization of red blood cells (RBCs) at a speed of 100-150 cells
   s(-1). Electrical impedance measurement is made when single RBCs flow
   through a constriction channel that is marginally smaller than RBCs'
   diameters. The multiple parameters quantified as mechanical and
   electrical signatures of each RBC include transit time, impedance
   amplitude ratio, and impedance phase increase. Histograms, compiled from
   84,073 adult RBCs (from 5 adult blood samples) and 82,253 neonatal RBCs
   (from 5 newborn blood samples), reveal different biophysical properties
   across samples and between the adult and neonatal RBC populations. In
   comparison with previously reported microfluidic devices for single RBC
   biophysical measurement, this system has a higher throughput, higher
   signal to noise ratio, and the capability of performing multi-parameter
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{The optimization of dual-energy computed tomography (DE-CT) is
   challenged by the lack of a theoretical foundation for image quality.
   This work reports a cascaded systems analysis model that was used to
   derive signal and noise propagation in DE-CBCT in prevalent Fourier
   metrics such as the noise-power spectrum (NPS) and noise-equivalent
   quanta (NEQ). The model was validated in comparison to measurements of
   the 3D NPS and NEQ in DE-CBCT images acquired using an experimental
   imaging bench. Task-based detectability index was derived using DE-NPS
   and NEQ as an objective function in optimizing DE imaging parameters
   such as the dose allocation factor (D-A) and kVp pair. The resulting
   dose allocation optimization is in agreement with the practice of
   assigning more dose to the high-energy image (D-A < 0.5), and the model
   provides a quantitative basis for examining the optimal dose allocation
   as a function of total dose, kVp pair, the presence of electronics
   noise, and the imaging task. An example optimization is shown for a
   breast tumor detection task. Using DE decomposition to cancel
   fibroglandular tissue (rendering a DE-CBCT image of breast tumor against
   an adipose tissue background) and assuming a total dose of 15mGy, the
   optimal kVp pair is identified at {[}45, 105] kVp with D-A=0.46. The
   model is sufficiently general for applications beyond this example,
   demonstrating utility in the optimization in a broad range of imaging
   parameters. The model provides a new, valuable framework for
   understanding the theoretical limits of DE-CBCT imaging performance and
   maximizing image quality while minimizing radiation dose.}},

Abstract = {{In-pipe robots provide inspection and maintenance services to various
   pipelines. This article proposes an algorithm to calculate the required
   radial variations for in-pipe robots to pass through pipeline elbows
   smoothly. It first gives a full overview of a robot passing through a
   U-shaped elbow and identifies the problem location where the radial
   dimension changes the most. It then presents a detailed analysis on the
   focused stage and deduces the algorithm. Based on the obtained
   algorithm, a realizing Matlab program is written to calculate all
   possible lengths of front and rear legs at every moment during the
   process. Finally, the calculation results are presented to precisely
   describe the track of movement, the length deformations during the whole
   process, and different contributions of structural variables. This
   article provides the design and the control of an in-pipe robot with an
   algorithm to calculate the lengths of its legs at every moment and to
   what extent the deformations of elastic legs are required.}},

Abstract = {{Particle concentrators allow exposure to controlled levels of
   concentrated ambient particulate matter (PM) over a broad range of
   concentrations. The performance of these systems can be influenced by
   the physicochemical characteristics of PM and so it is vital to
   characterize the concentrators at a given site. The quasi-ultrafine PM
   (<0.2 mu m), fine PM (0.15-2.5 mu m), and coarse PM (2.5-10 mu m)
   concentrators at the Southern Ontario Center for Atmospheric Aerosol
   Research (SOCAAR), University of Toronto, were characterized as a part
   of the ``Health Effects of Aerosols in Toronto (HEAT){''} campaign held
   during February-March, 2010. The full size distributions of ambient and
   concentrated particles were simultaneously measured in terms of number,
   surface area, and volume using high time-resolution instruments.
   Examination of the complete size distribution, including the
   unconcentrated particles beyond the cutpoints of the concentrator
   systems, revealed that particles in the unconcentrated size ranges made
   significant contributions to the particle number and surface area
   present in the concentrated airstreams of fine and coarse concentrators.
   Further transients in the ambient ultrafine particle concentrations were
   evident as dampened signals in these concentrated airstreams. The
   ultrafine concentrator exhibited a significant size shift when the
   ambient particle size distribution had a mode <= 30 nm. Over-all the
   fine and coarse concentrators provided a reasonable concentrated
   reproduction of the ambient PM mass while questions remain regarding the
   representativeness of the ultrafine concentrator.}},

Title = {{Screening of nickel catalysts for selective hydrogen production using
   supercritical water gasification of glucose}},
Journal = {{GREEN CHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{1766-1777}},
Abstract = {{We report the activity and the selectivity of several heterogeneous
   nickel catalysts for the supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of
   biomass. The effects of catalyst support on the carbon conversion and
   hydrogen selectivity were demonstrated using 44 different materials,
   covering a wide range of chemical and physical properties. At 5\% nickel
   loading, alpha-Al2O3, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and MgO supports resulted
   in high carbon conversions, while SiO2, Y2O3, hydrotalcite,
   yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), and TiO2 showed modest activities.
   Utilization of different gamma-Al2O3 supports resulted in a wide range
   of catalytic activities from almost inactive to highly active. Other
   catalyst carriers such as zeolites, molecular sieves, CeO2, and ZrO2 had
   insignificant activity under the conditions tested (i.e., 380 degrees C,
   2 wt\% feed). Aside from the catalytic activity, the stable metal oxide
   supports under the experimental conditions of this work, as identified
   by XRD, were alpha-Al2O3, boehmite, YSZ, and TiO2. Given the high
   hydrogen yield and carbon conversion as well as its superior stability
   in supercritical water, alpha-Al2O3 was chosen for a more elaborate
   investigation. It was found that when using the same amount of nickel,
   the methane yield significantly decreased by increasing the nickel to
   support ratio whereas the carbon conversion was only slightly affected.
   At a given nickel to support ratio, a threefold increase in methane
   yield was observed by increasing the temperature from 350 to 410 degrees
   C. The catalyst activation conditions (e. g., calcination and reduction)
   had a small impact on its catalytic performance. The catalyst activity
   increased with the addition of alkali promoters (i.e., K, Na, Cs) and
   decreased with the addition of tin. The highest catalytic activity was
   obtained with the addition of 0.5\% potassium. In summary, nickel
   loading and alkali promoters improved the hydrogen selectivity and the
   carbon conversion of the Ni/alpha-Al2O3 catalyst.}},

Abstract = {{A geo-positioning satellite (GPS)-based survey, using a web-based
   prompted recall tool, was conducted on a sample of 94 students at the
   University of Toronto from November 2008 to April 2009. The sample
   included students with and without telephone land lines, allowing for a
   statistical comparison of demographic and travel behaviour attributes.
   The same subjects simultaneously completed a traditional trip reporting
   survey, modelled on the household travel survey in Toronto, allowing for
   a comparison between the travel behaviour information obtained from the
   GPS and that reported by the participants in the traditional survey.
   Students with a land line are more likely to live in houses, with
   parents, and to live in suburban areas than students without a land
   line. They also make fewer trips in total, fewer discretionary trips,
   more transit and auto trips and fewer active trips than students without
   a land line. By comparing questionnaire-based data and GPS data, we
   found that most participants reported in the questionnaire either the
   same number of GPS-based trips or fewer. On average, the GPS survey
   captured 1.29 more daily trips per participant than the corresponding
   trips reported in the questionnaire.}},

Abstract = {{This article contributes to the growing research and policy interest on
   the challenges of achieving socially sustainable transportation. It
   analyses the determinants of transport mode use for journey to work
   among population groups considered as vulnerable to mobility and

   multinomial logistic regression models were estimated to assess the
   personal, social and economic factors that affect travel mode use of
   low-income persons in their journey to work in urban areas in Ontario
   and Quebec. The findings show important differences in the factors
   associated with car driving and public transit, between genders, and
   according to income level, educational achievement, household structure
   and immigration status. Furthermore, it is found that significant
   factors affecting travel mode use among low-income people in various
   urban areas are differentiated by province. The results point towards a
   geographic-based and balanced promotion of public and private mobility
   programmes and policies to address transport needs of low-income

Abstract = {{Designers of electronic devices and telecommunications equipment have
   used three-dimensional chip architecture, comprised of a vertically
   integrated stack of chips, to increase the number of transistors on
   integrated circuits. These latest chips generate excessive amount of
   heat, and thus can reach unacceptably high temperatures. In this
   context, this research aims to develop thermally conductive liquid
   crystal polymer (LCP)/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) composite films to
   replace the traditionally-used Kapton films that satisfy the electrical
   insulation requirements for the attachment of heat sinks to the chips
   without compromising the heat dissipation performance. Parametric study
   was conducted to elucidate the effects of hBN contents on the heat
   dissipation ability of the composite. The performance of the hybrid heat
   sinks were experimentally simulated by measuring the temperature
   distribution of the hybrid heat sinks attached to a 10 W square-faced
   (i.e., 10 cm by 10 cm) heater. Experimental simulation show that the
   maximum temperature of the heater mounted with a hybrid heat sink
   reduced with increased hBN content. It is believed the fibrillation of
   LCP matrix leads to highly ordered structure, promoting heat dissipation
   ability of the electrically insulating pad of the hybrid heat sink.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, two methodologies were used in fabricating conductive
   electrospun polymer fibers with nano features. We first investigated the
   addition of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) as conductive fillers at
   concentrations ranging from 1 to 10\% into a polystyrene (PS) matrix.
   Electrospinning conditions were tailored to produce fibers with minimal
   beads. Next, we investigated the effects of coating electrospun fibers
   with nano structured conductive polymer. Oxidant (FeCl3) fibers were
   electrospun in PS and then exposed to a pyrrole (Py) monomer in a vacuum
   chamber. As a result, polypyrrole (PPy) was coated on the fibers
   creating conductive pathways. In both methods, the electrospun
   conductive fibers were characterized in terms of their morphologies,
   thermal stability and electrical conductivity. Strong correlations were
   found among PPy coating nanostructures, oxidant concentration and
   polymerization time. Electrospun fibrous membranes with conductive
   polymer coating exhibit much higher electrical conductivities compare to
   fibers with conductive fillers. Highest conductivity achieved was 9.5E-4
   S/cm with 40\% FeCl3/PS fibers polymerized with Py for 140 min.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing interest in the use of ultrasound to enhance drug
   delivery to the brain and central nervous system. Disorders of the brain
   and CNS historically have had poor response to drug therapy due to the
   presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Techniques for circumventing
   the BBB are typically highly invasive or involve disrupting large
   portions of the BBB, exposing the brain to pathogens. Ultrasound can be
   non-invasively delivered to the brain through the intact skull. When
   combined with preformed microbubbles, ultrasound can safely induce
   transient, localised and reversible disruption of the BBB, allowing
   therapeutics to be delivered. Investigations to date have shown positive
   response to ultrasound BBB disruption combined with therapeutic agent
   delivery in rodent models of primary and metastatic brain cancer and
   Alzheimer's disease. Recent work in non-human primates has demonstrated
   that the technique is feasible for use in humans. This review examines
   the current status of drug delivery to the brain and CNS both by
   disruption of the BBB, and by ultrasound enhancement of drug delivery
   through the already compromised BBB. Cellular and physical mechanisms of
   disruption are discussed, as well as treatment technique, safety and
   monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Trapping of carbon in deep underground brine-filled reservoirs is a
   promising approach for the reduction of atmospheric greenhouse gas
   emissions. However, estimation of the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2)
   that can be captured in a given reservoir and the long-term storage
   stability remain a challenge. One difficulty lies in the estimation of
   local capillary pressure effects that arise from mineral surface
   heterogeneity inherent in underground geological formations. As a
   preliminary step to address this issue, we have performed dynamic pore
   network modelling (PNM) simulations of two-phase immiscible flow in
   two-dimensional structured porous media with contact angle heterogeneity
   under typical reservoir conditions. We begin by characterizing the
   network with a single, uniform contact angle. We then present saturation
   patterns for networks with homogeneous and heterogeneous contact angles
   distributions, based on two common reservoir minerals: quartz and mica,
   both of which have been well-characterized experimentally for their
   brine-CO2 contact angles. At lower flow rates, we found moderately
   higher saturations for the heterogeneous networks than for the
   homogeneous ones. To characterize the fingering patterns, we have
   introduced R as the ratio of filled throats to the total network
   saturation. Based on this measure, the heterogeneous networks
   demonstrated thicker fingering patterns than the homogeneous networks.
   The computed saturation patterns demonstrate the importance of
   considering surface heterogeneity in pore-scale modelling of deep saline
   aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{Trip chaining (or tours) and mode choice are two critical factors
   influencing a variety of patterns of urban travel demand. This paper
   investigates the hierarchical relationship between these two sets of
   decisions including the influences of socio-demographic characteristics
   on them. It uses a 6-week travel diary collected in Thurgau,
   Switzerland, in 2003. The structural equation modeling technique is
   applied to identify the hierarchical relationship. Hierarchy and
   temporal consistency of the relationship is investigated separately for
   work versus non-work tours. It becomes clear that for work tours in
   weekdays, trip-chaining and mode choice decisions are simultaneous and
   remain consistent across the weeks. For non-work tours in weekdays, mode
   choice decisions precede trip-chaining decisions. However, for non-work
   tours in weekends, trip-chaining decisions precede mode choice
   decisions. A number of socioeconomic characteristics also play major
   roles in influencing the relationships. Results of the investigation
   challenge the traditional approach of modeling mode choice separately
   from activity-scheduling decisions.}},

   array (FPGA) devices have significantly enhanced their aggregate
   transceiver bandwidth, reaching terabits per second for the upcoming

   In answering this question, we propose a new switch fabric organization,
   called Grouped Crosspoint Queued switch, that brings significant memory
   efficiency over the state-of-the-art organizations. This makes it
   possible to build high bandwidth, high radix switches directly on FPGA
   that rivals ASIC performance. The proposal was validated at small scale
   by a 16x16 160Gps switch on the available Virtex-6 device, and simulated
   at a larger scale of fat-tree switching network with 5Tbps capacity.}},

Abstract = {{To facilitate the development of future FPGA architectures and CAD -
   tools both embedded programmable fabrics and pure-play FPGAs - there is
   a need for a large scale, publicly available software suite that can
   synthesize circuits into easily-described hypothetical FPGA
   architectures. These circuits should be captured at the HIM, level, or
   higher, and pass through logical and physical synthesis. Such a tool
   must provide detailed modelling of area, performance and energy to
   enable architecture exploration. As software flows themselves evolve to
   permit design capture at ever higher levels of abstraction, this
   downstream full-implementation flow will always be required. This paper
   describes the current status and new release of an ongoing effort to
   create such a flow the `Verilog to Routing' (VTR) project, which is a
   broad collaboration of researchers. There are three core tools: ODIN II
   {[}10] for Verilog Elaboration and front-end hard-block synthesis, ABC
   {[}16] for logic synthesis, and VPR {[}13] for physical synthesis and
   analysis. ODIN II now has a simulation capability to help verify that
   its output is correct, as well as specialized synthesis at the
   elaboration step for multipliers and memories. ABC is used to optimize
   the `soft' logic of the FPGA. The VPR-based packing, placement and
   routing is now fully timing-driven (the previous release was not) and
   includes new capability to target complex logic blocks. In addition we
   have added a set of four large benchmark circuits to a suite of
   previously-released Verilog HDL circuits. Finally, we illustrate the use
   of the new flow by using it to help architect a floating-point unit in
   an FPGA., and contrast it with a prior, much longer effort that was
   required to do the same thing.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-ported memories are challenging to implement with FPGAs since the
   block RAMs included in the fabric typically have only two ports. Any
   design that requires a memory with more than two ports must therefore be
   built out of logic elements or by combining multiple block RAMs. The
   recently-proposed Live Value Table (LVT) {[}8] design provides a
   significant operating frequency improvement over conventional
   approaches. In this paper we present an alternative approach based on
   the XOR operation that provides multi-ported memories that use far less
   logic but more block RAMs than LVT designs, and are often smaller and
   faster for memories that are more than 512 entries deep. We show that
   (i) both designs can exploit multipumping to trade speed for area
   savings, (ii) that multipumped XOR designs are significantly smaller but
   moderately slower than their LVT counterparts, and (iii) that both the
   LVT and XOR approaches are valuable and useful in different situations,
   depending on the constraints and resource utilization of the enclosing
   design.}},

Abstract = {{Much like other computing platforms in the world today, FPGAs are
   becoming increasingly larger and contain large amounts of reconfigurable
   logic. This makes FPGAs an acceptable platform for multiprocessor
   systems. However in today's world of FPGA computing, very limited
   infrastructure is available to facilitate the creation of cache coherent
   shared memory systems for FPGAs. This paper introduces FCache, a system
   for shared memory cache coherent processing on FPGAs. The paper also
   describes the mapping of the conventional shared bus to :FPGAs using two
   distinct network implemented in FCache. FCache also provides flushing
   and multithreaded synchronization functionalities, such as locking and
   unlocking of a mutex variable, which is embedded in its cache component.
   Despite these additional functionalities, results show that FCache has
   little resource overhead compared to a previous more simplistic cache
   coherent system that was targeted for FPGAs.}},

Abstract = {{Through research conducted in this study, a network approach to the
   correlation patterns of void spaces in rough fractures (crack type II)
   was developed. We characterized friction networks with several networks
   characteristics. The correlation among network properties with the
   fracture permeability is the result of friction networks. The revealed
   hubs in the complex aperture networks confirmed the importance of highly
   correlated groups to conduct the highlighted features of the dynamical
   aperture field. We found that there is a universal power law between the
   nodes' degree and motifs frequency (for triangles it reads T(k) k beta
   (beta approximate to 2 +/- 0.3)). The investigation of localization
   effects on eigenvectors shows a remarkable difference in parallel and
   perpendicular aperture patches. Furthermore, we estimate the rate of
   stored energy in asperities so that we found that the rate of radiated
   energy is higher in parallel friction networks than it is in transverse
   directions. The final part of our research highlights 4 point sub-graph
   distribution and its correlation with fluid flow. For shear rupture, we
   observed a similar trend in sub-graph distribution, resulting from
   parallel and transversal aperture profiles (a superfamily phenomenon).}},

Abstract = {{The effects of small vibrations on a particle oscillating near a solid
   wall in a fluid cell, relevant to material processing such as crystal
   growth in space, have been investigated by three dimensional direct
   numerical simulations. Simulations have been conducted for a solid
   spherical particle suspended in a fluid cell filled with a fluid of 1
   cSt viscosity, vibrating sinusoidally in a horizontal direction. The
   simulations revealed the existence of a vibration-induced force
   attracting the particle towards the nearest cell wall which varied with
   the cell vibration frequency. The mechanism for this attraction force as
   well as an example showing the effects of this force on the particle are
   presented in this paper. The predicted flow patterns around the particle
   unveiled an accelerated flow in the gap between the particle and the
   nearest wall as well as a pressure decrease in accordance with
   Bernoulli's principle, which would result in the attraction force.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of determining invariance kernels for planar single-input
   nonlinear systems is considered. If K is a closed set, its invariance
   kernel is the largest subset of K with the property of being positively
   invariant for arbitrary measurable input signals. It is shown that the
   boundary of the invariance kernel is a concatenation of solutions of two
   so-called extremal vector fields. Moreover, only the solutions through a
   finite number of special points are of interest. This result makes it
   possible to devise an algorithm which determines the invariance kernel
   of a simply connected set in a finite number of steps.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, ultrashort pulse laser processing has opened a
   large suite of photonic devices that can be formed inside bulk optical
   glasses by direct writing. Such processes promise rapid and seamless
   integration into novel three-dimensional optical circuits. One obstacle
   towards commercial application of this technology has been finding an
   effective means for inscribing high-quality grating devices. Such
   gratings, when embedded within the laser written waveguides, enable
   multi-functional spectral filters to be tailored to specific
   applications required in optical sensing, fiber lasers, and
   telecommunications. In this chapter, a new Bragg grating waveguide
   device is introduced that can be fabricated directly inside transparent
   glass materials by ultrashort laser direct writing. These Bragg grating
   waveguide devices are composed of arrays of partially overlapped
   refractive index voxels (volume pixels), defining a finely pitched
   segmented waveguide which simultaneously offers low-loss light guiding
   and strong Bragg filter resonances. Two approaches, a single-pulse
   writing method and a burst writing method, are introduced for inscribing
   the grating waveguide devices with respective low-and high-repetition
   rate ultrashort laser systems. Optimal laser exposure parameters are
   presented for fabricating high rejection notch filters (>35 dB) with
   narrow spectral bandwidth (0.2 nm) the 1550-nm telecom band. Examples of
   Bragg grating waveguide circuits are presented for filter and sensor
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{A chirped pulsed photothermal radiometric radar is introduced for the
   diagnosis of biological samples, especially bones with tissue and skin
   overlayers. The constraints imposed by the laser safety (maximum
   permissible exposure, MPE) ceiling on pump laser energy and the strong
   attenuation of thermal-wave signals in tissues significantly limit the
   photothermally active depth in most biological specimens to a level
   which is normally insufficient for practical applications (approx. 1 mm
   below the skin surface). A theoretical approach for improvement of
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), minimizing the static (dc) component of the
   photothermal signal and making use of the photothermal radiometric
   nonlinearity has been introduced and verified by comparing the SNR of
   four distinct excitation wave forms (sine-wave, square-wave,
   constant-width and constant duty-cycle pulses) for chirping the pump
   laser, under constant exposure energy. At low frequencies
   fixed-pulsewidth chirps of large peak power were found to be superior to
   all other equal-energy modalities, with an SNR improvement up to two
   orders of magnitude. Distinct thickness-dependent characteristic delay
   times in a goat bone were obtained, establishing an active depth
   resolution range of ca. 2.8 mm in a layered skin-fat-bone structure, a
   favorable result compared to the maximum reported pulsed photothermal
   radiometric depth resolution < 1 mm in turbid biological media. Compared
   to radar peak delay and amplitude, the long-delayed radar output
   amplitude is found to be more sensitive to subsurface conditions.
   Two-dimensional spatial plots of this parameter depicting the back
   surface conditions of bones with and without fat-tissue overlayers are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past two decades, osteoporosis has been recognized among the
   most serious public health problems. Fortunately with the growing
   awareness of osteoporosis, new treatments have been developed for the
   prevention of fracture. At the same time, there is a rapid improvement
   in diagnostic methods. In this study biomedical photoacoustics (PA) is
   applied to the analysis of bone mineral concentration. The PA signal
   depends on optical as well as mechanical properties of the object and
   therefore has the potential to provide higher sensitivity to density
   variations compared with standard diagnostic methods, like ultrasound. A
   laser source with 800 nm wavelength and different ultrasonic transducers
   with resonance frequencies in the range 1 to 5 MHz were employed. The CW
   or frequency-domain (FD) PA radar method was utilized with linear
   frequency modulation chirps to provide temporal gating control over the
   transmitted signal and higher sensitivity in the detected signal. The
   laser intensity was set below the safety standards for skin exposure.
   The preliminary studies showed adequate optical absorption by cortical
   bone to generate measurable PA signals and the transmission of laser
   light through this layer. Experiments are focused on detection and
   evaluation of PA signals from in-vitro animal cortical bones with and
   without a trabecular sublayer. The trabecular layer is then diluted by
   chemical etching and differences in the PA signals are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Energy transport in diffusion-wave fields is gradient driven and
   therefore diffuse, yielding depth-integrated responses with poor axial
   resolution. Using matched-filter principles, we propose a methodology
   enabling these parabolic diffusion-wave energy fields to exhibit energy
   localization akin to propagating hyperbolic wave-fields. This not only
   improves the axial resolution, but also allows for deconvolution of
   individual responses of superposed axially discrete sources, opening a
   new field of depth-resolved subsurface thermal coherence tomography
   using diffusion waves. The depth resolved nature of the developed
   methodology is verified through experiments carried out on phantoms and
   biological samples. The results suggest that thermal coherence
   tomography can resolve deep structural changes in hard dental and bone
   tissues. The sensitivity of the developed diagnostic imaging system is
   compared to that of polarized Raman spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{Many small drinking water treatment systems disinfect using only
   ultraviolet light, which provides minimal adenovirus inactivation at
   common doses. There is uncertainty in jurisdictions around the world
   about whether such practices should be accepted by regulators, or
   whether there is a need to specify a treatment target for adenovirus. A
   preliminary objective of this study was to determine whether adequate
   adenovirus information exists to conduct a meaningful quantitative
   microbial risk assessment (QMRA). The study then applied the QMRA
   framework to draw conclusions about whether there is justification to
   regulate adenovirus, and to identify weaknesses in those conclusions. A
   thorough review revealed that the quality of data available to conduct
   the analysis was poor. Using the (limited) data available, the QMRA
   suggests that adenovirus may pose risks similar to other viruses that
   are regulated. A lack of information about the concentration of
   adenovirus in source waters makes it difficult to propose a compelling
   evidence-based argument either for or against the need to require
   adenovirus treatment. Furthermore, management of risk from water borne
   adenovirus should take into account an endemic rate of infection from
   non-waterborne exposures that appears to obscure accepted levels of
   waterborne risk.}},

Title = {{Mobile Phone-Based Telemonitoring for Heart Failure Management: A
   Randomized Controlled Trial}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: Previous trials of telemonitoring for heart failure
   management have reported inconsistent results, largely due to diverse
   intervention and study designs. Mobile phones are becoming ubiquitous
   and economical, but the feasibility and efficacy of a mobile phone-based
   telemonitoring system have not been determined.
   Objective: The objective of this trial was to investigate the effects of
   a mobile phone-based telemonitoring system on heart failure management
   and outcomes.
   Methods: One hundred patients were recruited from a heart function
   clinic and randomized into telemonitoring and control groups. The
   telemonitoring group (N = 50) took daily weight and blood pressure
   readings and weekly single-lead ECGs, and answered daily symptom
   questions on a mobile phone over 6 months. Readings were automatically
   transmitted wirelessly to the mobile phone and then to data servers.
   Instructions were sent to the patients' mobile phones and alerts to a
   cardiologist's mobile phone as required.
   Results: Baseline questionnaires were completed and returned by 94
   patients, and 84 patients returned post-study questionnaires. About 70\%
   of telemonitoring patients completed at least 80\% of their possible
   daily readings. The change in quality of life from baseline to
   post-study, as measured with the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure
   Questionnaire, was significantly greater for the telemonitoring group
   compared to the control group (P=.05). A between-group analysis also
   found greater post-study self-care maintenance (measured with the
   Self-Care of Heart Failure Index) for the telemonitoring group (P=.03).
   Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, self-care management, and left
   ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improved significantly for both
   groups from baseline to post-study, but did not show a between-group
   difference. However, a subgroup within-group analysis using the data
   from the 63 patients who had attended the heart function clinic for more
   than 6 months revealed the telemonitoring group had significant
   improvements from baseline to post-study in BNP (decreased by 150 pg/mL,
   P = .02), LVEF (increased by 7.4\%, P = .005) and self-care maintenance
   (increased by 7 points, P = .05) and management (increased by 14 points,
   P = .03), while the control group did not. No differences were found
   between the telemonitoring and control groups in terms of
   hospitalization, mortality, or emergency department visits, but the
   trial was underpowered to detect differences in these metrics.
   Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence of improved quality of life
   through improved self-care and clinical management from a mobile
   phone-based telemonitoring system. The use of the mobile phone-based
   system had high adherence and was feasible for patients, including the
   elderly and those with no experience with mobile phones.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Previous trials of heart failure telemonitoring systems have
   produced inconsistent findings, largely due to diverse interventions and
   study designs.
   Objectives: The objectives of this study are (1) to provide in-depth
   insight into the effects of telemonitoring on self-care and clinical
   management, and (2) to determine the features that enable successful
   heart failure telemonitoring.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 heart failure
   patients attending a heart function clinic who had used a mobile
   phone-based telemonitoring system for 6 months. The telemonitoring
   system required the patients to take daily weight and blood pressure
   readings, weekly single-lead ECGs, and to answer daily symptom questions
   on a mobile phone. Instructions were sent to the patient's mobile phone
   based on their physiological values. Alerts were also sent to a
   cardiologist's mobile phone, as required. All clinicians involved in the
   study were also interviewed post-trial (N = 5). The interviews were
   recorded, transcribed, and then analyzed using a conventional content
   analysis approach.
   Results: The telemonitoring system improved patient self-care by
   instructing the patients in real-time how to appropriately modify their
   lifestyle behaviors. Patients felt more aware of their heart failure
   condition, less anxiety, and more empowered. Many were willing to
   partially fund the use of the system. The clinicians were able to manage
   their patients' heart failure conditions more effectively, because they
   had physiological data reported to them frequently to help in their
   decision-making (eg, for medication titration) and were alerted at the
   earliest sign of decompensation. Essential characteristics of the
   telemonitoring system that contributed to improved heart failure
   management included immediate self-care and clinical feedback (ie,
   teachable moments), how the system was easy and quick to use, and how
   the patients and clinicians perceived tangible benefits from
   telemonitoring. Some clinical concerns included ongoing costs of the
   telemonitoring system and increased clinical workload. A few patients
   did not want to be watched long-term while some were concerned they
   might become dependent on the system.
   Conclusions: The success of a telemonitoring system is highly dependent
   on its features and design. The essential system characteristics
   identified in this study should be considered when developing
   telemonitoring solutions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores transport planning approaches adopted for the Summer
   Olympic Games (SOG) and identifies lessons learned for planning of the
   world's largest regular special event; the Hajj/Umrah Pilgrimage in
   Makkah, Saudi Arabia. The Hajj/Umrah Pilgrimage has been held annually
   for many centuries. Major growth has occurred in recent decades with
   some 6 million visitors p. a. including 3 million during the week of the
   Hajj event and 1 million during Ramadan. These events now represent the
   largest regular special event in history and are expected to grow
   substantially into the future. SOG is probably the second largest
   regularly held major event, held over 2 weeks in major host cities every
   4 years. Olympic host cities commonly already exhibit congested
   transport networks but must cope with over 40 000 Olympic officials and
   athletes in addition up to 8 million ticketed spectators. Olympic
   transport planning is a critical factor in games performance. This paper
   describes the context for each event and the nature of transport demand
   and supply and outlines the transport planning approaches used. A major
   aim is to synthesize lessons learned between events and to illustrate

Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1033-1040}},
Abstract = {{Enhancing microbial U(VI) reduction with the addition of organic
   electron donors is a promising strategy for immobilizing uranium in
   contaminated groundwaters, but has yet to be optimized because of a poor
   understanding of the factors controlling the growth of various microbial
   communities during bioremediation. In previous field trials in which
   acetate was added to the subsurface, there were two distinct phases: an
   initial phase in which acetate-oxidizing, U(VI)-reducing Geobacter
   predominated and U(VI) was effectively reduced and a second phase in
   which acetate-oxidizing sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) predominated and
   U(VI) reduction was poor. The interaction of Geobacter and SRB was
   investigated both in sediment incubations that mimicked in situ
   bioremediation and with in silico metabolic modeling. In sediment
   incubations, Geobacter grew quickly but then declined in numbers as the
   microbially reducible Fe(III) was depleted whereas the SRB grow more
   slowly and reached dominance after 30-40 days. Modeling predicted a
   similar outcome. Additional modeling in which the relative initial
   percentages of the Geobacter and SRB were varied indicated that there
   was little to no competitive interaction between Geobacter and SRB when
   acetate was abundant. Further simulations suggested that the addition of
   Fe(III) would revive the Geobacter, but have little to no effect on the
   SRB. This result was confirmed experimentally. The results demonstrate
   that it is possible to predict the impact of amendments on important
   components of the subsurface microbial community during groundwater
   bioremediation. The finding that Fe(III) availability, rather than
   competition with SRB, is the key factor limiting the activity of
   Geobacter during in situ uranium bioremediation will aid in the design
   of improved uranium bioremediation strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This article applies an econometric model to investigate the
   determinants of telecommuting choices in the context of commute mode
   choices, based on a survey dataset from the City of Edmonton, Canada.
   Our results indicate that attributes of different commuting modes have
   different cross elastic effects on the attitude toward telecommuting.
   However, the magnitudes of cross elasticity are very low. Time of start
   of work plays a major role in considering telecommuting as a feasible
   choice. Moreover, it is clear that complementary Travel Demand
   Management (TDM) policies are necessary to encourage a positive attitude
   towards telecommuting.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{271-296}},
Abstract = {{We are motivated to investigate methods to increase creativity in
   conceptual design since creativity is essential to design success, and
   no other stage influences final design success as much as conceptual
   design. Existing work supports that design stimuli may encourage
   creative concept generation, but does not give details on how to
   systematically generate stimuli. The established relationship between
   language and cognition, and the systematic nature of language prompt us
   to examine its use as design stimuli. Language relationships such as
   opposition provide a systematic method of generating non-obvious
   semantic stimuli for design problems. In this paper, we present two
   experiments, a pen-and-paper and a verbal protocol study, where
   participants used oppositely related and similarly related word stimuli
   in conceptual design. We found that designers using oppositely related
   word stimuli developed more creative concepts. Language analysis
   revealed how opposite stimuli elicited designer behaviours that may
   encourage and support creative concept generation. Our empirical results
   combined with linguistic theory lead us to propose a model explaining
   the interactions and effects of opposite-stimulus words on concept
   creativity. This knowledge can be used to facilitate more creative, and
   ultimately, more successful design.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{1611-1618}},
Abstract = {{We present an automated microfluidic (MF) approach for the systematic
   and rapid investigation of carbon dioxide (CO2) mass transfer and
   solubility in physical solvents. Uniformly sized bubbles of CO2 with
   lengths exceeding the width of the microchannel (plugs) were
   isothermally generated in a co-flowing physical solvent within a
   gas-impermeable, silicon-based MF platform that is compatible with a
   wide range of solvents, temperatures and pressures. We dynamically
   determined the volume reduction of the plugs from images that were
   accommodated within a single field of view, six different downstream
   locations of the microchannel at any given flow condition. Evaluating
   plug sizes in real time allowed our automated strategy to suitably
   select inlet pressures and solvent flow rates such that otherwise
   dynamically self-selecting parameters (e. g., the plug size, the solvent
   segment size, and the plug velocity) could be either kept constant or
   systematically altered. Specifically, if a constant slug length was
   imposed, the volumetric dissolution rate of CO2 could be deduced from
   the measured rate of plug shrinkage. The solubility of CO2 in the
   physical solvent was obtained from a comparison between the terminal and
   the initial plug sizes. Solubility data were acquired every 5 min and
   were within 2-5\% accuracy as compared to literature data. A parameter
   space consisting of the plug length, solvent slug length and plug
   velocity at the microchannel inlet was established for different
   CO2-solvent pairs with high and low gas solubilities. In a case study,
   we selected the gas-liquid pair CO2-dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and
   volumetric mass transfer coefficients 4-30 s(-1) (translating into mass
   transfer times between 0.25 s and 0.03 s), and Henry's constants, within
   the range of 6-12 MPa.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{The conversion of solar energy to chemical energy useful for maintaining
   cellular function in photosynthetic algae and cyanobacteria relies
   critically on light delivery to the microorganisms. Conventional direct
   irradiation of a bulk suspension leads to non-uniform light distribution
   within a strongly absorbing culture, and related inefficiencies. The
   study of small colonies of cells in controlled microenvironments would
   benefit from control over wavelength, intensity, and location of light
   energy on the scale of the microorganism. Here we demonstrate that the
   evanescent light field, confined near the surface of a waveguide, can be
   used to direct light into cyanobacteria and successfully drive
   photosynthesis. The method is enabled by the synergy between the
   penetration depth of the evanescent field and the size of the
   photosynthetic bacterium, both on the order of micrometres. Wild type
   Synechococcus elongatus (ATCC 33912) cells are exposed to evanescent
   light generated through total internal reflection of red (lambda = 633
   nm) light on a prism surface. Growth onset is consistently observed at
   intensity levels of 79 +/- 10 W m(-2), as measured 1 mu m from the
   surface, and 60 +/- 8 W m(-2) as measured by a 5 mu m depthwise average.
   These threshold values agree well with control experiments and
   literature values based on direct irradiation with daylight. In
   contrast, negligible growth is observed with evanescent light
   penetration depths less than the minor dimension of the rod-like
   bacterium (achieved at larger light incident angles). Collectively these
   results indicate that evanescent light waves can be used to tailor and
   direct light into cyanobacteria, driving photosynthesis.}},

Abstract = {{A parallel Simulated Annealing algorithm with multi-threaded
   architecture is proposed to solve a real bi-objective maintenance
   scheduling problem with conflicting objectives: the minimisation of the
   total equipment downtime caused by maintenance jobs and the minimisation
   of the multi-skilled workforce requirements over the given horizon. The
   maintenance jobs have different priorities with some precedence
   relations between different skills. The total weighted flow time is used
   as a scheduling criterion to measure the equipment availability. The
   multi-threaded architecture is used to speed up a multi-objective
   Simulated Annealing algorithm to solve the considered problem.
   Multi-threading is a form of parallelism based on shared memory
   architecture where multiple logical processing units, so-called threads,
   run concurrently and communicate via shared memory. The performance of
   the parallel method compared to the exact method is verified using a
   number of test problems. The obtained results imply the high efficiency

Abstract = {{The fabrication and on-chip integration of surface-enhanced Raman
   scattering (SERS) optrodes are presented. In the optrode configuration,
   both the laser excitation and the back-scattered Raman signal are
   transmitted through the same optical fiber. The SERS-active component of
   the optrode was fabricated through the self-assembly of silver
   nanoparticles on the tip of optical fibers. The application of SERS
   optrodes to detect dyes in aqueous solution indicated a limit of
   quantification below 1 nM, using nile blue A as a molecular probe. Using
   the optrode-integrated microfluidic chip, it was possible to detect
   several different dyes from solutions sequentially injected into the
   same channel. This approach for sequential detection of different
   analytes is applicable to monitoring on-chip chemical processes. The
   narrow bandwidth of the vibrational information generated by SERS
   allowed solutions of different compositions of two chemically similar
   dyes to be distinguished using a dilution microfluidic chip. These
   results demonstrate the advantages of the SERS-optrode for microfluidics
   applications by illustrating the potential of this vibrational method to

Abstract = {{Steel braced frames that are designed to rock on their foundations have
   been proposed as an efficient way to resist seismic loads without
   structural damage or residual deformations. Although such systems have
   been shown to exhibit a desirable self-centering response, there have
   been concerns that higher mode effects cause excessive amplification of
   member design forces. To mitigate these effects, multiple structural
   fuses are proposed. This paper presents shake table test results from an
   eight-storey rocking steel frame that was tested at 30\% scale. The
   frame was designed to be able to rock at the base only, or also at
   midheight. In addition, the first-storey brace was designed to be
   replaced with a Self-Centering Energy-Dissipating (SCED) brace. Both of
   these secondary fuses were effective in reducing the shear and bending
   moment envelopes for the frame with only minor increases in the peak
   structural displacements.}},

Abstract = {{The cast steel Yielding Brace System (YBS) is a new hysteretic damper
   that was developed at the University of Toronto to enhance the seismic
   performance of braced frames. In this system, a ductile, cast steel
   connector dissipates seismic energy through inelastic, flexural yielding
   of specially designed, triangular fingers. The cyclic, plastic bending
   of the yielding fingers replaces the tensile yielding and inelastic
   buckling of traditional ductile braces. This provides a symmetrical
   hysteresis with increased energy dissipation. This paper first presents
   the development stages of the new cast steel YBS system with an overview
   of the cast steel material characterization tests and prototype
   component tests. Results are then presented from a test program in which
   two prototype YBS-brace assemblies were tested in a full-scale braced
   frame that simulates the in-situ boundary conditions that would be
   present in a steel braced frame that employed the YBS as its primary
   lateral force resisting system. The prototypes were designed for the
   second floor of a six storey sample structure. The prototypes were
   subjected to displacement protocols that consisted of large, inelastic,
   quasi-static and pseudo dynamic cycles up to three times the design
   level brace elongation as calculated in the sample building design. The
   system exhibited a high initial stiffness, excellent ductility capacity
   with a very stable hysteretic response and a desirable large deformation
   stiffening effect. As such, the YBS represents a viable new alternative
   to existing yielding brace systems.}},

Title = {{Understanding and controlling the interaction of nanomaterials with

Journal = {{CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS}},

Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2780-2799}},
Abstract = {{Nanomaterials hold promise as multifunctional diagnostic and therapeutic
   agents. However, the effective application of nanomaterials is hampered
   by limited understanding and control over their interactions with
   complex biological systems. When a nanomaterial enters a physiological
   environment, it rapidly adsorbs proteins forming what is known as the
   protein `corona'. The protein corona alters the size and interfacial
   composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a biological identity that is
   distinct from its synthetic identity. The biological identity determines
   the physiological response including signalling, kinetics, transport,
   accumulation, and toxicity. The structure and composition of the protein
   corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial (size,
   shape, and composition), the nature of the physiological environment
   (blood, interstitial fluid, cell cytoplasm, etc.), and the duration of
   exposure. In this critical review, we discuss the formation of the
   protein corona, its structure and composition, and its influence on the
   physiological response. We also present an `adsorbome' of 125 plasma
   proteins that are known to associate with nanomaterials. We further
   describe how the protein corona is related to the synthetic identity of
   a nanomaterial, and highlight efforts to control protein-nanomaterial
   interactions. We conclude by discussing gaps in the understanding of
   protein-nanomaterial interactions along with strategies to fill them

Abstract = {{Variations in electrical conductivity and real relative permittivity of
   cemented paste backfill (CPB) at early times of cement hydration are
   studied using non-destructive, electromagnetic wave-based techniques.
   The CPB used in this study consists of normal Portland cement (PC),
   process water and gold mine tailings. The measurements were performed
   using (i) a broadband network analyser, which operates at frequencies
   ranging from 20 MHz to 1.3 GHz and (ii) a capacitance probe, which
   operates at a single frequency of 70 MHz. This study shows that the
   electromagnetic properties of CPB are sensitive to specimen composition,
   the stage of binder hydration, binder content and the operating
   frequency of the instrument, and, as such, are a useful tool to monitor
   changes in CPB caused by binder hydration. The electromagnetic (EM) data
   also suggest that, as binder hydration progresses, a portion of free
   water in CPB becomes bound into the newly formed hydration products or
   onto the surface of hydrating cement particles. In addition to EM
   properties, the progress of binder hydration and setting in CPB was also
   monitored using conventional measurement techniques, such as temperature
   evolution measurements and penetrative resistance measurements.}},

Title = {{Engineering Airway Epithelium}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICINE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Airway epithelium is constantly presented with injurious signals, yet
   under healthy circumstances, the epithelium maintains its innate immune
   barrier and mucociliary elevator function. This suggests that airway
   epithelium has regenerative potential (I. R. Telford and C. F. Bridgman,
   1990). In practice, however, airway regeneration is problematic because
   of slow turnover and dedifferentiation of epithelium thereby hindering
   regeneration and increasing time necessary for full maturation and
   function. Based on the anatomy and biology of the airway epithelium, a
   variety of tissue engineering tools available could be utilized to
   overcome the barriers currently seen in airway epithelial generation.
   This paper describes the structure, function, and repair mechanisms in
   native epithelium and highlights specific and manipulatable tissue
   engineering signals that could be of great use in the creation of
   artificial airway epithelium.}},

Abstract = {{Informatics deal with knowledge management and not just information
   technology, which, by its very nature, is social, cognitive, and tied to
   linguistics and human communication. Consequently, philosophy plays a
   major role in informatics because one has to understand in a human and
   not artificial way the meaning of concepts, their relationships, and
   their frames of references (context). Over the last few years, this has
   manifested in the development of many ontologies (a formal description
   of what knowledge is known). Epistemology, the means by which one knows
   or creates assumptions about knowledge, did not receive its due
   attention. This paper establishes the need for investigating the
   epistemological foundations of construction informatics systems, reviews
   related schools of epistemology in general philosophy and in that of
   science, reviews the rather limited and indirect use of epistemology in
   construction research, and presents a proposal for an epistemology for
   construction informatics. Such epistemology is meant to act as
   guidelines for the development of informatics systems and, more
   importantly, the ontologies they use. The proposed epistemology (1)
   advocates the use of constructivist models (bottom-up approach) at the
   microlevel (individual models) within a contemporary pragmatic
   framework, i.e., acceptance of dualism and probabilistic coexistence and
   focus on usability and benefit to users, at the macrolevel in which
   models should be linked to one other effectively to present a value for
   users; (2) emphasizes the need for context modeling along with concept
   modeling; (3) calls for balancing object orientation (top-down
   standardization) with prototype orientation (discovery and situational
   awareness) in concept development; and (4) balancing communication
   (linguistic orientation) along with the prevailing reasoning
   orientation. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000392. (C) 2012 American

Journal = {{ENGINEERING FRACTURE MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{61-77}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Aged open-faced asymmetric double cantilever beam (ADCB) specimens made
   with two different rubber-toughened epoxy adhesives were subject to
   cyclic loading under mixed-mode conditions. The contrasting results
   illustrated the effects of environmental degradation on the matrix and
   toughener. The fatigue threshold strain energy release rate, G(th), and
   the crack growth rates of adhesive 1 degraded in two stages: G(th)
   initially decreased with aging time until it reached a constant minimum
   value at long aging times. Similarly, fatigue crack growth rates
   initially increased with aging time until reaching a limiting upper
   value. However, Gth reached the minimum value sooner than did the crack
   growth rate. In contrast, the Gth of adhesive 2 decreased significantly
   with aging while the crack growth rates remained unchanged even after
   prolonged aging. These differences in fatigue threshold and crack growth
   rate behavior were attributed to changes in the size of the plastic zone
   at the crack tip as the applied loads changed. The differences in the
   degradation behavior of both adhesives were explained using gravimetric
   and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). The degradation of the
   toughening mechanism of adhesive 1 was related to retained, bound water
   disrupting the chemical bonds at the rubber/matrix interface. Having no
   retained water, adhesive 2 was unaffected by this degradation. (C) 2011

Pages = {{11-17}},

Abstract = {{To examine the age-related deterioration in postural control, we
   investigated the association between postural sway during quiet standing
   and either amplitude of physiological tremor or muscle volume of the
   plantar flexors in 20 young and 20 elderly adults. They maintained a
   quiet standing position on a force platform for 60 s with their eyes
   open or closed. During quiet standing, physiological tremors detected
   using a piezoresistive accelerometer were recorded from the soleus
   muscle, and the center of pressure (COP) displacement and body
   acceleration in the antero-posterior direction were calculated using the
   ground reaction forces as an assessment of postural sway. Muscle volume
   was predicted from muscle thickness by an ultrasonographic image. The
   physiological tremor of the soleus muscle during quiet standing was
   significantly greater in elderly than in young adults, and a positive
   association between physiological tremor and the amplitude of postural
   sway was found for young and elderly adults combined. Furthermore,
   physiological tremor was positively correlated with the high-frequency
   component of COP sway during quiet standing. A significantly negative
   relation between the muscle volume of the plantar flexors and postural
   sway was found in both age groups. These results suggest that
   physiological tremor reflects high-frequency fluctuations in postural
   sway during quiet standing in young and elderly adults, and age-related
   increases in the postural sway amplitude in the anteroposterior
   direction may be related to a decrease in muscle volume of the plantar
   flexors for maintaining an upright posture. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The language used in engineering course materials may be a barrier to
   accurate assessment because students perceive the meanings of words
   differently. Universal Design in Education (UDE) has emerged as a
   strategy for making course material more accessible, but remains largely
   untested in this area. This study investigates whether students can
   accurately self-assess their understanding of vocabulary, i.e. if this
   is a `visible' or `invisible' deficit from the student's point of view,
   using a limited sample of ten words found in engineering exams. This is
   a preliminary investigation toward testing the efficacy of a UDE-based
   mitigation strategy, and it finds that students often inaccurately
   self-assess their understanding of language used in engineering

Abstract = {{Communication systems in the architecture, engineering, and construction
   (AEC) industry face many challenges. This paper proposes construction
   information and knowledge portal (CIKP), an information and
   knowledge-management system that utilizes three technologies to address
   the challenges in information exchange and knowledge sharing. First, a
   semantic web that is unlike typical data-exchange standards because
   ontologies present human knowledge in a machine-interpretable manner.
   This provides for more linguistic-friendly representation of
   tacit/subjective knowledge, which increases the level of
   human-friendliness of communication systems. Second, a social web, which
   links people (instead of documents) to create communities of practice
   (CoPs) and allows people to share, reconfigure, and generate knowledge.
   Finally, publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems, which provide for a
   push-pull scenario for information exchange. In the proposed system, any
   knowledge item (KI) (e.g., a document, website, and blog) will be
   represented (tagged) with a semantic vector that describes its contents.
   The developer of the KI can push (share) this to his or her social
   network. On the other end of the spectrum, system users can build
   semantic profiles for their areas of expertise and/or interests. The
   system can pull (find) the most relevant KIs and forward them to the
   user. The system can also link peers with similar or complementary
   interest to one another to establish virtual ad hoc teams. The system
   was evaluated through input from two focus groups. DOI:

Title = {{Forced homodimerization of the c-Fos leucine zipper in designed

Journal = {{MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Although the c-Fos leucine zipper (LZ) does not form a homodimer in its
   native basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) structure, we found that it is
   capable of homodimerization and promoting protein folding in engineered
   basic region/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLHZ) hybrid proteins
   MaxbHLH-Fos and ArntbHLH-Fos, in which the bHLH subdomains of Max and
   Arnt are fused to the c-Fos LZ. By using the in vivo yeast one-hybrid
   system and in vitro circular dichroism and quantitative fluorescence
   anisotropy, we demonstrated that attachment of the c-Fos LZ to the
   otherwise unstructured MaxbHLH resulted in a hybrid bHLHZ-like protein
   now competent for homodimerization and DNA binding at the cognate E-box
   site, CACGTG. In ArntbHLH-Fos, the c-Fos LZ promoted proper folding of
   the HLH structure, although unlike MaxbHLH, ArntbHLH alone is capable of
   homodimerization and DNA binding. In addition, by comparing the E-box
   binding and secondary structures of MaxbHLH-Fos and two derivatives
   containing targeted mutations in the c-Fos LZ, we found that cooperative
   communication exists between the bHLH and LZ: proper folding of the
   four-helix bundle in the HLH region could be induced by the c-Fos LZ,
   and the HLH dimerization region could force homodimerization of the
   c-Fos LZ. These results demonstrate that although intrinsically
   unfavorable, the c-Fos LZ can homodimerize, demonstrating that the same
   c-Fos LZ element can yield orthogonal differences in structure and/or
   DNA-binding function within different transcription factor families,
   including the bZIP and bHLHZ.}},

Abstract = {{While genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECIs) allow Ca2+ imaging in
   model organisms, the gene expression is often under the control of a
   single promoter that may drive expression beyond, the cell types of
   interest. To enable more cell-type specific targeting, GECIs can be
   brought under the, control of the intersecting expression from two
   promoters. Here, we present the splitting and, reassembly of two
   representative GECIs (TN-XL and GCaMP2) mediated by the split intein
   from Nostoc, punctiforme (NpuDnaE). While the split TN-XL biosensor
   offered ratiometric Ca2+ imaging, it had a, diminished Ca2+ response
   relative to the native TN-XL biosensor. In contrast, the split GCaMP2,
   biosensor retained similar Ca2+ response to the native GCaMP2. The split
   GCaMP2 biosensor was, further targeted to the pharyngeal muscles of
   Caenorhabditis elegans where Ca2+ signals from feeding C. elegans, were
   imaged. Thus, we envision that increased cell-type targetability of
   GECIs is feasible with two, complementary promoters. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background and purpose: Heuristic evaluations have been used to evaluate
   safety of medical devices by identifying and assessing usability issues.
   Since radiotherapy treatment delivery systems often consist of multiple
   complex user-interfaces, a heuristic evaluation was conducted to assess
   the potential safety issues of such a system.
   Material and methods: A heuristic evaluation was conducted to evaluate
   the treatment delivery system at Princess Margaret Hospital (Toronto,
   Canada). Two independent evaluators identified usability issues with the
   user-interfaces and rated the severity of each issue.
   Results: The evaluators identified 75 usability issues in total.
   Eighteen of them were rated as high severity, indicating the potential
   to have a major impact on patient safety. A majority of issues were
   found on the record and verify system, and many were associated with the
   patient setup process. While the hospital has processes in place to
   ensure patient safety, recommendations were developed to further
   mitigate the risks of potential consequences.
   Conclusions: Heuristic evaluation is an efficient and inexpensive method
   that can be successfully applied to radiotherapy delivery systems to
   identify usability issues and improve patient safety. Although this
   study was conducted only at one site, the findings may have broad
   implications for the design of these systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland

   extracted is limited by short carrier diffusion lengths. Here, we
   investigate, using a combination of electrical and optical
   characterization techniques, ligand passivation strategies aimed at
   tuning the density and energetic distribution of charge trap states at
   PbS nanocrystal surfaces. Electrical and optical measurements reveal a
   more than 7-fold enhancement of the mobility-lifetime product of PbS CQD
   films treated with 3-mercaptopropionic add (MPA) in comparison to
   traditional organic passivation strategies that have been examined in
   the literature. We show by direct head-to-head comparison that the
   greater mobility-lifetime products of MPA-treated devices enable
   markedly greater short-circuit current and higher power conversion
   efficiency under AM1.5 illumination. Our findings highlight the
   importance of selecting ligand treatment strategies capable of
   passivating a diversity of surface states to enable shallower and lower
   density trap distributions for better transport and more efficient CQD
   solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{The use of steel elliptical hollow sections (EHS) has grown steadily,
   but the implementation of EHS has been done without appropriate design
   guidelines or procedures. A pragmatic objective has been to develop a
   section conversion method to transform the EHS into an equivalent shape
   for which design equations and guidelines already exist. This paper
   further explores the equivalent RHS (rectangular hollow section)
   approach for member design. By using the equivalent RHS approach to
   convert the EHS into an equivalent RI-IS, the validity of existing RHS
   cross-section classification limits and member design equations are
   demonstrated for EHS columns subjected to axial compression that buckle
   about the major axis and the minor axis, and EHS beams subjected to
   bending about the major axis and the minor axis. The equivalent RI-IS
   approach is a single consistent and rational procedure, and it is shown
   to be a viable method for designing EHS compression members and flexural
   members.}},

Abstract = {{Traumatic injury to the central nervous system (CNS) is highly
   debilitating, with the clinical need for regenerative therapies
   apparent. Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) are promising because
   they can repopulate lost or damaged cells and tissues. However, the
   adult CNS does not provide an optimal milieu for exogenous NSPCs to
   survive, engraft, differentiate, and integrate with host tissues. This
   review provides an overview of tissue engineering strategies to improve
   stem cell therapies by providing a defined microenvironment during
   transplantation. The use of biomaterials for physical support, growth
   factor delivery, and cellular co-transplantation are discussed.
   Providing the proper environment for stem cell survival and host tissue
   integration is crucial in realizing the full potential of these cells in
   CNS repair strategies.}},

Pages = {{33-41}},

Abstract = {{Although small interfering RNA (siRNA) can silence the expression of
   disease-related genes, delivery of these highly charged molecules is
   challenging. Delivery approaches for siRNAs are actively being pursued,
   and improved strategies are required for nontoxic and efficient delivery
   for gene knockdown. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) is a natural and
   endogenous nanoparticle that has a rich history as a delivery vehicle.
   Here, we examine purified LDL nanoparticles as carriers for siRNAs. When
   siRNA was covalently conjugated to cholesterol, over 25 chol-siRNA could
   be incorporated onto each LDL without changing nanoparticle morphology.
   The resulting LDL-chol-siRNA nanoparticles were selectively taken up
   into cells via LDL receptor mediated endocytosis, resulting in enhanced
   gene silencing compared to free chol-siRNA (38\% gene knock down versus
   0\% knock down at 100 nM). However, silencing efficiency was limited by
   the receptor-mediated entrapment of the LDL-chol-siRNA nanoparticles in
   endolysosomes. Photochemical internalization demonstrated that
   endolysosome disruption strategies significantly enhance LDL-mediated
   gene silencing (78\% at 100 nM).}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining a secondary disinfectant in the distribution system has
   caused undesirable disinfection by-product (DBP) formation, such as
   haloacetic acids (HAA(9)), and the occurrence of corrosion. This study
   investigated free chlorine degradation and HAA(9) formation as a result
   of the interactions between metals (ductile iron, lead, and copper) and
   corrosion inhibitors (orthophosphate and polyphosphate) by using
   material-specific formation potential (MS-FP) tests at bench scale.
   Interactions of phosphate-based corrosion inhibitors with metal coupons
   had no significant impact on chlorine decay for iron and lead coupons,
   but reduced the rate of free chlorine decay by 50\% for copper coupons.
   Water incubated with iron coupons had approximately 50\% less HAA
   formation compared with bulk water. Elevated HAA formation in the
   presence of copper coupons indicated that copper could catalyze HAA
   formation. Dichloroacetic acid (DCAA) was the dominant species when
   water was in contact with metal coupons, whereas comparable DCAA and
   trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) formed in the bulk water. The results of
   this study will help utilities understand the effects of interactions
   between corrosion inhibitors and metals on chlorine decay and HAA
   formation in their distribution systems, in particular when new pipes
   are installed or as water enters consumers' buildings.}},

Title = {{Risks and Benefits of Consumption of Great Lakes Fish}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{11-18}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Beneficial effects of fish consumption on early cognitive
   development and cardiovascular health have been attributed to the
   omega-3 fatty acids in fish and fish oils, but toxic chemicals in fish
   may adversely affect these health outcomes. Risk benefit assessments of
   fish consumption have frequently focused on methylmercury and omega-3
   fatty acids, not persistent pollutants such as polychlorinated
   biphenyls, and none have evaluated Great Lakes fish consumption.
   OBJECTIVES: The risks and benefits of fish consumption have been
   established primarily for marine fish. Here, we examine whether
   sufficient data are available to evaluate the risks and benefits of
   eating freshwater fish from the Great Lakes.
   METHODS: We used a scoping review to integrate information from multiple
   state, provincial, and federal agency sources regarding the contaminants
   and omega-3 fatty acids in Great Lakes fish and fish consumers,
   consumption rates and fish consumption advisories, and health effects of
   contaminants and omega-3 fatty acids.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: Great Lakes fish contain persistent contaminants many of
   which have documented adverse health effects-that accumulate in humans
   consuming them. In contrast, data are sparse on omega-3 fatty acids in
   the fish and their consumers. Moreover, few studies have documented the
   social and cultural benefits of Great Lakes fish consumption,
   particularly for subsistence fishers and native communities. At this
   time, federal and state/provincial governments provide fish consumption
   advisories based solely on risk.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our knowledge of Great Lakes fish has critical gaps,
   particularly regarding the benefits of consumption. A risk benefit
   analysis requires more information than is currently available on the
   concentration of omega-3 fatty acids in Great Lakes fish and their
   absorption by fish eaters in addition to more information on the social,
   cultural, and health consequences of changes in the amount of fish
   consumed.}},

   using: 1) a backward-forward sweep algorithm for single-phase laterals
   and 2) a sequence-components frame solver for three-phase networks. The
   interface-VSC operating limits are accommodated in the power-flow
   algorithm as an interleaved step to increase computational efficiency of

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{This paper approaches the topic of protection system reliability from an
   economic point of view by 1) designing an optimal modern protective
   relay based on a prescribed level of reliability subject to economic
   constraints and 2) determining optimal routine test intervals by
   balancing the cost of routine tests and losses due to relay failure.
   This paper proposes a method that enables the designer to optimally
   select hardware and software components of a digital protective relay to
   gain the highest possible overall reliability with a restricted budget.
   This design can be viewed as a reliability and redundancy allocation
   problem for which a new easy-to-implement algorithm is proposed. In
   contrast to the existing literature that views the problem of routine
   test interval optimization solely from a reliability viewpoint, this
   paper proposes an optimization procedure for determining optimal test
   intervals. The optimization objective function consists of three terms:
   cost of routine tests, losses due to relay unresponsiveness, and losses
   due to relay maloperation. The value of the objective function is
   calculated based on a new, simple, and comprehensive Markov model.
   Illustrative numerical examples clarify the application of the proposed
   methods and demonstrate their effectiveness in achieving an optimum for
   both cases.}},

   expanding the intermediate nodes of the search tree on-demand, rather
   than exhaustively, along with three types of distributed sorters
   operating in a pipelined structure. The proposed architecture has a
   fixed critical path independent of the constellation size, on-demand
   expansion scheme, efficient distributed sorters, and is scalable to
   higher number of antennas. Fabricated in 0.13 mu m CMOS, it occupies
   0.95 mm(2) core area. Operating at 282 MHz clock frequency, it
   dissipates 135 mW at 1.3 V supply with no BER performance loss. It
   achieves an SNR-independent throughput of 675 Mbps satisfying the
   requirements of IEEE 802.16m and long term evolution (LTE) systems. The

Abstract = {{Carsharing is an innovative travel alternative that has recently
   experienced considerable growth and become part of sustainable
   transportation initiatives. Although carsharing is becoming increasingly
   a popular alternative transportation mode in North America, it is still
   an under-researched area. Current research is aimed at better
   understanding of the behavior of carsharing users. For every member, a
   two-stage approach microsimulates the probability of being active in any
   month using a binary probit model and given that a particular member is
   active during a month, the probability of that member using the service
   multiple times using a random utility-based model. The model is
   estimated using empirical data from one of the largest carsharing
   companies in North America. The model estimates reveal that the activity
   persistency of members is positively linked to previous behaviors for up
   to 4 months, and that the influence of previous months weakens over
   time. It also shows that some attributes of the traveler (gender, age,
   and language spoken at home) impact his or her behaviors. Copyright (c)

   establishes that the conventional compress-and-forward scheme also
   achieves to within a constant gap to the capacity. In contrast, the
   decode-and-forward and the single-tap amplify-and-forward relaying
   strategies can have an infinite gap to capacity in the regime where the

Abstract = {{Multilayer electroactive polymer actuators consisting of polypyrrole
   films electropolymerized on a passive polymer membrane core have been
   harnessed as a source of simple actuation. As an integral component of
   the actuator, the membrane plays a vital role in the transport of ionic
   species and largely dictates the stiffness of the layered configuration,
   yet in past studies the specification of the membrane has remained
   largely arbitrary. In this investigation, we use quasi-static and
   dynamic mechanical analysis to investigate the impact of the mechanical
   properties of the membrane on the actuation response of
   polypyrrole-based trilayer bending actuators. Candidate materials with
   distinctly varied microcellular morphologies are identified and include
   polyvinylidene difluoride, nylon, and nitrocellulose. The quasi-static
   stress-strain response and the frequency-dependent viscoelastic nature
   of the candidates are then evaluated. On the basis of mechanical
   properties these results indicate that polyvinylidene difluoride
   membranes are superior to the other candidates for application as
   trilayer actuator cores. Bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide doped
   polypyrrole actuators with polyvinylidene difluoride cores and nylon

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RHEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Using a numerical method based on the boundary-integral technique, we
   assess the impact of interfacial slip on the dynamics of deformation and
   breakup of a single drop subjected to a uniaxial extensional flow under
   creeping-flow conditions. Interfacial slip is incorporated in our
   continuum development as a jump in the tangential velocity across the
   interface. This velocity jump is shown to reduce to the Navier-slip
   boundary condition to leading order and is characterized by a
   dimensionless slip coefficient alpha = (d(I)/mu(I))(mu/R), where d(I) is
   thickness of the diffuse interface between the liquids, mu(I) is the
   viscosity of the interfacial region, mu is the viscosity of the
   suspending fluid, and R is the drop radius. A key contribution of this
   paper is the development of a stable, boundary-integral formulation to
   incorporate interfacial slip into existing, no-slip boundary-integral
   frameworks for drop deformation. Slip has a fourfold impact on the drop
   stretching, relaxation, and breakup phenomena. First, when the capillary
   number is small, the steady deformation of the drop with slip is smaller
   than the no-slip result, and the difference increases with the viscosity
   ratio and the capillary number. Slip thus leads to larger critical
   capillary numbers beyond which the drop stretches continuously in the
   extensional flow. Second, for capillary numbers greater than the
   critical value, we find that the shape of the deformed drop for the same
   drop elongation is relatively insensitive to the slip coefficient, but
   the time required to reach this deformation is a strong function of the
   slip coefficient-slip slows down the deformation process. Third, the
   end-pinch mechanism of drop breakup leads to a different number and
   sizes of droplets with the inclusion of slip. Finally, slip causes the
   capillary-instability mechanism of drop breakup to produce larger drops
   at faster rates relative to the no-slip case. In addition to the above
   results, we also show that slip moderates the viscosity and normal
   stress differences in a sheared, dilute emulsion. Our study has
   important implications in the area of blending of immiscible polymers
   and indicates that the drop size distribution, which ultimately governs
   the material properties of the blend and composites prepared from it, is
   influenced strongly by interfacial slip. (C) 2012 The Society of

   of (i) a strong base and a strong acid, (ii) a strong base and a weak
   acid, and (iii) a strong base and a multiprotic acid. Microfluidic
   titrations yielded excellent repeatability. The small experimental
   footprint is advantageous in crowded teaching laboratories, and it
   offers limited waste and exposure to potentially hazardous acids and

Abstract = {{Digital microfluidic (DMF) liquid handling includes active
   (electrostatic) and passive (surface tension) mechanisms for reagent
   dispensing. Here we implement a simple and straightforward Teflon-AF
   liftoff protocol for patterning hydrophilic sites on a two-plate device
   for precise passive dispensing of reagents forming virtual microwells -
   an analogy to the wells found on a microtitre plate. We demonstrate here
   that devices formed using these methods are capable of reproducible
   dispensing of volumes ranging from similar to 80 to similar to 800 nL,
   with CVs of 0.7\% to 13.8\% CV. We demonstrate that passive dispensing
   is compatible with DMF operation in both air and oil, and provides for
   improved control of dispensed nano-and micro-litre volumes when compared
   to active electrostatic dispensing. Further, the technique is
   advantageous for cell culture and we report the first example of reagent
   dispensing on a single-plate DMF device. We anticipate this method will
   be useful for a wide range of applications particularly those involving

Abstract = {{Tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) is a ubiquitous substrate used by many
   researchers in the biomedical and biological sciences. Different
   parameters involved in the production of TCPS, including the treatment
   time and the use of reactive gases and chemical agents, can have a
   significant influence on the ultimate surface properties achieved. The
   assumption that they will all yield a consistent and controlled product
   has not proven to be true. To provide a better insight into the
   bioactivity differences in TCPS supplied by different manufacturers,
   TCPS from three different companies (Sarstedt, Wisent Corp., and Becton
   Dickinson (BD)) were analyzed for their surface properties, protein
   adsorption characteristics, and interactions with human monocytes.
   Marked differences were observed in terms of surface wettability and
   surface chemistry. Furthermore, Wisent TCPS adsorbed more than twice the
   amount of serum proteins compared with BD and Sarstedt TCPS. Sarstedt
   showed significantly more cell retention (more DNA) compared with both
   BD and Wisent TCPS brands over a 7 day culture period. Cytokine release
   from monocytes adherent on the three different TCPS also differed
   significantly, suggesting that the differences in the surface properties
   were sufficient to differentially mediate monocyte activation. These
   results have important implications for TCPS research use, in terms of
   appreciating the interpretation of the data when TCPS is used as a
   control substrate as well as when it is used where a pre-conditioned
   state would influence the outcome of the study. (C) 2011 Published by

Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{104-110}},

Abstract = {{Osteocyte apoptosis precedes osteoclast resorption, and may act as a
   critical signal to trigger bone remodeling. While osteoclast precursors
   are known to travel via the circulation, the specific mechanisms by
   which they accumulate at remodeling sites are unclear. We hypothesized
   that osteocyte apoptosis mediates osteoclast precursor adhesion to
   vascular endothelium by regulating osteocytic secretion of IL-6 and
   soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) to promote endothelial ICAM-1 expression.
   We found that conditioned media from TNF-alpha-induced apoptotic MLO-Y4
   osteocytes promoted RAW264.7 osteoclast precursor adhesion onto D4T
   endothelial cells (P < 0.05). Blocking osteocyte apoptosis with a
   pan-caspase inhibitor (ZVAD-FMK) reduced osteoclast precursor adhesion
   to baseline levels (P < 0.001). Endothelial cells treated with apoptotic
   osteocyte conditioned media had elevated surface expression of ICAM-1 (P
   < 0.05), and blocking ICAM-1 abolished apoptosis-induced osteoclast
   precursor adhesion. Apoptotic osteocyte conditioned media contained more
   IL-6 (P < 0.05) and sIL-6R (P < 0.05) than non-apoptotic osteocyte
   conditioned media. When added exogenously, both IL-6 and sIL-6R were
   required for endothelial activation, and blocking IL-6 reduced
   apoptosis-induced osteoclast precursor adhesion to baseline levels (P <
   0.05). Therefore, we conclude that osteocyte apoptosis can promote
   osteoclast precursor adhesion to endothelial cells via ICAM-1; this is
   likely through increased osteocytic IL-6 and sIL-6R secretion, both of
   which are indispensible to endothelial activation. (C) 2011 Elsevier

   sample model analyte, along a microcapillary, resulting in almost
   500-fold local concentration increase in 15 min. Optically controlled

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Established methods for assessing surgical performance face
   limitations. Global rating scales and procedure-specific checklists are
   resource intensive and rely on expert opinions. Alternatives that use
   technology to track hand movements, such as magnetic and optical
   tracking systems, are generally expensive and ill suited to the surgical
   environment.
   METHODS: The authors present a new platform that integrates a novel,
   low-cost optical tracking system, magnetic tracking technology and a
   videographic recording system to quantify surgical performance
   synchronously across all modalities. The validity of this platform was
   tested by examining its ability to differentiate between the performance
   of expert and novice participants on a basic surgical task.
   RESULTS: Each modality was able to differentiate between expert and
   novice participants, and metrics were well correlated across modalities.
   CONCLUSIONS: The authors have developed a platform for assessing
   surgical performance. It can operate in the absence of expert raters and
   has the potential to provide immediate feedback to trainees. Crown

Abstract = {{This paper reports dynamic surface tension experiments of a lung
   surfactant preparation, BLES, for a wide range of concentrations,
   compression ratios and compression rates. These experiments were
   performed using Axisymmetric Drop Shape Analysis-Constrained Sessile
   Drop (ADSA-CSD). The main purpose of the paper is to interpret the
   results in terms of physical parameters using the recently developed
   Compression-Relaxation Model (CRM). In the past, only the minimum
   surface tension was used generally for the characterization of lung
   surfactant films: however, this minimum value is not a physical
   parameter and depends on the compression protocol. CRM is based on the
   assumption that the dynamic surface tension response is governed by
   surface elasticities, adsorption and desorption of components of the
   lung surfactant. The ability of CRM to fit the surface tension response
   closely for a wide variety of parameters (compression ratio, compression
   rate and surfactant concentration) and produce sensible values for the
   elastic and kinetic parameters supports the validity of CRM. (C) 2011

Volume = {{94}},

Abstract = {{A framework was established to predict the fracture toughness of
   degraded closed DCB (CDCB) joints of a toughened adhesive-aluminum
   system using fracture data obtained from accelerated degradation tests
   on open-faced joints. The exposure index (El), the time integral of
   water concentration, was calculated at all points in the closed joints
   using the water diffusion properties of the adhesive. The fracture
   toughness of the closed joints was then predicted from these calculated
   Els by making reference to previously reported fracture toughness data
   from open-faced DCB (ODCB) specimens degraded to various El levels. To
   verify the predictions, fracture experiments and analyses were carried
   out for closed DCB joints degraded at 60 degrees C-95\% relative
   humidity (RH) and 60 degrees C-82\% RH conditions. The failure mode of
   both closed and open DCBs was cohesive in the adhesive layer. Good
   agreement was observed between the predicted steady-state critical
   strain energy release rate (G(CS)) values and the experimentally
   measured G(CS) values for the degraded closed DCB joints. The results
   showed that the accelerated open-faced methodology, which significantly
   reduces the exposure time to reach a given level of degradation, can be
   used to predict the durability of degraded closed joints used in service
   conditions. It was also shown that at a given temperature, the knowledge
   of the degradation behavior at one RH level could be extended to other
   levels of RH with an acceptable accuracy using the fact that fracture
   degradation at a given temperature is a unique function of El,
   independent of the RH exposure history that gives rise to El. The
   results are applicable to other laminated systems where degradation of
   the bonding layer is a failure mode of concern. 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The ability of random mutagenesis techniques to annotate the mammalian
   genome can be hampered due to genetic redundancy and compensatory
   pathways that mask heterozygous mutations under homeostatic conditions.
   The objective of this study was to devise a pharmacologically sensitized
   screen using the chemotherapeutic drug, 5-fluorouracil (5FU), to induce
   cytopenia. 5FU dose was optimized in the 129/SvImJ, C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ,
   and C3H/HeJ strains of laboratory mice. N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)
   mutagenesis was performed on 129/SvImJ males and phenotypic variants
   were identified by backcrossing on to the C57BL/6J background. G1
   animals were challenged with 100 mu g/g 5FU and phenodeviants with
   altered platelet recovery were monitored. Of 546 G1 animals tested, 15
   phenodeviants were identified that displayed increased baseline platelet
   number, a platelet overshoot, or delayed platelet recovery, thereby
   demonstrating the utility of this approach for uncovering mutations in
   megakaryocyte and platelet development. Four G1 mice were selected for
   further analysis. The phenotypes were heritable in all four strains and
   genetic mapping identified a chromosome location in two of the three G2
   lines tested. In conclusion, our group has developed a sensitized random
   mutagenesis screen utilizing 5FU and has shown that the strain
   combination of 129/SvImJ x C57BL/6J is robust for identification of
   founder lines with defects in megakaryocyte and platelet development.

Abstract = {{Electronically tunable reflectarrays and amplifying reflectarrays have
   attracted considerable research in recent years, however, little work
   has been done to combine these two features simultaneously in a single
   design. This paper focuses on the design of such a reflectarray, which
   can be used as a high gain, reconfigurable transmitting antenna for
   communication links. The reflectarray element is an aperture-coupled
   microstrip patch that accepts a linearly polarized wave, phase shifts
   and amplifies the guided-waves in the transmission lines, and then
   re-radiates an orthogonally-polarized wave. First, the element design,
   modelling, stability analysis and experimental results are presented.
   Then a 48 element reflectarray prototype operating at 5.7 GHz is
   described and its two dimensional beam steering capability and
   amplifying nature are successfully demonstrated and verified.}},

   are assigned to different processor cores and routed concurrently.
   Communication between cores is through the message passing interface
   communications protocol. We propose a geographic partitioning of signals
   into independent sets to help minimize the communication overhead. Our
   parallel implementation provides approximately 2.3x speedup using four
   cores and produces deterministic/repeatable results. When combined, the
   parallel and heuristic techniques provide over 7x speedup with four
   cores versus the router in the widely used Versatile Place and Route
   (VPR) FPGA placement/routing framework, with no significant impact on

Title = {{Bit Allocation Laws for Multiantenna Channel Feedback Quantization:

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the optimal design of limited-feedback downlink
   multiuser spatial multiplexing systems. A multiple-antenna base-station
   is assumed to serve multiple single-antenna users, who quantize and feed
   back their channel state information (CSI) through a shared rate-limited
   feedback channel. The optimization problem is cast in the form of
   minimizing the average transmission power at the base-station subject to
   users' target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINR) and outage
   probability constraints. The goal is to derive the feedback bit
   allocations among the users and the corresponding channel magnitude and
   direction quantization codebooks in a high-resolution quantization
   regime. Toward this end, this paper develops an optimization framework
   using approximate analytical closed-form solutions, the accuracy of
   which is then verified by numerical results. The results show that, for
   channels in the real space, the number of channel direction quantization
   bits should be (M - 1) times the number of channel magnitude
   quantization bits, where M is the number of base-station antennas.
   Moreover, users with higher requested quality-of-service (QoS), i.e.,
   lower target outage probabilities, and higher requested downlink rates,
   i.e., higher target SINR's, should use larger shares of the feedback
   rate. It is also shown that, for the target QoS parameters to be
   feasible, the total feedback bandwidth should scale logarithmically with
   the geometric mean of the target SINR values and the geometric mean of
   the inverse target outage probabilities. In particular, the minimum
   required feedback rate is shown to increase if the users' target
   parameters deviate from the corresponding geometric means. Finally, the
   paper shows that, as the total number of feedback bits B increases, the
   performance of the limited-feedback system approaches the perfect-CSI
   system as 2(-B/M2).}},

Abstract = {{Digital microfluidics (DMF) is a technology that facilitates
   electrostatic manipulation of discrete nano-and micro-litre droplets
   across an array of electrodes, which provides the advantages of single
   sample addressability, automation, and parallelization. There has been
   considerable interest in recent years in using DMF for cell culture and
   analysis, but previous studies have used immortalized cell lines. We
   report here the first digital microfluidic method for primary cell
   culture and analysis. A new mode of ``upside-down'' cell culture was
   implemented by patterning the top plate of a device using a fluorocarbon
   liftoff technique. This method was useful for culturing three different
   primary cell types for up to one week, as well as implementing a
   fixation, permeabilization, and staining procedure for F-actin and
   nuclei. A multistep assay for monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells
   (ECs) was performed to evaluate functionality in DMF-cultured primary
   cells and to demonstrate co-culture using a DMF platform. Monocytes were
   observed to adhere in significantly greater numbers to ECs exposed to
   tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha than those that were not, confirming
   that ECs cultured in this format maintain in vivo-like properties. The
   ability to manipulate, maintain, and assay primary cells demonstrates a
   useful application for DMF in studies involving precious samples of
   cells from small animals or human patients.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{595-601}},
Abstract = {{Gas bubbles present a frequent challenge to the on-chip investigation
   and culture of biological cells and small organs. The presence of a
   single bubble can adversely impair biological function and often
   viability as it increases the wall shear stress in a liquid-perfused
   microchannel by at least one order of magnitude. We present a
   microfluidic strategy for in-plane trapping and removal of gas bubbles
   with volumes of 0.1-500 nL. The presented bubble trap is compatible with
   single-layer soft lithography and requires a footprint of less than ten
   square millimetres. Nitrogen bubbles were consistently removed at a rate
   of 0.14 mu L min(-1). Experiments were complemented with analytical and
   numerical models to comprehensively characterize bubble removal for
   liquids with different wetting behaviour. Consistent long-term operation
   of the bubble trap was demonstrated by removing approximately 4000
   bubbles during one day. In a case study, we successfully applied the
   bubble trap to the on-chip investigation of intact small blood vessels.
   Scalability of the design was demonstrated by realizing eight parallel
   traps at a total removal rate of 0.9 mu L min(-1) (measured for
   nitrogen).}},
