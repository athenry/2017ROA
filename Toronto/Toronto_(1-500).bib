Abstract = {{Plasmonic effects have been proposed as a solution to overcome the
   limited light absorption in thin-film photovoltaic devices, and various
   types of plasmonic solar cells have been developed. This review provides
   a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art progress on the design
   and fabrication of plasmonic solar cells and their enhancement
   mechanism. The working principle is first addressed in terms of the
   combined effects of plasmon decay, scattering, near-field enhancement,
   and plasmonic energy transfer, including direct hot electron transfer
   and resonant energy transfer. Then, we summarize recent developments for
   various types of plasmonic solar cells based on silicon, dye-sensitized,
   organic photovoltaic, and other types of solar cells, including quantum
   dot and perovskite variants. We also address several issues regarding
   the limitations of plasmonic nanostructures, including their electrical,
   chemical, and physical stability, charge recombination, narrowband
   absorption, and high cost. Next, we propose a few potentially useful
   approaches that can improve the performance of plasmonic cells, such as
   the inclusion of graphene plasmonics, plasmon-upconversion coupling, and
   coupling between fluorescence resonance energy transfer and plasmon
   resonance energy transfer. This review is concluded with remarks on
   future prospects for plasmonic solar cell use.}},

Abstract = {{On-chip imaging of intact three-dimensional tissues within microfluidic
   devices is fundamentally hindered by intratissue optical scattering,
   which impedes their use as tissue models for high-throughput screening
   assays. Here, we engineered a microfluidic system that preserves and
   converts tissues into optically transparent structures in less than 1 d,
   which is 20x faster than current passive clearing approaches.
   Accelerated clearing was achieved because the microfluidic system
   enhanced the exchange of interstitial fluids by 567-fold, which
   increased the rate of removal of optically scattering lipid molecules
   from the cross-linked tissue. Our enhanced clearing process allowed us
   to fluorescently image and map the segregation and compartmentalization
   of different cells during the formation of tumor spheroids, and to track
   the degradation of vasculature over time within extracted murine
   pancreatic islets in static culture, which may have implications on the
   efficacy of beta-cell transplantation treatments for type 1 diabetes. We
   further developed an image analysis algorithm that automates the
   analysis of the vasculature connectivity, volume, and cellular spatial
   distribution of the intact tissue. Our technique allows whole tissue
   analysis in microfluidic systems, and has implications in the
   development of organ-on-a-chip systems, high-throughput drug screening
   devices, and in regenerative medicine.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we present a new three-dimensional printing inspired
   method for in situ fabrication of mobile magnetic microrobots with
   complex topology by bending a polymer filament on demand directly inside
   an enclosed operational environment. Compared with current microrobot
   fabrication methods that typically involve multiple microfabrication
   steps and complex equipment, the proposed method is simply and fast. The
   target shape is formed as the filament is fed through a hot needle
   inserted into the workspace, and the filament bending moment is induced
   by attaching a tip magnet at the end of the filament and projecting
   magnetic fields wirelessly from external electromagnetic coils. The
   filament bending mechanics and the behavior of the bending zone are
   analyzed and verified through bending experiment. A shape planner is
   developed for automatically controlling the fabrication process of any
   desired planar shapes, and the shape creation potential of this method
   is also studied. Magnetically active millimeter-scale robotic devices of
   different planar shapes are fabricated using polylactic acid filament
   with diameter as small as 100 mu m. As demonstrations of the in situ
   formation of functional microrobotic devices, a micro-gripper is
   fabricated and controlled to assemble a cell cage. A micro- spring is
   created as a manipulating tool with force sensing capability. We, thus,
   show the utility of the fabrication method for creating complex
   microrobot shapes remotely in enclosed environments for advanced
   microrobotic applications, with the potential for scaled down
   applications in health care and microfluidics.}},

Abstract = {{Paint films with uniform thicknesses (similar to 1 mm) were applied on
   glass substrates using a model paint consisting of a resin dissolved in
   butanol. Small air bubbles were introduced into the liquid, and test
   samples were cured in a natural convection oven. Bubbles in paint grew
   larger as the evaporating solvent diffused into them. Photographs of the
   film surfaces were taken during drying, and the distance between bubbles
   was measured. Bubbles were observed to move toward each other and form
   clusters. When a vertical surface was introduced into the liquid film,
   bubbles moved toward the surface if the liquid-solid contact angle theta
   < 90 degrees but moved away if theta > 90 degrees. A floating bubble or
   hydrophilic surface creates an upward curving liquid meniscus near
   itself so that neighboring bubbles experience buoyancy forces that drive
   them up the rising liquid surface. A hydrophobic surface creates a
   downward-curving meniscus, so that bubbles move away from it. Bubble
   motion was modeled using an analysis of the shape of, liquid meniscus
   and buoyancy forces acting on floating bubbles.}},

Abstract = {{Focused ultrasound (FUS) phased arrays show promise for non-invasive
   brain therapy. However, the majority of them are limited to a single
   transmit/ receive frequency and therefore lack the versatility to expose
   and monitor the treatment volume. Multi-frequency arrays could offer
   variable transmit focal sizes under a fixed aperture, and detect
   different spectral content on receive for imaging purposes. Here, a
   three-frequency (306, 612, and 1224 kHz) sparse hemispherical ultrasound
   phased array (31.8 cm aperture; 128 transducer modules) was constructed
   and evaluated for microbubblemediated transcranial therapy and
   simultaneous cavitation mapping. The array is able to perform effective
   electronic beam steering over a volume spanning (-40, 40) and (-30, 50)
   mm in the lateral and axial directions, respectively. The focal size at
   the geometric center is approximately 0.9 (2.1) mm, 1.7 (3.9) mm, and
   3.1 (6.5) mm in lateral (axial) pressure full width at half maximum
   (FWHM) at 1224, 612, and 306 kHz, respectively. The array was also found
   capable of dual-frequency excitation and simultaneous multi-foci
   sonication, which enables the future exploration of more complex
   exposure strategies. Passive acoustic mapping of dilute microbubble
   clouds demonstrated that the point spread function of the receive array
   has a lateral (axial) intensity FWHM between 0.8-3.5 mm (1.7-11.7 mm)
   over a volume spanning (-25, 25) mm in both the lateral and axial
   directions, depending on the transmit/receive frequency combination and
   the imaging location. The device enabled both half and second harmonic
   imaging through the intact skull, which may be useful for improving the
   contrast-to-tissue ratio or imaging resolution, respectively.
   Preliminary in vivo experiments demonstrated the system's ability to
   induce blood-brain barrier opening and simultaneously spatially map
   microbubble cavitation activity in a rat model. This work presents a
   tool to investigate optimal strategies for non-thermal FUS brain therapy
   and concurrent microbubble cavitation monitoring through the
   availability of multiple frequencies.}},

Title = {{Development and Application of a Life Cycle-Based Model to Evaluate
   Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Oil Sands Upgrading Technologies}},

Abstract = {{A life cycle-based model, OSTUM (Oil Sands Technologies for Upgrading
   Model), which evaluates the energy intensity and greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions of current oil sands upgrading technologies, is developed.
   Upgrading converts oil sands bitumen into high quality synthetic crude
   oil (SCO), a refinery feedstock. OSTUM's novel attributes include the
   following: the breadth of technologies and upgrading operations options
   that can be analyzed, energy intensity and GHG emissions being estimated
   at the process unit level, it not being dependent on a proprietary
   process simulator, and use of publicly available data. OSTUM is applied
   to a hypothetical, but realistic, upgrading operation based on delayed
   coking, the most common upgrading technology, resulting in emissions of
   328 kg CO(2)e/m(3) SCO. The primary contributor to upgrading emissions
   (45\%) is the use of natural gas for hydrogen production through steam
   methane reforming, followed by the use of natural gas as fuel in the
   rest of the process units' heaters (39\%). OSTUM's results are in
   agreement with those of a process simulation model developed by
   CanmetENERGY, other literature, and confidential data of a commercial
   upgrading operation. For the application of the model, emissions are
   found to be most sensitive to the amount of natural gas utilized as
   feedstock by the steam methane reformer. OSTUM is capable of evaluating
   the impact of different technologies, feedstock qualities, operating
   conditions, and fuel mixes on upgrading emissions, and its life cycle
   perspective allows easy incorporation of results into well-to-wheel
   analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Cesium lead halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have attracted
   significant interest for optoelectronic applications in view of their
   high brightness and narrow emission linewidth at visible wavelengths. A
   remaining challenge is the degradation of PQDs during purification from
   the synthesis solution. This is attributed to proton transfer between
   oleic acid and oleylamine surface capping agents that leads to facile
   ligand loss. Here, a new synthetic method is reported that enhances the
   colloidal stability of PQDs by capping them solely using oleic acid
   (OA). Quaternary alkylammonium halides are used as precursors,
   eliminating the need for oleylamine. This strategy enhances the
   colloidal stability of OA capped PQDs during purification, allowing us
   to remove excess organic content in thin films. Inverted red, green, and
   blue PQD light-emitting diodes (LED) are fabricated for the first time
   with solution-processed polymer-based hole transport layers due to
   higher robustness of OA capped PQDs to solution processing. The blue and
   green LEDs exhibit threefold and tenfold improved external quantum
   efficiency (EQE), respectively, compared to prior related reports for
   amine/ammonium capped cross-linked PQDs. The brightest blue LED based on
   all inorganic CsPb(Br1-xClx)(3) PQDs is also reported.}},

Title = {{A 17-gene stemness score for rapid determination of risk in acute

Pages = {{433+}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Refractoriness to induction chemotherapy and relapse after achievement
   of remission are the main obstacles to cure in acute myeloid leukaemia
   (AML)(1). After standard induction chemotherapy, patients are assigned
   to different post-remission strategies on the basis of cytogenetic and
   molecular abnormalities that broadly define adverse, intermediate and
   favourable risk categories(2,3). However, some patients do not respond
   to induction therapy and another subset will eventually relapse despite
   the lack of adverse risk factors(4). There is an urgent need for better
   biomarkers to identify these high-risk patients before starting
   induction chemotherapy, to enable testing of alternative induction
   strategies in clinical trials(5). The high rate of relapse in AML has
   been attributed to the persistence of leukaemia stem cells (LSCs), which
   possess a number of stem cell properties, including quiescence, that are
   linked to therapy resistance(6-10). Here, to develop predictive and/or
   prognostic biomarkers related to stemness, we generated a list of genes
   that are differentially expressed between 138 LSC+ and 89 LSC- cell
   fractions from 78 AML patients validated by xenotransplantation. To
   extract the core transcriptional components of stemness relevant to
   clinical outcomes, we performed sparse regression analysis of LSC gene
   expression against survival in a large training cohort, generating a
   17-gene LSC score (LSC17). The LSC17 score was highly prognostic in five
   independent cohorts comprising patients of diverse AML subtypes (n =
   908) and contributed greatly to accurate prediction of initial therapy
   resistance. Patients with high LSC17 scores had poor outcomes with
   current treatments including allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The
   LSC17 score provides clinicians with a rapid and powerful tool to
   identify AML patients who do not benefit from standard therapy and who
   should be enrolled in trials evaluating novel upfront or post-remission
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Self-trapped polarons and excitons associated with defects can localize
   energy in ways that can modify the material properties. The doped
   amorphous titanium dioxide (aTiO(2)) that possesses self-trapped
   polarons and excitons due to its inherited disorder and extrinsic doping
   has recently drawn increased attention as potential cheap visible light
   photocatalyst. However, the synergetic role that intrinsic and extrinsic
   defects play in enhancing the photoactivity of doped aTiO(2) is still a
   mystery. To gain insights into the photocatalytic behavior of defected
   aTiO(2), in this study, we analyzed three Fe-doped aTiO(2) models having
   Fe in Fe(II), Fe(III), and Fe(IV) oxidation states. The density
   functional theory with Hubbard energy correction (DFT+U) calculations
   conducted in this study clearly indicate that the visible light
   absorption of aTiO(2) will be improved by doping it with Fe.
   Furthermore, our investigation reveals that even though all the doped
   aTiO(2) models showed highly localized states at mid gap and band edges,
   doping with Fe(II) led to maximum visible light absorption. This
   distinct behavior of Fe(II)-doped aTiO(2) is attributed to the unique
   position of its mid gap states, high self-trap energy, low mobility, and
   weak chemical bonds.}},

Abstract = {{Proton conducting polymer electrolytes employed in many electrochemical
   pseudocapacitors are typically based on aqueous systems, which limit the
   operating potential and temperature range of these energy storage
   devices. In this study, we developed non-aqueous polymer electrolytes
   based on protic ionic liquids (PIL). We relied on cationic substitution
   to obtain proton conducting yet environmentally benign non-fluorinated
   ionic liquids. By developing binary systems of PILs with different
   cations, eutectic compositions of PILs with drastically lowered melting
   points were demonstrated. Through thermal analyses of these binary
   systems, phase diagrams were constructed which allowed us to obtain
   eutectic binary PIL mixtures exhibiting a liquidus range from 70 degrees
   C to 150 degrees C . These eutectic PIL mixtures were incorporated into
   polymer systems to develop non-aqueous thin film proton-conducting
   polymer electrolytes for solid pseudocapacitors. The proton conductivity
   of the eutectic ionic liquids was observed in the polymer electrolyte
   systems and promoted pseudocapacitive behavior in solid and liquid
   capacitor cells. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Coupling with rapid economic development and continual urban expansion,
   CO2 as the dominant contributor to the greenhouse has aggravated the
   global climate change, such that achieving the joint goal of increasing
   electricity demand and mitigating CO2 emission become crucial to plan
   electric power systems (EPS). Various complexities and uncertainties
   exist in the real-world EPS problems, which can affect the optimization
   processes as well as the generated decision schemes. In this study, a
   two-stage interval-possibilistic programming (TIPP) method is developed
   for planning carbon emission trading (CET) in the EPS of Qingdao
   (China), where dual uncertainties expressed as interval-random variables
   and interval-possibilistic parameters can be handled. Techniques of
   support vector regression (SVR) and Monte Carlo simulation are used for
   predicting electricity demand and CO2 emission. Four scenarios
   corresponding to different CO2-emission permits and CO2-mitigation
   levels have been analyzed. Results reveal that coal-fired power is the
   primary CO2-emission emitter, and it tends to the transition to
   renewable energy-dominated power with the CO2-mitigation levels from 5\%
   to 30\% (e.g., contributing to 0.6\% increment of renewable energies and
   {[}30.8, 33.1] \% reduction of treated CO2 emissions). Compared to
   without CET scheme, CO2 emissions can be reduced about 5\% under the
   CET, demonstrating that CET can help to promote the cleaner production
   of the local electricity. The findings can help decision makers
   reallocate carbon permits among different emitters effectively, provide
   appropriate mitigation plan for CO2-emission, as well as to improve
   environmental and sustainable EPS planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Understanding how compression affects the distribution of liquid water

   diffusion layer (GDL) is vital for informing the design of improved

   networks extracted from synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography
   images of compressed GDLs were employed to simulate liquid water
   transport in GDL materials over a range of compression pressures. The
   oxygen transport resistance was predicted for each sample under dry and
   partially saturated conditions. A favorable GDL compression value for a
   preferred liquid water distribution and oxygen diffusion was found for
   Toray TGP-H-090 (10\%), yet an optimum compression value was not
   recognized for SGL Sigracet 25BC. SGL Sigracet 25BC exhibited lower
   transport resistance values compared to Toray TGP-H-090, and this is
   attributed to the additional diffusion pathways provided by the
   microporous layer (MPL), an effect that is particularly significant
   under partially saturated conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Influence of SiO2 reduction on the local structural order and fluidity

Abstract = {{An in-depth understanding about the transformation of molten coke ash is
   significant to uncover the mechanism of coke reaction at high
   temperature inside a blast furnace. The evolution of local structural
   order and fluidity of molten coke ash (SiO2-Al2O3-CaO) with the
   reduction of SiO2 at a fixed Al2O3/CaO ratio was investigated by means
   of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. While {[}SA] tetrahedral was the
   main structural units forming Si-O network, due to the high levels of
   Al2O3 in coke minerals {[}AlO4] and a small amount of {[}AlO3] were the
   two key structural units forming the Al-O network. The effect of
   chemical composition on the bond length of Si-O, Al-O and Ca-O is very
   weak, while the coordination number of Al-O can be slightly influenced
   by the reduction of SiO2 due to the unstable structure of Al-centered
   polyhedron compared with {[}Sat]. The concentration of bridging oxygen
   decreases, while that of tricluster oxygen increases with the reduction
   of SiO2 from the system. Al-centered polyhedrons prefer to be connected
   by O triclusters, while Si-centered polyhedron favor a link by bridging
   oxygen. With the decrease of SiO2, more {[}AlO4] will change from
   edge-sharing to corner-sharing with similar units. The angular
   distribution of Si-O-Si exhibits an asymmetric shape with the average
   value around 151, while two peaks were observed in the Al-O-Al angular
   distribution because of the edge-sharing (similar to 90 degrees) and
   corner-sharing (similar to 122 degrees) features in Al-centered
   polyhedrons. With the reduction of SiO2 from the system, the diffusivity
   of all atoms increase considerably since the amount of strong Si-O bond
   decreases. Viscosity estimated from MD simulation decrease with the
   reduction of SiO2. The good agreement between MD simulated data and
   experimental data indicates that MD simulation can be adopted to
   estimate the property change of molten coke ash at high temperature. (C)

Abstract = {{In2O3-x(OH)(y) nanoparticles have been shown to function as an effective
   gas-phase photocatalyst for the reduction of CO2 to CO via the reverse
   water-gas shift reaction. Their photocatalytic activity is strongly
   correlated to the number of oxygen vacancy and hydroxide defects present
   in the system. To better understand how such defects interact with
   photogenerated electrons and holes in these materials, we have studied
   the relaxation dynamics of In2O3-x(OH)(y) nanoparticles with varying
   concentration of defects using two different excitation energies
   corresponding to above-band-gap (318-nm) and near-band-gap (405-nm)
   excitations. Our results demonstrate that defects play a significant
   role in the excited-state, charge relaxation pathways. Higher defect
   concentrations result in longer excited-state lifetimes, which are
   attributed to improved charge separation. This correlates well with the
   observed trends in the photocatalytic activity. These results are
   further supported by density-functional theory calculations, which
   confirm the positions of oxygen vacancy and hydroxide defect states
   within the optical band gap of indium oxide. This enhanced understanding
   of the role these defects play in determining the optoelectronic
   properties and charge carrier dynamics can provide valuable insight
   toward the rational development of more efficient photocatalytic
   materials for CO2 reduction.}},

Abstract = {{The elastic properties of renal glomeruli and their capillaries permit
   them to maintain structural integrity in the presence of variable
   hemodynamic forces. Measured by micro-indentation, glomeruli have an
   elastic modulus (E, Young's modulus) of 2.1 kPa, and estimates from
   glomerular perfusion studies suggest that the E of glomeruli is between
   2 and 4 kPa. F-actin depolymerization by latrunculin, inhibition of
   acto-myosin contractility by blebbistatin, reduction in ATP synthesis,
   and reduction of the affinity of adhesion proteins by EDTA reduced the
   glomerular E to 1.26, 1.7, 1.5, and 1.43 kPa, respectively. Actin
   filament stabilization with jasplakinolide and increasing integrin
   affinity with Mg2+ increased E to 2.65 and 2.87 kPa, respectively.
   Alterations in glomerular E are reflected in commensurate changes in F/G
   actin ratios. Disruption of vimentin intermediate filaments by
   withaferin A reduced E to 0.92 kPa. The E of decellularized glomeruli
   was 0.74 kPa, indicating that cellular components of glomeruli have
   dominant effects on their elasticity. The E of glomerular basement
   membranes measured by magnetic bead displacement was 2.4 kPa. Podocytes
   and mesangial cells grown on substrates with E values between 3 and 5
   kPa had actin fibers and focal adhesions resembling those of podocytes
   in vivo. Renal ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion reduced the E of
   glomeruli to 1.58 kPa. These results show that the E of glomeruli is
   between 2 and 4 kPa. E of the GBM, 2.4 kPa, is consistent with this
   value, and is supported by the behavior of podocytes and mesangial cells
   grown on variable stiffness matrices. The podocyte cytoskeleton
   contributes the major component to the overall E of glomeruli, and a
   normal E requires ATP synthesis. The reduction in glomerular E following
   ischemia and in other diseases indicates that reduced glomerular E is a
   common feature of many forms of glomerular injury and indicative of an
   abnormal podocyte cytoskeleton.}},

Journal = {{BMC BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: To achieve synthetic control over how a cell responds to
   other cells or the extracellular environment, it is important to
   reliably engineer proteins that can traffic and span the plasma
   membrane. Using a modular approach to assemble proteins, we identified
   the minimum necessary components required to engineer such
   membrane-spanning proteins with predictable orientation in mammalian
   cells.
   Results: While a transmembrane domain (TM) fused to the N-terminus of a
   protein is sufficient to traffic it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
   an additional signal peptidase cleavage site downstream of this TM
   enhanced sorting out of the ER. Next, a second TM in the synthetic
   protein helped anchor and accumulate the membrane-spanning protein on
   the plasma membrane. The orientation of the components of the synthetic
   protein were determined through measuring intracellular Ca2+ signaling
   using the R-GECO biosensor and through measuring extracellular quenching
   of yellow fluorescent protein variants by saturating acidic and salt
   conditions.
   Conclusions: This work forms the basis of engineering novel proteins
   that span the plasma membrane to potentially control intracellular
   responses to extracellular conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Dysfunctional cortical inhibition (CI) is postulated as a key
   neurophysiological mechanism in major depressive disorder.
   Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the treatment of choice for resistant
   depression and ECT has been associated with enhanced CI. The objective
   of this study was to evaluate the relationship between CI and ECT
   response in resistant depression. Twenty-five patients with treatment
   resistant depression underwent an acute course of ECT. CI was indexed by
   the cortical silent period (CSP) and short-interval cortical inhibition
   (SICI), through TMS-EMG. CI and clinical response was measured prior to
   beginning an acute ECT course and within 48 hours of the last ECT
   treatment in the course. Clinical response to ECT was assessed by
   HDRS-17 before and after an acute course of ECT. We found that there was
   a significant difference in CSP at baseline between responder and
   non-responder groups (p = 0.044). Baseline CSP predicted therapeutic
   response to ECT with sensitivity of 80\% and specificity of 60\%. There
   were no changes in CSP or SICI after administration of the ECT course.
   Our findings suggest that duration of pre-treatment CSP may be a useful
   predictor of therapeutic response to ECT in patients with TRD.}},

   Elements Leaching from Phosphogypsum}},

Abstract = {{Many technologies relied upon by modern society, such as portable
   electronics and renewable energy systems, require the use of rare-earth
   elements (REEs). The global demand for REEs is increasing rapidly, and
   new developments for their recovery from secondary sources have been
   sparked. Phosphogypsum (PG), the byproduct of phosphoric acid
   production, is considered a secondary source for REEs. This research
   builds upon previous studies investigating the hydrometallurgical
   recovery of REEs from PG via acid leaching. The current study put the
   emphasis on developing processes to recover consumed acid in the
   leaching process. Here we propose an innovative process that relies upon
   the addition of calcium sulfate anhydrite seeds to the leached solution.
   Anhydrite seeding results in the rejection of calcium sulfate from the
   leached solution and reduced calcium concentration. Because the REE
   leaching efficiency is controlled by the solubility limit of PG, which
   is correlated to the calcium concentration, the drop increases the
   potential of the solution to leach more REEs. Thus, the solution can be
   recycled and reused as the leachant in subsequent leaching steps. This
   novel process is a promising technique to recycle consumed acid,
   lowering the operating costs and improving the efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved inorganic salts influence the partitioning of organic
   compounds into the aqueous phase. This influence is especially
   significant in atmospheric aerosol, which usually contains large amounts
   of ions, including sodium, ammonium, chloride, sulfate, and nitrate.
   However, empirical data on this salt effect are very sparse. Here, the
   partitioning of numerous organic compounds into solutions of Na2SO4,
   NH4Cl, and NH4NO3 was measured and compared with existing data for NaCl
   and (NH4)(2)SO4. Salt mixtures were also tested to establish whether the
   salt effect is additive. In general, the salt effect showed a decreasing
   trend of Na2SO4 > (NH)(2)SO4 > NaCl > NH4Cl > NH4NO3 for the studied
   organic compounds, implying the following relative strength of the salt
   effect of individual anions: SO42- > Cl > NO3- and of cations: Na+ >
   NH4+. The salt effect of different salts is moderately correlated.
   Predictive models for the salt effect were developed based on the
   experimental data. The experimental data indicate that the salt effect
   of mixtures may not be entirely additive. However, the deviation from
   additivity, if it exists, is small. Data of very high quality are
   required to establish whether the effect of constituent ions or salts is
   additive or not.}},

Abstract = {{We compare the microfluidic manufacturing of
   polycaprolactone-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PCL-b-PEO) nanoparticles
   (NPs) in a single-phase staggered herringbone (SHB) mixer and in a
   two-phase gas liquid segmented mixer. NPs generated from two different
   copolymer compositions in both reactors and at three different flow
   rates, along with NPs generated using a conventional bulk method, are
   compared with respect to morphologies, dimensions, and internal
   crystallinities. Our work, the first direct comparison between alternate
   microfluidic NP synthesis methods, shows three key findings: (i) NP
   morphologies and dimensions produced in the bulk are different from
   those produced in a microfluidic mixer, whereas NP crystallinities
   produced in the bulk and in the SHB mixer are similar; (ii) NP
   morphologies, dimensions, and crystallinities produced in the
   single-phase SHB and two-phase mixers at the lowest flow rate are
   similar; and (iii) NP morphologies, dimensions, and crystallinities
   change with flow rate in the two-phase mixer but not in the single-phase
   SHB mixer. These findings provide new insights into the relative roles
   of mixing and shear in the formation and flow-directed processing of
   polymeric NPs in microfluidics, informing future reactor designs for
   manufacturing NPs of low polydispersity and controlled multiscale
   structure and function.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue morphogenesis requires force-generating mechanisms to organize
   cells into complex structures. Although many such mechanisms have been
   characterized, we know little about how forces are integrated across
   developing tissues. We provide evidence that integrin-mediated
   cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion modulates the transmission of
   apically generated tension during dorsal closure (DC) in Drosophila.
   Integrin-containing adhesive structures resembling focal adhesions were
   identified on the basal surface of the amnioserosa (AS), an
   extraembryonic epithelium essential for DC. Genetic modulation of
   integrin-mediated adhesion results in defective DC. Quantitative image
   analysis and laser ablation experiments reveal that basal cell-ECM
   adhesions provide resistance to apical cell displacements and force
   transmission between neighboring cells in the AS. Finally, we provide
   evidence for integrin-dependent force transmission to the AS substrate.
   Overall, we find that integrins regulate force transmission within and
   between cells, thereby playing an essential role in transmitting tension
   in developing tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that electrodeposited metal-diamond
   composite materials exhibit excellent mechanical properties, but their
   potential applications for thermal management in electronic devices have
   not been addressed. In contrast to common high temperature-high pressure
   (HTHP) methods, electrodeposition could offer a more economically viable
   route for making metal-diamond heat sink materials. In this study,
   nanocrystalline nickel-diamond composite materials were produced by
   electrodepositon. Using them as a prototype, the feasibility of using
   electrodeposited metal-diamond composite materials for heat sink
   applications was examined. The maximum thermal conductivity of
   nanocrystalline nickel-diamond composite was 200 W/mK at 61 vol\%
   diamond, which is 2.6 times higher than 77 W/mK for pure nanocrystalline
   nickel. In addition, the thermal boundary conductance in the composite
   materials produced by electrodeposition was comparable to that
   previously reported for copper-diamond composite materials produced by
   the HTHP method. These results are a promising sign for producing
   electrodeposited metal-diamond composite materials with thermal
   conductivities high enough for heat management applications. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The emergence of interference alignment (IA) as a degrees-of-freedom
   optimal strategy motivates the need to investigate whether IA can be
   leveraged to aid conventional network utility maximization algorithms,
   which are typically only capable of finding locally optimal solutions.
   To test the usefulness of IA in this context, this paper proposes a
   two-stage optimization framework for the downlink of a G-cell
   multi-antenna network with K users/cell. The first stage of the proposed
   framework focuses on nulling interference from a set of dominant
   interferers using IA, while the second stage optimizes transmit and
   receive beamformers to maximize a network-wide utility using the IA
   solution as the initial condition. Further, this paper establishes a set
   of new feasibility results for partial IA that can be used to guide the
   number of dominant interferers to be nulled in the first stage. Through
   simulations on specific topologies of a cluster of base stations, it is
   observed that the impact of IA depends on the choice of the utility
   function and the presence of out-of-cluster interference. In the absence
   of out-of-cluster interference, the proposed framework outperforms
   straightforward optimization when maximizing the minimum rate, while
   providing marginal gains when maximizing sum rate. However, the benefit
   of IA is greatly diminished in the presence of significant
   out-of-cluster interference.}},

Title = {{Diverse mechanisms of metaeffector activity in an intracellular
   bacterial pathogen, Legionella pneumophila}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Pathogens deliver complex arsenals of translocated effector proteins to
   host cells during infection, but the extent to which these proteins are
   regulated once inside the eukaryotic cell remains poorly defined. Among
   all bacterial pathogens, Legionella pneumophila maintains the largest
   known set of translocated substrates, delivering over 300 proteins to
   the host cell via its Type IVB, Icm/Dot translocation system. Backed by
   a few notable examples of effector-effector regulation in L.
   pneumophila, we sought to define the extent of this phenomenon through a
   systematic analysis of effector-effector functional interaction. We used
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an established proxy for the eukaryotic host,
   to query > 108,000 pairwise genetic interactions between two compatible
   expression libraries of similar to 330 L. pneumophila-translocated
   substrates. While capturing all known examples of effector-effector
   suppression, we identify fourteen novel translocated substrates that
   suppress the activity of other bacterial effectors and one pair with
   synergistic activities. In at least nine instances, this regulation is
   direct-a hallmark of an emerging class of proteins called metaeffectors,
   or ``effectors of effectors{''}. Through detailed structural and
   functional analysis, we show that metaeffector activity derives from a
   diverse range of mechanisms, shapes evolution, and can be used to reveal
   important aspects of each cognate effector's function. Metaeffectors,
   along with other, indirect, forms of effector-effector modulation, may
   be a common feature of many intracellular pathogens-with unrealized
   potential to inform our understanding of how pathogens regulate their
   interactions with the host cell.}},

Abstract = {{The Escherichia coli type I-E CRISPR-Cas system Cascade effector is a
   multisubunit complex that binds CRISPR RNA (crRNA). Through its
   32-nucleotide spacer sequence, Cascade-bound crRNA recognizes
   protospacers in foreign DNA, causing its destruction during CRISPR
   interference or acquisition of additional spacers in CRISPR array during
   primed CRISPR adaptation. Within Cascade, the crRNA spacer interacts
   with a hexamer of Cas7 sub-units. We show that crRNAs with a spacer
   length reduced to 14 nucleotides cause primed adaptation, while crRNAs
   with spacer lengths of more than 20 nucleotides cause both primed
   adaptation and target interference in vivo. Shortened crRNAs assemble
   into altered-stoichiometry Cascade effector complexes containing less
   than the normal amount of Cas7 subunits. The results show that Cascade
   assembly is driven by crRNA and suggest that multisubunit type I CRISPR
   effectors may have evolved from much simpler ancestral complexes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to investigate facial expressions associated with visual
   discomfort induced by excessive screen disparities of stereoscopic
   three-dimensional (S3D) contents. For this purpose, we constructed a
   novel facial expression database regarding the visual discomfort. While
   viewing the realistic stereoscopic stimuli with screen disparities
   varying from 0 degrees to 4.66 degrees, each viewer's face was captured.
   The database consisted of face videos and associated comfort scores
   obtained by self-reporting, which might be only a publicly available
   database regarding the facial expressions associated with visual
   discomfort. Using the database, for the quantitative investigation, the
   facial expressions associated with visual discomfort were compared with
   basic emotional expressions that were well defined and universal. As a
   result, we observed that the emotional expression of ``stressed{''}
   (i.e., anger or disgust) was highly correlated with the perceived visual
   discomfort (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.91). Furthermore, the
   feasibility of the discomfort measurement using facial expressions
   obtained while viewing S3D contents was verified. Experimental results
   showed that the discomfort measurement using facial expression
   recognition could achieve a feasible performance (classification
   accuracy of 81.42\%).}},

Abstract = {{Yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (3Y-TZP) is a ceramic
   material used in indirect dental restorations. However, phase
   transformation at body temperature may compromise the material's
   mechanical properties, affecting the clinical performance of the
   restoration. The effect of mastication on 3Y-TZP aging has not been
   investigated. 3Y-TZP specimens (IPS E-max ZirCAD and Z5) were aged in
   three different modes (n = 13): no aging (control), hydrothermal aging
   (HA), or chewing simulation (CS). Mechanical properties and surface
   topography were analyzed. Analysis of variance showed that neither aging
   protocol (p = 0.692) nor material (p = 0.283) or the interaction between
   them (p = 0.216) had a significant effect on flexural strength, values
   ranged from 928.8 MPa (IPSHA) to 1,080.6 MPa (Z5HA). Nanoindentation
   analysis showed that material, aging protocol, and the interaction
   between them had a significant effect (p < 0.001) on surface hardness
   and reduced Young's modulus. The compositional analysis revealed similar
   yttrium content for all the experimental conditions (aging: p = 0.997;
   material: p = 0.248; interaction material x aging: p = 0.720). Atomic
   force microscopy showed an effect of aging protocols on phase
   transformation, with samples submitted to CS exhibiting features
   compatible with maximized phase transformation, such as increased volume
   of the material microstructure at the surface leading to an increase in
   surface roughness.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI metrics are evaluated against
   volumetric DCE-CT quantitative parameters as a standard for
   tracer-kinetic validation using a common 4-dimensional temporal dynamic
   analysis platform in tumor perfusion measurements following stereotactic
   radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases. Patients treated with SRS as
   part of Research Ethics Board-approved clinical trials underwent
   volumetric DCE-CT and DCE-MRI at baseline, then at 7 and 21 days after
   SRS. Temporal dynamic analysis was used to create 3-dimensional
   pharmacokinetic parameter maps for both modalities. Individual vascular
   input functions were selected for DCE-CT and a population function was
   used for DCE-MRI. Semiquantitative and pharmacokinetic DCE parameters
   were assessed using a modified Tofts model within each tumor at every
   time point for both modalities for characterization of perfusion and
   capillary permeability, as well as their dependency on precontrast
   relaxation times (TRs), T-10, and input function. Direct voxel-to-voxel
   Pearson analysis showed statistically significant correlations between
   CT and magnetic resonance which peaked at day 7 for Ktrans (R = 0.74, P
   <= .0001). The strongest correlation to DCE-CT measurements was found
   with DCE-MRI analysis using voxel-wise T-10 maps (R = 0.575, P < .001)
   instead of assigning a fixed T-10 value. Comparison of histogram
   features showed statistically significant correlations between

Abstract = {{A broader consensus on the number of ground motions to be used and the
   method of scaling to be adopted for nonlinear response history analysis
   (RHA) of structures is yet to be reached. Therefore, in this study, the
   effects of selection and scaling of ground motions on the response of
   seismically isolated structures, which are routinely designed using
   nonlinear RHA, are investigated. For this purpose, isolation systems
   with a range of properties subjected to bidirectional excitation are
   considered. Benchmark response of the isolation systems is established
   using large sets of unscaled ground motions systematically categorized
   into pulse-like, non-pulse-like, and mixed set of motions. Different
   subsets of seven to 14 ground motions are selected from these large sets
   using (a) random selection and (b) selection based on the best match of
   the shape of the response spectrum of ground motions to the target
   spectrum. Consequences of weighted scaling (also commonly referred to as
   amplitude scaling or linear scaling) as well as spectral matching are
   investigated. The ground motion selection and scaling procedures are
   evaluated from the viewpoint of their accuracy, efficiency, and
   consistency in predicting the benchmark response. It is confirmed that
   seven time histories are sufficient for a reliable prediction of
   isolation system displacement demands, for all ground motion subsets,
   selection and scaling procedures, and isolation systems considered. If
   ground motions are selected based on their best match to the shape of
   the target response spectrum (which should be preferred over randomly
   selected motions), weighted scaling should be used if pulse-like motions
   are considered, either of weighted scaling or spectral matching can be
   used if non-pulse-like motions are considered, and an average of
   responses from weighted-scaled and spectrum-matched ground motions
   should be used for a mixed set of motions. On the other hand, the
   importance of randomly selected motions in representing inherent
   variability of response is recognized and it is found that weighted
   scaling is more appropriate for such motions.}},

Abstract = {{Although FPGAs have grown in capacity, FPGA-based soft processors have

   memory access and memory dependence speculation (1.32xSPECint2000) and
   for the addition of a second-level cache (another 1.60x). With careful

Abstract = {{Snap-through is used to improve the efficiencies of energy harvesters
   and extend their effective frequency bandwidths. This work uses the
   Melnikov method to explore the underlying snap-through mechanism and the
   conditions necessary for homoclinic bifurcations in a magnet-induced

   energy harvester is established analytically using the Euler-Bernoulli
   beam theory and the extended Hamilton's principle. Second, the Melnikov
   function of the model is derived, and the necessary conditions for
   homoclinic bifurcations and chaos are presented on the basis of this
   model. The analysis reveals that the distance between the magnets and
   the end-block mass significantly affect the thresholds for chaotic
   motions and the high-energy solutions. Numerical and experimental
   studies confirm these analytical predictions and provide guidelines for
   optimum design of the magnet-induced buckled energy harvester. Published

Abstract = {{Vehicular safety applications require reliable and up-to-date knowledge
   of the local neighborhood. Under IEEE 802.11p, this is attained through
   single-hop broadcasts of safety beacons in the control channel. However,
   high transmission power and node mobility can cause regions of node
   density to form rapidly. In such situations, excessive load on the
   control channel must be avoided to prevent performance degradation for
   safety applications. Existing congestion control schemes aim to reach a
   fair distribution of available channel resources, but fail to account
   for the differing quality of service (QoS) requirements of vehicles in
   different driving contexts. This context depends on many factors,
   including the relative position and velocity of its neighbors. The
   problem of adapting each vehicle's transmission probability under a
   slotted p-persistent vehicular broadcast medium access control (MAC)
   protocol is formulated as a network utility maximization (NUM) problem
   which takes the driving context into account. A distributed algorithm is
   proposed to solve this problem in a decentralized manner, its
   convergence is analyzed, and its performance is evaluated through
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The epileptogenic zone (EZ) is a brain region containing the
   sources of seizure genesis. Removal of the EZ is associated with
   cessation of seizures after resective surgical procedures, as measured
   by Engel Class I score. This study describes a novel EEG
   (electroencephalography) source imaging (ESI) method which uses
   cross-frequency coupled potential signals (SCFC) derived from scalp EEG.
   Methods: Scalp EEG were recorded from ten patients (20 seizures)
   suffering from epilepsy. The SCFC were constructed from the phase and
   amplitude of the lower and higher frequency rhythms at electrographic
   seizure onset. ESI was then performed using the SCFC. Validation of the
   technique was facilitated by forward and inverse computer modeling of
   known cortical sources, and the correspondence of the ESI with EZ in
   resected regions of patients. Results: For ten seizures sampled at or
   above 500 Hz from four patients, all estimated sources lay within the
   resected region, emphasizing the clinical importance of higher sampling
   rates. The SCFC demonstrated significant advantages over the ``raw{''}
   scalp EEG, indicating its robust noise performance. Modeling
   investigations indicated that a signal-to-noise ratio above 0.2 was
   sufficient to achieve successful localization regarding EMG artifacts.
   Conclusion: The association of the estimated sources to the EZ suggests
   that cross-frequency coupling is a feature of the brain's neural
   networks, not of artifactual activity. The SCFC can effectively extract
   brain signals from a noisy background. Significance: We propose this
   approach to enhance the placement of intracranial electrode for surgical
   intervention.}},

Abstract = {{We consider streaming data transmission over a discrete memoryless
   channel. A new message is given to the encoder at the beginning of each
   block and the decoder decodes each message sequentially, after a delay
   of T blocks. In this streaming setup, we study the fundamental interplay
   between the rate and error probability in the central limit and moderate
   deviations regimes and show that: 1) in the moderate deviations regime,
   the moderate deviations constant improves over the block coding or
   non-streaming setup by a factor of T and 2) in the central limit regime,
   the second-order coding rate improves by a factor of approximately root
   T for a wide range of channel parameters. For both the regimes, we
   propose coding techniques that incorporate a joint encoding of fresh and
   previous messages. In particular, for the central limit regime, we
   propose a coding technique with truncated memory to ensure that a
   summation of constants, which arises as a result of applications of the
   central limit theorem, does not diverge in the error analysis.
   Furthermore, we explore interesting variants of the basic streaming
   setup in the moderate deviations regime. We first consider a scenario
   with an erasure option at the decoder, i.e., the decoder can output an
   erasure symbol instead of a message estimate, and show that both the
   exponents of the total error and the undetected error probabilities
   improve by factors of T. Next, by utilizing the erasure option, we show
   that the exponent of the total error probability can be improved to that
   of the undetected error probability (in the order sense) at the expense
   of a variable decoding delay.}},

Abstract = {{The state-dependent point-to-point Gaussian channel with a helper is
   first studied, in which a transmitter communicates with a receiver via a
   state-corrupted channel. The state is not known to the transmitter nor
   to the receiver, but known to a helper noncausally, which then wishes to
   assist the receiver to cancel the state. Differently from the previous
   work that characterized the capacity only in the infinite state power
   regime, this paper explores the general case with arbitrary state power.
   A lower bound on the capacity is derived based on an achievable scheme
   that integrates direct state subtraction and single-bin dirty paper
   coding. By analyzing this lower bound and further comparing it with the
   existing upper bounds, the capacity of the channel is characterized for
   a wide range of channel parameters. Such an idea of characterizing the
   capacity is further extended to study the two-user state-dependent
   multiple access channel with a helper. By comparing the derived inner
   and outer bounds, the channel parameters are partitioned into
   appropriate cases, and for each case, either segments on the capacity
   region boundary or the full capacity region are characterized.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by recent interest in physical-layer secret-key generation
   over wireless fading channels, we study the non-coherent secret-key
   generation capacity of a block-fading wireless channel with channel
   reciprocity and bi-directional (two-way) communication. We assume a
   non-coherent main channel, i.e., the realization of channel gains on the
   main channel is not known to any terminal. The eavesdropper is assumed
   to have both perfect Channel State Information of its own channel and
   orthogonal observations from the forward and backward channels. As our
   main result, we establish new upper and lower bounds on the secret-key
   generation capacity with public discussion, which are structurally
   similar. The upper bound can be expressed as a sum of three terms-one of
   the terms arises due to channel reciprocity, while the other two terms
   correspond to communication on the forward and backward channels,
   respectively. In the limit of long coherence period, the contribution
   from channel reciprocity vanishes to zero, whereas the other terms
   prevail. The lower bound is based on a separation based scheme. In each
   coherence block, we use the first symbol for training while the
   remainder of the coherence block is devoted to source emulation, i.e.,
   to generate correlated sources between the terminals. The lower bound
   expression also consists of three terms and admits an interpretation
   similar to the upper bound expression. For Rayleigh fading channels, in
   the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, the gap between the upper
   and lower bounds is shown to vanish inversely with the coherence period.
   Numerical results indicate significant performance gains over
   training-only schemes even for moderate values of SNR and small
   coherence periods.}},

Title = {{On the Optimal Fronthaul Compression and Decoding Strategies for Uplink
   Cloud Radio Access Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY}},

Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the compress-and-forward scheme for an uplink
   cloud radio access network (C-RAN) model, where multi-antenna base
   stations (BSs) are connected to a cloud-computing-based central
   processor (CP) via capacity-limited fronthaul links. The BSs compress
   the received signals with Wyner-Ziv coding and send the representation
   bits to the CP; the CP performs the decoding of all the users' messages.
   Under this setup, this paper makes progress toward the optimal structure
   of the fronthaul compression and CP decoding strategies for the
   compress-and-forward scheme in the C-RAN. On the CP decoding strategy
   design, this paper shows that under a sum fronthaul capacity constraint,
   a generalized successive decoding strategy of the quantization and user
   message codewords that allows arbitrary interleaved order at the CP
   achieves the same rate region as the optimal joint decoding.
   Furthermore, it is shown that a practical strategy of successively
   decoding the quantization codewords first, then the user messages,
   achieves the same maximum sum rate as joint decoding under individual
   fronthaul constraints. On the joint optimization of user transmission
   and BS quantization strategies, this paper shows that if the input
   distributions are assumed to be Gaussian, then under joint decoding, the
   optimal quantization scheme for maximizing the achievable rate region is
   Gaussian. Moreover, Gaussian input and Gaussian quantization with joint
   decoding achieve to within a constant gap of the capacity region of the
   Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) uplink C-RAN model.
   Finally, this paper addresses the computational aspect of optimizing
   uplink MIMO C-RAN by showing that under fixed Gaussian input, the sum
   rate maximization problem over the Gaussian quantization noise
   covariance matrices can be formulated as convex optimization problems,
   thereby facilitating its efficient solution.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of the use of third-party logistics (3PL) providers is
   noticeable. The complexity of the relationships pertinent to 3PL is
   greater than that of any traditional logistics supplier relationships.
   Moreover, they can be considered as truly strategic alliances. The use
   of the mentioned relationships to increase the flexibility of the
   organization to address the rapid changes occurring in market conditions
   has become popular while these relationships concentrate on the core
   competencies as well as the development of long-term growth strategies.
   A good number of studies have examined the selection of service
   providers. With respect to the selection of the service providers, the
   most recent studies approved the better performance of neural networks
   in comparison with the conventional methods to provide a solution for
   the real-world engineering problems, one of the sociopolitically
   inspired optimization strategies named imperialist competitive algorithm
   (ICA) is used. In order to select the 3PL, integration of the support
   vector regression (SVR) and self-adaptive ICA (SAICA) has offered a
   novel model, in which SAICA is utilized to adjust the parameters of the
   SVR. The suggested model is applied for cosmetics production. Moreover,
   the comparison of the suggested model and back-propagation neural
   networks, pure SVR, and ICA-SVR is presented. Higher estimation accuracy
   is achieved as the results of the proposed model reveal, which leads to
   the effective prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Network functions virtualization provides opportunities to design,
   deploy, and manage networking services. It utilizes cloud computing
   virtualization services that run on high-volume servers, switches, and
   storage hardware to virtualize network functions. Virtualization
   techniques can be used in IP multimedia subsystem (IMS)cloud computing
   to develop different networking functions (e.g., load balancing and call
   admission control). IMS network signaling happens through session
   initiation protocol (SIP). An open issue is the control of overload that
   occurs when an SIP server lacks sufficient CPU and memory resources to
   process all messages. This paper proposes a virtual load balanced call
   admission controller (VLB-CAC) for the cloud-hosted SIP servers. VLB-CAC
   determines the optimal ``call admission rates{''} and ``signaling
   paths{''} for admitted calls along with the optimal allocation of CPU
   and memory resources of the SIP servers. This optimal solution is
   derived through a new linear programming model. This model requires some
   critical information of SIP servers as input. Further, VLB-CAC is
   equipped with an autoscaler to overcome resource limitations. The
   proposed scheme is implemented in smart applications on virtual
   infrastructure (SAVI) which serves as a virtual testbed. An assessment
   of the numerical and experimental results demonstrates the efficiency of
   the proposed work.}},

Abstract = {{Extracellular potassium concentration, {[}K+](o), plays a fundamental
   role in the physiological functions of the brain. Studies investigating
   changes in {[}K+](o) have predominantly relied upon glass capillary
   electrodes with K+-sensitive solution gradients for their measurements.
   However, such electrodes are unsuitable for taking spatio-temporal
   measurements and are limited by the surface area of their tips. We
   illustrate seizures invoked chemically and in optogenetically modified
   mice using blue light exposure while impedimetrically measuring the
   response. A sharp decrease of 1-2 mM in {[}K+](o) before each spike has
   shown new physiological events not witnessed previously when measuring
   extracellular potassium concentrations during seizures in mice. We
   propose a novel approach that uses multichannel monolayer coated gold
   microelectrodes for in vivo spatio-temporal measurements of {[}K+](o) in
   a mouse brain as an improvement to the conventional glass capillary

Abstract = {{Characterizing project sites where gravelly alluvium is present poses
   particular challenges. Conventional field and laboratory techniques are
   significantly limited when large gravel particles either prevent their
   operation or adversely influence their measurements. The deposition of
   gravelly alluvium often involves complex, energy and sediment load
   dependent processes that can result in highly spatially variable
   deposits comprised of gravel to clay sized particles. This pervasive
   variability warrants an integrated site characterization approach
   anchored in an understanding of the geological formation processes and
   the expected controlling deformation/failure mechanisms, confirmed by
   the site investigation, simplified as part of site idealization, and
   verified during construction and long term monitoring. Systematic
   incorporation and handling of the site variability during the site
   idealization process is particularly important. Recent work at several
   gravelly alluvial sites has allowed the development of new approaches
   and techniques for improved site characterization. In particular, the
   benefit of continuous sonic sampling is demonstrated and a systematic
   method for evaluating gravel influence on SPT N values is outlined.
   Finally, an overview of the instrumented Becker Penetration Test (iBPT),
   a closed-ended, large diameter penetrometer with new direct energy
   measurement at the drill string tip is presented.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this pilot-scale study were to optimize backwash

   ozonated surface water from Lake Ontario. Performance was benchmarked in
   terms of the reduction of turbidity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC),
   disinfection by-product (DBP) precursors, and ultrafiltration foulants
   (biopolymers). Increasing the EBCT from 4 to 8 min resulted in a higher
   reduction of DOC (5\%), trihalomethane (THM4) and haloacetic acid
   (HAA(9)) precursors (similar to 12\%) without negatively impacting
   effluent turbidity (consistently below 0.4 NTU), while biopolymer
   removal remained unaffected (2\%). The impact of varying backwash
   frequency (5, 10, and 25 day intervals) was also compared for biofilters
   operated at an EBCT of 4 min. Results showed no impact of extended run
   times (up to 25 days) on DOC or DBP precursor removal; however turbidity
   removal was affected beyond 15 days of operation. Backwashing biofilters

Abstract = {{We developed a strategy that transforms phosphor down-converting white
   light sources from low power systems into efficient high-power ones. To
   incorporate multiple phosphors, we generalized and extended a phosphor
   layer model, which we term CCAMP (color correction analysis for multiple
   phosphors). CCAMP describes both the scattering and saturation of
   phosphor materials and allows modeling of different layered structures.
   We employed a phosphor mixture comprising YAG:Ce and K2TiF6:Mn4+ to
   illustrate the effectiveness of the model. YAG:Ce's high density and
   small particle size produce a large amount of scattering, while the long
   (4.8 ms) photoluminescent lifetime of K2TiF6:Mn4+ results in saturation
   at high pump power. By incorporating experimental photophysical results
   from the phosphors, we modeled our system and chose the design suitable
   for high-power applications. We report the first solid-state phosphor
   system that creates warm white light emission at powers up to 5
   kW/cm(2). Furthermore, at this high power, the system's emission
   achieves the digital cinema initiative (DCI) requirements with a
   luminescence efficacy improvement of 20\% over the stand-alone ceramic
   YAG:Ce phosphor.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We present the design and theoretical characterization of a
   magnetoplasmonic Faraday rotator for active polarization control in
   integrated plasmonics. By incorporating bismuth-substituted yttrium iron
   garnet (Bi:YIG) into a unique hybrid ridge plasmonic waveguide
   structure, we effectively overcome the phase-matching limitations
   between photonic TE and plasmonic TM modes, and hence attain efficient
   Faraday rotation within a plasmonic device. The device provides 99.4\%
   polarization conversion within a length of 830 pm, while the two modes
   exhibit propagation lengths in excess of 1 mm. This versatile optical
   building block can be operated with either a TE or TM input, making it
   ideal for polarization switching and polarization division multiplexing.
   Additionally, a buried Ag transmission line under the waveguide
   facilitates high-speed active polarization modulation by generating
   transient magnetic fields and modulating the Bi:YIG magnetization. We
   show that with these transient fields and an external static biasing
   field one can operate the device in either a pulsed-input pulsed-output
   mode, to produce a polarization switch, or a pulsed-input
   continuous-output mode, to produce a polarization oscillator. Such a
   device is shown to be capable of polarization modulation of 10 GHz and
   will be vital in realizing plasmonic circuits employing polarization
   diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Drop shape techniques for the measurement of interfacial tension are

   commonly used drop shape technique. A streamlined version of the
   development of ADSA over the past several decades is presented to
   illustrate its validity and range of utility. Several configurations of
   interest will be considered and presented systematically. Shape and
   surface tension will be linked to a shape parameter based on proper
   concepts of differential geometry. The resulting shape parameter will be
   shown to allow determination of the range of applicability of such a

Abstract = {{We consider the downlink of a two-layer heterogeneousnetwork,
   comprisingmacrocells (MCs) and small cells (SCs). The existing
   literature generally assumes independent placements of the access points
   (APs) in different layers; in contrast, we analyze a dependent placement
   where SC APs are placed at locations with poor service from the MC
   layer. Our goal is to obtain an estimate of the number of SCs required
   tomaintain a target outage rate. Such an analysis is trivial if the MCs
   are located according to a Poisson point process (PPP), which provides a
   lower bound on performance. Here, we consider MCs placed on a hexagonal
   grid, which complements the PPP model by providing an upper bound on
   performance. We first provide accurate bounds for the average
   interference within an MC when SCs are not used. Then, by obtaining the
   outage areas, we estimate the number of SCs required within an MC to
   overcome outage. If resource allocation among SCs is not used, we show
   that the problem of outage is not solved completely and that the
   residual outage area depends on whether cochannel or orthogonal SCs are
   used. Simulations show that a much smaller residual outage area is
   obtained with orthogonal SCs.}},

Abstract = {{Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a significant public health issue, and
   treatment, namely, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation, is
   very time sensitive. Public access defibrillation programs, which deploy
   automated external defibrillators (AEDs) for bystander use in an
   emergency, reduce the time to defibrillation and improve survival rates.
   In this paper, we develop models to guide the deployment of public AEDs.
   Our models generalize existing location models and incorporate
   differences in bystander behavior. We formulate three mixed integer
   nonlinear models and derive equivalent integer linear reformulations or
   easily computable bounds. We use kernel density estimation to derive a
   spatial probability distribution of cardiac arrests that is used for
   optimization and model evaluation. Using data from Toronto, Canada, we
   show that optimizing AED deployment outperforms the existing approach by
   40\% in coverage, and substantial gains can be achieved through
   relocating existing AEDs. Our results suggest that improvements in
   survival and cost-effectiveness are possible with optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Interferometric Laser Imaging for Droplet Sizing (ILIDS a.k.a. MSI or

   droplet images) this defocusing introduces a distortion that thwarts an
   accurate calibration of the two cameras and makes a successful
   registration of the two images impossible. We show that to overcome the
   obvious difficulties presented by empirical ad-hoc estimates of this
   ``center discrepancy{''} distortion, existing feature-based registration
   and/or point set registration algorithms can be used on the images to
   find the correct homography directly. This approach eliminates the need

Journal = {{SPINAL CORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1145-1151}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Automated sensor-based assessments of upper extremity (UE)
   function after cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) could provide more
   detailed tracking of individual recovery profiles than is possible with
   existing assessments, and optimize the delivery and assessment of new
   interventions. The design of reliable automated assessments requires
   identifying the key variables that need to be measured to meaningfully
   quantify UE function. An unanswered question is to what extent measures
   of sensorimotor impairment can quantitatively predict performance on
   functional tasks.
   Objective: The objective was to define the predictive value of
   impairment measures for concurrent functional task performance in
   traumatic cervical SCI, as measured by the Graded Redefined Assessment
   of Strength, Sensibility and Prehension (GRASSP).
   Setting: Retrospective analysis.
   Methods: A data set of 138 GRASSP assessments was analyzed. The Strength
   and Sensation modules were used as measures of impairment, whereas the
   concurrent Prehension Performance module was used as the surrogate
   measure of function. Classifiers were trained to predict the scores on
   each of the six individual tasks in the Prehension Performance module.
   The six scores were added to obtain a total score.
   Results: The Spearman's. between predicted and actual total Prehension
   Performance scores was 0.84. Predictions using both the Strength and
   Sensation scores were not found to be superior to predictions using the
   Strength scores alone.
   Conclusions: Measures of UE motor impairment are highly predictive of
   functional task performance after cervical SCI. Automated sensor-based
   assessments of UE motor function after SCI can rely on measuring only
   impairment and estimating functional performance accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{A 16 Gb/s 1-tap Infinite impulse response (IIR) + 1-tap discrete-time
   (DT) decision feedback equalizer (DFE) with integrated clock recovery
   and adaptation is demonstrated in 28 nm FD-SOI CMOS. Using a CMOS phase
   rotator, 0.7 unit interval (UI) high-frequency jitter tolerance is
   achieved when operating mesochronously, and over 0.4 UI operating
   plesiochronously. The half-rate architecture includes a novel 2: 1
   multiplexer to reduce delay in the IIR feedback path. With a 28 dB loss
   channel, a BER below 10-12 is measured over a 0.32 UI timing window with
   a TX swing of 0.8 Vpp-diff. Using a 2 Vpp-diff TX swing, a 30 dB loss
   channel has a measured BER below 10-12 over a 0.3 UI timing window. A
   novel edge-based algorithm adapts both IIR and DT equalizer coefficients
   using the same high-speed circuitry and signals required for clock
   recovery. The algorithm utilizes all transitions to inform the
   adaptation of all equalizer coefficients, thereby providing faster
   convergence than previously-reported algorithms which await specific
   patterns. Moreover, the adaptation freezes automatically unless a
   diverse set of data patterns is received, thereby making the algorithm
   robust in the presence of poorly-conditioned data. The adaptive DFE
   converges within 5 mu s.}},

Abstract = {{The electrochemical reduction of CO2 into renewable chemical products
   such as formic acid is an important and challenging goal. Traditional Pd
   catalysts suffer from CO poisoning, which leads to current density decay
   and short operating lifetimes. Here we explored the ability to control
   Pd nanoparticle surface morphology to amplify catalytic activity and
   increase stability in the electroreduction of CO2 to formate. Through
   computational studies we have elucidated trends in intermediate binding
   which govern the selectivity and catalytic activity. We then rationally
   synthesized Pd nanoparticles having an abundance of high index surfaces
   to maximize electrocatalytic performance. This catalyst displays a
   record current density of 22 mA/cm(2) at a low overpotential of -0.2 V
   with a Faradaic efficiency of 97\%, outperforming all previous Pd
   catalysts in formate electrosynthesis. The findings presented in this
   work provide rational design principles which highlight morphological
   control of high-index surfaces for the effective and stable catalytic
   electroreduction of CO2 to liquid fuels.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we developed a green and efficient process for the
   recovery of rare earths from waste cathode ray tube phosphors. The
   mixture of hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide was identified as the
   most suitable leaching agent due to the synergistic effect. The effects
   of various parameters on leaching process were explored, and the optimal
   conditions with stirring speed 600 rpm, temperature 313 K, 1 M of H2O2 4
   M of HCl, and leaching time of 90 min were determined. Furthermore, a
   possible reaction mechanism was proposed, and the kinetics for the
   leaching process was investigated in detail. The leaching process was
   found to follow a shirking-core model, with the chemical reaction as the
   rate-controlling step. The apparent activation energy of the reaction
   was calculated as 52.3 kJ/mol, and the reaction orders for H2O2 and HCl
   were established as 0.82 and 2.13, respectively. The kinetic equation
   was established. Moreover, the optimal leaching conditions were applied
   to the waste phosphors, and the oxalate precipitation process was
   employed, achieving the recovery rate of rare earths >99.5\%. After
   calcining, a well crystallized (Y0.95Eu0.05)(2)O-3 product with a purity
   of 99\% was obtained with an average diameter of 5 mu m.}},

Abstract = {{This study is focused on identifying the candidature of timothy grass as
   an energy crop for hydrogen-rich syngas production through supercritical
   water gasification. Timothy grass was gasified in supercritical water to
   investigate the impacts of temperature (450-650 degrees C),
   biomass-to-water ratio (1:4 and 1:8) and reaction time (15-45 min) in
   the pressure range of 23-25 MPa. The impacts of carbonate catalysts
   (e.g., Na2CO3 and K2CO3) and hydroxide catalysts (e.g., NaOH and KOH) at
   variable mass fractions (1-3\%) were examined to maximize hydrogen
   yields. In the non-catalytic gasification of timothy grass, highest
   hydrogen (5.15 mol kg(-1)) and total gas yields (17.2 mol kg(-1)) with
   greater carbon gasification efficiency (33\%) and lower heating value
   (2.21 MJ m(-3)) of the gas products were obtained at 650 degrees C with
   1:8 biomass-to-water ratio for 45 min. However, KOH at 3\% mass fraction
   maximized hydrogen and total gas yields up to 8.91 and 30.6 mol kg(-1),
   respectively. Nevertheless, NaOH demonstrated highest carbon
   gasification efficiency (613\%) and enhanced lower heating value of the
   gas products (4.68 MJ m(-3)). Timothy grass biochars were characterized
   through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and
   scanning electron microscopy to understand the behavior of the feedstock
   to rising temperature and reaction time. The overall findings suggest
   that timothy grass is a promising feedstock for hydrogen production via
   supercritical water gasification. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective. Assess the modulating effect of matrix metalloproteinase
   (MMP) inhibition on simulated human salivary enzyme (SHSE)-catalyzed
   degradation of interfacial fracture toughness (FT) of self-etched and
   total-etched resin-dentin interfaces.
   Methods. Miniature short-rod FT specimens (N=10/group) containing a
   resin composite bonded to human dentin, using a self-etch (Easy Bond,
   EB) or a total-etch (Scotchbond, SB) adhesives, were prepared with and
   without application of an MMP inhibitor (galardin). Specimens were
   non-incubated or incubated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or SHSE
   for 7, 30, 90, or 180-days. FT data were obtained using a universal
   testing machine. Incubation media were analyzed by high performance
   liquid chromatography (HPLC) for the presence of a 2,2-bis
   -{[}4-2(2-hydroxy-3-methacryloxypropoxy)phenyl]-propane (bisGMA)-derived
   degradation product, bis-hydroxy-propoxy-phenyl-propane (bisHPPP).
   Fractographic analysis was performed by scanning electron microscopy and
   image processing software (ImageJ). Statistical analysis was performed
   by ANOVA and Tukey's (p<0.05).
   Results. More bisHPPP was detected in SHSE vs. PBS for both adhesive
   systems (p<0.05). EB specimens yielded no difference in FT and failed
   preferentially in the resin after >30 days (p<0.05). SB specimens
   yielded lower FT values after 180-days with SHSE Igalardin vs.
   0-days/no-galardin (p<0.05) and failed preferentially in the
   hybrid-layer after >30-days (p<0.05). Galardin mildly modulated the
   change in fracture mode for both systems.
   Significance. Esterase-catalyzed degradation of total-etch interfaces is
   modulated by MMP-inhibition, however, self-etch interfaces possess
   greater biostability under simulated intra-oral conditions, regardless
   of MMP inhibition. This could be related to different chemical
   compositions and/or mode of adhesion. (C) 2016 The Academy of Dental

Abstract = {{The behavior and formation mechanisms of inclusions in Ti-stabilized,
   17Cr Austenitic Stainless Steel produced by the ingot casting route were
   investigated through systematic sampling of liquid steel and rolled
   products. Analysis methods included total oxygen and nitrogen contents,
   optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy. The results indicate that the composition of
   inclusions was strongly dependent on the types of added alloying agents.
   During the AOD refining process, after the addition of ferrosilicon
   alloy and electrolytic manganese, followed by aluminum, the composition
   of inclusions changed from manganese silicate-rich inclusions to
   alumina-rich inclusions. After tapping and titanium wire feeding, pure
   TiN particles and complex inclusions with Al2O3-MgO-TiOx cores
   containing TiN were found to be the dominant inclusions when {[}pct Ti]
   was 0.307 mass pct in the molten steel. These findings were confirmed by
   thermodynamic calculations which indicated that there was a driving
   force for TiN inclusions to be formed in the liquid phase due to the
   high contents of {[}Ti] and {[}N] in the molten steel. From the start of
   casting through to the rolled bar, there was no further change in the
   composition of inclusions compared to the titanium addition stage.
   Stringer-shaped TiN inclusions were observed in the rolled bar. These
   inclusions were elongated along the rolling direction with lengths
   varying from 17 to 84 mu m and could have a detrimental impact on the
   corrosion resistance as well as the mechanical properties of the
   stainless steel products. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials Society

Abstract = {{Full-face helmets are designed to protect against head and face injuries
   during downhill and free-ride mountain biking. This study assessed
   whether multiple impacts and helmet type are related to the protective
   properties of full-face helmets. A drop tower fitted with a helmeted
   headform simulated impacts to the chin following a forwards fall. Four
   models of full-face mountain biking helmets were tested. Three repeated
   trials were completed for each helmet at four impact velocities. Outcome
   variables included head injury criterion score, peak force, and peak
   acceleration. Peak accelerations for all trials were below the 300g
   pass/fail criterion used in some testing standards. Multiple impacts
   reduced helmet protective properties, most noticeably at the higher
   impact velocities (increases in impact severity measures ranging from
   11\% to 22\% for low and 17\% to 49\% for higher impact velocities).
   However, the effects of multiple impacts were smaller than the
   differences observed across individual helmet types. Helmet protective
   properties were associated with local chin bar characteristics, most
   notably chin bar length at higher impact velocities. Towards the goal of
   reducing overall head/brain injury risk in cyclists, there may be value
   in complimentary messaging about the importance of repeated impacts and
   helmet type on the protective properties of downhill mountain biking
   helmets.}},

Title = {{Vehicle attribute trade-offs to meet the 2025 CAFE fuel economy target}},

Abstract = {{The literature analyzes changes in vehicle attributes that can improve
   fuel economy to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.
   However, these analyses exclude either vehicle price, size, acceleration
   or technology advancement. A more comprehensive examination of the
   trade-offs among these attributes is needed, this case study focuses on
   technically feasible modifications to a reference 2012 vehicle to meet
   the 2025 fuel economy target. Scenarios developed to examine uncertainty
   in technology advancement indicate that expected technology cost
   reductions over time will be insufficient to offset the costs of
   additional fuel efficiency technologies that could be used to meet the
   2025 fuel economy target while maintaining other vehicle attributes. The
   mid-price scenario results show the targeted 66\% increase in fuel
   economy from 2012 to 2025 can be achieved with (i) a 10\% (\$2070)
   vehicle price increase (lightweight hybrid electric vehicle), (ii) a
   31\% (2.9 second) increase in the 0-97 km/h (60 mph) acceleration time
   (smaller engine), or (iii) a 17\% (700 L) decrease in interior volume
   (smaller body) while maintaining other vehicle attributes. These results
   are consistent with those obtained using methods that generalize the US
   light-duty vehicle fleet, but are not a forecast of future vehicle
   attributes because combinations of less perceptible changes to vehicle
   price, acceleration and size would also be feasible. This study shows
   there are numerous ways that 2025 fuel economy targets can be met;
   therefore, the trade-offs quantified provide important insights on the
   implications of future CAFE standards. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Today cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are surviving longer but ultimately
   the lung disease will progress despite new treatments. Lung
   transplantation, a life saving procedure, initially was not offered to
   CF patients due to their infectious complications and complications
   related to their multisystem disease. After the first CF patients were
   transplanted it appeared clear that CF patients had excellent outcomes.
   Infectious complications with multi-resistant bacteria are still a
   challenge for some patients which shortens survival in some cases.
   Better understanding and management of their unique extra pulmonary
   complications including other organ transplants have opened new horizons
   in the life of CF patients. Increasing number of CF patients are
   surviving longer pre and post transplant. Without doubt we will continue
   to learn as they present with new challenges and conditions unique to
   their disease. We reviewed the evolution and current status of the main
   aspects of lung transplant for CF patients.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of a socially assistive robot is to create a close and
   effective interaction with a human user for the purpose of giving
   assistance. In particular, the social interaction, guidance, and support
   that a socially assistive robot can provide a person can be very
   beneficial to patient-centered care. However, there are a number of
   research issues that need to be addressed in order to design such
   robots. This paper focuses on developing effective emotion-based
   assistive behavior for a socially assistive robot intended for natural
   human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios with explicit social and
   assistive task functionalities. In particular, in this paper, a unique
   emotional behavior module is presented and implemented in a
   learning-based control architecture for assistive HRI. The module is
   utilized to determine the appropriate emotions of the robot to display,
   as motivated by the well-being of the person, during assistive
   task-driven interactions in order to elicit suitable actions from users
   to accomplish a given person-centered assistive task. A novel online
   updating technique is used in order to allow the emotional model to
   adapt to new people and scenarios. Experiments presented show the
   effectiveness of utilizing robotic emotional assistive behavior during
   HRI scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we have explored various ultrasound treatment conditions
   for structural modification of enzymatic hydrolysis lignin (EHL) for
   enhanced chemical reactivity. The key structural modifications were
   characterized by using a combination of analytical methods, including,
   Fourier Transform-Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Proton Nuclear Magnetic
   Resonance (H-1 NMR), Gel permeation chromatography (GPC), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Folin-Ciocalteu (F-C) method.
   Chemical reactivity of the modified EHL samples was determined by both
   1,1-dipheny1-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity
   and their reactivity towards formaldehyde. It was observed that the
   modified EHL had a higher phenolic hydroxyl group content, a lower
   molecular weight, a higher reactivity towards formaldehyde, and a
   greater antioxidant property. The higher reactivity demonstrated by the
   samples after treatment suggesting that ultrasound is a promising method
   for modifying enzymatic hydrolysis lignin for value-added applications.

Abstract = {{Focusing on rehabilitation goals is an effective approach for improving
   function in individuals with spasticity after stroke. The objectives of
   this study were to examine and map goals of post-stroke individuals with
   spasticity using the Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) and International
   Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), and to
   evaluate the impact of botulinum toxin A (BoNTA) on occupational
   performance based on the type of rehabilitation goals. Thirty-one
   patients were recruited from an outpatient spasticity management clinic.
   Each patient set one goal, was injected with BoNTA in their spastic
   upper limb muscles and received standard rehabilitation services twice a
   week for four weeks. Twenty-seven participants achieved the expected
   level, and four exceeded the expected level of their rehabilitation
   goals. Fifty-five percent of the goals were related to
   Activity/Participation, and 45\% of the goals were categorized in the
   Body Structures and Function domain of the ICF. Fifteen goals focused on
   positioning, while 16 goals focused on (independent) activities of daily
   living (ADL/IADL). Both the positioning and ADL/IADL groups experienced
   a reduction in MAS following the administration of BoNTA. The
   positioning group was older and more impaired. Mapping goals to ICF
   identifies specific targets for intervention, establishes a common
   language within the interdisciplinary team and contextualizes the ways
   disability impacts goals. This study is limited by a relatively small
   sample size and absence of a functional measure. Further studies can
   explore the development of goal/item banks to advance the use of GAS for

Abstract = {{Congestion pricing is one of the widely contemplated methods to manage
   traffic congestion. The purpose of congestion pricing is to manage
   traffic demand generation and supply allocation by charging fees (i.e.,
   tolling) for the use of certain roads in order to distribute traffic
   demand more evenly over time and space. This study presents a framework
   for large-scale variable congestion pricing policy determination and
   evaluation. The proposed framework integrates departure time choice and
   route choice models within a regional dynamic traffic assignment (DTA)
   simulation environment. The framework addresses the impact of tolling
   on: (1) road traffic congestion (supply side), and (2) travelers' choice
   dimensions including departure time and route choices (demand side). The
   framework is applied to a simulation-based case study of tolling a major
   freeway in Toronto while capturing the regional effects across the
   Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The models are developed and calibrated
   using regional household travel survey data that reflect the
   heterogeneity of travelers' attributes. The DTA model is calibrated
   using actual traffic counts from the Ontario Ministry of Transportation
   and the City of Toronto. The case study examined two tolling scenarios:
   flat and variable tolling. The results indicate that: (1) more benefits
   are attained from variable pricing, that mirrors temporal congestion
   patterns, due to departure time rescheduling as opposed to predominantly
   re-routing only in the case of flat tolling, (2) widespread spatial and
   temporal re-distributions of traffic demand are observed across the
   regional network in response to tolling a significant, yet relatively
   short, expressway serving Downtown Toronto, and (3) flat tolling causes
   major and counterproductive rerouting patterns during peak hours, which
   was observed to block access to the tolled facility itself. (C) 2016

Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{259-269}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the distributed resource allocation optimization problem
   is investigated. The allocation decisions are made to minimize the sum
   of all the agents' local objective functions while satisfying both the
   global network resource constraint and the local allocation feasibility
   constraints. Here the data corresponding to each agent in this separable
   optimization problem, such as the network resources, the local
   allocation feasibility constraint, and the local objective function, is
   only accessible to individual agent and cannot be shared with others,
   which renders new challenges in this distributed optimization problem.
   Based on either projection or differentiated projection, two classes of
   continuous time algorithms are proposed to solve this distributed
   optimization problem in an initialization-free and scalable manner.
   Thus, no re-initialization is required even if the operation environment
   or network configuration is changed, making it possible to achieve a
   ``plug-and-play{''} optimal operation of networked heterogeneous agents.
   The algorithm convergence is guaranteed for strictly convex objective
   functions, and the exponential convergence is proved for strongly convex
   functions without local constraints. Then the proposed algorithm is
   applied to the distributed economic dispatch problem in power grids, to
   demonstrate how it can achieve the global optimum in a scalable way,
   even when the generation cost, or system load, or network configuration,
   is changing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing demand for some critical rare earth elements (REEs),
   which are crucial in the production of green and technologically
   advanced products, has sparked the development of novel processes to
   recover REEs from secondary resources, such as mine tailings,
   metallurgical slags, and phosphogypsum. These resources have low
   concentration of REEs, but are available in large volumes. Phosphogypsum
   (PG) is the main by-product of the production of phosphoric acid by
   sulphuric acid digestion of phosphate rock. The current study put the
   emphasis on the thorough characterization of phosphogypsum as well as
   investigation of the kinetics of the leaching process. The results show
   the leaching efficiency is controlled by the solubility limit of PG.
   Chemical modelling indicated that the systems are at the saturation
   level with respect to Ca. The instantaneous and saturation
   concentrations of Ca were used to model the dissolution kinetics. The
   apparent activation energy was determined to be 10.4 kJ/mol.
   Furthermore; systematic leaching processes using three acids under
   various operating conditions were performed. The results indicate the
   optimal operation conditions are 1.5 M, 80 degrees C and solid-to-liquid
   ratio (S/L) of 1/8 and 20 min residence time for all three acid, but the
   leaching efficiency using nitric and hydrochloric acids are higher than
   the sulfuric acid. This novel work investigates the feasibility of acid
   leaching of REEs from PG from both theoretical and practical
   standpoints. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial noise (AN) transmission can enhance the secrecy in
   multiantenna wireless channels by superimposing judiciously constructed
   synthetic noise signals over information signals during transmission.
   Motivated by the large-scale multiple-input multiple-output systems, we
   study AN transmission under a constraint that all elements (weights) in
   each beamforming vector must have a constant magnitude, but can have
   arbitrary phases. For the special case of one AN beamforming vector and
   one legitimate receiver, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition
   for finding a beamforming vector in the null space of the legitimate
   receiver's channel and provide a geometric interpretation. For the
   independent identically distributed Rayleigh fading channel, we derive
   an approximate expression for the probability of failing to find such a
   beamforming vector, and show that it decreases exponentially in the
   square of the number of transmit antennas. For the general case, we
   propose a numerical algorithm for obtaining a set of mutually orthogonal
   AN beamforming vectors in the null space of all the receivers. Our
   approach involves reducing the problem to an unconstrained nonlinear
   programming problem, which is then solved using the Gauss-Newton method.
   We show numerically that our proposed algorithm performs significantly
   better than a heuristic relaxation approach. Finally, for a multiantenna
   system with multiple RF chains, we show numerically that the secrecy
   rate achieved by our proposed approach is close to that achieved by the
   AN transmission with unconstrained beamforming, when the number of
   transmit antennas is sufficiently large.}},

Abstract = {{The microorganisms present in retail environments have not been studied
   in detail despite the fact that these environments represent a
   potentially important location for exposure. In this study, HVAC filter
   dust samples in 13 US retail stores were collected and analyzed via
   pyrosequencing to characterize the indoor bacterial communities and to
   explore potential relationships between these communities and building
   and environmental parameters. Although retail stores contained a diverse
   bacterial community of 788 unique genera, over half of the nearly 118K
   sequences were attributed to the Proteobacteria phylum. Streptophyta,
   Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter were the most
   prevalent genera detected. The recovered indoor airborne microbial
   community was statistically associated with both human oral and skin
   microbiota, indicating occupants are important contributors, despite a
   relatively low occupant density per unit volume in retail stores.
   Bacteria generally associated with outdoor environments were present in
   the indoor communities with no obvious association with air exchange
   rate, even when considering relative abundance. No significant
   association was observed between the indoor bacterial community
   recovered and store location, store type, or season. However, predictive
   functional gene profiling showed significant associations between the
   indoor community and season. The microbiome recovered from multiple
   samples collected months apart from the same building varied
   significantly indicating that caution is warranted when trying to
   characterize the bacterial community with a single sampling event.}},

Abstract = {{The biologically relevant characteristics of particulate matter (PM) in

   and was found to be lower inside (mean +/- s.e.=1.59 +/- 0.33nmol/m(3))
   than outside (2.35 +/- 0.57nmol/m(3)). Indoor particulate ROS
   concentrations were substantial and a major fraction of indoor
   particulate ROS existed on PM2.5 (58 +/- 10\%), which is important from
   a health perspective as PM2.5 can carry ROS deep into the lungs. No
   obvious relationships were evident between selected building
   characteristics and indoor particulate ROS concentrations, but this
   observation would need to be verified by larger, controlled studies.
   Controlled experiments conducted at a test house suggest that indoor
   ozone and terpene concentrations substantially influence indoor
   particulate ROS concentrations when outdoor ozone concentrations are
   low, but have a weaker influence on indoor particulate ROS
   concentrations when outdoor ozone concentrations are high. The
   combination of substantial indoor concentrations and the time spent

Abstract = {{Objective. Brain-computer interface (BCI) performance is sensitive to
   short-term changes in psychological states such as fatigue, frustration,
   and attention. This paper explores the design of a BCI that can adapt to
   these short-term changes. Approach. Eleven able-bodied individuals
   participated in a study during which they used a mental task-based
   EEG-BCI to play a simple maze navigation game while self-reporting their
   perceived levels of fatigue, frustration, and attention. In an offline
   analysis, a regression algorithm was trained to predict changes in these
   states, yielding Pearson correlation coefficients in excess of 0.45
   between the self-reported and predicted states. Two means of fusing the
   resultant mental state predictions with mental task classification were
   investigated. First, single-trial mental state predictions were used to
   predict correct classification by the BCI during each trial. Second, an
   adaptive BCI was designed that retrained a new classifier for each
   testing sample using only those training samples for which predicted
   mental state was similar to that predicted for the current testing
   sample. Main results. Mental state-based prediction of BCI reliability
   exceeded chance levels. The adaptive BCI exhibited significant, but
   practically modest, increases in classification accuracy for five of 11
   participants and no significant difference for the remaining six despite
   a smaller average training set size. Significance. Collectively, these
   findings indicate that adaptation to psychological state may allow the
   design of more accurate BCIs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel quantum homomorphic signature scheme based solely
   on Bell-state measurement is proposed. It allows an aggregator to merge
   two signature nodes' signatures of their classical messages into one
   signature, which is an effective approach to identity authentication for
   multiple streams to enhance the security of quantum networks. And it is
   easy to generalize this scheme to multiple nodes. Bell-state measurement
   has been realized by using only linear optical elements in many
   experimental measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution
   schemes, which makes us believe that our scheme can be realized in the
   near future. It is shown that our scheme is a quantum group homomorphic
   signature scheme and is secure by the scheme analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Time-dependent variational inequality-based formulations describing the
   behavior of elastodynamic contact problems have been used to model the
   soft docking of micro/nano paired-satellites. The solution strategy is
   based upon the iterative use of two subproblems. In the first
   subproblem, the technique of Quadratic Programming was used to predict
   the contact surface and the stresses acting on it. In the second
   subproblem, the technique of Lagrange multipliers was used to impose the
   boundary conditions and contact constraint obtained in step I. The
   solution accounts for the effect of friction through the use of an
   appropriate regularization technique in the virtual work expressions.
   The accuracy of the proposed variational inequality (VI) model of the
   soft docking process is validated by comparing the VI results with
   commercially available software. Finally, the effects of the bending
   stiffness of the docking probe, the friction between the candidate
   contact surfaces are investigated and analyzed using the newly developed
   model.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the model and design of a novel hybrid piezoelectric
   actuator which provides high active and passive performances for smart
   structural systems. The actuator is composed of a pair of curved
   pre-stressed piezoelectric actuators, so-called commercially THUNDER
   actuators, installed opposite each other using two clamping mechanisms
   constructed of in-plane fixable hinges, grippers and solid links. A
   fully mathematical model is developed to describe the active and passive
   dynamics of the actuator and investigate the effects of its geometrical
   parameters on the dynamic stiffness, free displacement and blocked force
   properties. Among the literature that deals with piezoelectric actuators
   in which THUNDER elements are used as a source of electromechanical
   power, the proposed study is unique in that it presents a mathematical
   model that has the ability to predict the actuator characteristics and
   achieve other phenomena, such as resonances, mode shapes, phase shifts,
   dips, etc. For model validation, the measurements of the free dynamic
   response per unit voltage and passive acceleration transmissibility of a
   particular actuator design are used to check the accuracy of the results
   predicted by the model. The results reveal that there is a good
   agreement between the model and experiment. Another experiment is
   performed to teste the linearity of the actuator system by examining the
   variation of the output dynamic responses with varying forces and
   voltages at different frequencies. From the results, it can be concluded
   that the actuator acts approximately as a linear system at frequencies
   up to 1000 Hz. A parametric study is achieved here by applying the
   developed model to analyze the influence of the geometrical parameters
   of the fixable hinges on the active and passive actuator properties. The
   model predictions in the frequency range of 0-1000 Hz show that the
   hinge thickness, radius, and opening angle parameters have great effects
   on the frequency dynamic responses, passive isolation characteristics
   and the locations of their peaks and dips. Furthermore, the output
   actuating force can be improved by increasing the hinge hardness, which
   is controlled by its dimensions, although increasing the hinge hardness
   may cause a decrease in the free displacement and passive insulation
   performance, particularly at low frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo investigate the feasibility of high-sensitivity cellular MRI
   of embryonic stem (ES) cells using a novel cell permeable and cell
   retentive T-1 contrast agent.
   Materials and MethodsMouse ES cells were labeled with a novel manganese
   porphyrin contrast agent, MnAMP, at 0.1mM over 2 to 24h and retained in
   contrast-free medium for up to 24h postlabeling. MRI was performed on a
   3 Tesla clinical scanner; T-1 and T-2 relaxation times were measured.
   Quantification of manganese content was performed using atomic
   absorption spectroscopy. Viability and proliferation assays were done
   for the longest labeling interval. Differentiation capacity was assessed
   using the hanging drop method to direct differentiation toward
   cardiomyocytes.
   ResultsMnAMP-labeled ES cells exhibited over a fourfold decrease in T-1
   compared with unlabeled cells, and maintained up to a threefold decrease
   24h postlabeling. Viability and proliferation were not affected. Most
   importantly, labeled ES cells differentiated into functional
   cardiomyocytes that exhibited normal contractility patterns.
   ConclusionMnAMP-based cellular MRI is a very high sensitivity T-1
   approach for cellular imaging. It has the potential for noninvasive in
   vivo monitoring of stem cell therapy in cardiac regeneration and other
   tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. J. Magn.

Abstract = {{Air can be entrapped in water and wastewater systems under a variety of
   conditions, and if such air is not managed properly, it can impose
   considerable operational penalties. To avoid these problems and the
   dangers associated with air pockets, several air management strategies
   have been routinely suggested. However, the devastating consequences of
   air pockets frequently documented in the literature imply the need for
   further development in this area. Improving air management obviously
   requires a thorough understanding of the current strategies and their
   shortcomings. This paper overviews the sources of air in pipes and key
   consequences associated with its presence. Current measures for managing
   air in water pipes are reviewed and critiqued. Finally, knowledge gaps
   that limit the efficient application of current air management
   strategies to real world problems are identified, and suggestions for
   future development are presented. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{A photo-thermo-mechanical non-destructive inspection methodology was
   developed theoretically and experimentally for non-contact,
   non-destructive evaluation of mechanical stress-strain relations in
   metallic materials. A one-dimensional thermal-wave model modified to
   include mechanical stress explicitly was used to fit experimental data
   from both frequency scan and stress scan tests and determine the thermal
   effusivity and diffusivity of an aerospace-industry-relevant aluminum
   6061 alloy. Within the elastic regime the thermal conductivity values
   measured from both photothermal radiometry (PTR) amplitude and phase
   showed very good agreement, thereby establishing the self-consistency of
   the new photo-thermo-mechanical radiometry (PTMR) method. Furthermore, a
   linear conductivity-stress dependence was found, thus establishing the
   dominant role this property plays in the ability of PTMR to monitor
   mechanical changes in the aluminum alloy. It was demonstrated that PTMR
   can be used as a non-contact ``strain gauge{''} within and far beyond
   the operational strain range of commercial strain gauges, up to the
   fracture point. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Freezing aluminum alloys in vacuum conditions could be an effective
   method to improve its chemical composition. Aluminum has a lower vapour

   elemental evaporation rate constants in the freezing Al-Si-Cu system.
   The highest evaporations were measured for Hg, Zn and Pb while no
   elemental losses for Si, Cu or Ni were recorded for temperatures below
   760 degrees C. Notwithstanding the known positive effect on mechanical
   properties, freezing aluminum based mixtures from 760 degrees C in
   near-vacuum conditions can significantly reduce concentrations of most

Abstract = {{A new class of modular multilevel dc/dc converters has recently emerged
   that eliminates the traditional full-rated intermediate ac stage
   inherent to two-stage dc/dc converter structures, that is, two cascaded
   dc/ac modular multilevel converters ( MMCs). This paper introduces the
   first averaged dynamic state-space model for this new class of
   single-stage dc/dc converter, called the DC-MMC, which captures all
   input and output terminal dynamics as well as internal capacitor
   dynamics. Based on the developed analytical model, a dynamic phasor
   model is derived to accommodate the multifrequency components that exist
   at steady state. The phasor model enables: 1) solving for the full
   steady-state solution of the DC-MMC under arbitrary loading and 2)
   evaluation of DC-MMC open-loop stability via eigenvalue analysis. These
   analyses are not possible with existing DC-MMC models. Simulations of a
   comprehensive switched model verify the accuracy of the presented
   analytical models, which represent valuable study tools for the analysis
   of emerging modular multilevel dc/dc converters containing multiple
   frequency components.}},

Title = {{Inclusion of Wire Twisting Effects in Cable Impedance Calculations}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2520-2529}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Cable-series impedance modeling is widely applied in electromagnetic
   transients simulations and power-loss calculations. The calculations are
   usually performed in a 2-D frame using the finite-element method or
   alternative approaches, such as MoM-SO, thereby losing the 3-D effects
   imposed by twisting wire screens and armors. One of the implications of
   using 2-D modeling for three-core and closely packed single-core cables
   is that currents will always circulate among the individual wires of
   each wire screen or armor. However, in the case of twisted
   screens/armors where the wires are insulated from each other, such
   current circulation will in reality not exist. As a result, the
   calculated impedances become incorrect as well as the induced currents
   and losses on individual conductors. A procedure is introduced for
   preventing such false current circulations in a 2-D calculation frame by
   simple manipulation of the system impedance matrix. The approach is
   demonstrated for the modeling of single-core and three-core cables, with
   and without external armor. It is shown that the representation of the
   wire screen/armor armor with respect to current circulations can
   substantially influence the calculated result, both for the 50/60 Hz
   impedance and the cable transient behavior. The use of tubular screen
   representations is also investigated.}},

Title = {{Development of TRACER: tissue roll for analysis of cellular environment
   and response}},
Journal = {{BIOFABRICATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The tumour microenvironment is heterogeneous and consists of multiple
   cell types, variable extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, and
   contains cell-defined gradients of small molecules, oxygen, nutrients
   and waste. Emerging in vitro cell culture systems that attempt to
   replicate these features often fail to incorporate design strategies to
   facilitate efficient data collection and stratification. The tissue roll
   for analysis of cellular environment and response (TRACER) is a novel
   strategy to assemble layered, three-dimensional tumours with
   cell-defined, graded heterogeneous microenvironments that also
   facilitates cellular separation and stratification of data from
   different cell populations from specific microenvironments. Here we
   describe the materials selection and development of TRACER. We find that
   cellulose fibre scaffolding is an ideal support to generate tissue
   constructs having homogenous cell seeding and consistent properties. We
   explore ECM remodeling and long-term cell growth in the scaffold, and
   characterize the tumour microenvironment in assembled TRACERs using
   multiple established analysis methods. Finally, we confirm that TRACERs
   replicate small molecule gradients of glucose and lactate, and explore
   cell phenotype associated with these gradients using confocal
   microscopy, flow cytometry, and quantitative PCR analysis. We envision
   this technology will provide a platform to create complex, yet
   controlled tumour microenvironments that can be easily disassembled for
   snapshot analysis of cell phenotype and response to therapy in relation
   to microenvironment properties.}},

Title = {{A pipeline of spatio-temporal filtering for predicting the laterality of
   self-initiated fine movements from single trial readiness potentials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. In recent years, the readiness potential (RP), a type of
   pre-movement neural activity, has been investigated for asynchronous
   electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Since
   the RP is attenuated for involuntary movements, a BCI driven by RP alone
   could facilitate intentional control amid a plethora of unintentional
   movements. Previous studies have attempted single trial classification
   of RP via spatial and temporal filtering methods, or by combining the RP
   with event-related desynchronization. However, RP feature extraction
   remains challenging due to the slow non-oscillatory nature of the
   potential, its variability among participants and the inherent noise in
   EEG signals. Here, we propose a participant-specific, individually
   optimized pipeline of spatio-temporal filtering (PSTF) to improve RP
   feature extraction for laterality prediction. Approach. PSTF applies
   band-pass filtering on RP signals, followed by Fisher criterion spatial
   filtering to maximize class separation, and finally temporal window
   averaging for feature dimension reduction. Optimal parameters are
   simultaneously found by cross-validation for each participant. Using EEG
   data from 14 participants performing self-initiated left or right key
   presses as well as two benchmark BCI datasets, we compared the
   performance of PSTF to two popular methods: common spatial subspace
   decomposition, and adaptive spatio-temporal filtering. Main results. On
   the BCI benchmark data sets, PSTF performed comparably to both existing
   methods. With the key press EEG data, PSTF extracted more discriminative
   features, thereby leading to more accurate (74.99\% average accuracy)
   predictions of RP laterality than that achievable with existing methods.
   Significance. Naturalistic and volitional interaction with the world is
   an important capacity that is lost with traditional system-paced BCIs.
   We demonstrated a significant improvement in fine movement laterality
   prediction from RP features alone. Our work supports further study of
   RP-based BCI for intuitive asynchronous control of the environment, such
   as augmentative communication or wheelchair navigation.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A vast array of two-dimensional (2D) graphene allotropes have been
   reported to possess remarkable electronic, thermal, and magnetic
   properties. However, our understanding of their structure-mechanical
   property relationship is far from complete. In this study, we performed
   extensive density functional theory calculations to evaluate the
   mechanical properties of 11 different graphene allotropes, comprising
   structures with solely sp(2) hybridized bonds and both sp and sp(2)
   hybridized bonds. A complete set of nonlinear anisotropic elastic
   constants up to the fifth order are determined for these structures.
   Energetics of the deformation of these allotropes have been analyzed to
   mathematically establish a relationship between the sum of the second
   order nonlinear elastic constants and the area density. Empirical
   relationships have been obtained for predicting theYoung's moduli,
   Poisson's ratios and the ultimate tensile strengths (UTS) of the
   allotropes using their area densities and the sizes of the carbon rings.
   Furthermore, comparison with traditional engineering materials reveals
   that 2D graphene allotropes expand the available material-property space
   by occupying a new region with both high Young's modulus and a high UTS,
   as well as a high UTS and low density. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The objective of a continuous authentication system is to continuously
   monitor the identity of subjects using biometric systems. In this paper,
   we proposed a novel feature extraction and a unique continuous
   authentication strategy and technique. We proposed One-Dimensional
   Multi-Resolution Local Binary Patterns (1DMRLBP), an online feature
   extraction for one-dimensional signals. We also proposed a continuous
   authentication system, which uses sequential sampling and 1DMRLBP
   feature extraction. This system adaptively updates decision thresholds
   and sample size during run-time. Unlike most other local binary patterns
   variants, 1DMRLBP accounts for observations' temporal changes and has a
   mechanism to extract one feature vector that represents multiple
   observations. 1DMRLBP also accounts for quantization error, tolerates
   noise, and extracts local and global signal morphology. This paper
   examined electrocardiogram signals. When 1DMRLBP was applied on the
   University of Toronto database (UofTDB) 1,012 single session subjects
   database, an equal error rate (EER) of 7.89\% was achieved in comparison
   to 12.30\% from a state-of-the-art work. Also, an EER of 10.10\% was
   resulted when 1DMRLBP was applied to UofTDB 82 multiple sessions
   database. Experiments showed that using 1DMRLBP improved EER by 15\%
   when compared with a biometric system based on raw time-samples.
   Finally, when 1DMRLBP was implemented with sequential sampling to
   achieve a continuous authentication system, 0.39\% false rejection rate
   and 1.57\% false acceptance rate were achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Seizure activity leads to increases in extracellular potassium
   concentration ({[}K+]o), which can result in changes in neuronal passive
   and active membrane properties as well as in population activities. In
   this study, we examined how extracellular potassium modulates seizure
   activities using an acute 4-AP induced seizure model in the neocortex,
   both in vivo and in vitro. Moderately elevated {[}K+] o up to 9 mM
   prolonged seizure durations and shortened interictal intervals as well
   as depolarized the neuronal resting membrane potential (RMP). However,
   when {[}K+]o reached higher than 9 mM, seizure like events (SLEs) were
   blocked and neurons went into a depolarization-blocked state. Spreading
   depression was never observed as the blockade of ictal events could be
   reversed within 1-2 min after the raised {[}K+]o was changed back to
   control levels. This concentration-dependent dual effect of {[}K+]o was
   observed using in vivo and in vitro mouse brain preparations as well as
   in human neocortical tissue resected during epilepsy surgery. Blocking
   the Ih current, mediated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic
   nucleotidegated (HCN) channels, modulated the elevated {[}K+]o influence
   on SLEs by promoting the high {[}K+]o inhibitory actions. These results
   demonstrate biphasic actions of raised {[}K+]o on neuronal excitability
   and seizure activity.}},

Title = {{Elastic-plastic fracture toughness and rising J(R)-curve behavior of
   cortical bone is partially protected from
   irradiation-sterilization-induced degradation by ribose protectant}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study tested the hypothesis that pre-treating cortical
   bone with ribose would protect the rising fracture resistance curve
   behavior and crack initiation fracture toughness of both bovine and
   human cortical bone from the degrading effects of gamma-irradiation
   sterilization.
   Materials and methods: A ribose pre-treatment (1.8 M for bovine, and 1.2
   M for human, in PBS at 60 degrees C for 24 h) was applied to single-edge
   notched bending fracture specimens prior to sterilization with a 33 kGy
   dose of gamma-irradiation. Fracture resistance curves were generated
   with a single specimen method using an optical crack length measurement
   technique. The effect of the treatment on overall fracture resistance
   behavior, crack initiation fracture toughness, and tearing modulus was
   compared with non-irradiated and conventionally irradiation sterilized
   controls. Hydrothermal isometric tension testing was used to examine
   collagen network connectivity and thermal stability to explore
   relationships between collagen network quality and fracture resistance.
   Results: The ribose pre-treatment successfully protected the crack
   growth initiation fracture toughness of bovine and human bone by 32\%
   and 63\%, respectively. The rising JR-curve behavior was also partially
   protected. Furthermore, collagen connectivity and thermal stability
   followed similar patterns to those displayed by fracture toughness.
   Conclusions: This paper demonstrates that the fracture toughness of
   irradiation-sterilized bone tissue can be partially protected with a
   ribose pre-treatment. This new approach shows potential for the
   production and clinical application of sterilized allografts with
   improved mechanical performance and durability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A novel 3-DOF microgripper driven by Linear Ultrasonic Motors (LUMs),
   with nanometer positional accuracy and an operational space in the
   millimeter scale is proposed. A two-fingers design method based on a
   chopstick-like structure is presented. The operational mechanism is
   illustrated to demonstrate how the microgripper works. Based on the
   spatial parallel mechanism with joints formed by right circular
   multi-axis flexible hinges, the kinematic model as well as the
   relationship between output and input displacement are derived. The
   maximum displacement of the manipulation end-effector is calculated and
   an error analysis is conducted. A series of experimental results
   indicate that the reachable operational workspace of the microgripper is
   a 20 mm height cylinder with the major-axis of 2.3415 mm and the
   minor-axis of 2.1178 mm, while the displacement resolution is 100 nm.
   Successful experiments on gripping a single shrimp embryo demonstrate
   that the microgripper has good performance in gripping micro-objects.

Abstract = {{We study the unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem with sequence
   and machine-dependent setup times and the objective of makespan
   minimization. Two exact decomposition-based methods are proposed based
   on logic-based Benders decomposition and branch and check. These
   approaches are hybrid models that make use of a mixed-integer
   programming (MIP) master problem and a specialized solver for travelling
   salesman subproblems. The master problem is used to assign jobs to
   machines, whereas the subproblems find optimal schedules on each machine
   given the master problem assignments. Computational results show that
   the decomposition models are able to find optimal solutions up to four
   orders of magnitude faster than the existing state of the art as well as
   solve problems six times larger than an existing MIP model. We further
   investigate the solution quality versus runtime trade-off for large
   problem instances for which the optimal solutions cannot be found and
   proved in a reasonable time. We demonstrate that the branch-and-check
   hybrid algorithm is able to produce better schedules in less time than
   the state-of-the-art metaheuristic, while also providing an optimality
   gap.}},

Abstract = {{Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are more and more
   frequently used to treat orthopedic injuries in horses. However, these
   cells are limited in their expandability and differentiation capacity.
   Recently, the first equine-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines
   were reported by us {[}1]. In vitro differentiation of iPSCs into
   MSC-like cells is an attractive alternative to using MSCs derived from
   other sources, as a much larger quantity of patient-specific cells with
   broad differentiation potential could be generated. However, the
   differentiation capacity of iPSCs to MSCs and the potential for use in
   tissue engineering have yet to be explored. In this study, equine iPSCs
   were induced to differentiate into an MSC-like population. Upon
   induction, the iPSCs changed morphology toward spindle-shaped cells
   similar to MSCs. The ensuing iPSC-MSCs exhibited downregulation of
   pluripotency-associated genes and an upregulation of MSC-associated
   genes. In addition, the cells expressed the same surface markers as MSCs
   derived from equine umbilical cord blood. We then assessed the
   multilineage differentiation potential of iPSC-MSCs. Although
   chondrogenesis was not achieved after induction with transforming growth
   factor-beta 3 (TGF3) and/or bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP-4) in 3D
   pellet culture, mineralization characteristic of osteogenesis and lipid
   droplet accumulation characteristic of adipogenesis were observed after
   chemical induction. We demonstrate a protocol for the derivation of
   MSC-like progenitor populations from equine iPS cells.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the interaction of molecularly assembled nanoparticles
   with physiological fluids is critical to their use for in vivo delivery
   of drugs and contrast agents. Here, we systematically investigated the
   factors and mechanisms that govern the degradation of DNA on the
   nanoparticle surface in serum. We discovered that a higher DNA density,
   shorter oligonucleotides, and thicker PEG layer increased protection of
   DNA against serum degradation. Oligonucleotides on the surface of
   nanoparticles were highly resistant to DNase I endonucleases, and
   degradation was carried out exclusively by protein-mediated exonuclease
   cleavage and full-strand desorption. These results enabled the
   programming of the degradation rates of the DNA-assembled nanoparticle
   system from 0.1 to 0.7 h(-1) and the engineering of superstructures that
   can release two different preloaded dye molecules with distinct kinetics
   and half-lives ranging from 3.3 to 9.8 h. This study provides a general
   framework for investigating the serum stability of DNA-containing
   nanostructures. The results advance our understanding of engineering
   principles for designing nanoparticle assemblies with controlled in vivo
   behavior and present a strategy for storage and multistage release of
   drugs and contrast agents that can facilitate the diagnosis and
   treatment of cancer and other diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Vanadium dioxide (VO2) exhibits a reversible insulator-metal phase
   transition that is of significant interest in energy-efficient
   nanoelectronic and nanophotonic devices. In these applications,
   crystalline materials are usually preferred for their superior
   electrical transport characteristics as well as spatial homogeneity and
   low surface roughness over the device area for reduced scattering. Here,
   we show applied electrical currents can induce a permanent
   reconfiguration of polycrystalline VO2 nanowires into crystalline
   nanowires, resulting in a dramatically reduced hysteresis across the
   phase transition and reduced resistivity. Low currents below 3 mA were
   sufficient to cause the local temperature in the VO2 to reach about 1780
   K to activate the irreversible polycrystalline-to-crystalline
   transformation. The crystallinity was confirmed by electron microscopy
   and diffraction analyses. This simple yet localized post-processing of
   insulator-metal phase transition materials may enable new methods of
   studying and fabricating nanoscale structures and devices formed from
   these materials.}},

Abstract = {{The quantum internet holds promise for achieving quantum
   communication-such as quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution
   (QKD)-freely between any clients all over the globe, as well as for the
   simulation of the evolution of quantum many-body systems. The most
   primitive function of the quantum internet is to provide quantum
   entanglement or a secret key to two points efficiently, by using
   intermediate nodes connected by optical channels with each other. Here
   we derive a fundamental rate-loss trade-off for a quantum internet
   protocol, by generalizing the Takeoka-Guha-Wilde bound to be applicable
   to any network topology. This trade-off has essentially no scaling gap
   with the quantum communication efficiencies of protocols known to be
   indispensable to long-distance quantum communication, such as intercity
   QKD and quantum repeaters. Our result-putting a practical but general
   limitation on the quantum internet-enables us to grasp the potential of
   the future quantum internet.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the structural organization and growth of organic
   molecules on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) is crucial for creating
   high-performance SAM-based electronic devices. We report herein C-60
   adsorption onto benzenethiol (BT), pentafluorobenzenethiol (PFBT), and
   octanethiol (C8SH) SAM-modified Au(111) studied using scanning tunneling
   microscopy at the liquid-solid interface. A continuous film of C-60
   molecules forms at a much faster rate (k = 3.3 x 10(-7) s(-1)) on PFBT
   compared to that on BT (k = 7.2 X 10(-9) s(-1)) and C8SH SAMs (k = 9.5 X
   10(-9) s(-1)). On the basis of density functional theory calculations,
   we propose that the difference in C-60 growth behavior originates from
   the dipole-induced dipole interactions between the SAM and C-60. This
   may be further augmented by an inverse charge transfer from C-60 to SAM.
   This work provides new insights into the self-assembly behavior of
   next-generation electronic materials.}},

Abstract = {{Thermoresponsive colloidal hydrogels (aqueous microgels) made from
   poly{[}oligo (ethylene glycol) methacrylate] (PEGMA) are an interesting
   class of biomaterials due to their sharp thermal transition and
   excellent biocompatibility. However, the inherent protein repellency of
   PEGMA has made the biofunctionalization of these microgels difficult and
   prevented them from reaching their full potential in applications such
   as a protein carrier. Here, we report the synthesis of thermoresponsive
   PEGMA microgels and the covalent attachment of horseradish peroxidase
   (HRP, as a model protein) to these microgels. We prepared our microgels
   by the precipitation copolymerization of 70 mol \% OEGMA(300) and 30 mol
   \% methacrylic acid in water. The resulting microgels showed a volume
   phase transition temperature (VPTT) of ca. 60 degrees C in acidic
   buffers and in DI water but in neutral and basic buffers did not show a
   thermal response up to 75 degrees C. The direct immobilization of HRP to
   the activated carboxylic groups in the microgel backbone was
   unsuccessful, but using a diamine spacer with four ethylene glycol
   units, we were able to covalently attach this enzyme to our PEGMA
   microgels through bis-aryl hydrazone chemistry. HRP has its maximum
   activity at ca. 50 degrees C. At higher temperatures, the activity was
   reduced, but the microgel-bound enzyme showed less reduction in activity
   than the native enzyme and no change in activity associated with the
   VPTT. In addition, PEGMA microgels stabilized the attached enzymes
   against thermal denaturation. For example, our results showed that the
   enzyme immobilized on the PEGMA microgel lost its activity 3.4 times
   slower than the free enzyme in the first 5 h of annealing at 50 degrees
   C. The bioconjugation strategy introduced here could serve as a model
   for the covalent attachment of other biomacromolecules to the
   protein-repellent PEGMA microgels.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{155}},
Pages = {{27-37}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{We used an innovative visualization mold to investigate the effect of
   foam processing parameters on bubble nucleation and growth. This was
   also done to uncover the mechanisms responsible for cellular structural
   development in the high-pressure foam injection molding process. The
   effects of the injection speed, the injection gate geometry, the blowing
   agent content, the melt flow rate and the use of talc as a heterogeneous
   nucleating agent on the formation and dynamics of cell bubbles were all
   explored. In the high-pressure foam injection molding process with a
   proper packing pressure, the overall cell density did not change with
   the injection speed nor with the injection gate resistance. However, the
   cell density increased significantly with the blowing agent's
   concentration and with a nucleating agent. We also observed the growth
   mechanism of the bubbles in a confined mold cavity, and concluded that
   the bubble growth rate decreased as the cell density increased. In
   addition, the satelliting phenomenon, i.e. bubble nucleation around the
   previously nucleated cells, was observed. This was due to the induced
   stress fluctuations in the surrounding melt, which could eventually
   affect the final cellular structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   oxidase: substrate range and H2O2 stability}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Glucose oxidase (GO) activity is generally restricted to glucose and is
   susceptible to inactivation by H2O2. By comparison, the Y300A variant of
   gluco-oligosaccharide oxidase (GOOX) from Sarocladium strictum showed
   broader substrate range and higher H2O2 stability. Specifically, Y300A
   exhibited up to 40 times higher activity on all tested sugars except
   glucose, compared to GO. Moreover, fusion of the Y300A variant to a
   family 22 carbohydrate binding module from Clostridium thermocellum
   (CtCBM22A) nearly doubled its catalytic efficiency on glucose, while
   retaining significant activity on oligosaccharides. In the presence of
   200 mM of H2O2, the recombinant CtCBM22A\_Y300A retained 80\% of
   activity on glucose and 100\% of activity on cellobiose, the preferred
   substrate for this enzyme. By contrast, a commercial glucose oxidase
   reported to contain <= 0.1 units catalase/mg protein, retained 60\%
   activity on glucose under the same conditions. GOOX variants appear to
   undergo a different mechanism of inactivation, as a loss of histidine
   instead of methionine was observed after H2O2 incubation. The addition
   of CtCBM22A also promoted functional binding of the fusion enzyme to
   xylan, facilitating its simultaneous purification and immobilization
   using edible oat spelt xylan, which might benefit the usage of this
   enzyme preparation in food and baking applications.}},

Abstract = {{Compared to FDG, the signal of F-18-labelled hypoxia-sensitive tracers
   in tumours is low. This means that in addition to the presence of
   hypoxic cells, transport properties contribute significantly to the
   uptake signal in static PET images. This sensitivity to transport must
   be minimized in order for static PET to provide a reliable standard for
   hypoxia quantification.
   A dynamic compartmental model based on a reaction-diffusion formalism
   was developed to interpret tracer pharmacokinetics and applied to static
   images of FAZA in twenty patients with pancreatic cancer.
   We use our model to identify tumour properties-well-perfused without
   substantial necrosis or partitioning-for which static PET images can
   reliably quantify hypoxia. Normalizing the measured activity in a tumour
   voxel by the value in blood leads to a reduction in the sensitivity to
   variations in `intercorporal' transport properties-blood volume and
   clearance rate-as well as imaging study protocols. Normalization thus
   enhances the correlation between static PET images and the FAZA binding
   rate K-3, a quantity which quantifies hypoxia in a biologically
   significant way. The ratio of FAZA uptake in spinal muscle and blood can
   vary substantially across patients due to long muscle equilibration
   times.
   Normalized static PET images of hypoxia-sensitive tracers can reliably
   quantify hypoxia for homogeneously well-perfused tumours with minimal
   tissue partitioning. The ideal normalizing reference tissue is blood,
   either drawn from the patient before PET scanning or imaged using PET.
   If blood is not available, uniform, homogeneously well-perfused muscle
   can be used. For tumours that are not homogeneously well-perfused or for
   which partitioning is significant, only an analysis of dynamic PET scans
   can reliably quantify hypoxia.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments are performed to examine the sedimentation of
   particles that initially rise in a plume, then spread radially and
   settle in uniformly stratified fluid. Using light attenuation, the depth
   of the sediment bed is measured nonintrusively as a function of radius
   from the center of the plume. To gain some insight into these dynamics,
   an idealized model is developed by adapting well-established plume
   theory and a theory that accounts for sedimentation from surface gravity
   currents emanating from a plume impacting a rigid lid. We also account
   for recycling of falling particles that are re-entrained into the plume.
   With a suitable choice of parameters determining the intrusion height,
   entrainment during fountain collapse, and the radius at which settling
   from the intrusion begins, in most cases for which particles are
   predicted to be drawn back into the plume and recycled. The predictions
   for intrusion height, particle mound height, and spread agree within
   20\% of observations.}},

Abstract = {{Boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dye molecules are well known for their
   excellent absorption and emission optical properties. Here, we report
   the results of an electrochemical and electrochemiluminescence (ECL)
   study of an organic-soluble and a water-soluble BODIPY dye to explore
   their effectiveness as ECL luminophores. A combination of UV-visible,
   fluorescence, and spooling ECL spectroscopy was used to study the
   mechanisms of ECL light emission. It was discovered that excimers, the
   excited states of analyte dimers, contributed significantly to the
   production of ECL. These BODIPY molecules exhibited relatively weak ECL
   efficiencies following the annihilation mechanism. However, ECL was
   enhanced with co-reactants such as persulfate, and tri-n-propylamine.
   Spooling ECL spectroscopy was utilized to gain analytical insight into
   light emission mechanisms. It is shown that while these two BODIPY
   compounds can form photoinduced excited monomers, excimers were
   generated mainly in their co-reactant ECL pathways. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Bioremediation of groundwater contaminated with chlorinated aliphatic
   hydrocarbons such as perchloroethene and trichloroethene can result in
   the accumulation of the undesirable intermediate vinyl chloride. Such
   accumulation can either be due to the absence of specific vinyl chloride
   respiring Dehalococcoides mccartyi or to the inhibition of such strains
   by the metabolism of other microorganisms. The fitness of vinyl chloride
   respiring Dehalococcoides mccartyi subpopulations is particularly
   uncertain in the presence of chloroethene/chloroethane cocontaminant
   mixtures, which are commonly found in contaminated groundwater.
   Therefore, we investigated the structure of Dehalococcoides populations
   in a continuously fed reactor system under changing chloroethene/ethane
   influent conditions. We observed that increasing the influent ratio of
   1,2-dichloroethane to trichloroethene was associated with ecological
   selection of a tceA-containing Dehalococcoides population relative to a
   vcrA-containing Dehalococcoides population. Although both-vinyl chloride
   and 1,2-dichloroethane could be simultaneously transformed to ethene,
   prolonged exposure to 1,2-dichloroethane diminished the vinyl chloride
   transforming capacity of the culture. Kinetic tests revealed that
   dechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane by the consortium was strongly
   inhibited by cis-dichloroethene but not vinyl chloride. Native
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry revealed that a
   trichloroethene reductive dehalogenase (TceA) homologue was the most
   consistently expressed of four detectable reductive dehalogenases during
   1,2-dichloroethane exposure, suggesting that it catalyzes the reductive
   dihaloelimination of 1,2-dichloroethane to ethene.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring, natural recovery of contaminated sediments requires the use
   of techniques that can provide definitive evidence of in situ
   contaminant degradation. In this study, a passive diffusion sampler,
   called ``peeper{''}, was combined with Compound Specific Isotope
   Analysis to determine benzene and monochlorobenzene (MCB) stable carbon
   isotope values at a fine vertical resolution (3 cm) across the sediment
   water interface at a contaminated site. Results indicated significant
   decrease in concentrations of MCB from the bottom to the top layers of
   the sediment over 25 cm, and a 3.5 parts per thousand enrichment in
   delta C-13 values of MCB over that distance. Benzene was always at lower
   concentrations than MCB, with consistently more depleted delta C-13
   values than MCB. The redox conditions were dominated by iron reduction
   along most of the sediment profile. These results provide multiple lines
   of evidence for in situ reductive dechlorination of MCB to benzene.
   Stable isotope analysis of contaminants in pore water is a valuable
   method to demonstrate in situ natural recovery of contaminated
   sediments. This novel high-resolution approach is critical to
   deciphering the combined effects of parent contaminant (e.g., MCB)
   degradation and both production and simultaneous degradation of daughter
   products, especially benzene.}},

Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{224-234}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Buildings represent habitats for microorganisms that can have direct or
   indirect effects on the quality of our living spaces, health, and
   well-being. Over the last ten years, new research has employed
   sophisticated tools, including DNA sequencing-based approaches, to study
   microbes found in buildings and the overall built environment. These
   investigations have catalyzed new insights into and questions about the
   microbes that surround us in our daily lives. The emergence of the
   ``microbiology of the built environment{''} field has required bridging
   disciplines, including microbiology, ecology, building science,
   architecture, and engineering. Early insights have included a fuller
   characterization of sources of microbes within buildings, important
   processes that structure the distributions and abundances of microbes,
   and a greater appreciation of the role that occupants can have on indoor
   microbiology. This ongoing work has also demonstrated that traditional

Abstract = {{The removal of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) remains a big
   challenge in water treatment. Risks associated with these compounds are
   not clearly defined and it is important that the water industry has
   additional options to increase the resiliency of water treatment
   systems. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has potential applications for the
   removal of EDCs from water. TiO2 has been immobilized on supports using
   a variety of synthesis methods to increase its feasibility for water
   treatment. In this study, we immobilized TiO2 through the
   thermal-chemical oxidation of porous titania sheets. The efficiency of
   the material to degrade target EDCs under UV-LED irradiation was
   examined under a wide range of pH conditions. A yeast-estrogen screen
   assay was used to complement chemical analysis in assessing removal
   efficiency. All compounds but 17 beta-estradiol were degraded and
   followed a pseudo first-order kinetics at all pH conditions tested, with
   pH 4 and pH 11 showing the most and the least efficient treatments
   respectively. In addition, the total estrogenic activity was
   substantially reduced even with the inefficient degradation of 17
   beta-estradiol. Additional studies will be required to optimize
   different treatment conditions, UV-LED configurations, and membrane
   fouling mitigation measures to make this technology a more viable option
   for water treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   level of the screen can be calculated. Using a Gedanken experiment
   involving infinitesimal slits and a distant cylindrical screen, entropy
   values assume a very simple form. The entropy changes (at the slit and
   screen) are found to be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign, and
   correspond to the minimum change permitted by Heisenberg's Uncertainty
   Principle. Moreover, when welcher Weg information is knowable a priori,
   we see that the ``cost{''} of this information (knowing which slit is
   taken) is reversion to a single slit pattern. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Exploratory analysis of real personal emergency response call
   conversations: considerations for personal emergency response spoken
   dialogue systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: The purpose of this study was to derive data from real,
   recorded, personal emergency response call conversations to help improve
   the artificial intelligence and decision making capability of a spoken
   dialogue system in a smart personal emergency response system. The main
   study objectives were to: develop a model of personal emergency
   response; determine categories for the model's features; identify and
   calculate measures from call conversations (verbal ability,
   conversational structure, timing); and examine conversational patterns
   and relationships between measures and model features applicable for
   improving the system's ability to automatically identify call model
   categories and predict a target response.
   Methods: This study was exploratory and used mixed methods. Personal
   emergency response calls were preclassified according to call model
   categories identified qualitatively from response call transcripts. The
   relationships between six verbal ability measures, three conversational
   structure measures, two timing measures and three independent factors:
   caller type, risk level, and speaker type, were examined statistically.
   Results: Emergency medical response services were the preferred response
   for the majority of medium and high risk calls for both caller types.
   Older adult callers mainly requested non-emergency medical service
   responders during medium risk situations. By measuring the number of
   spoken words-per-minute and turn-length-in-words for the first spoken
   utterance of a call, older adult and care provider callers could be
   identified with moderate accuracy. Average call taker response time was
   calculated using the number-of-speaker-turns and time-in-seconds
   measures. Care providers and older adults used different conversational
   strategies when responding to call takers. The words `ambulance' and
   `paramedic' may hold different latent connotations for different
   callers.
   Conclusions: The data derived from the real personal emergency response
   recordings may help a spoken dialogue system classify incoming calls by
   caller type with moderate probability shortly after the initial caller
   utterance. Knowing the caller type, the target response for the call may
   be predicted with some degree of probability and the output dialogue
   could be tailored to this caller type. The average call taker response
   time measured from real calls may be used to limit the conversation
   length in a spoken dialogue system before defaulting to a live call
   taker.}},

Abstract = {{Trapping broadband electromagnetic radiation over a subwavelength
   grating, provides new opportunities for hyperspectral light-matter
   interaction on a nanometer scale. Previous efforts have shown
   rainbow-trapping is possible on functionally graded structures. Here, we
   propose groove width as a new gradient parameter for designing
   rainbow-trapping gratings and define the range of its validity. We
   articulate the correlation between the width of narrow grooves and the
   overlap or the coupling of the evanescent surface plasmon fields within
   the grooves. In the suitable range (less than or similar to 150 nm),
   this width parameter becomes as important as other known parameters such
   as groove depth and materials composition, but tailoring groove widths
   is remarkably more feasible in practice. Using groove width as a design
   parameter, we investigate rainbow-trapping gratings and derive an
   analytical formula by treating each nano-groove as a plasmonic waveguide
   resonator. These results closely agree with numerical simulations. (C)

Abstract = {{Two yellow-emissive triads, DPXZ-as-TAZ and TPXZ-as-TAZ, featuring an
   asymmetric triazine (1,2,4-triazine) core as an electron acceptor,
   phenoxazine units as electron donors and phenyl groups as p-linkages are
   constructed. Both emitters possess high thermal stability, suitable
   HOMO/LUMO levels, relatively high PLQY, near-zero singlet-triplet energy
   splitting, apparent TADF features and short delayed lifetimes. As a
   result, a yellow OLED utilizing TPXZ-as-TAZ as an emitter reaches a
   maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 13.0\%, which is on a par
   with a similar device (13.3\%) based on a symmetric-triazine
   (1,3,5-triazine) cored analogue. Surprisingly, a TPXZ-as-TAZ-based
   device exhibits a high EQE of 11.5\% and an ultra-slow efficiency
   roll-off of 11.5\% at a high luminance of 1000 cd m(-2). For the first
   time, this work reports the huge potential of asymmetric triazine
   compounds as TADF emitters for high-performance OLEDs.}},

Abstract = {{The higher risk of vaso-occlusion events and sudden death for
   sickle-cell trait (SCT) athletes has been speculatively ascribed to SCT
   red blood cell (RBC) stiffening during strenuous exercise. However, the
   microenvironmental changes that could induce the stiffening of SCT RBCs
   are unknown. To address this question, we measured the mechanical
   properties of and changes in SCT RBCs under deoxygenated and acidic
   environments, which are two typical conditions present in the
   circulation of athletes undertaking strenuous exercise. The results
   reveal that SCT RBCs are inherently stiffer than RBCs from non-SCT
   healthy subjects, and a lower pH further stiffens the SCT cells.
   Furthermore, at both normal and low pH levels, deoxygenation was found
   to not be the cause of the stiffness of SCT RBCs. This study confirms
   that the stiffening of SCT RBCs occurs at a low pH and implies that SCT
   RBC stiffening could be responsible for vaso-occlusion in SCT athletes
   during strenuous exercise.}},

Abstract = {{Triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) is a diluent monomer used
   pervasively in dental composite resins. Through hydrolytic degradation
   of the composites in the oral cavity it yields a hydrophilic
   biodegradation product, triethylene glycol (TEG), which has been shown
   to promote the growth of Streptococcus mutans, a dominant cariogenic
   bacterium. Previously it was shown that TEG up-regulated gtfB, an
   important gene contributing to polysaccharide synthesis function in
   biofilms. However, molecular mechanisms related to TEG's effect on
   bacterial function remained poorly understood. In the present study, S.
   mutans UA159 was incubated with clinically relevant concentrations of
   TEG at pH 5.5 and 7.0. Quantitative real-time PCR, proteomics analysis,
   and glucosyltransferase enzyme (GTF) activity measurements were employed
   to identify the bacterial phenotypic response to TEG. A S. mutans vicK
   isogenic mutant (SM Delta vicK1) and its associated complemented strain
   (SM Delta vicK1C), an important regulatory gene for biofilm-associated
   genes, were used to determine if this signaling pathway was involved in
   modulation of the S. mutans virulence-associated genes. Extracted
   proteins from S. mutans biofilms grown in the presence and absence of
   TEG were subjected to mass spectrometry for protein identification,
   characterization and quantification. TEG up-regulated gtfB/C, gbpB,
   comC, comD and comE more significantly in biofilms at cariogenic pH
   (5.5) and defined concentrations. Differential response of the vicK
   knock-out (SM Delta vicK1) and complemented strains (SM Delta vicK1C)
   implicated this signalling pathway in TEG-modulated cellular responses.
   TEG resulted in increased GTF enzyme activity, responsible for
   synthesizing insoluble glucans involved in the formation of cariogenic
   biofilms. As well, TEG increased protein abundance related to biofilm
   formation, carbohydrate transport, acid tolerance, and stress-response.
   Proteomics data was consistent with gene expression findings for the
   selected genes. These findings demonstrate a mechanistic pathway by
   which TEG derived from commercial resin materials in the oral cavity
   promote S. mutans pathogenicity, which is typically associated with
   secondary caries.}},

Title = {{Test-Retest Reliability of a Serious Game for Delirium Screening in the
   Emergency Department}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Cognitive screening in settings such as emergency
   departments (ED) is frequently carried out using paper-and-pencil tests
   that require administration by trained staff. These assessments often
   compete with other clinical duties and thus may not be routinely
   administered in these busy settings. Literature has shown that the
   presence of cognitive impairments such as dementia and delirium are
   often missed in older ED patients. Failure to recognize delirium can
   have devastating consequences including increased mortality (Kakuma et
   al., 2003). Given the demands on emergency staff, an automated cognitive
   test to screen for delirium onset could be a valuable tool to support
   delirium prevention and management. In earlier research we examined the
   concurrent validity of a serious game, and carried out an initial
   assessment of its potential as a delirium screening tool (Tong et al.,
   2016). In this paper, we examine the test-retest reliability of the
   game, as it is an important criterion in a cognitive test for detecting
   risk of delirium onset.
   Objective: To demonstrate the test-retest reliability of the screening
   tool over time in a clinical sample of older emergency patients. A
   secondary objective is to assess whether there are practice effects that
   might make game performance unstable over repeated presentations.
   Materials and Methods: Adults over the age of 70 were recruited from a
   hospital ED. Each patient played our serious game in an initial session
   soon after they arrived in the ED, and in follow up sessions conducted
   at 8-h intervals (for each participant there were up to five follow up
   sessions, depending on how long the person stayed in the ED).
   Results: A total of 114 adults (61 females, 53 males) between the ages
   of 70 and 104 years (M = 81 years, SD = 7) participated in our study
   after screening out delirious patients. We observed a test-retest
   reliability of the serious game (as assessed by correlation r-values)
   between 0.5 and 0.8 across adjacent sessions.
   Conclusion: The game-based assessment for cognitive screening has
   relatively strong test-retest reliability and little evidence of
   practice effects among elderly emergency patients, and may be a useful
   supplement to existing cognitive assessment methods.}},

Title = {{Simultaneous Bayesian Estimation of Excitatory and Inhibitory Synaptic
   Conductances by Exploiting Multiple Recorded Trials}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Advanced statistical methods have enabled trial-by-trial inference of
   the underlying excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances (SCs) of
   membrane-potential recordings. Simultaneous inference of both excitatory
   and inhibitory SCs sheds light on the neural circuits underlying the
   neural activity and advances our understanding of neural information
   processing. Conventional Bayesian methods can infer excitatory and
   inhibitory SCs based on a single trial of observed membrane potential.
   However, if multiple recorded trials are available, this typically leads
   to suboptimal estimation because they neglect common statistics (of
   synaptic inputs (Sls)) across trials. Here, we establish a new
   expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that improves such single-trial
   Bayesian methods by exploiting multiple recorded trials to extract
   common SI statistics across the trials. In this paper, the proposed EM
   algorithm is embedded in parallel Kalman filters or particle filters for
   multiple recorded trials to integrate their outputs to iteratively
   update the common SI statistics. These statistics are then used to infer
   the excitatory and inhibitory SCs of individual trials. We demonstrate
   the superior performance of multiple-trial Kalman filtering (MtKF) and
   particle filtering (MtPF) relative to that of the corresponding
   single-trial methods. While relative estimation error of excitatory and
   inhibitory SCs is known to depend on the level of current injection into
   a cell, our numerical simulations using MtKF show that both excitatory
   and inhibitory SCs are reliably inferred using an optimal level of
   current injection. Finally, we validate the robustness and applicability
   of our technique through simulation studies, and we apply MtKF to in
   vivo data recorded from the rat barrel cortex.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber debonding and pullout are well-understood processes that occur
   during damage and failure events in composite materials. In this study,
   we show how these mechanisms, under controlled conditions, can be used
   to produce multifunctional textured surfaces. A two-step process
   consisting of (1) achieving longitudinal fiber alignment followed by (2)
   cutting, rearranging, and joining is used to produce the textured
   surfaces. This process employs common composite manufacturing techniques
   and uses no reactive chemicals or wet handling, making it suitable for
   scalability. This uniform textured surface is due to the fiber debonding
   and pullout occurring during the cutting process. Using well-established
   fracture mechanics principles for composite materials, we demonstrate
   how different material parameters such as fiber geometry, fiber and
   matrix stiffness and strength, and interface behavior can be used to
   achieve multifunctional textured surfaces. The resulting textured
   surfaces show very high friction coefficients on wet ice (9x
   improvement), indicating their promising potential as materials for ice
   traction/tribology. Furthermore, the texturing enhances the surface's
   hydrophobicity as indicated by an increase in the contact angle of water
   by 30\%. The substantial improvements to surface tribology and
   hydrophobicity make fiber debonding and pullout an effective, simple,
   and scalable method of producing multifunctional textured surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Water emerges in microchannels of proton exchange membrane fuel cells
   forming different two-phase flow patterns. In the current study, the
   two-phase flow in cathode side of a single-serpentine microchannel of
   proton exchange membrane fuel cell is quantified and characterized for
   different operating conditions as anode/cathode stoichiometry (flow
   rate), anode/cathode relative humidity and temperature of inlet gases.
   The two-phase flow is studied by direct visualization and image
   processing. The detected two-phase flow patterns are small/medium/large
   droplets, film, annular, slug and plug. An empirical correlation is
   proposed for average dimensionless diameter of droplets. The numbers of
   channel passes which involve in two-phase flow formation are derived.
   The distributions of each two-phase flow pattern in the channel are
   calculated. The effect of change of operating conditions on two-phase
   flow distribution is surveyed. The average local distributions of
   different two-phase flow patterns are studied for each channel pass,
   elbows and middle region. The dominant flow patterns are determined
   locally and overall. The droplets are categorized based on their
   diameters into three categories as small, medium and large droplets,
   then the average dimensionless droplet diameter is calculated. The
   distributions of three droplet categories in the channel are studied,
   and the dominant categories are identified for each case. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper deals with a proposal to revise the effective width terms in
   the brace shear criterion for overlap joints in rectangular hollow
   sections (RHS). The background to the design equations in ISO 14346 for
   the failure modes, brace effective width, chord M-N interaction and
   brace shear are described first. That is followed by the relation
   between overlap joints in circular hollow sections and those in
   rectangular hollow sections and those with an I- or H-section chord.
   Finally, it is shown that the effective width terms in the brace shear
   criterion can - in the case of 100 \% overlap joints -be better related
   to the thickness of the overlapped brace. In the case of smaller
   overlaps, lambda(ov,limit) <= lambda(ov) <= 100 \%, the effective width
   should also be related to the thickness of the overlapping brace, where
   lambda(ov,limit) depends on whether the hidden seam at the toe of the
   overlapped brace has been welded.}},

Title = {{Combined Changes in Chloride Regulation and Neuronal Excitability Enable
   Primary Afferent Depolarization to Elicit Spiking without Compromising
   its Inhibitory Effects}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The central terminals of primary afferent fibers experience
   depolarization upon activation of GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)R) because
   their intracellular chloride concentration is maintained above
   electrochemical equilibrium. Primary afferent depolarization (PAD)
   normally mediates inhibition via sodium channel inactivation and
   shunting but can evoke spikes under certain conditions. Antidromic
   (centrifugal) conduction of these spikes may contribute to neurogenic
   inflammation while orthodromic (centripetal) conduction could contribute
   to pain in the case of nociceptive fibers. PAD-induced spiking is
   assumed to override presynaptic inhibition. Using computer simulations
   and dynamic clamp experiments, we sought to identify which biophysical
   changes are required to enable PAD-induced spiking and whether those
   changes necessarily compromise PAD-mediated inhibition. According to
   computational modeling, a depolarizing shift in GABA reversal potential
   (E-GABA) and increased intrinsic excitability (manifest as altered spike
   initiation properties) were necessary for PAD-induced spiking, whereas
   increased GABA(A)R conductance density ((g) over tilde (GABA)) had mixed
   effects. We tested our predictions experimentally by using dynamic clamp
   to insert virtual GABA(A)R conductances with different E-GABA and
   kinetics into acutely dissociated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron
   somata. Comparable experiments in central axon terminals are
   prohibitively difficult but the biophysical requirements for PAD-induced
   spiking are arguably similar in soma and axon. Neurons from naive (i.e.
   uninjured) rats were compared before and after pharmacological
   manipulation of intrinsic excitability, and against neurons from
   nerve-injured rats. Experimental data confirmed that, in most neurons,
   both predicted changes were necessary to yield PAD-induced spiking.
   Importantly, such changes did not prevent PAD from inhibiting other
   spiking or from blocking spike propagation. In fact, since the high
   value of (g) over bar (GABA) required for PAD-induced spiking still
   mediates strong inhibition, we conclude that PAD-induced spiking does
   not represent failure of presynaptic inhibition. Instead, diminished PAD
   caused by reduction of (g) over bar (GABA) poses a greater risk to
   presynaptic inhibition and the sensory processing that relies upon it.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment efficacy of a heat-activated thermosensitive liposome
   formulation of cisplatin (CDDP), known as HTLC, was determined in
   xenograft models of non-small-cell lung carcinoma. The short-term impact
   of local hyperthermia (HT) on tumor morphology, microvessel density and
   local inflammatory response was also evaluated. The HTLC formulation in
   combination with local HT resulted in a significant advantage in
   therapeutic effect in comparison with free drug and a
   non-thermosensitive liposome formulation of CDDP (i.e. Lipoplatin(TM))
   when administered at their maximum tolerated doses. Local HT-induced
   widespread cell necrosis and a significant reduction in microvessel
   density in the necrotic regions of tumors. CD11b-expressing innate
   leukocytes were demonstrated to infiltrate and reside preferentially at
   the necrotic rim of tumors, likely as a means to phagocytose-damaged
   tissue. Colocalization of CD11b with a marker of DNA damage (i.e. H2AX)
   revealed a small portion of CD11b-expressing leukocytes that were
   possibly undergoing apoptosis as a result of HT-induced damage and/or
   the short lifespan of leukocytes. Overall, HT-induced tissue damage
   (i.e. at 24-h post-treatment) alone did not result in significant
   improvements in treatment effect, rather, the enhancement in tumor drug
   availability was correlated with improved therapeutic outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years colloidal quantum dot (CQD) photovoltaics have developed
   rapidly because of novel device architectures and robust surface
   passivation schemes. Achieving controlled net doping remains an
   important unsolved challenge for this field. Herein we present a general
   molecular doping platform for CQD solids employing a library of metal
   organic complexes. Low effective ionization energy and high electron
   affinity complexes are shown to produce n- and p-doped CQD solids. We
   demonstrate the obvious advantage in solar cells by p-doping the CQD
   absorber layer. Employing photoemission spectroscopy, we identify two
   doping concentration regimes: lower concentrations lead to efficient
   doping, while higher concentrations also cause large surface dipoles
   creating energy barriers to carrier flow. Utilizing the lower
   concentration regime, we remove midgap electrons leading to 25\%
   enhancement in the power conversion efficiency relative to undoped
   cells. Given the vast number of available metal-organic complexes, this
   approach opens new and facile routes to tuning the properties of CQDs
   for various applications without necessarily resorting to new ligand
   chemistries.}},

Abstract = {{Depth information of objects plays a significant role in image-based
   rendering. Traditional depth estimation techniques use different visual
   cues including the disparity, motion, geometry, and defocus of objects.
   This paper presents a novel approach of focus cue-based depth estimation
   for still images using the Gaussian-Hermite moments (GHMs) of local
   neighboring pixels. The GHMs are chosen due to their superior
   reconstruction ability and invariance properties to intensity and
   geometric distortions of objects as compared to other moments. Since
   depths of local neighboring pixels are significantly correlated, the
   Laplacian matting is employed to obtain final depth map from the
   moment-based focus map. Experiments are conducted on images of indoor
   and outdoor scenes having objects with varying natures of resolution,
   edge, occlusion, and blur contents. Experimental results reveal that the
   depth estimated from GHMs can provide anaglyph images with stereo
   quality better than that provided by existing methods using traditional
   visual cues. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We study supervisory control of timed discrete-event systems (TDES)
   under partial observation, and propose new observability concepts
   effective for supervisor synthesis. First, we consider
   monolithic/centralized supervisory control, and introduce timed relative
   observability and timed relative weak observability. The former concept
   extends our previous work to the timed case, while the latter exploits
   choices of forcible events to preempt the clock event tick. We prove
   that timed relative (respectively, weak) observability is stronger than
   timed (respectively, weak) observability, weaker than normality, and
   closed under set union; hence there exists the supremal relatively
   (respectively, weakly) observable sublanguage of a given language. We
   move on to study decentralized supervisory control of TDES, and propose
   timed relative coobservability and timed relative weak coobservability
   as extensions of their centralized counterparts. It is shown that timed
   relative (respectively, weak) coobservability is stronger than timed
   (respectively, weak) coobservability, weaker than conormality, and
   closed under set union; therefore the supremal relatively (respectively,
   weakly) coobservable sublanguage of a given language exists. Finally,
   algorithms are designed to compute the supremal relatively (weakly)
   (co)observable and controllable sublanguages, which are demonstrated
   with a Guideway example.}},

Abstract = {{This article provides an interdisciplinary perspective on driver
   monitoring systems by discussing state-of-the-art signal processing
   solutions in the context of road safety issues identified in human
   factors research. Recently, the human factors community has made
   significant progress in understanding driver behaviors and assessed the
   efficacy of various interventions for unsafe driving practices. In
   parallel, the signal processing community has had significant
   advancements in developing signal acquisition and processing methods for
   driver monitoring systems. This article aims to bridge these efforts and
   help initiate new collaborations across the two fields. Toward this end,
   we discuss how vehicle measures, facial/body expressions, and
   physiological signals can assist in improving driving safety through
   adaptive interactions with the driver, based on the driver's state and
   driving environment. Moreover, by highlighting the current human factors
   research in road safety, we provide insights for building feedback and
   mitigation technologies, which can act both in real time and postdrive.
   We provide insights into areas with great potential to improve driver
   monitoring systems, which have not yet been extensively studied in the
   literature, such as affect recognition and data fusion. Finally, a
   high-level discussion is given on the challenges and possible future
   directions for driver monitoring systems.}},

Abstract = {{The flow around an isolated cylinder with a Boger fluid was studied
   experimentally by partially immersing a small vertical cylinder in a
   test fluid contained in an annular tank slowly rotating on a turntable.
   To approximate isolation, the ratio of the tank width to cylinder
   diameter varied from 40/1 to 300/1, and Reynolds numbers ranged from
   10(-5) to 0.5. Drag was measured by a custom-made mechanical/optical
   system and the flow field was mapped using particle image velocimetry
   (Ply). The experimental liquids were two Newtonian fluids and two
   polyisobutylene/polybutene Boger fluids, and the cylinders had various
   diameters. The Newtonian drag data, corrected for end and wall effects,
   agree with Kaplun's low-Re asymptotic formula. Elasticity increased the
   drag, starting at a Deborah number of 0.6, by 50\% at a De of 2.5, and
   by more at higher Deborah numbers. PIV measurements were made around a
   cylinder-upstream, downstream, and transversely-and at 180 degrees from
   it. The velocity measurements showed that the wake increased with De,
   among other findings. To relate the increased drag to fluid elasticity,
   normal stresses due to elasticity were found from deformation rates
   derived from the PIV data, but these stresses appear to be insufficient
   to account for the effect. (C) 2016 The Society of Rheology.}},

Abstract = {{The theory of T-cells and their application in Fourier transform
   infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy (FTIR-PAS) based on a commercial
   FTIR spectrometer are discussed. This work was undertaken with the view
   to develop portable compact instrumentation for monitoring air
   contaminants. A resonant T-cell was determined to be the most
   appropriate resonator in view of the requirement for the low frequency
   and the limited space available in the FTIR spectrometer sample
   compartment. A two dimensional analytical solution with a semi-empirical
   boundary condition was introduced for resonance frequency prediction.
   Carbon dioxide (CO2) gas was the chosen air contaminant. Linear
   amplitude response to CO2 concentrations from 1000 to 8000 ppmv was
   observed, leading to a theoretical detection limit of 4 ppmv. The
   FTIR-PA phase shift was correlated to varying relaxation times in a
   mixture of CO2 and nitrogen (N-2) gases. The analytical solution showed
   excellent agreement with simulated and experimental data, providing a
   reliable means for estimating the resonance frequency of the system. The
   experimental results establish the feasibility of using step-scan T-cell
   FTIR-PAS for quantitative detection of ambient air pollutants. (C) 2016

Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{36-47}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Various Kalman filter approaches have been proposed for the state
   estimation of gas turbine engines, among which Linear Kalman Filter
   (LKF) is the most common one. Kalman filters achieve state estimation
   provided that there are more available measurement sensors than state
   parameters to be estimated. However, it is hard to hold this assumption
   in gas turbine engine health monitoring applications, and an
   underdetermined estimation problem rises up.
   The aim of this contribution is to present a nonlinear underdetermined
   state estimation method on the basis of Extended Kalman Filter (EKF);
   and to evaluate the performance of this methodology, the comparisons of
   three nonlinear estimators, i.e. basic EKF, underdetermined EKF and
   resultant EKF are conducted to gas turbine engine health state
   estimation. The underdetermined EKF is developed from the previous
   linear achievements using the transformation matrix, and it produces the
   least estimation errors in the nonlinear framework. Moreover, the prior
   state information represented by inequality constraints is introduced to
   create the resultant EKF, and the estimates of state variables are tuned
   to truncated Probability Density Function (PDF). Results from the
   application to a turbojet engine health monitoring in the flight
   envelope show that the proposed methodology yields a significant
   improvement in terms of underdetermined estimation accuracy and
   robustness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is an effective and
   widely used time-domain method for solving electromagnetic problems.
   Conventionally, its solutions are obtained numerically in a
   march-on-in-time manner. In this paper, based on the eigenmatrix theory,
   we derive the analytical expression for the FDTD solution. The FDTD
   solution is analytically expressed in terms of spatial modes modulated
   by discrete time sequences related to the eigenvalues of the FDTD system
   equation. Based on our results, we propose an alternative approach to
   the FDTD solutions and it could open a new horizon for applying advanced
   signal processing techniques as well as offering the possibility of
   storing the FDTD results in an analytical form for a structure after
   computation.}},

Abstract = {{Results from an experimental program consisting of 10 large beams are
   presented herein that investigated the performance of the most current
   generation of bent glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) stirrups. In
   the experiments, strains greater than 1\% were measured in the
   transverse reinforcement, which significantly exceeded the
   code-prescribed design values. No substantial difference in the shear
   strength was noted between beams reinforced with either sand-coated or
   milled-surface stirrups. Predictions of ultimate strength using CSA
   S806-12, CSA S6-06, and ACI 440.1R-06 were all found to be safe if the
   prescribed strain limits for FRP transverse reinforcement were used.
   Finally, it was shown that performance of the reinforcement at load
   levels close to service condition with respect to shear cracking was of
   critical importance, as evidenced by the observations that measured
   shear cracks were wider in some cases than flexure cracks.}},

Abstract = {{A series of three shear panels with transverse reinforcing ratios

   Extensive experimental results including strain distributions and
   cracking patterns were analyzed to explain this discrepancy, and it was
   determined that shear behavior under reversed cyclic conditions is not
   well captured by a single rotating crack model; rather, explicit
   consideration of both diagonal crack systems is required. This analysis
   has shown that the behavior can be rationally explained by considering
   the evolution of crack slip and crack closing hysteresis.}},

Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{218-224}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide was investigated for use as a beneficial admixture to
   concrete as it was truck mixed. The reaction between the CO2 and the
   hydrating cement creates finely distributed calcium carbonate reaction
   products that thereby influence the subsequent hydration. Comparisons of
   the fresh, hardened and durability properties were made between a
   reference concrete batch, a batch that contained a conventional
   accelerating admixture, and three batches subjected to a carbon dioxide
   addition. The optimum dose of carbon dioxide was found to reduce the
   time to initial set by 40\% and increase the one and three day
   compressive strengths by 14\% and 10\% respectively. In comparison to
   the CO2 batch, the conventional accelerator provided greater reductions
   in set time but lower early strength. Concrete durability test results
   indicated that the carbon dioxide process did not compromise the
   expected durability performance of the treated concrete. Carbon dioxide
   is a viable admixture to improve concrete performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Four different polymorphs of nanostructured iron oxyhydroxides, namely;
   goethite (-FeOOH), akaganeite (-FeOOH), lepidocrocite (-FeOOH), and
   feroxyhyte (-FeOOH) were synthesized and fully characterized by X-ray
   diffraction, electron microscopy, UV/Visible spectrophotometry,
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurements, and X-ray photoemission
   spectroscopy. The relationship between these iron oxyhydroxide
   polymorphs and their photocatalytic properties was explored by examining
   the extent of methylene blue (MB) degradation by each polymorph under
   visible-light irradiation. Feroxyhyte exhibited the best photocatalytic
   properties and degraded 85\% of the MB dye in five hours. In comparison,
   goethite, akaganeite, and lepidocrocite degraded only 40\%, 35\%, and
   30\% of the MB in five hours, respectively. To understand this trend,
   the surface area, particle size and shape, and electronic band
   properties were systematically studied and discussed. It was found that
   the rate of MB degradation relates mainly to the surface area of the
   FeOOH polymorphs more than any other factor. This is the first report of
   a comparative study of the physical, electronic, and photocatalytic
   properties of all four polymorphs of nanostructured iron oxyhydroxides.}},

Abstract = {{Conversion of CO2 to CO powered by renewable electricity not only
   reduces CO pollution but also is a means to store renewable energy via
   chemical production of fuels from CO. However, the kinetics of this
   reaction are slow due its large energetic barrier. We have recently
   reported CO2 reduction that is considerably enhanced via local electric
   field concentration at the tips of sharp gold nanostructures. The high
   local electric field enhances CO2 concentration at the catalytic active
   sites, lowering the activation barrier. Here we engineer the nucleation
   and growth of next-generation Au nanostructures. The electroplating
   overpotential was manipulated to generate an appreciably increased
   density of honed nanoneedles. Using this approach, we report the first
   application of sequential electrodeposition to increase the density of
   sharp tips in CO2 electroreduction. Selective regions of the primary
   nanoneedles are passivated using a thiol SAM (self-assembled monolayer),
   and then growth is concentrated atop the uncovered high-energy planes,
   providing new nucleation sites that ultimately lead to an increase in
   the density of the nanosharp structures. The two-step process leads to a
   new record in CO2 to CO reduction, with a geometric current density of
   38 mA/cm(2) at -0.4 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), and a 15-fold
   improvement over the best prior reports of electrochemical surface area
   (ECSA) normalized current density.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a novel two-step linear optimization model to
   calculate energy efficient timetables in metro railway networks. The
   resultant timetable minimizes the total energy consumed by all trains
   and maximizes the utilization of regenerative energy produced by braking
   trains, subject to the constraints in the railway network. In contrast
   to other existing models, which are NP-hard, our model is
   computationally the most tractable one being a linear program. We apply
   our optimization model to different instances of service PES2-SFM2 of
   line 8 of Shanghai Metro network spanning a full service period of one
   day (18 h) with thousands of active trains. For every instance, our
   model finds an optimal timetable very quickly (largest runtime being
   less than 13 s) with significant reduction in effective energy
   consumption (the worst case being 19.27\%). Code based on the model has
   been integrated with Thales Timetable Compiler - the industrial
   timetable compiler of Thales Inc that has the largest installed base of
   communication based train control systems worldwide. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Intra-cardiac flow has been explored for decades but there is still no
   consensus on whether or not healthy left ventricles (LV) may harbour
   turbulent-like flow despite its potential physiological and clinical
   relevance. The purpose of this study is to elucidate if a healthy LV
   could harbour flow instabilities, using image-based computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD). 35 cardiac cycles were simulated in a patient-specific
   left heart model obtained from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR).
   The model includes the valves, atrium, ventricle, papillary muscles and
   ascending aorta. We computed phase-averaged flow patterns, fluctuating
   kinetic energy (FKE) and associated frequency components. The LV
   harbours disturbed flow during diastole with cycle-to-cycle variations.
   However, phase-averaged velocity fields much resemble those of CMR
   measurements and usually reported CFD results. The peak FKE value occurs
   during the E wave deceleration and reaches 25\% of the maximum
   phase-averaged flow kinetic energy. Highest FKE values are predominantly
   located in the basal region and their frequency content reach more than
   200 Hz. This study suggests that high-frequency flow fluctuations in
   normal LV may be common, implying deficiencies in the hypothesis usually
   made when computing cardiac flows and highlighting biases when deriving
   quantities from velocity fields measured with CMR.}},

Abstract = {{In clinical CT images containing thin osseous structures, accurate
   definition of the geometry and density is limited by the scanner's
   resolution and radiation dose. This study presents and validates a
   practical methodology for restoring information about thin bone
   structure by volumetric deblurring of images. The methodology involves 2
   steps: a phantom-free, post-reconstruction estimation of the 3D point
   spread function (PSF) from CT data sets, followed by iterative
   deconvolution using the PSF estimate. Performance of 5 iterative
   deconvolution algorithms, blind, Richardson-Lucy (standard, plus Total
   Variation versions), modified residual norm steepest descent (MRNSD),
   and Conjugate Gradient Least-Squares were evaluated using CT scans of
   synthetic cortical bone phantoms. The MRNSD algorithm resulted in the
   highest relative deblurring performance as assessed by a cortical bone
   thickness error (0.18 mm) and intensity error (150 HU), and was
   subsequently applied on a CT image of a cadaveric skull. Performance was
   compared against micro-CT images of the excised thin cortical bone
   samples from the skull (average thickness 1.08 +/- 0.77 mm). Error in
   quantitative measurements made from the deblurred images was reduced
   82\% (p < 0.01) for cortical thickness and 55\% (p < 0.01) for bone
   mineral mass. These results demonstrate a significant restoration of
   geometrical and radiological density information derived for thin
   osseous features.}},

Title = {{Closed-Loop Interruption of Hippocampal Ripples through Fornix
   Stimulation in the Non-Human Primate}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) arising from
   synchronous bursting in CA3 pyramidal cells and propagating to CA1 are
   thought to facilitate memory consolidation. Stimulation of the CA3 axon
   collaterals comprising the hippocampal commissure in rats interrupts
   sharp-wave ripples and leads to memory impairment. In primates, however,
   these commissural collaterals are limited. Other hippocampal fiber
   pathways, like the fornix, may be potential targets for modulating
   ongoing hippocampal activity, with the short latencies necessary to
   interrupt ripples.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of
   closed-loop stimulation adjacent to the fornix for interrupting
   hippocampal ripples.
   Method: Stimulating electrodes were implanted bilaterally alongside the
   fornix in the macaque, together with microelectrodes targeting the
   hippocampus for recording SWRs. We first verified that fornix
   stimulation reliably and selectively evoked a response in the
   hippocampus. We then implemented online detection and stimulation as
   hippocampal ripples occurred.
   Results: The closed-loop interruption method was effective in
   interrupting ripples as well as the associated hippocampal multi-unit
   activity, demonstrating the feasibility of ripple interruption using
   fornix stimulation in primates.
   Conclusion: Analogous to murine research, such an approach will likely
   be useful in understanding the role of SWRs in memory formation in
   macaques and other primates sharing these pathways, such as humans. More
   generally, closed-loop stimulation of the fornix may prove effective in
   interrogating hippocampal-dependent memory processes. Finally, this
   rapid, contingent-DBS approach may be a means for modifying pathological
   high-frequency events within the hippocampus, and potentially throughout
   the extended hippocampal circuit. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Implementation of highly integrated optical receivers in CMOS promises
   low cost, but combining high gain, low noise, high bandwidth, and low
   power in a CMOS transimpedance amplifier is a challenge. Fortunately,
   the sensitivity of an optical receiver is improved by limiting its
   frontend bandwidth far below the symbol rate and using equalization to
   eliminate the resulting intersymbol interference (ISI). Analysis reveals
   that when using a decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) to cancel all
   postcursor ISI, receiver sensitivity is optimized by taking a front-end
   bandwidth as low as 0.12 fbit, depending upon the frequency response and
   noise spectrum assumed for the front end. This paper presents a 20 Gb/s
   optical receiver with a front-end bandwidth of 3 GHz. The front end is
   designed to have an approximately first-order response, ensuring only
   postcursor ISI, which may be efficiently canceled with a first-order
   infinite-impulse response DFE (IIR-DFE). An IIR-DFE circuit is also
   proposed that obviates the need for an explicit full-rate multiplexor.
   Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS, the receiver achieves 0.705 pJ/b efficiency
   with the IIR-DFE consuming 150 fJ/b. Using a photodiode with 12 GHz
   analog bandwidth and responsivity of 0.5 A/W, the receiver has a
   sensitivity of -5.8 dBm optically modulated amplitude.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new model to find the jointly optimal
   economic manufacturing quantity (EMQ) and preventive maintenance (PM)
   policy for a complex production facility. Unlike the previous joint
   models which dealt with EMQ and maintenance policy considering a single
   unit production facility and traditional maintenance approaches, we
   consider a production facility which consists of two modules with
   economic dependence. The more expensive module (unit 1) is subject to
   condition monitoring (CM), and only the age information of the second
   module (unit 2) is available, which follows a general distribution. The
   deterioration process of unit 1 is modeled as a continuous time
   hidden-Markov process. CM data is available at the end of each
   production run, and it provides only partial information about the
   hidden state of unit 1. The failure state of unit 1 is observable at any
   time. The objective is to develop a jointly optimal lot sizing and
   maintenance policy for a two-unit production facility using multivariate
   Bayesian control approach by minimizing the long-run expected average
   cost per unit time. The problem is formulated and solved in the
   semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) framework. Also, a formula for the
   mean residual life (MRL) of the production facility is derived, which is
   an important statistic for practical applications. A practical example
   of the wind turbine CM and maintenance is provided and a comparison with
   other policies shows an outstanding performance of the new model and the
   control policy proposed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling the muscle response to functional electrical stimulation (FES)
   is an essential step in the design of closed-loop controlled
   neuroprostheses. This study was aimed at identifying the dynamic
   response of ankle plantar-flexors to FES during quiet standing. Thirteen
   healthy subjects stood in a standing frame that locked the knee and hip
   joints. The ankle plantar-flexors were stimulated bilaterally through
   surface electrodes and the generated ankle torque was measured. The
   pulse amplitude was sinusoidally modulated at five different
   frequencies. The pulse amplitude and the measured ankle torque fitted by
   a sine function were considered as input and output, respectively.
   First-order and critically-damped second order linear models were fitted
   to the experimental data. Both models fitted similarly well to the
   experimental data. The coefficient of variation of the time constant
   among subjects was smaller in the case of the second-order model
   compared to the first-order model (18.1\% vs. 79.9\%, p < 0.001). We
   concluded that the critically-damped second-order model more
   consistently described the relationship between isometric ankle torque
   and surface FES pulse amplitude, which was applied to the ankle
   plantar-flexors during quiet standing. (C) 2016 IPEM. Published by

Title = {{Tetherless mobile micrograsping using a magnetic elastic composite
   material}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this letter, we propose and characterize a new type of tetherless
   mobile microgripper for micrograsping that is made of a magnetic elastic
   composite material. Its magnetically-programmable material and
   structures make it the first three-dimensional (3D) mobile microgripper
   that is directly actuated and controlled by magnetic forces and torques.
   With a symmetric four-limb structure, the microgripper is 3.5 mm long
   from tip to tip when it is open and 30 mu m thick. It forms an
   approximate 700 mu m cube when it is closed. The orientation and 3D
   shape of the microgripper are determined by the direction and strength
   of the applied magnetic field, respectively. As a mobile device, the
   microgripper can be moved through aqueous environments for precise
   grasping and transportation of micro-objects, pulled by magnetic
   gradients directly or rolled in rotating magnetic fields. The
   deformation of the microgripper under magnetic actuation is
   characterized by modeling and confirmed experimentally. Being directly
   controlled by magnetic forces and torques, the microgripper is easier
   and more intuitive to control than other magnetic microgrippers that
   require other inputs such as thermal and chemical responses. In
   addition, the microgripper is capable of performing fast repeatable
   grasping motions, requiring no more than 25 ms to change from fully open
   to fully closed in water at room temperature. As a result of its
   large-amplitude 3D deformation, the microgripper can accommodate cargoes
   with a wide range of geometries and dimensions. A pick-and-place
   experiment demonstrates the efficacy of the microgripper and its
   potentials in biomedical, microfluidic, and microrobotic applications.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient and early verification of the chip power distribution network
   is a critical step in modern chip design. Vectorless verification,
   developed over the last decade as an alternative to simulation-based
   methods, requires user-specified current constraints (budgets) and
   checks if the corresponding worst-case voltage drops at all grid nodes
   are below user-specified thresholds. However, obtaining/specifying the
   current constraints remains a burdensome task for users. In this paper,
   we define and address the inverse problem: for a given grid, we would
   like to generate circuit current constraints which, if adhered to by the
   underlying logic, would guarantee grid safety. There are many potential
   applications for this approach, including various grid quality metrics,
   as well as voltage drop aware placement and floorplanning. We give a
   rigorous problem definition and develop some key theoretical results
   related to maximality of the current space defined by the constraints.
   Based on this, we then develop two algorithms for constraints generation
   that target the peak total chip power that is allowed by the grid and
   the uniformity of the temperature distribution. Finally, we develop a
   superior algorithm which targets a combination of both quality metrics.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The liver and spleen are major biological barriers to translating
   nanomedicines because they sequester the majority of administered
   nanomaterials and prevent delivery to diseased tissue. Here we examined
   the blood clearance mechanism of administered hard nanomaterials in
   relation to blood flow dynamics, organ microarchitecture and cellular
   phenotype. We found that nanomaterial velocity reduces 1,000-fold as
   they enter and traverse the liver, leading to 7.5 times more
   nanomaterial interaction with hepatic cells relative to peripheral
   cells. In the liver, Kupffer cells (84.8 +/- 6.4\%), hepatic B cells
   (81.5 +/- 9.3\%) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (64.6 +/-
   13.7\%) interacted with administered PEGylated quantum dots, but splenic
   macrophages took up less material (25.4 +/- 10.1\%) due to differences
   in phenotype. The uptake patterns were similar for two other
   nanomaterial types and five different surface chemistries. Potential new
   strategies to overcome off-target nanomaterial accumulation may involve
   manipulating intra-organ flow dynamics and modulating the cellular
   phenotype to alter hepatic cell interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Older powered chair users' perceptions on and attitudes towards mixed
   reality and modern facilitating technologies, such as tablets and
   smartphones, was explored to inform the design of mixed reality games
   that involve power mobility. Eleven older powered chair users (aged 55
   and over) were interviewed in focus groups about their knowledge of,
   adoption of, experiences with, attitudes about, preferences for, and
   interest in these topics. Questionnaire and interview data were analysed
   using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Findings suggest
   that community-dwelling older powered chair users are a technologically
   forward group that use or are interested in trying new technologies and
   interaction paradigms, with key barriers being identity mismatch,
   affordability, and social acceptability. Although they did not see their
   use of powered chairs, new technologies, and digital entertainment as an
   integrated system, participants were receptive to the idea of
   synchronizing assistive and non-assistive technologies for the purpose
   of social entertainment, advanced training, and/or promoting
   understanding and empathy in others. In particular, the concept of a
   game-based mixed reality platform designed around performance mastery
   for older powered chair users and empathy training for able-bodied
   friends and family members was well-received. Initial resistance due to
   identity mismatch or lack of knowledge was mitigated through explanation
   and examples.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound (US) is one of the most commonly used clinical imaging
   techniques. However, the use of US and US-based intravenous agents
   extends far beyond imaging. In particular, there has been a surge in the
   fabrication of multimodality US contrast agents and theranostic US
   agents for cancer imaging and therapy. The unique interaction of US
   waves with microscale and nanoscale agents has attracted much attention
   in the development of contrast agents and drug-delivery vehicles. The
   dimensions of the agent not only dictate how it behaves in vivo, but
   also how it interacts with US for imaging and drug delivery.
   Furthermore, these agents are also unique due to their ability to
   convert from the nanoscale to the microscale and vice versa, having
   imaging and therapeutic utility in both dimensions. Here, we review
   multimodality and multifunctional US-based agents, according to their
   size, and also highlight recent developments in size conversion US
   agents. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms of cell nucleation and growth are investigated in foam
   injection molding (FIM) using gas-counter pressure (GCP). An in-situ
   mold visualization technique is employed. The application of GCP
   suppresses cell nucleation, and prevents the blowing agent from escaping
   during mold-filling. The inherent structural heterogeneity in the
   regular FIM can be improved because of the uniform cavity pressure when
   employing GCP. The cavity pressure profiles show much faster
   pressure-drop rates using GCP, because the single-phase polymer/gas
   mixture has a lower compressibility than the two-phase polymer/bubble
   mixture. Therefore, both the cell nucleation and growth rates are
   significantly increased through a higher pressure-drop rate on the
   removal of the GCP. The effect of GCP magnitude on the cell morphology
   is explored. When the GCP is lower than the solubility pressure, bimodal
   foaming occurs. As the GCP increases above the solubility pressure, the
   cell density increases because of the higher pressure-drop rate. (c)

Abstract = {{Driven by fuel economy and emission control concerns, modern automotive
   internal combustion engines operate at increasingly higher pressures and
   temperatures. The development of new low emission advanced combustion
   concepts rely on accurate predictions of the fuel mixture formation and
   combustion, sometimes near or across the critical point of the fuel
   blend. The present work provides libraries of thermodynamic and
   transport properties of automotive certification fuel surrogate,
   indolene, and its mixtures with ethanol E5, E10, E15, E20, E25, E50 and
   E85, to be used in the subcritical and supercritical range, in order to
   make transcritical fuel predictions possible and accurate.
   Values of enthalpy, latent heat of vaporisation, isobaric and isodioric
   specific heat capacity, entropy, surface tension, thermal conductivity,
   density, vapour pressure and viscosity are obtained numerically through
   theoretical and semi -empirical correlations and given for all the
   specified mixtures in the form of polynomial functions of temperature.
   The synthesis of the coefficients was obtained by minimising the least
   -squares -errors through a 5th order polynomial regression fit method.
   This format is particularly convenient for implementing computer
   equations or for use in CFD numerical codes. (C) 2016 The Combustion

Abstract = {{The Received Signal Strength (RSS) based fingerprinting approaches for
   indoor localization pose a need for updating the fingerprint databases
   due to dynamic nature of the indoor environment. This process is hectic
   and time-consuming when the size of the indoor area is large. The
   semi-supervised approaches reduce this workload and achieve good
   accuracy around 15 percent of the fingerprinting load but the
   performance is severely degraded if it is reduced below this level. We
   propose an indoor localization framework that uses unsupervised manifold
   alignment. It requires only 1 percent of the fingerprinting load, some
   crowd sourced readings, and plan coordinates of the indoor area. The 1
   percent fingerprinting load is used only in perturbing the local
   geometries of the plan coordinates. The proposed framework achieves less
   than 5mmean localization error, which is considerably better than
   semi-supervised approaches at very small amount of fingerprinting load.
   In addition, the few location estimations together with few fingerprints
   help to estimate the complete radio map of the indoor environment. The
   estimation of radio map does not demand extra workload rather it employs
   the already available information from the proposed indoor localization
   framework. The testing results for radio map estimation show almost 50
   percent performance improvement by using this information as compared to
   using only fingerprints.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{80-91}},

Abstract = {{Abrasive slurry jet micro-machining (ASJM) can etch micro-features such
   as holes and channels in virtually any material. Holes, and to a lesser
   extent, channels machined in brittle materials using ASJM typically
   suffer from substantial edge rounding near the opening. This study
   investigated the erosive mechanism responsible for the rounding in
   borosilicate glass and sintered zirconium tin titanate targets, and
   determined the process parameters capable of minimizing the effect.
   Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) showed that the rounding that
   occurred during ASJM with a water-based slurry was due to the impact of
   particles accelerated by the formation and collapse of cavitation
   bubbles in regions where local pressures were below the vapor pressure
   of water. Further evidence of this was obtained by comparing the
   micro-topography in these regions with that produced by an ultrasonic
   cavitation apparatus in a water-particle slurry. Cavitation-enhanced
   erosion in ASJM was minimized using liquids such as mineral or soybean
   oil that have relatively low vapor pressures, resulting in blind and
   through-holes having sharp entrance and exit holes in glass and sintered
   zirconium tin titanate. The increased viscosity of the test fluids also
   altered the particle trajectories observed in the CFD models, causing
   the cross-sectional shape of the holes to have flatter bottoms and
   steeper sidewalls. In ductile targets such as copper, edge rounding due
   to cavitation-enhanced erosion was found to be much smaller than in
   brittle targets. In glass channels, the use of a soybean oil-based
   slurry eliminated the edge rounding and resulted in flatter bottoms, but
   increased the width by approximately 20\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Existing waste disposal sites are being strained by exceeding their
   volumetric capacities because of exponentially increasing rates of
   municipal solid waste generation worldwide, especially in densely
   populated metropolises. Over the past 40 years, six well-documented and
   analyzed disposal sites experienced catastrophic failure. This research
   presents a novel analysis and design method for implementation of a
   series of in-situ earth berms to slow down the movement of waste
   material flow following a catastrophic failure. This is the first study
   of its kind that employs a dynamic landslide analysis model, DAN-W, and
   the Voellmy rheological model to approximate solid waste avalanche flow.
   A variety of single and multiple berm configuration scenarios were
   developed and tested to find an optimum configuration of the various
   earth berm geometries and number of berms to achieve desired energy
   dissipation and reduction in total waste material runout length. The
   case study application of the novel mitigation measure shows that by
   constructing a series of six relatively inexpensive 3 m high earth berms
   at an optimum distance of 250 m from the slope toe, the total runout
   length of 1000 m and associated fatalities of the Leuwigajah dumpsite
   catastrophic failure in Bandung, Indonesia, could have been reduced by

Abstract = {{Wood ash is typically applied to soils to counteract acidification and
   base cation depletion, but the effects of this ash on the organic layer
   microbial community are rarely studied. We analyzed microbial responses
   to ash addition in two field-scale experiments in Ontario, Canada. One
   experiment was in a young boreal forest soil and the other was in an
   uneven-aged hardwood north-temperate forest soil. We also investigated
   the effects of a natural forest fire near the boreal experiment. In both
   cases, ash addition had no effect on overall microbial biomass and
   respiration, but increased the phylogenetic diversity of bacterial
   communities and the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes taxa, though
   effects on other bacterial taxa were site-specific. Eukaryotic effects
   also varied by experiment; at the boreal site, ash increased eukaryotic
   phylogenetic diversity and decreased the fungi:bacteria ribosomal marker
   ratio, but at the temperate site ash decreased eukaryotic diversity and
   did not affect the fungi:bacteria ratio. There was limited additional
   effect on the boreal soil microbial community of increasing ash addition
   from 0.7 to 5.7 tha(-1), as determined by T-RFLP analysis, though soil
   pH in both experiments increased with higher addition rates. At the
   temperate site, ash effects were consistently stronger for fly ash than
   for bottom ash. In both experiments, only 14 unique bacterial taxa were
   found after ash addition, and the strongest driver of overall community
   composition was the forest type, not ash treatment. In contrast, the
   soil microbial community observed at the forest fire site was clearly
   different. Overall, these results indicate that wood ash addition has
   only minimal effects on the composition of the soil microbial community
   in sites across two distinct global forest biomes. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Algal biofilms were grown to investigate the interaction effects of bulk
   medium CO2 concentration and photon flux density (PFD) on biomass
   productivities. When increasing the CO2 concentration from 0.04\% to
   2\%, while maintaining a PFD of 100 mu mol/m(2)/s, biomass
   productivities increased from similar to 0.5 to 2.0 g/m(2)/d; however,
   the productivities plateaued when CO2 concentrations were incrementally
   increased above 2-12\%. Statistical analysis demonstrates that there is
   a significant interaction between PFD and CO2 concentrations on biomass
   productivities. By simultaneously increasing PFD and CO2 concentrations,
   biomass productivities were significantly increased to 4.0 and 4.1
   g/m(2)/d in the experimental and modeled data, respectively. The second
   order model predicted increases in biomass productivities as both PFD
   and CO2 simultaneously increased yielding an optimum at 440 mu
   mol/m(2)/s and 7.1\%; however, when conditions were extended to the
   highest end of their respective ranges, the conditions were detrimental
   to growth and productivities decreased. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Investigations of the application of gyro-mass dampers with various
   types of supplemental dampers for vibration control of building
   structures}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{174-186}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{A gyro-mass damper (GMD) is an inertia-based passive control device. It
   has a gear assembly that amplifies the rotational inertias developed in
   the gears and generates a resultant resisting force that is proportional
   to the relative acceleration at the end terminals of the GMD. The
   amplification provided by the gear assembly can be adjusted by changing
   the gear masses or the gear ratios of the compound gears. Although
   similar inertia-based devices have been successfully used for vibration
   mitigation of motor vehicles and optical tables, there are only a few
   studies that investigated their application in building structures. This
   number is even lower for the particular type of inertial damper that has
   been considered in this study, i.e., GMD. Unlike other types of inertial
   dampers, the supplemental energy dissipation component of GMD5 is not
   built-in to the device and can be independently attached as an external
   component. This allows the design engineers to use this cost-effective
   device and select any available energy dissipation device to use in
   parallel. In this study, using a small-scale GMD, by considering the
   rotational inertias of the intermediate gears, characteristic equation
   which describes the relationship between the applied relative
   acceleration and the resulting resisting force is derived and
   experimentally verified. For the introduction of GMDs into building
   structures, three different configurations are evaluated: (i)
   stand-alone GMD, (ii) GMD-brace system, and (iii) GMD-Viscous
   damper-Brace (GVB) system. The structure-GMD interaction, considering
   these three configurations, is investigated in frequency domain and in
   time domain through energy balance equations and time history analyses.
   It is shown that by selecting the system parameters properly, GVB
   systems with nonlinear viscous dampers can effectively improve the
   seismic behaviour of the structure. This is discussed in more detail
   when the effects of the damper non-linearities, as well as the various
   GMD equivalent mass, brace stiffness, damping values and selected ground
   motions are investigated. The key findings related to the design,
   implementation and performance considerations of these systems are
   provided. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Multiscale modeling of stress transfer in continuous microscale fiber
   reinforced composites with nano-engineered interphase}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{117-131}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This study is focused on the mechanical properties and stress transfer
   behavior of multiscale composites containing nano- and micro-scale
   reinforcements. The distinctive feature of construction of this
   composite is such that the carbon nanostructures (CNS) are dispersed in
   the matrix around the continuous microscale fiber to modify
   microfiber-matrix interfacial adhesion. Such CNS are considered to be
   made of aligned CNTs (A-CNTs). Accordingly, multiscale models are
   developed for such hybrid composites. First, molecular dynamics
   simulations in conjunction with the Mori-Tanaka method are used to
   determine the effective elastic properties of nano-engineered interphase
   layer composed of CNS and epoxy. Subsequently, a micromechanical
   pull-out model for a continuous fiber multi-scale composite is
   developed, and stress transfer behavior is studied for different
   orientations of CNS considering their perfect and imperfect interfacial
   bonding conditions with the surrounding epoxy. Such interface condition
   was modeled using the linear spring layer model with a continuous
   traction but a displacement jump. The current pull-out model accounts
   for the radial as well as the axial deformations of different
   orthotropic constituent phases of the multiscale composite. The results
   from the developed pull-out model are compared with those of the finite
   element analyses and are found to be in good agreement. Our results
   reveal that the stress transfer characteristics of the multiscale
   composite are significantly improved by controlling the CNT morphology
   around the fiber, particularly, when they are aligned along the axial
   direction of the microscale fiber. The results also show that the
   CNS-epoxy interface weakening significantly influences the radial stress
   along the length of the microscale fiber. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Dust reduction in abrasive jet micro-machining using liquid films}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{301}},
Pages = {{1270-1274}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Abrasive jet micro-machining (AJM) uses a high-velocity particle jet to
   erode features in target substrates for a variety of applications,
   including micro-electro-mechanical and micro-fluidic device fabrication.
   AJM can result in a dusty environment due primarily to airborne,
   rebounding abrasive particles that eventually settle. This paper
   proposes a novel concept of covering the target with a layer of liquid
   in order to improve the process cleanliness. Films of water, glycerin,
   and a polymer solution were used to investigate the effect of liquid
   viscosity and film thickness on the percentage of captured particles,
   and also on the depth, width, erosion rate, roughness, and waviness of
   abrasive jet micro-machined channels.
   The glycerin film captured up to 61\% of the rebounding particles during
   the machining of micro-channels. The channel depth, width, erosion rate,
   and roughness decreased, and the channel centreline waviness increased.
   Films of the long-chain polymer solution and of pure water absorbed up
   to 42\% and 36\%, respectively, of the rebounding particles, while not
   significantly changing the channel depth, width, roughness, and
   waviness. For all liquids, the percentage of trapped particles increased
   with increasing film thickness. The results showed that AJM with the
   target covered by a thin liquid film is a viable way of increasing
   process cleanliness by decreasing the amount of airborne particulates.

Journal = {{IIE TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1016-1026}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we introduce an age-based replacement policy in which
   the preventive replacements are restricted to specific calendar times.
   Under the new policy, the assets are renewed at failure or if their ages
   are greater than or equal to a replacement age at given calendar times,
   whichever occurs first. This policy is logistically applicable in
   industries such as utilities where there are large and geographically
   diverse populations of deteriorating assets with different installation
   times. Since preventive replacements are performed at fixed times, the
   renewal cycles are dependent random variables. Therefore, the classic
   renewal reward theorem cannot be directly applied. Using the theory of
   Markov chains with general state space and a suitably defined ergodic
   measure, we analyze the problem to find the optimal replacement age,
   minimizing the long-run expected cost per time unit. We further find the
   limiting distributions of the backward and forward recurrence times for
   this policy and show how our ergodic measure can be used to analyze more
   complicated policies. Finally, using a real data set of utility wood
   poles' maintenance records, we numerically illustrate some of our
   results including the importance of defining an appropriate ergodic
   measure in reducing the computational expense.}},

Abstract = {{A new competing risk model is proposed to calculate the Conditional Mean
   Residual Life (CMRL) and Conditional Reliability Function (CRF) of a
   system subject to two dependent failure modes, namely, degradation
   failure and catastrophic failure. The degradation process can be
   represented by a three-state continuous-time stochastic process having a
   healthy state, a warning state, and a failure state. The system is
   subject to condition monitoring at regular sampling times that provides
   partial information about the system is working state and only the
   failure state is observable. To model the dependency between two failure
   modes, it is assumed that the joint distribution of the time to
   catastrophic failure and sojourn time in the healthy state follow
   Marshal-Olkin bivariate exponential distributions. The
   Expectation-Maximization algorithm is developed to estimate the model's
   parameters and the explicit formulas for the CRF and CMRL are derived in
   terms of the posterior probability that the system is in the warning
   state. A comparison with a previously published model is provided to

Abstract = {{Semiconductors with bandgaps in the near-to mid-infrared can harvest
   solar light that is otherwise wasted by conventional single-junction
   solar cell architectures. In particular, colloidal quantum dots (CQDs)
   are promising materials since they are cost-effective, processed from
   solution, and have a bandgap that can be tuned into the infrared (IR)
   via the quantum size effect. These characteristics enable them to
   harvest the infrared portion of the solar spectrum to which silicon is
   transparent. To date, IR CQD solar cells have been made using a wasteful
   and complex sequential layer-by-layer process. Here, we demonstrate
   similar to 1 eV bandgap solar-harvesting CQD films deposited in a single
   step. By engineering a fast-drying solvent mixture for metal
   iodide-capped CQDs, we deposited active layers greater than 200 nm in
   thickness having a mean roughness less than 1 nm. We integrated these
   films into infrared solar cells that are stable in air and exhibit power
   conversion efficiencies of 3.5\% under illumination by the full solar
   spectrum, and 0.4\% through a simulated silicon solar cell filter.

Abstract = {{Current methods for fabricating thermoplastic microfluidic devices are
   either appropriate for prototyping in research labs, or for mass
   production for commercialization purposes. However, methods for
   fabricating plastic microfluidic devices in medium volume production
   have not been demonstrated, and thus, creates a gap in manufacturing
   methods. A medium volume manufacturing method would be practical and
   necessary during the technology development phase when many fabricated
   devices may be required for testing and validation, but design
   modifications may still be required, thereby making mass production
   unnecessary and not economical. This study demonstrates the feasibility
   of combining hot embossing and milling methods to achieve medium volume
   production of thermoplastic microfluidic devices with high replication
   fidelity. Hot embossing parameters were tested and optimized on two
   different embossing systems and for two different plastics (COP and
   PMMA). Using these optimal hot embossing parameters together with
   improvements in epoxy mold fabrication and a streamlined milling
   procedure, a production rate of similar to 50 devices per week was
   achieved during a proof-of-concept medium volume production run.
   Importantly, this approach also provides a flexible strategy that can
   accommodate prototype design changes without resulting in long
   development delays. Overall, results provide evidence that medium
   production levels can be performed in research labs and in industry,
   thereby providing an accelerated path to commercialization. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Using a scaling analysis, we assess the impact of interfacial slip on
   the time required for the thin liquid film between two drops undergoing
   a head-on collision to drain to the critical thickness for rupture by
   van der Waals forces. Interfacial slip is included in our continuum
   development using a Navier slip boundary condition, with the slip
   coefficient modeled using previous theories {[}Helfand and Tagami, J.
   Chem. Phys. 57, 1812 (1972); Goveas and Fredrickson, Eur. Phys. J. B 2,
   79 (1998)]. Slip decreases hydrodynamic resistance and speeds up film
   drainage. It renders the dependence of the drainage time on capillary
   number stronger in the spherical-film regime, but, interestingly, this
   dependence is altered only weakly in the dimpled-film regime. A subtle
   effect of slip is that it increases the range of capillary numbers in
   which the film remains predominantly spherical in shape during drainage
   (as opposed to being dimpled), leading to significantly faster drainage
   for these capillary numbers. Slip also leads to an increase in the
   critical capillary number beyond which coalescence is not possible in a
   head-collision.}},

Abstract = {{Herein quantum efficiency enhancements are demonstrated in
   multi-junction solar cells with one-dimensional Selectively Transparent
   and Conducting Photonic Crystal (STCPC) intermediate Bragg reflectors.
   Specifically, the modelling, design and fabrication of series-connected
   multi-junction cells comprising a top amorphous-silicon cell and a
   bottom crystalline-silicon heterojunction cell with spectrally tunable
   STCPC intermediate reflectors (IR) is presented. Wave-optics modeling
   analysis shows current density gains of up to 17.4\% and 10.4\% compared
   to multi-junction cells without an IR and with an industry standard IR
   comprising a ZnO film, respectively. Fabricated multi-junction cells
   based on these modelled structures demonstrate that the STCPC IR
   enhances cell currents by 17.1\% and 13.2\% compared to the reference
   cases without an IR and with a ZnO film IR, respectively. From an
   efficiency standpoint, the STCPC IR improved cell performance by 7.9\%
   over reference cells without an IR, but was 8.9\% less efficient
   relative to the reference cells with a ZnO IR. The lower overall
   efficiency of the tandem cell with the STCPC IR with respect to that of
   the cell with the ZnO IR is primarily due to non optimal electrical
   performance of the STCPC compared to the single ZnO layer. Methods for
   improving the electrical properties are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a voxel-based methodology is introduced for the
   hybridization of a pore network with interspersed nano-porous material
   elements allowing pore network based oxygen diffusivity calculations in
   a 3D image of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell gas
   diffusion layer (GDL) with an embedded microporous layer (MPL). The
   composite GDL is modeled by combining a hybrid network of block MPL
   elements with prescribed bulk material properties and a topologically
   equivalent network of larger discrete pores and throats that are
   directly derived from the 3D image of the GDL substrate. This hybrid
   network was incorporated into a pore network model, and effective
   diffusivity predictions of GDL materials with MPL coatings were
   obtained. Stochastically generated numerical models of carbon paper
   substrates with and without MPLs were used, and the pore space was
   directly extracted from this realistic geometry as the input for the
   pore network model. The effective diffusion coefficient of MPL-coated
   GDL materials was predicted from 3D images in a pore network modeling
   environment without resolving the nano-scale structure of the MPL. This
   method is particularly useful due to the disparate length scales that
   are involved when attempting to capture pore-scale transport in the GDL.
   Validation was performed by comparing our predicted diffusivity values
   to analytical predictions, and excellent agreement was observed. Upon
   conducting a mesh sensitivity study, it was determined that an MPL
   element size of 7 mm provided sufficiently high resolution for
   accurately describing the MPL nano-structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Socket}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED}},

Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{Quantum computing architectures are on the verge of scalability, a key
   requirement for the implementation of a universal quantum computer. The
   next stage in this quest is the realization of quantum error-correction
   codes, which will mitigate the impact of faulty quantum information on a
   quantum computer. Architectures with ten or more quantum bits (qubits)
   have been realized using trapped ions and superconducting circuits.
   While these implementations are potentially scalable, true scalability
   will require systems engineering to combine quantum and classical
   hardware. One technology demanding imminent efforts is the realization
   of a suitable wiring method for the control and the measurement of a
   large number of qubits. In this work, we introduce an interconnect
   solution for solid-state qubits: the quantum socket. The quantum socket
   fully exploits the third dimension to connect classical electronics to
   qubits with higher density and better performance than two-dimensional
   methods based on wire bonding. The quantum socket is based on
   spring-mounted microwires-the three-dimensional wires-that push directly
   on a microfabricated chip, making electrical contact. A small wire cross
   section (approximately 1 mm), nearly nonmagnetic components, and
   functionality at low temperatures make the quantum socket ideal for
   operating solid-state qubits. The wires have a coaxial geometry and
   operate over a frequency range from dc to 8 GHz, with a contact
   resistance of approximately 150 m Omega, an impedance mismatch of
   approximately 10 Omega, and minimal cross talk. As a proof of principle,
   we fabricate and use a quantum socket to measure high-quality
   superconducting resonators at a temperature of approximately 10 mK.
   Quantum error-correction codes such as the surface code will largely
   benefit from the quantum socket, which will make it possible to address
   qubits located on a two-dimensional lattice. The present implementation
   of the socket could be readily extended to accommodate a quantum
   processor with a (10 x 10)-qubit lattice, which would allow for the
   realization of a simple quantum memory.}},

Abstract = {{Immunoprecipitation (IP) is a common method for isolating a targeted
   protein from a complex sample such as blood, serum, or cell lysate. In
   particular, IP is often used as the primary means of target purification
   for the analysis by mass spectrometry of novel biologically derived
   pharmaceuticals, with particular utility for the identification of
   molecules bound to a protein target. Unfortunately, IP is a
   labor-intensive technique, is difficult to perform in parallel, and has
   limited options for automation. Furthermore, the technique is typically
   limited to large sample volumes, making the application of IP cleanup to
   precious samples nearly impossible. In recognition of these challenges,
   we introduce a method for performing microscale IP using magnetic
   particles and digital microfluidics (DMF-IP). The new method allows for
   80\% recovery of model proteins from approximately microliter volumes of
   serum in a sample-to-answer run time of approximately 25 min. Uniquely,
   analytes are eluted from these small samples in a format compatible with
   direct analysis by mass spectrometry. To extend the technique to be
   useful for large samples, we also developed a macro-to-microscale
   interface called preconcentration using liquid intake by paper (P-CLIP).
   This technique allows for efficient analysis of samples >100x larger
   than are typically processed on microfluidic devices. As described
   herein, DMF-IP and P-CLIP-DMF-IP are rapid, automated, and multiplexed
   methods that have the potential to reduce the time and effort required
   for IP sample preparations with applications in the fields of pharmacy,
   biomarker discovery, and protein biology.}},

   FOLLOWING PERIPHERAL NERVE INJURY AND REPAIR IN RATS}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Despite advances in surgery, patients with nerve injuries frequently
   have functional deficits. We previously demonstrated in a rat model that
   daily electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) following peripheral nerve
   injury and repair enhances reinnervation, detectable as early as two
   weeks post-injury. In this study, we explain the enhanced early
   reinnervation observed with electrical stimulation. In two groups of
   rats, the tibial nerve was transected and immediately repaired.
   Gastrocnemius muscles were implanted with intramuscular electrodes for
   sham or muscle stimulation. Muscles were stimulated daily, eliciting 600
   contractions for one hour/day, repeated five days per week. Sixteen days
   following nerve injury, muscles were assessed for functional
   reinnervation by motor unit number estimation methods using
   electromyographic recording. In a separate cohort of rats, surgical and
   electrical stimulation procedures were identical but muscles and distal
   nerve stumps were harvested for molecular analysis. We observed that
   stimulated muscles had significantly higher motor unit number counts.
   Intramuscular levels of brain-derived and glial cell line-derived
   neurotrophic factor (BDNF and GDNF) mRNA were significantly upregulated
   in muscles that under - went daily electrical stimulation compared to
   those without stimulation. The corresponding levels of trophic factor
   mRNA within the distal stump were not different from one another,
   indicating that the intramuscular electrical stimulus does not modulate
   Schwann cell-derived trophic factor transcription. Stimulation over a
   three-month period maintained elevated muscle -derived GDNF but not BDNF
   mRNA. In conclusion, EMS elevates intramuscular trophic factor mRNA
   levels which may explain how EMS enhances neural regeneration following
   nerve injury. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Steam-treated wood pellets: Environmental and financial implications
   relative to fossil fuels and conventional pellets for electricity
   generation}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{180}},
Pages = {{637-649}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Steam-treated pellets can help to address technical barriers that limit
   the uptake of pellets as a fuel for electricity generation, but there is
   limited understanding of the cost and environmental impacts of their
   production and use. This study investigates life cycle environmental
   (greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions) and financial
   implications of electricity generation from steam-treated pellets,
   including fuel cycle activities (biomass supply, pellet production, and
   combustion) and retrofit infrastructure to enable 100\% pellet firing at
   a generating station that previously used coal. Models are informed by
   operating experience of pellet manufacturers and generating stations
   utilising coal, steam-treated and conventional pellets. Results are
   compared with conventional pellets and fossil fuels in a case study of
   electricity generation in northwestern Ontario, Canada. Steam-treated
   pellet production has similar GHG impacts to conventional pellets as
   their higher biomass feedstock requirement is balanced by reduced
   process electricity consumption. GHG reductions of more than 90\%
   relative to coal and similar to 85\% relative to natural gas (excluding
   retrofit infrastructure) could be obtained with both pellet options.
   Pellets can also reduce fuel cycle air pollutant emissions relative to
   coal by 30\% (NOx), 97\% (SOx), and 75\% (PM10). Lesser retrofit
   requirements for steam-treated pellets more than compensate for
   marginally higher pellet production costs, resulting in lower
   electricity production cost compared to conventional pellets (\$0.14/kW
   h vs. \$0.16/kW h). Impacts of retrofit infrastructure become
   increasingly significant at lower generating station capacity factors,
   further favouring steam-treated pellets for both environmental and
   financial metrics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation has been conducted with respect to the

   required magnetic flux density. The effects of different values of omega
   and B were investigated by analyzing the driven flow intensity, surface
   and internal quality, macrostructure, microstructure and tensile

Abstract = {{Gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines are increasingly prevalent in
   the global vehicle fleet. Particulate matter emissions from GDI engines
   are elevated compared to conventional gasoline engines. The pulmonary
   effects of these higher particulate emissions are unclear. This study
   investigated the pulmonary responses induced by GDI engine exhaust using
   an ex vivo model. The physiochemical properties of GDI engine exhaust
   were assessed. Precision cut lung slices were prepared using Balb/c mice
   to evaluate the pulmonary response induced by one-hour exposure to
   engine-out exhaust from a laboratory GDI engine operated at conditions
   equivalent to vehicle highway cruise conditions. Lung slices were
   exposed at an air-liquid interface using an electrostatic aerosol in
   vitro exposure system. Particulate and gaseous exhaust was fractionated
   to contrast mRNA production related to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
   (PAH) metabolism and oxidative stress. Exposure to GDI engine exhaust
   upregulated genes involved in PAH metabolism, including Cyp1a1 (2.71, SE
   = 0.22), and Cyp1b1 (3.24, SE = 0.12) compared to HEPA filtered air (p <
   0.05). GDI engine exhaust further increased Cyp1b1 expression compared
   to filtered GDI engine exhaust (i.e., gas fraction only), suggesting
   this response was associated with the particulate fraction. Exhaust
   particulate was dominated by high molecular weight PAHs. Hmox1, an
   oxidative stress marker, exhibited increased expression after exposure
   to GDI (1.63, SE = 0.03) and filtered GDI (1.55, SE = 0.04) engine
   exhaust compared to HEPA filtered air (p < 0.05), likely attributable to
   a combination of the gas and particulate fractions. Exposure to GDI
   engine exhaust contributes to upregulation of genes related to the
   metabolism of PAHs and oxidative stress. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Two new graphene allotropes, penta-graphene and phagraphene, have been
   proposed recently with unique electronic properties, e.g. quasi-direct
   band gap, direction-dependent Dirac cones and tunable Fermi velocities.
   However, their mechanical properties have not been fully studied yet. In
   this work, we have performed extensive density functional theory
   calculations to evaluate the mechanical properties of these two
   materials and compared with graphene, graphane, and pentaheptite. Our
   simulations show that the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and the strain
   corresponding to UTS in both penta-graphene and phagraphene are smaller
   than that of graphene. A complete set of nonlinear anisotropic elastic
   constants up to the fourth order have been determined for these two
   allotropes using the tenets of continuum mechanics by fitting the
   stress-strain responses under uniaxial and biaxial tension until the
   point of fracture. We propose a new physical explanation for
   penta-graphene's negative Poisson's ratio based on the atomic
   de-wrinkling mechanism, driven by the local Hellman-Feynman force on
   each atom. Additionally, we used charge density plot and virtual
   Scanning Tunneling Microscopy images to analyze the initiation of
   fracture under uniaxial and biaxial tensile loading in these two
   materials. The charge density plots reveal that the charge density in
   sp(3) bonds is lower than that in the sp(2) bonds. In phagraphene, all
   the broken bonds were found to belong to the largest carbon ring in the
   structure.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Identification of necrosis in tumors is of prognostic value in treatment
   planning, as necrosis is associated with aggressive forms of cancer and
   unfavourable outcomes. To facilitate rapid detection of necrosis with
   Mass Spectrometry (MS), we report the lipid MS profile of necrotic
   breast cancer with Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry
   (DESI-MS) imaging validated with statistical analysis and correlating
   pathology. This MS profile is characterized by (1) the presence of the
   ion of m/z 572.48 {[}Cer(d34:1) + Cl](-) which is a ceramide absent from
   the viable cancer subregions; (2) the absence of the ion of m/z 391.25
   which is present in small abundance only in viable cancer subregions;
   and (3) a slight increase in the relative intensity of known breast
   cancer biomarker ions of m/z 281.25 {[}FA(18:1)-H](-) and 303.23
   {[}FA(20:4)-H](-). Necrosis is accompanied by alterations in the tissue
   optical depolarization rate, allowing tissue polarimetry to guide
   DESI-MS analysis for rapid MS profiling or targeted MS imaging. This
   workflow, in combination with the MS profile of necrosis, may permit
   rapid characterization of necrotic tumors from tissue slices. Further,
   necrosis-specific biomarker ions are detected in seconds with single MS
   scans of necrotic tumor tissue smears, which further accelerates the
   identification workflow by avoiding tissue sectioning and slide
   preparation.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial protein synthesis is an essential, conserved, and
   environmentally responsive process. Yet, many of its components and
   dependencies remain unidentified. To address this gap, we used
   quantitative synthetic genetic arrays to map functional relationships
   among >48,000 gene pairs in Escherichia coli under four culture
   conditions differing in temperature and nutrient availability. The
   resulting data provide global functional insights into the roles and
   associations of genes, pathways, and processes important for efficient
   translation, growth, and environmental adaptation. We predict and
   independently verify the requirement of unannotated genes for normal
   translation, including a previously unappreciated role of YhbY in 30S
   biogenesis. Dynamic changes in the patterns of genetic dependencies
   across the four growth conditions and data projections onto other
   species reveal overarching functional and evolutionary pressures
   impacting the translation system and bacterial fitness, underscoring the
   utility of systematic screens for investigating protein synthesis,
   adaptation, and evolution.}},

Abstract = {{We are interested in characterizing how brain networks interact and
   communicate with each other during voluntary movements. We recorded
   electrical activities from the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi),
   subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the motor cortex during voluntary wrist
   movements. Seven patients with dystonia and six patients with
   Parkinson's disease underwent bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS)
   electrode placement. Local field potentials from the DBS electrodes and
   scalp EEG from the electrodes placed over the motor cortices were
   recorded while the patients performed externally triggered and
   self-initiated movements. The coherence calculated between the motor
   cortex and STN or GPi was found to be coupled to its power in both the
   beta and the gamma bands. The association of coherence with power
   suggests that a coupling in neural activity between the basal ganglia
   and the motor cortex is required for the execution of voluntary
   movements. Finally, we propose a mathematical model involving coupled
   neural oscillators which provides a possible explanation for how
   inter-regional coupling takes place.}},

Title = {{Does conservation account for splicing patterns?}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Alternative mRNA splicing is critical to proteomic diversity
   and tissue and species differentiation. Exclusion of cassette exons,
   also called exon skipping, is the most common type of alternative
   splicing in mammals.
   Results: We present a computational model that predicts absolute (though
   not tissue-differential) percent-spliced-in of cassette exons more
   accurately than previous models, despite not using any `hand-crafted'
   biological features such as motif counts. We achieve nearly identical
   performance using only the conservation score (mammalian phastCons) of
   each splice junction normalized by average conservation over 100 bp of
   the corresponding flanking intron, demonstrating that conservation is an
   unexpectedly powerful indicator of alternative splicing patterns. Using
   this method, we provide evidence that intronic splicing regulation
   occurs predominantly within 100 bp of the alternative splice sites and
   that conserved elements in this region are, as expected, functioning as
   splicing regulators. We show that among conserved cassette exons,
   increased conservation of flanking introns is associated with reduced
   inclusion. We also propose a new definition of intronic splicing
   regulatory elements (ISREs) that is independent of conservation, and
   show that most ISREs do not match known binding sites or splicing
   factors despite being predictive of percent-spliced-in.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that one mechanism for the
   evolutionary transition from constitutive to alternative splicing is the
   emergence of cis-acting splicing inhibitors. The association of our
   ISREs with differences in splicing suggests the existence of novel
   RNA-binding proteins and/or novel splicing roles for known RNA-binding
   proteins.}},

Title = {{TMSEEG: A MATLAB-Based Graphical User Interface for Processing
   Electrophysiological Signals during Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Concurrent recording of electroencephalography (EEG) during transcranial
   magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an emerging and powerful tool for studying
   brain health and function. Despite a growing interest in adaptation of
   TMS-EEG across neuroscience disciplines, its widespread utility is
   limited by signal processing challenges. These challenges arise due to
   the nature of TMS and the sensitivity of EEG to artifacts that often
   mask TMS evoked potentials (TEP)s. With an increase in the complexity of
   data processing methods and a growing interest in multi-site data
   integration, analysis of TMS-EEG data requires the development of a
   standardized method to recover TEPs from various sources of artifacts.
   This article introduces TMSEEG, an open-source MATLAB application
   comprised of multiple algorithms organized to facilitate a step-by-step
   procedure for TMS-EEG signal processing. Using a modular design and
   interactive graphical user interface (GUI), this toolbox aims to
   streamline TMS-EEG signal processing for both novice and experienced
   users. Specifically, TMSEEG provides: (i) targeted removal of
   TMS-induced and general EEG artifacts; (ii) a step-by-step modular
   workflow with flexibility to modify existing algorithms and add
   customized algorithms; (di) a comprehensive display and quantification
   of artifacts; (iv) quality control check points with visual feedback of
   TEPs throughout the data processing workflow; and (v) capability to
   label and store a database of artifacts. In addition to these features,
   the software architecture of TMSEEG ensures minimal user effort in
   initial setup and configuration of parameters for each processing step.
   This is partly accomplished through a close integration with EEGLAB, a
   widely used open-source toolbox for EEG signal processing. In this
   article, we introduce TMSEEG, validate its features and demonstrate its
   application in extracting TEPs across several single- and multi-pulse
   TMS protocols. As the first open-source GUI-based pipeline for TMS-EEG
   signal processing, this toolbox intends to promote the widespread
   utility and standardization of an emerging technology in brain research.}},

Title = {{Surface patterning of nanoparticles with polymer patches}},
Journal = {{NATURE}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{7623}},

Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Patterning of colloidal particles with chemically or topographically
   distinct surface domains (patches) has attracted intense research
   interest(1-3). Surface-patterned particles act as colloidal analogues of
   atoms and molecules(4,5), serve as model systems in studies of phase
   transitions in liquid systems(6), behave as `colloidal surfactants'(7)
   and function as templates for the synthesis of hybrid particles(8). The
   generation of micrometre- and submicrometre-sized patchy colloids is now
   efficient(9-11), but surface patterning of inorganic colloidal
   nanoparticles with dimensions of the order of tens of nanometres is
   uncommon. Such nanoparticles exhibit size-and shape-dependent optical,
   electronic and magnetic properties, and their assemblies show new
   collective properties(12). At present, nanoparticle patterning is
   limited to the generation of two-patch nanoparticles(13-15), and
   nanoparticles with surface ripples(16) or a `raspberry' surface
   morphology(17). Here we demonstrate nanoparticle surface patterning,
   which utilizes thermodynamically driven segregation of polymer ligands
   from a uniform polymer brush into surface-pinned micelles following a
   change in solvent quality. Patch formation is reversible but can be
   permanently preserved using a photocrosslinking step. The methodology
   offers the ability to control the dimensions of patches, their spatial
   distribution and the number of patches per nanoparticle, in agreement
   with a theoretical model. The versatility of the strategy is
   demonstrated by patterning nanoparticles with different dimensions,
   shapes and compositions, tethered with various types of polymers and
   subjected to different external stimuli. These patchy nanocolloids have
   potential applications in fundamental research, the self-assembly of
   nanomaterials, diagnostics, sensing and colloidal stabilization.}},

Abstract = {{There is a clinical need for new, more effective treatments for chronic
   wounds in diabetic patients. Lack of epithelial cell migration is a
   hallmark of nonhealing wounds, and diabetes often involves endothelial
   dysfunction. Therefore, targeting re-epithelialization, which mainly
   involves keratinocytes, may improve therapeutic outcomes of current
   treatments. In this study, we present an integrin-binding prosurvival
   peptide derived from angiopoietin-1, QHREDGS
   (glutamine-histidine-arginine-glutamic acid-aspartic
   acid-glycine-serine), as a therapeutic candidate for diabetic wound
   treatments by demonstrating its efficacy in promoting the attachment,
   survival, and collective migration of human primary keratinocytes and
   the activation of protein kinase B Akt and MAPK(p42/44). The QHREDGS
   peptide, both as a soluble supplement and when immobilized in a
   substrate, protected keratinocytes against hydrogen peroxide stress in a
   dose-dependent manner. Collective migration of both normal and diabetic
   human keratinocytes was promoted on chitosan-collagen films with the
   immobilized QHREDGS peptide. The clinical relevance was demonstrated
   further by assessing the chitosan-collagen hydrogel with immobilized
   QHREDGS in full-thickness excisional wounds in a db/db diabetic mouse
   model; QHREDGS showed significantly accelerated and enhanced wound
   closure compared with a clinically approved collagen wound dressing,
   peptide-free hydrogel, or blank wound controls. The acceleratedwound
   closure resulted primarily from faster re-epithelialization and
   increased formation of granulation tissue. There were no observable
   differences in blood vessel density or size within the wound; however,
   the total number of blood vessels was greater in the
   peptide-hydrogeltreated wounds. Together, these findings indicate that
   QHREDGS is a promising candidate for wound-healing interventions that
   enhance reepithelialization and the formation of granulation tissue.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal cord injury (SCI) can result in paralysis of trunk muscles, which
   can affect sitting balance. The objective of this study was to analyze
   trunk muscle coordination of individuals with thoracic SCI and compare
   it to able-body individuals. A total of 27 individuals were recruited
   and subdivided into: (a) high thoracic SCI; (b) low thoracic SCI; and
   (c) able-body groups. Participants were seated and asked to lean their
   trunk in eight directions while trunk muscle activity was recorded.
   Muscle coordination was assessed using the non-negative matrix
   factorization (NMF) method to extract muscle modules, which are the
   synergistic trunk muscle activations, and their directional activation
   patterns. Our results showed that individuals with SCI used less muscle
   modules, more co-contractions, and less directional tuning, compared to
   able-bodied people. These results suggest impaired and simplified muscle
   coordination due to the loss of supraspinal input after SCI. Observed
   variability in muscle coordination within SCI groups also suggests that
   other mechanisms such as spasticity and muscle stretch reflexes or
   individual factors such as experience and training contributed to the
   postural muscle synergies. Overall, muscle coordination deficits
   revealed impaired neuromuscular strategies which provide implications
   for rehabilitation of trunk muscles during sitting balance after SCI.

Abstract = {{Due to the need for adequate statistically homogeneous training,
   full-dimensional space-time adaptive processing (STAP) is well accepted
   to be impractical. Several previous works have addressed this issue by
   reducing the adaptive degrees of freedom (DoF), in turn reducing the
   required training. In this paper, we introduce a new multistage STAP
   approach that significantly reduces the required sample support while
   still processing all available DoF. The multistage fast fully adaptive
   (FFA) scheme draws inspiration from the butterfly structure of the fast
   Fourier transform. It uses a ``divide-and-conquer{''} approach by
   creating several smaller STAP problems but then combines the outputs of
   each problem adaptively as well. The reduction in required sample
   support rivals currently available reduced DoF algorithms. We also
   develop three variants of the algorithm, including one that uses random
   subdivisions of the original STAP problem. We test the efficacy of the
   algorithms developed via simulations based on simulated airborne radar
   data and measured high-frequency surface wave radar data. The results
   show that for simulated homogeneous data, the performance of the FFA
   approaches is comparable to that of available STAP algorithms; however,
   with measured data, the FFA approach provides significantly better
   performance.}},

Title = {{Arabidopsis TH2 Encodes the Orphan Enzyme Thiamin Monophosphate
   Phosphatase}},
Journal = {{PLANT CELL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2683-2696}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{To synthesize the cofactor thiamin diphosphate (ThDP), plants must first
   hydrolyze thiamin monophosphate (ThMP) to thiamin, but dedicated enzymes
   for this hydrolysis step were unknown and widely doubted to exist. The
   classical thiamin-requiring th2-1 mutation in Arabidopsis thaliana was
   shown to reduce ThDP levels by half and to increase ThMP levels 5-fold,
   implying that the THIAMIN REQUIRING2 (TH2) gene product could be a
   dedicated ThMP phosphatase. Genomic and transcriptomic data indicated
   that TH2 corresponds to At5g32470, encoding a HAD (haloacid
   dehalogenase) family phosphatase fused to a TenA (thiamin salvage)
   family protein. Like the th2-1 mutant, an insertional mutant of
   At5g32470 accumulated ThMP, and the thiamin requirement of the th2-1
   mutant was complemented by wild-type At5g32470. Complementation tests in
   Escherichia coli and enzyme assays with recombinant proteins confirmed
   that At5g32470 and its maize (Zea mays) orthologs GRMZM2G148896 and
   GRMZM2G078283 are ThMP-selective phosphatases whose activity resides in
   the HAD domain and that the At5g32470 TenA domain has the expected
   thiamin salvage activity. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that
   alternative translation start sites direct the At5g32470 protein to the
   cytosol and potentially also to mitochondria. Our findings establish
   that plants have a dedicated ThMP phosphatase and indicate that modest
   (50\%) ThDP depletion can produce severe deficiency symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic radiation emitted from hot objects represents a sizable
   source of energy, one that in most applications is not harvested
   efficiently. Even for a blackbody at 800 degrees C, the radiation
   intensity peaks near 2.7 mu m wavelength, and this requires a
   semiconductor absorber having a band gap in the short-wavelength
   infrared and beyond to enable thermophotovoltaic (TPV) heat recovery.
   Here we report the first solution-processed TPV device to harvest
   efficiently 800 degrees C heat. The active layer consists of colloidal
   quantum dots (CQDs), infrared-absorbing nanoparticles synthesized using
   a scalable solution-based method, having 0.75 eV band gap. We construct
   rectifying junction devices based on controllably p- and n-doped CQD
   solids that benefit from a gradient in electron affinity that extends
   over the devices' thickness. The gradient doped architecture relies on
   engineered charge carrier drift and overcomes the existing limitations
   of small band gap CQD solids. The devices provide 2.7\% efficiency in
   the conversion of optical power from above-band gap photons from a
   blackbody source at 800 +/- 20 degrees C into electrical power. The
   cells were thermally stable up to 140 degrees C, increasing the promise
   of CQD solids for TPV applications.}},

Abstract = {{We report optically enhanced infrared-harvesting colloidal quantum dot

   of a dielectric stack of SiNx and SiO2 with a terminal layer of ITO and
   ZnO in which current can flow, while the back mirror consists of a
   highly reflective gold layer. Adjusting the reflectivity and central
   wavelength of the front mirror as well as the thickness of the active

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the problem of planar maneuvering control for
   bio-inspired underwater snake robots that are exposed to unknown ocean
   currents. The control objective is to make a neutrally buoyant snake
   robot which is subject to hydrodynamic forces and ocean currents
   converge to a desired planar path and traverse the path with a desired
   velocity. The proposed feedback control strategy enforces virtual
   constraints which encode biologically inspired gaits on the snake robot
   configuration. The virtual constraints, parametrized by states of
   dynamic compensators, are used to regulate the orientation and forward
   speed of the snake robot. A two-state ocean current observer based on
   relative velocity sensors is proposed. It enables the robot to follow
   the path in the presence of unknown constant ocean currents. The
   efficacy of the proposed control algorithm for several biologically
   inspired gaits is verified both in simulations for different path
   geometries and in experiments.}},

   time-dependent strength degradation process from water absorption was
   assumed and implemented in the numerical modeling. Next, the progressive
   failure of a roadway from water-rich roofs was analyzed in detail. The
   numerical results agreed well with field measurements and observations.
   This method was demonstrated to reproduce the real phenomenon of roof
   failure in all of its complexity. The numerical results revealed that
   the progressive failure mechanism was characterized by an initial
   fracturing of the roof due to strength degradation, which was followed
   by significant dilation as fractures grew. The large span of the roadway
   further contributed to the roof failure process. The results also
   clearly showed that shear cracks were predominant in the roof and played
   a major role in the behavior of the roadway roof. Additionally, support
   and excavation schemes that affect roof stability were observed. (C)

Title = {{A Novel Data Hierarchical Fusion Method for Gas Turbine Engine
   Performance Fault Diagnosis}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Gas path fault diagnosis involves the effective utilization of
   condition-based sensor signals along engine gas path to accurately
   identify engine performance failure. The rapid development of
   information processing technology has led to the use of multiple-source
   information fusion for fault diagnostics. Numerous efforts have been
   paid to develop data-based fusion methods, such as neural networks
   fusion, while little research has focused on fusion architecture or the
   fusion of different method kinds. In this paper, a data hierarchical
   fusion using improved weighted Dempster-Shaffer evidence theory (WDS) is
   proposed, and the integration of data-based and model-based methods is
   presented for engine gas-path fault diagnosis. For the purpose of
   simplifying learning machine typology, a recursive reduced kernel based
   extreme learning machine (RR-KELM) is developed to produce the fault
   probability, which is considered as the data-based evidence. Meanwhile,
   the model-based evidence is achieved using particle filter-fuzzy logic
   algorithm (PF-FL) by engine health estimation and component fault
   location in feature level. The outputs of two evidences are integrated
   using WDS evidence theory in decision level to reach a final recognition
   decision of gas-path fault pattern. The characteristics and advantages
   of two evidences are analyzed and used as guidelines for data
   hierarchical fusion framework. Our goal is that the proposed methodology
   provides much better performance of gas-path fault diagnosis compared to
   solely relying on data-based or model-based method. The hierarchical
   fusion framework is evaluated in terms to fault diagnosis accuracy and
   robustness through a case study involving fault mode dataset of a
   turbofan engine that is generated by the general gas turbine simulation.
   These applications confirm the effectiveness and usefulness of the
   proposed approach.}},

   Region-Based Approach with Adaptive Resolution}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Speed profile optimization plays an important role in optimal train
   control. Considering the characteristics of an electrical locomotive
   with regenerative braking, this paper proposes a new algorithm for
   target speed profile approximation. This paper makes the following three
   contributions: First, it proves that under a certain calculation
   precision, there is an optimal coast-brake switching region-not just a
   point where the train should be switched from coasting mode to braking
   mode. This is very useful in engineering applications. Second, the paper
   analyzes the influence of regenerative braking on the optimal
   coast-brake switching region and proposes an approximate linear
   relationship between the optimal switching region and the regeneration
   efficiency. Third, the paper presents an average speed equivalent
   algorithm for local speed profile optimization in steep sections. In
   addition, this paper simplifies the proof of the optimality of smooth
   running on a non-steep track in two steps. The effects on energy
   consumption from two important factors (optimal coast and running time)
   are systematically analyzed. Extensive simulations verify these points
   of view and demonstrate that the proposed approximation approach is
   computationally efficient and achieves sufficient engineering accuracy.}},

   Carbon dioxide (CO2) IR absorption spectra were used to demonstrate the
   capability of the DFTIR-PAS method to detect ambient pollutants. A
   linear amplitude response to CO2 concentrations from 100 to 10,000 ppmv
   was observed, leading to a theoretical detection limit of 2 ppmv. The

   imparting the DFTIR-PAS method with a better signal-to-noise ratio and
   lower theoretical detection limit than the single mode. The results

Abstract = {{The reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction driven by Nb2O5
   nanorod-supported Pd nanocrystals without external heating using visible
   and near infrared (NIR) light is demonstrated. By measuring the
   dependence of the RWGS reaction rates on the intensity and spectral
   power distribution of filtered light incident onto the nanostructured
   Pd@Nb2O5 catalyst, it is determined that the RWGS reaction is activated
   photothermally. That is the RWGS reaction is initiated by heat generated
   from thermalization of charge carriers in the Pd nanocrystals that are
   excited by interband and intraband absorption of visible and NIR light.
   Taking advantage of this photothermal effect, a visible and NIR
   responsive Pd@Nb2O5 hybrid catalyst that efficiently hydrogenates CO2 to
   CO at an impressive rate as high as 1.8 mmol gcat(-1) h(-1) is
   developed. The mechanism of this photothermal reaction involves H-2
   dissociation on Pd nanocrystals and subsequent spillover of H to the
   Nb2O5 nanorods whereupon adsorbed CO2 is hydrogenated to CO. This work
   represents a significant enhancement in our understanding of the
   underlying mechanism of photothermally driven CO2 reduction and will
   help guide the way toward the development of highly efficient catalysts
   that exploit the full solar spectrum to convert gas-phase CO2 to
   valuable chemicals and fuels.}},

Journal = {{POLYMER TESTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{88-96}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Pressure-volume temperature (PVT) data for polymer/gas solutions are
   fundamental to the design and control of such polymer processes as
   injection molding, foaming, blending and extraction reaction. Previous
   studies have offered methodologies based on the observation of an
   axisymmetric polymer pendent/sessile drop, which is used to measure the
   polymer's PVT behavior at elevated temperatures and pressures. Because
   polymer generally has high viscosity and elasticity, it is not easy to
   form an axisymmetric shape out of some types of polymer drops. Our study
   uses a novel rotational device in a high-pressure and high-temperature
   cell with a visualization window. This makes it possible to measure the
   PVT behavior of polymer/gas solutions in those cases where it is not
   easy to obtain an axisymmetrically-shaped polymer drop. The degree of
   asymmetry is mathematically defined, and an algorithm is developed to
   integrate the asymmetric profile for determining the PVT (that is, the
   volume swelling) of the polymer/gas solution. We have presented a case
   study on the pressure-volume temperature (PVT) property of a polystyrene
   (PS)/CO2 solution at temperatures elevated in the range of 423 K-523 K
   and at pressures from 6.895 MPa to 27.579 MPa. We found that the volume
   of the asymmetric sessile drops of PS/CO2 in the PS melt determined the
   extent of the melt's swelling with the dissolved CO2. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   women and 4 men) and 20 healthy young adults (age: M = 24 years, SD =
   4.0; 12 women and 8 men) participated in this pilot study. Each
   completed a RIG task, along with the color Stroop test, the Repeatable
   Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, and the Peabody
   Picture Vocabulary Test-Fourth Edition (Dunn \& Dunn, 2007). Several
   statistical features extracted from RIG sequences, including recurrence
   quantification, were found to be related to the other measures through
   correlation, regression, and a neural-network model.
   Results: The authors found significant effects of age in RIG and
   demonstrate that nonlinear machine learning can use measures of RIG to
   accurately predict outcomes from other tools.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that RIG can be used as a relatively
   simple predictor for other tools and in particular seems promising as a
   potential screening tool for selective attention in healthy aging.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Distributed resource allocation and sharing can often be formulated as a
   utility maximization problem, with the objective being the sum of user
   utilities minus a coupled cost. A traditional distributed solution to
   such problems, called ``consistency pricing,{''} decouples the objective
   function via dual decomposition, which is then iteratively solved by the
   subgradient method. However, such gradient-based approaches may require
   many iterations of message passing to converge, which may not be
   sufficient in large-scale real-time applications. In this paper, we
   propose a new fixed-point-like distributed solution to resource sharing
   problems with coupled objective functions. While preserving the simple
   pricing interpretation, our approach speeds up convergence by exploiting
   the structural difference between user utilities and the coupled cost
   function. We theoretically analyze the asynchronous algorithm
   convergence conditions based on contraction mapping. Through a detailed
   case study of cloud bandwidth reservation based on real-world workload
   traces, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm over
   state-of-the-art distributed optimization techniques including gradient
   descent, dual decomposition, and ADMM. In addition, we also extend the
   proposed algorithm to approach a more general class of consensus
   optimization problems with not only a coupled objective function, but
   also a certain class of coupled constraints.}},

Journal = {{IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of efficient content delivery over networks in
   which individual nodes are equipped with content caching capabilities.
   We present a flexible methodology for the design of cooperative,
   decentralized caching strategies that can adapt to real-time changes in
   regional content popularity. This design methodology makes use of a
   recently proposed reduced consensus optimization scheme, in which a
   number of networked agents cooperate in locating the optimum of the sum
   of their individual, privately known objective functions. The outcome of
   the design is a set of dynamic update rules that stipulate how much and
   which portions of each content piece an individual network node ought to
   cache. In implementing these update rules, the nodes achieve a
   collectively optimal caching configuration through nearest-neighbor
   interactions and measurements of local content request rates only.
   Moreover, individual nodes need not be aware of the overall network
   topology or how many other nodes are on the network. The desired caching
   behavior is encoded in the design of individual nodes' costs and can
   incorporate a variety of network performance criteria. Using the
   proposed methodology, we develop a set of content-caching update rules
   designed to minimize the energy consumption of the network as a whole by
   dynamically trading off transport and caching energy costs in response
   to changes in content demand.}},

Abstract = {{The design provisions for seismically isolated bridges in the CAN/CSA-S6
   Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code and the AASHTO Guide Specifications
   for Seismic Isolation Design (AASHTO 2010, 2014) have been developed
   primarily based on ground motions recorded along the west coast of North
   America. Both codes include a simplified analysis procedure that relies
   on an equivalent effective linearization of the nonlinear isolated
   structure together with damping coefficients to account for the effect
   of energy dissipation on the response of the isolated system. The
   appropriateness and range of application of code-specified simplified
   methods were investigated through nonlinear time-history analyses to
   propose improvements to this procedure for the new edition of the
   CSA-S6-2014 code. Based on these analyses, new damping coefficients are
   proposed for Eastern North America (ENA) and new limits for the
   application of the simplified method are defined. For ENA, the method
   with newly proposed damping coefficients can give good bridge
   displacement estimates for equivalent damping ratios of up to 40\%,
   which broadens the possible designs that can be achieved using the
   simplified method. This study also showed that applicability limits
   could be defined more accurately as a function of the system properties.}},

Abstract = {{High-speed videos of oil-coated solid spheres falling through an aqueous
   solution were analyzed to determine the amount of oil separated and the
   velocity of the coated sphere during free fall. The oil-coated sphere
   configuration is relevant to understanding the recovery of oil from oil
   sands; hence, bitumen was used as the oil phase. A new form of a
   capillary number based on a low-Reynolds number solution is introduced
   to characterize the separation process. The proposed particle-based
   capillary number takes into account the effect of the oil film thickness
   and the viscosity ratio. In this study, the separation of oil from an
   oil-coated sphere is examined as a function of the oil film thickness,
   while keeping the viscosity ratio constant at 0.08. From the
   experimental results, it was observed that there is a critical oil film
   thickness beyond which oil separation from a particle is observed.
   Higher oil removal efficiencies are obtained at higher oil film
   thicknesses. The velocity of an oil-coated sphere is higher than the
   velocity of an oil-free sphere due to the lubrication effect of the oil
   layer.}},

Abstract = {{Early detection and efficient treatment modality of early-stage
   peripheral lung cancer is essential. Current nonsurgical treatments for
   peripheral lung cancer show critical limitations associated with various
   complications, requiring alternative minimally invasive therapeutics.
   Porphysome nanoparticle-enabled fluorescence-guided transbronchial
   photothermal therapy (PTT) of peripheral lung cancer was developed and
   demonstrated in preclinical animal models. Systemically administered
   porphysomes accumulated in lung tumors with significantly enhanced
   disease-to-normal tissue contrast, as confirmed in three subtypes of
   orthotopic human lung cancer xenografts (A549, H460, and H520) in mice
   and in an ortho-topic VX2 tumor in rabbits. An in-house prototype
   fluorescence bronchoscope demonstrated the capability of porphysomes for
   in vivo imaging of lung tumors in the mucosal/ submucosal layers,
   providing real-time fluorescence guidance for transbronchial PTT.
   Porphysomes also enhanced the efficacy of transbronchial PTT
   significantly and resulted in selective and efficient tumor tissue
   ablation in the rabbit model. A clinically used cylindrical diffuser
   fiber successfully achieved tumor-specific thermal ablation, showing
   promising evidence for the clinical translation of this novel platform
   to impact upon nonsurgical treatment of early-stage peripheral lung
   cancer. (C) 2016 AACR.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{36-42}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Vegetated roofs are a widely accepted form of green infrastructure
   deployed around the world to contribute to building efficiency and
   climate change mitigation and adaptation through improved
   thermoregulation and water capture. No two roofs are the same, and the
   evaporative cooling functions of green roofs have been linked to a
   number of attributes including plant species combinations and cover,
   substrate type, and the use of supplemental irrigation. Using a
   replicated extensive green roof modular array, temperature change at
   five thermal sensor stations along a vertical gradient was determined to
   examine the effects of irrigation and attributes of the vegetation and
   substrate. Over two seasons, a significant 2 degrees C difference at the
   surface of the substrate and 1.5 degrees C difference 15 cm above the
   substrate layer was found between the treatment combination with the
   highest temperature (grasses and wildflower `meadow' mix, inorganic
   substrate, no irrigation) and the lowest temperature (Sedum plant
   community, organic substrate, supplemental irrigation). Vegetation type
   and cover were important for roof cooling, and overall, Sedum cooled the
   roof significantly more than meadow vegetation. Irrigated meadow
   vegetation in organic substrate performed as well as unirrigated Sedum.
   Supplemental irrigation and organic substrate were important variables
   for roof cooling, although these lead to additional inputs that could
   reduce sustainability in the overall design. Sedum should be promoted to
   improve green roof coolingdue to constant, near 100\% vegetative cover.
   However, additional study is needed to interpret additional benefits
   that might come from combining Sedum and other suitable wildflowers and
   grasses, as well as the role of plant and substrate diversity in
   improving multiple green roof functions. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The present work investigates the influence of welding sequence and
   scheme on residual stresses induced during in-service sleeve repair
   welding of gas pipelines. For this purpose, a 3D thermo-mechanical FE
   analysis is conducted on an 8{''}-Schedule-20, API 5L-X65 steel pipe.
   Two welding sequences for the sleeve-pipe circumferential fillet welds
   are compared in the present study: sequential welding in which one side
   of the sleeve is welded first and then the other side is welded by the
   same welder, and simultaneous welding in which both sides of the sleeve
   are welded concurrently by two welders. Within the simultaneous welding
   sequence, four different welding schemes, designed to investigate the
   influence of the number of welders and welding directions on residual
   stresses, are investigated. The results show that the sequential welding
   sequence induces less residual stresses and distortions. Within the
   simultaneous welding sequence, the back-step welding scheme is found to
   induce the least average residual stresses as compared to other welding
   schemes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Localized corrosion at the weld periphery of AZ31B friction stir spot
   welds has been associated with the formation of a galvanic cell between

   study, the influence of microstructural changes on the electrochemical
   characteristics of FSSW joints is investigated using a combination of
   microcapillary polarization, stress relief heat-treatment and
   micro-hardness testing. It is confirmed that residual stress has no
   significant effect on the corrosion resistance properties of completed
   joints. Also, based on a detailed examination of the electrochemical
   characteristics of materials in the stir zone, TMAZ and HAZ regions,
   grain growth had negligible influence on the corrosion resistance

   transport:properties of InAs nanowire field-effect transistors. A point
   where the nanowire conductance becomes independent of temperature is

   surface states is determined by a spectral analysis of the conductance
   activation energy and used to develop a carrier transport model that
   explains the existence and gate voltage dependence of this point. We
   determine that the position of this point in gate voltage is directly
   related to the fixed oxide charge on the nanowire surface and
   demonstrate the utility of this method for studying surface passivations

Abstract = {{We design quasi-type-II CdSe/CdS core-shell colloidal quantum dots
   (CQDs) exhibiting a suppressed Auger recombination rate. We do so using
   fully atomistic tight-binding wave functions and microscopic Coulomb
   interactions. The recombination rate as a function of the core and shell
   size and shape is tested against experiments. Because of a higher
   density of deep hole states and stronger hole confinement, Auger
   recombination is found to be up to six times faster for positive trions
   compared to negative ones in 4 nm core/10 nm shell CQDs.
   Soft-confinement at the interface results in weak suppression of Auger
   recombination compared to same-bandgap sharp-interface CQDs. We find
   that the suppression is due to increased volume of the core resulting in
   delocalization of the wave functions, rather than due to
   soft-confinement itself. We show that our results are consistent with
   previous effective mass models with the same system parameters.
   Increasing the dot volume remains the most efficient way to suppress
   Auger recombination. We predict that a 4-fold suppression of Auger
   recombination can be achieved in 10 nm CQDs by increasing the core
   volume by using rodlike cores embedded in thick shells.}},

Abstract = {{Organometal halide perovskites exhibit large bulk crystal domain sizes,
   rare traps, excellent mobilities and carriers that are free at room
   temperature-properties that support their excellent performance in
   charge-separating devices. In devices that rely on the forward injection
   of electrons and holes, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), excellent
   mobilities contribute to the efficient capture of non-equilibrium charge
   carriers by rare non-radiative centres. Moreover, the lack of bound
   excitons weakens the competition of desired radiative (over undesired
   non-radiative) recombination. Here we report a perovskite mixed material
   comprising a series of differently quantum-size-tuned grains that
   funnels photoexcitations to the lowest-bandgap light-emitter in the
   mixture. The materials function as charge carrier concentrators,
   ensuring that radiative recombination successfully outcompetes trapping
   and hence non-radiative recombination. We use the new material to build
   devices that exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.8\% and a
   radiance of 80 W sr(-1) m(-2). These represent the brightest and most
   efficient solution-processed near-infrared LEDs to date.}},

Title = {{Catalytic Pathways and Kinetic Requirements for Alkanal Deoxygenation on
   Solid Tungstosilicic Acid Clusters}},
Journal = {{ACS CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Kinetic measurements and acid site titrations were carried out to
   interrogate the reaction network, probe the mechanism of several
   concomitant catalytic cycles, and explain their connection during
   deoxygenation of light alkanals (CnH2nO, n = 3-6) on tungstosilicic acid
   clusters (H4SiW12O40) that leads to hydrocarbons (e.g., light alkenes,
   dienes, and larger aromatics) and larger oxygenates (e.g., alkenals).
   The three primary pathways are (1) intermolecular C=C bond formation,
   which couples two alkanal molecules in aldol-condensation reactions
   followed by rapid dehydration, forming a larger alkenal (C2nH4n-2O), (2)
   intramolecular C=C bond formation, which converts an alkanal directly to
   an n-alkene (C=H) by accepting a hydride ion from H donor and ejecting a
   H2O molecule, and (3) isomerization dehydration, which involves
   self-isomerization of an alkanal to form an allylic alcohol and then
   rapid dehydration to produce an n-diene (CnH2n-2). The initial
   intermolecular C=C bond formation is followed by a series of sequential
   intermolecular C=C bond formation steps; during each of these steps an
   additional alkanal unit is added onto the carbon chain to evolve a
   larger alkenal (C3nH6n-4O and C4nH8n-6O), which upon its
   cyclization-dehydration reaction forms hydrocarbons (CtnH2tn-2t, t =
   2-4, including cycloalkadienes or aromatics). The intermolecular and
   intramolecular C=C bond formation cycles are catalytically coupled
   through intermolecular H-transfer events, whereas the intermolecular C=C
   bond formation and isomerization dehydration pathways share a coadsorbed
   alkanal-alkenol pair as the common reaction intermediate. The carbon
   number of alkanals determines their hydride ion affinities, the
   stabilities of their enol tautomers, and the extent of van der Waals
   interactions with the tungstosilicic clusters; these factors influence
   the stabilities of the transition states or the abundances of reaction
   intermediates in the kinetically relevant steps and in turn the
   reactivities and selectivities of the various cycles.}},

Title = {{Metadynamics-Biased ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Study of Heterogeneous
   CO2 Reduction via Surface Frustrated Lewis Pairs}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The recent discovery of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) capable of
   heterolytically splitting hydrogen gas at the surface of hydroxylated
   indium oxide (In(2)O(3-)x(OH)(y)) nanoparticles has led to interesting
   implications for heterogeneous catalytic reduction of CO2. Although the
   role of surface FLPs in the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction (CO2
   + H-2 > CO + H2O) has been experimentally and theoretically
   demonstrated, the interplay between surface FLPs and temperature and
   their consequences for the reaction mechanism have yet to be understood.
   Here we use well-tempered metadynamics-biased ab initio molecular
   dynamics to obtain the free energy landscape of the multistep RWGS
   reaction at finite temperatures. The reaction is simulated at 20 and 180
   degrees C, and the minimum energy reaction pathways and energy barriers
   corresponding to H-2 dissociation and CO, reduction are obtained. The
   reduction of CO, at the surface FLP catalytically active site, where H-2
   is heterolytically dissociated and bound, is found to be the
   rate-limiting step and is mostly unaffected by increased temperature
   conditions; however, at 180 degrees C the energetic barriers associated
   with the splitting of H-2 and the subsequent adsorption of CO2 are
   reduced by 0.15 and 0.19 eV, respectively. It is suggested that
   increased thermal conditions may enhance reactivity by enabling the
   surface FLP to become further spatially separated. Product H2O is found
   to favor dissociative adsorption over direct desorption from the surface
   of In2O3-x(OH)(y) and may therefore impede sustained catalytic activity
   by blocking surface sites.}},

Abstract = {{Natural extracellular matrices often have a filamentous nature, however,
   only a limited number of artificial extracellular matrices have been
   designed from nanofibrillar building blocks. Here we report the
   preparation of temperature responsive nanofibrillar hydrogels from
   rod-shaped cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) functionalized with a copolymer
   of N-isopropylacrylamide and N,N'-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate. The
   composition of the copolymer was tuned to achieve gelation of the
   suspension of copolymer-functionalized CNCs at 37 degrees C in cell
   culture medium and gel dissociation upon cooling it to room temperature.
   The mechanical properties and the structure of the hydrogel were
   controlled by changing copolymer composition and the CNC-to-copolymer
   mass ratio. The thermoreversible gels were used for the encapsulation
   and culture of fibroblasts and T cells and showed low cytotoxicity.
   Following cell culture, the cells were released from the gel by reducing
   the temperature, thus, enabling further cell characterization. These
   results pave the way for the generation of injectable temperature
   responsive nanofibrillar hydrogels. The release of cells following their
   culture in the hydrogels would enable enhanced cell characterization and
   potential transfer in a different cell culture medium.}},

   the ssPBRs with carriers coated by bacteria and sterilized bacteria were
   on average 26\% and 15\% more than uncoated carriers, respectively.
   Through absorbing and immobilizing nutrients from the bulk medium, the

Abstract = {{Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is an important oil recovery
   strategy for extra heavy oil and bitumen. Operators are under pressure

   Through direct visualization, micromodels provide insight into SAGD, but
   methods to date cannot fully resolve the temperature field which is
   essential to this thermal recovery process. In this work, infrared and
   optical pore-scale imaging of the SAGD process within a micromodel with
   reservoir-relevant pore geometries, fluids, and temperatures was
   performed, and both recovery and pore-scale fluid behavior was
   quantified for different concentrations of alkaline additive. Combined
   microscale flow and high-resolution temperature analysis provide insight
   into pore-scale phenomena, and shed light on the link between the rapid

Abstract = {{It is critical to understand the dynamic tensile failure of confined
   rocks in many rock engineering applications, such as underground
   blasting in mining projects. To simulate the in situ stress state of
   underground rocks, a modified split Hopkinson pressure bar system is
   utilized to load Brazilian disc (BD) samples hydrostatically, and then
   exert dynamic load to the sample by impacting the striker on the
   incident bar. The pulse shaper technique is used to generate a slowly
   rising stress wave to facilitate the dynamic force balance in the tests.
   Five groups of Laurentian granite BD samples (with static BD tensile
   strength of 12.8 MPa) under the hydrostatic confinement of 0, 5, 10, 15,
   and 20 MPa were tested with different loading rates. The result shows
   that the dynamic tensile strength increases with the hydrostatic
   confining pressure. It is also observed that under the same hydrostatic
   pressure, the dynamic tensile strength increases with the loading rate,
   revealing the so-called rate dependency for engineering materials.
   Furthermore, the increment of the tensile strength decreases with the
   hydrostatic confinement, which resembles the static tensile behavior of
   rock under confining pressure, as reported in the literature. The
   recovered samples are examined using X-ray micro-computed tomography
   method and the observed crack pattern is consistent with the
   experimental result.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic load superposed on a static pre-load is a key problem in deep
   underground rock engineering projects. Based on a modified split
   Hopkinson pressure bar test system, the notched semi-circular bend
   (NSCB) method is selected to investigate the fracture initiation
   toughness of rocks subjected to pre-load. In this study, a
   two-dimensional ANSYS finite element simulation model is developed to
   calculate the dimensionless stress intensity factor. Three groups of
   NSCB specimen are tested under a pre-load of 0, 37 and 74 \% of the
   maximum static load and with the loading rate ranging from 0 to 60 GPa
   m(1/2) s(-1). The results show that under a given pre-load, the fracture
   initiation toughness of rock increases with the loading rate, resembling
   the typical rate dependence of materials. Furthermore, the dynamic rock
   fracture toughness decreases with the static pre-load at a given loading
   rate. The total fracture toughness, defined as the sum of the dynamic
   fracture toughness and initial stress intensity factor calculated from
   the pre-load, increases with the pre-load at a given loading rate. An
   empirical equation is used to represent the effect of loading rate and
   pre-load force, and the results show that this equation can depict the
   trend of the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the effects of increasing temperature and loading rate on
   the flexural tensile strength of Laurentian granite, dynamic flexural
   tensile strength experiments were carried out by means of a
   semi-circular bend specimen with a modified split Hopkinson pressure bar
   system. The tests were performed at different loading rates, specimens
   were treated from room temperature up to 850 A degrees C, and a
   high-speed camera was utilized to monitor the failure process of the
   specimen. For samples in the same temperature group, a loading rate
   dependence of the flexural tensile strength was observed; it increased
   consistently with the increase of loading rate. Temperature effects on
   rock mechanical properties were investigated from the microscopic
   viewpoint, and the dynamic flexural tensile strength decreased with the
   treatment temperature. A formula relating dynamic flexural tensile
   strength to loading rate and temperature is presented to quantify the
   results. It was found that the change regulation of the dynamic flexural
   tensile strength of rock is very similar to that of its crack growth
   along with the increase of loading rate, which indicates that the
   essence of rock failure is the initiation and propagation of the
   internal cracks. Compared with our earlier work on dynamic tensile tests
   using the Brazilian test, it was observed that the flexural tensile
   strength is higher than the tensile strength. Non-local failure theory
   can be adopted to explain this discrepancy at low temperature
   conditions, but it is no longer effective at high temperatures. Under
   high loading rates, rock failure is initiated at the centre of the half
   circular disc, and finally it is separated completely into two equal
   parts.}},

Abstract = {{As a material for famous historical underground rock caverns, Longyou
   sandstone (LS) may fail under the combination of high loading rate and

   different dynamic loading rates (ranging from 24 to 540 GPa/s) were then
   obtained using the split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system. The
   dynamic tensile strength of LS increases with the loading rate at a

Abstract = {{FEM-based numerical testing systems of the split Hopkinson pressure bar
   (SHPB) and the split Hopkinson tensile bar (SHTB) are established to
   study the characteristics of rock materials under dynamic compressive
   and tensile loadings. First of all, the accuracy and applicability of
   the numerical testing system are validated and calibrated through
   comparison between the laboratory measurements and the simulation
   results. Subsequently, the dynamic behavior of rock is analyzed in
   detail with the numerical testing system followed by the underlying
   physical mechanism. For the SHPB tests, the simulation results
   demonstrate that the incident waveform is determined by the striker
   length, the striker shape and the pulse shaper. The dynamic increase
   factor (DIF) of the rock specimen varies with different impact
   velocities, which is attributed to the strain rate effect. The rock
   specimen size and bar size also have effects on the DIF. In addition,
   the interfacial friction between the rock specimen and the bars cannot
   be ignored. For the SHTB tests, it is found that the incident waveform
   is dependent on the striker tube length and the striker tube thickness.
   In addition, similar to the SHPB tests, the impact velocity, rock

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simplified coupled thermal-mechanical model for
   the modelling of viscoelastic dampers with temperature- and
   frequency-dependent properties subjected to long-term and short-term
   dynamic loading due to wind and earthquakes. In this numerical model,
   the self-heating effect caused by molecular-level friction in the
   viscoelastic (VE) material is captured explicitly using a finite volume
   thermal diffusion model based only on the physical properties of the
   steel and VE material. The thermal model is coupled to a single degree
   of freedom (SDOF) mechanical model, which produces an efficient
   computational scheme for time-history analyses of VE dampers under both
   long-term and short-term loading scenarios. The predictions from the
   proposed model are compared with full-scale experimental results of
   long-duration wind loading ranging from design level events to extremely
   rare events, and for shorter but more intense seismic loading scenarios.
   It is shown that results obtained using this proposed simplified model
   with idealized geometry predicted well the dynamic response of the
   damper for all ranges of experimental results thus validating a robust
   physics based tool for predicting the response of VE dampers. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Liquid column separation (LCS) in pressurized pipelines may occur if a
   water hammer event drops the local pressure to the liquid's vapor point.
   Numerical simulations of LCS have traditionally been based on
   one-dimensional (1D) transient flow theory; here, a two-dimensional (2D)
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is used to investigate the
   complicated nature of LCS and to help characterize the limitations of
   the traditional 1D models. To this end, the Schnerr-Sauer cavitation
   model with a shear-stress transport (SST) k- turbulence model is
   employed, whereas the Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS)
   equations are solved for the mixture of liquid and vapor. 2D model
   results are compared to both experimental data and to those of the 1D
   discrete vapor-cavity model (DVCM), thus demonstrating that the 2D
   method effectively simulates the pressure variations while helping to
   visualize the associated physical processes. More specifically, the 2D
   simulations vividly reveal the growth and the collapse of the cavity,
   including the formation of an intermediate cavity and both the location
   and shape of the region undergoing distributed vaporous cavitation.}},

Abstract = {{Open eye formation in tundishes can result in reoxidation of liquid
   steel leading to the formation of harmful inclusions. Moreover, it is
   also a site for heat loss, gas absorption, and slag emulsification. All
   these factors make it necessary to understand the fundamentals of open
   eye formation, which in turn will allow us to prevent or control its
   harmful effects. In the present study, the bubble plume regions in a
   ladle and tundish were compared, and it was observed that there are
   significant differences between the two. Moreover, a simplistic model
   for predicting the open eye area in tundishes for `thin slag' practices
   was derived using the principles of conservation of mass and momentum.
   The proposed model was able to predict open eye areas in tundish
   reasonably well and was compared with other models, and experimental

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have provided strong evidence that
   fine particulate matter (PM2.5; aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m) can
   exacerbate asthmatic symptoms in children. Pro-oxidant components of
   PM2.5 are capable of directly generating reactive oxygen species.
   Oxidative burden is used to describe the capacity of PM2.5 to generate
   reactive oxygen species in the lung.
   OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated the association between airway
   inflammation in asthmatic children and oxidative burden of PM2.5
   personal exposure.
   METHODS: Daily PM2.5 personal exposure samples (n = 249) of 62 asthmatic
   school-aged children in Montreal were collected over 10 consecutive
   days. The oxidative burden of PM2.5 samples was determined in vitro as
   the depletion of low-molecular-weight antioxidants (ascorbate and
   glutathione) from a synthetic model of the fluid lining the respiratory
   tract. Airway inflammation was measured daily as fractional exhaled
   nitric oxide (FeNO).
   RESULTS: A positive association was identified between FeNO and
   glutathione-related oxidative burden exposure in the previous 24 hr
   (6.0\% increase per interquartile range change in glutathione).
   Glutathione-related oxidative burden was further found to be positively
   associated with FeNO over 1-day lag and 2-day lag periods. Results
   further demonstrate that corticosteroid use may reduce the FeNO response
   to elevated glutathione-related oxidative burden exposure (no use,
   15.8\%; irregular use, 3.8\%), whereas mold (22.1\%), dust (10.6\%), or
   fur (13.1\%) allergies may increase FeNO in children with versus
   children without these allergies (11.5\%). No association was found
   between PM2.5 mass or ascorbate-related oxidative burden and FeNO
   levels.
   CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to PM2.5 with elevated glutathione-related
   oxidative burden was associated with increased FeNO.}},

Abstract = {{Model order reduction (MOR) techniques play a crucial role in the
   computer-aided design of modern integrated circuits, where they are used
   to reduce the size of parasitic networks. Unfortunately, the efficient
   reduction of passive networks with many ports is still an open problem.
   Existing techniques do not scale well with the number of ports, and lead
   to dense reduced models that burden subsequent simulations. In this
   paper, we propose TurboMOR-RC, a novel MOR technique for the efficient
   reduction of passive RC networks. TurboMOR-RC is based on
   moment-matching at dc, achieved through efficient congruence
   transformations based on Householder reflections. A novel feature of
   TurboMOR-RC is the block-diagonal structure of the reduced models, that
   makes them more efficient than the dense models produced by existing
   techniques. Moreover, the model structure allows for an insightful
   interpretation of the reduction process in terms of system theory.
   Numerical results show that TurboMOR-RC scales more favorably than
   existing techniques in terms of reduction time, simulation time, and
   memory consumption.}},

Volume = {{142}},

Abstract = {{Presented in this paper is a field data-based probabilistic approach to
   quantifying the expected pipe break rates of water distribution systems.
   Uncertain demands and variations in the roughness of pipes during their
   service lives are described as random variables. Sample values of these
   random variables are generated and input to a distribution system model
   to determine the resulting minimum and maximum pressures in Monte Carlo
   simulations. Based on an estimated break rate-maximum pressure
   relationship, the sample maximum pressures obtained from a Monte Carlo
   simulation are transformed into a sample of break rates, and the
   expected pipe break rate can subsequently be determined. The sample
   minimum pressures are used to gain a better understanding of the
   distribution network. This probabilistic approach is used for a part of
   the City of Hamilton's network in Ontario, Canada. The results show that
   the frequency of low-pressure events is very small, but a higher minimum
   pressure criterion would inevitably increase expected pipe break rates.
   Local field data collection is necessary to use the proposed
   methodology. Savings resulting from reduced pipe break rates justify
   costs associated with data collection.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Energy systems are not only intrinsically interesting, because power is
   itself of importance; they raise fascinating trade-offs in other areas
   particularly since there are almost invariably technical, economic, and
   ecological dimensions to these considerations. This paper illustrates
   this interplay through a staged process that starts with a direct
   optimization approach for a pumped-storage facility with the simple goal
   of achieving an optimal profit given well-forecasted flows and energy
   prices. Sir Adam Beck Pumping Generating Station, located on the Niagara
   River, is selected as the subject of the model application. When
   analyzed for probable changes in current electricity rates, a 1-24\%
   reduction in profit is realized depending on the month. Interestingly,
   relative to current design the model predicts only modest profit
   throughout the year with an increasing reservoir footprint. Since
   considerations other than the purely technical quickly arise, this paper
   considers the trade-off between hydropower and ecological targets
   imposed by the 1950 Niagara River Treaty. This exploratory study makes
   no pretense to forecast likely or advisable developments, but rather
   considers a possible role that a pumped-storage operation might
   hypothetically play in the Ontario spot market.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{179}},
Pages = {{110-123}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{The Wind Farm Layout Optimization (WFLO) problem has attracted a lot of
   attention from researchers and industry practitioners, as it has been
   proven that better placement of wind turbines can increase the overall
   efficiency and the total revenue of a wind farm. Although the
   engineering wake models are commonly used for layout optimization, the
   literature seems to have settled on using metaheuristics and stochastic
   optimization methods. In the present study, we show the effectiveness of
   non-linear mathematical programming in solving continuous-variable WFLO
   problems by utilizing exact gradient information of the problem's
   objective and constraints. Moreover, mathematical models for handling
   land -use constraints are developed to solve highly constrained
   practical problems. For demonstration purposes, the results were
   compared with those obtained by a genetic algorithm, using a set of test
   cases that have been frequently used in the WFLO literature. Additional
   test cases with higher dimensionality, significant land -availability
   constraints and higher wind farm turbine densities (i.e., turbines per
   square kilometer) are devised and solved to show the merits of the
   proposed approach. Our results show the superiority of mathematical
   programing in solving this problem, as evidenced by the resulting wind
   farm efficiency and the computational cost required to obtain the
   solutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed at capturing the determinants of near-road
   concentrations of ultrafine particles (UFP) using linear mixed-effects
   models, investigating the effects of meteorology, built environment, and
   traffic. In addition, the differences in the levels of UFP between both
   sides of the road were investigated. To reach these objectives, field
   measurements were conducted on 16 weekdays in the months of March and
   April 2015, along Papineau Avenue, a high-volume street in Montreal,
   Canada. Four sites were identified varying in land use, building height,
   and road characteristics. Air quality measurements were conducted at
   each location (on both sides of the road) for two consecutive hours, at
   four different times during the day and repeated four times, leading to
   a total of 16 visits per location. Traffic volume and composition was
   also recorded. On-site meteorological variables including wind speed,
   wind direction, temperature and relative humidity were collected using a
   portable weather station. Linear mixed-effects models with random
   intercept were developed for both dependent variables: the natural
   logarithm of the mean UFP concentration and the difference in UFP
   concentrations between two sides of the road. Lower temperatures and
   wind speeds were associated with increased UFP concentrations. Winds
   orthogonal to the road tended to increase UFP concentrations as well as
   the differences between both sides of the road. Finally, built
   environment variables such as the presence of open areas and buildings
   on both sides of the road, had a positive influence on the difference
   between UFP on the two sides. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Near-road concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a known marker of
   traffic-related air pollution, were simulated along a busy urban
   corridor in Montreal, Quebec using a combination of microscopic traffic
   simulation, instantaneous emission modeling, and air pollution
   dispersion. In order to calibrate and validate the model, a data
   collection campaign was designed. For this purpose, measurements of NO2
   were conducted mid-block along four segments of the corridor throughout
   a four-week campaign conducted between March and April 2015. The four
   segments were chosen to be consecutive and yet exhibiting variability in
   road configuration and built environment characteristics. Roadside NO2
   measurements were also paired with on-site and fixed-station
   meteorological data. In addition, traffic volumes, composition, and
   routing decisions were collected using video-cameras located `at
   upstream and downstream intersections. Dispersion of simulated emissions
   was conducted for eight time slots and under a range of meteorological
   conditions using three different models with vastly different dispersion
   algorithms (OSPM, CALINE 4, and SIRANE). The three models exhibited poor
   correlation with near-road NO2 concentrations and were better able to
   simulate average concentrations occurring along the road-ways rather
   than the range of concentrations measured under diverse meteorological
   and traffic conditions. As hypothesized, the model SIRANE that can
   handle a street canyon configuration was the most sensitive to the built
   environment especially to the presence of tall buildings around the
   road. In contrast, CALINE exhibited the lowest sensitivity to the built
   environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an asynchronous gossip-based algorithm for finding a
   Nash equilibrium (NE) of a game in a distributed multi-player network.
   The algorithm is designed in such a way that players make decisions
   based on estimates of the other players' actions obtained from local
   neighbors. Using a set of standard assumptions on the cost functions and
   communication graph, the paper proves almost sure convergence to a NE
   for diminishing step sizes. For constant step sizes an error bound on
   expected distance from a NE is established. The effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithm is demonstrated via simulation for both diminishing
   and constant step sizes. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents the finite element (FE) modeling of a new form of
   composite walling system consisting of two skins of profiled steel
   sheeting and an infill of concrete subjected to in-plane impact loading.
   Composite wall specimen tested under impact shear loading in two phases,
   namely Phase I and Phase II was used to develop the FE model. In Phase
   I, the impact test was performed repeatedly keeping the impact energy of
   the projectile low intentionally to capture dynamic characteristics of
   the wall. In Phase II, the impact test was performed once with high
   impact energy (using maximum projectile speed the apparatus could
   produce). The developed FE model was used to simulate
   acceleration/displacement at the top of the wall during impact, impact
   energy dissipation, fundamental period, stress-strain
   development/concentration, shear strain/rate evolution, impact duration
   and bounce back impact time. The FE model predicted values/responses
   were found to be in good agreement with those obtained from experiments.
   Extensive parametric studies were conducted to study the influence of
   varying geometric, material and sheet-concrete interface parameters
   governing the composite wall performance under impact loading using the
   developed FE model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a highly incapacitating condition for which
   there is still no cure. Current clinical approaches are mainly based on
   palliative care, so there is a need to find possible treatments to SCI.
   Cellular transplantation is regarded with great expectation due to the
   therapeutic potential of cells such as Adipose tissue-derived
   Stromal/Stem Cells (ASCs) or Olfactory Ensheathing Cells (OECs). Both
   are accessible sources and present positive paracrine and cell-to-cell
   interactions, previously reported by our group. Additionally,
   biomaterials such as hydrogels have been applied in SCI repair with
   promising results. We propose to combine a GRGDS-modified gellan gum
   hydrogel with ASCs and OECs in order to promote SCI regeneration. In
   vitro, ASCs and OECs could be co-cultured within GG-GRGDS hydrogels
   inducing a more robust neurite outgrowth when compared to controls. In
   vivo experiments in a hemisection SCI rat model revealed that the
   administration of ASCs and OECs encapsulated in a GG-GRGDS hydrogel led
   to significant motor improvements when compared to both control (SCI)
   and hydrogel alone (GG-GRGDS) groups. This was accompanied by a
   decreased infiltration of inflammatory cells and astrocytes, and by an
   increased intensity of neurofilament. These results suggest evident
   gains induced by the encapsulation of ASCs and OECs in GG-GRGDS based
   hydrogels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Furthermore, a matrix protein deficient GP in the packaging vector

Abstract = {{Mitigation of soot emissions from combustion devices is a global
   concern. For example, recent EURO 6 regulations for vehicles have placed
   stringent limits on soot emissions. In order to allow design engineers
   to achieve the goal of reduced soot emissions, they must have the tools
   to so. Due to the complex nature of soot formation, which includes
   growth and oxidation, detailed numerical models are required to gain
   fundamental insights into the mechanisms of soot formation. A detailed
   description of the CoFlame FORTRAN code which models sooting laminar
   coflow diffusion flames is given. The code solves axial and radial
   velocity, temperature, species conservation, and soot aggregate and
   primary particle number density equations. The sectional particle
   dynamics model includes nucleation, PAH condensation and HACA surface
   growth, surface oxidation, coagulation, fragmentation, particle
   diffusion, and thermophoresis. The code utilizes a distributed memory
   parallelization scheme with strip-domain decomposition. The public
   release of the CoFlame code, which has been refined in terms of coding
   structure, to the research community accompanies this paper. CoFlame is
   validated against experimental data for reattachment length in an
   axi-symmetric pipe with a sudden expansion, and ethylene-air and
   methane-air diffusion flames for multiple soot morphological parameters
   and gas-phase species. Finally, the parallel performance and
   computational costs of the code is investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Mono- and double-layer porous scaffolds were successfully fabricated
   using ball-milled agglomerates of Ti and Ti-10Nb-3Mo alloy. For
   selectively controlling the level of porosity and pore size, the
   agglomerates were sieved into two different size fractions of 100-300 pm
   and 300-500 mu m. Compressive mechanical properties were measured on a
   series of cylindrical sintered compacts with different ratios of solid
   core diameter to porous layer width. The graded porous scaffolds
   exhibited stress-strain curves typical for metallic foams with a defined
   plateau region after yielding. The compressive strengths and elastic
   moduli ranged from 300 to 700 MPa and 14 to 55 GPa, respectively,
   depending on the core diameter and the material used. The obtained
   properties make these materials suitable for load-bearing implant
   applications. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this study, an innovative technique is introduced for application of
   annular tuned liquid dampers (ATLD) in wind turbines subjected to
   seismic ground motions. The performance of ATLD in mitigating the
   vibration of wind turbines is investigated using numerical simulations.
   The wind tower is modeled using finite element method while the fluid
   domain is simulated by finite volume method. The numerical study
   considers the dynamic behavior of ATLD under different seismic records.
   Also, the effects of earthquake amplitude and frequency content,
   structural damping and detuning on the interaction between the tower and
   ATLD are investigated. The results of time-history analysis show that
   the ATLD is effective in mitigating the response of a wind turbine when
   subjected to large-amplitude seismic loading. The wind tower equipped
   with the proposed ATLD also behaves in the elastic range of response
   during the considered earthquake records which is critical for the
   integrity and safety of these structures.}},

Abstract = {{Cu(I) complexes are considered as idea emitters in organic
   light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their low cost and theoretical high
   internal quantum efficiency, which are two important issues have to be
   concerned for OLEDs commercialization. However, most Cu(I) complexes are
   unstable toward sublimation and hence not amenable to the vacuum
   deposition method typically used to fabricate OLEDs. To solve this
   problem, a codeposition route that involves codeposition of CuI and
   pyridine derivative has been proposed to synthesis Cu(I) complex emitter
   in situ. Since chemical reactions were conducted in a vacuum chamber, we
   systematically studied the effect of reactant chemical structure,
   reaction ratio, and deposition rate on the in situ synthesized Cu(I)
   complex and its application as an emitter in OLEDs. With an optimal
   chemical reaction condition, the device showed a high external quantum
   efficiency (EQE) up to 14.2\% at a brightness of 100 cd/m(2),
   corresponding to a current and power efficiency of 45.2 cd/A and 33.3
   lm/W, respectively. The performance is comparable to those efficient
   OLEDs with iridium complex emitter, while using a CuI dopant that having
   only one ten-thousandth of price to bis(2-phenylpyridine)
   (acetylacetonate) iridium. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The effect of tongue strength on meal consumption in long term care}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1078-1083}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: As many as 74\% of residents in long-term care (LTC) are
   anticipated to have swallowing difficulties (dysphagia). Low food intake
   is commonly reported in persons with swallowing problems, but food
   intake may also be affected by fatigue in the swallowing muscles. As
   fatigue sets in during mealtimes, the strength of the tongue may
   decline. Tongue strength is also known to decline with age but it is
   unclear how this functional change may influence food intake. In this
   pilot study, we explored the relationship between tongue strength and
   meal consumption in persons not previously diagnosed with dysphagia.
   Methods: The Iowa Oral Performance Instrument was used to collect
   maximum anterior isometric tongue-palate pressures from 12 LTC residents
   (5 male; mean age: 85, range 65-99). Residents were also screened for
   dysphagia with applesauce and a water swallow test. Each resident was
   observed at three different meals to record the length of time taken to
   eat the meal, amount of food consumed, and any indication of overt signs
   of swallowing difficulty (e.g. coughing).
   Results: Residents who displayed observable swallowing difficulties at
   mealtimes had significantly lower tongue strength than those without
   swallowing difficulties (p < 0.01). Those with lower tongue strength
   took significantly longer to complete meals (p < 0.05) and consumed less
   food. Tongue strength was not predictive of performance on the water
   screen and the water swallow test was not a good predictor of which
   participants were observed to display mealtime difficulties.
   Conclusion: Among seniors in long term care, reduced tongue strength is
   associated with longer meal times, reduced food consumption, and the
   presence of observable signs of swallowing difficulty. Further
   exploration of these relationships is warranted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract = {{Experiments were done to study the growth of bubbles in paint films
   sprayed on steel substrates. Highspeed video images were taken of the
   impact of paint spray droplets, generated with an air-atomizing nozzle,
   on a stainless steel surface. Paint droplets stuck to the surface after
   impact and were not dislodged by subsequent droplets landing on them.
   Droplets hitting patches of paint merged with them to form an uneven
   layer. Once the spray was turned off after 0.5 s the paint masses
   settled and formed a uniform film in a few seconds. The paint film
   contained a large number of entrapped air bubbles that migrated to the
   paint surface and disappeared in 4-5 min. Painted substrates were placed
   in an oven at 130 degrees C to cure. Any air bubbles present in the film
   at the start of baking acted as nucleation sites that expanded as paint
   volatiles diffused into them. Waiting 10 min prior to curing ensured
   that the cured paint film was free of bubbles. The diffusion of
   volatiles out of the paint film Was modelled-using a one-dimensional
   analytical solution of the mass diffusion equation. The model was fit to
   experimental measurements of the mass decrease of painted films to
   estimate the diffusivity. of volatiles in paint, D-v = 1.5 x 10(-12)
   m(2)/s. The concentration of volatiles in the paint film after a
   flash-off time of 10 min was estimated to be less than 50\% of the

Abstract = {{Anomalous current-voltage (I-V) characteristics, as reported with
   increasing frequency, can significantly compromise the energy conversion
   efficiency of colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells. This paper
   applied a purely hopping transport model rather than the traditional
   Schottky-diode equation to interpret the anomalous I-V curves measured
   in CQD solar cells with a structure: ITO/ZnO/PbS-TBAI QD/PbS-EDT QD/Au.
   Anomalous I-V curves were found at temperatures below 300 K. A
   double-diode-equivalent electric circuit was developed for the
   quantitative analysis of these anomalous I-V curves, yielding multiple
   hopping transport parameters, such as hopping diffusivity, diffusion
   length, mobility, and lifetime. Quantitative analysis revealed that the
   imbalanced charge carrier mobility in the carrier transport (PbS-TBAI)
   and extraction (PbS-EDT) layers, as well as the existence of a reverse
   Schottky-diode at the PbS-EDT/Au interface, played key roles in the
   formation of the anomalous I-V curves. Furthermore, charge-transfer (CT)
   states, located at the ZnO/PbS-TBAI interface, were found to reduce the
   CQD solar cell open-circuit voltage through radiative and non-radiative
   recombination of excitons. A modified Einstein equation was also
   validated, further proving the presence of a Schottky barrier and
   pointing to a rate determining interface for the I-V behaviors of our
   solar cells. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new hybrid passive power device, denoted as the
   hybrid transformer, which is an improved alternative to the classical

   transformer is comprised of a coupled inductor topology, that provides
   load-source matching, denoted as the mutual branch topology, and a
   dielectric isolation device denoted as the multilayer capacitive
   isolation device. The main focus of this paper is on the design and
   operation of the mutual branch topology. Simulation results are shown to
   highlight the improved efficiency of the hybrid transformer over a
   conventional high-frequency transformer. Finally, the efficiency of the
   hybrid transformer is compared with that of a classical two-winding
   transformer using the same resonant converter, highlighting the improved
   efficiency of the hybrid transformer (up to 10\% improved efficiency for
   light loads).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the mechanical properties, microstructure evolution

   at different temperatures have been interpreted using well known

   have been utilized to detect pertinent microstructural alterations.
   Results indicate that the strength, energy absorption and ductility of

Abstract = {{Nonradiative recombination is one of the key electronic processes in
   semiconductor devices. In this study, we demonstrate that nonradiative
   recombination rate of intermolecular charge-transfer (CT) exciton at
   organic heterojunction increases exponentially with decreasing energy
   difference between the LUMO of acceptor and the HOMO of donor. In
   addition, the effect of orbital overlap between the acceptor LUMOs and
   donor HOMOs on nonradiative recombination is studied using a wide
   bandgap organic spacer layer. It is found that the rate for nonradiative
   CT exciton recombination decreases exponentially as the donor,-acceptor
   separation distance increases. Nonradiative CT exciton recombination is
   an important consideration in selecting materials for organic devices
   such as organic solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes, and so on.}},

Abstract = {{We performed in-situ optical visualization studies of a flowing melt in

   from a stressed melt at elevated temperatures. In the experiments,
   a-tandem extrusion system equipped-with a conical converging flow
   channel with a long tubular end was employed via direct visualization
   techniques. A secondary extruder and a converging channel were used to
   cool the polymer melts uniformly and to create extensional flow,
   respectively. We observed various crystallite morphologies depending
   upon the specific processing conditions, such as the temperature and the
   flow rate. The crystallites' sizes and quantities were quantified
   according to their light intensities. The in-situ observations of the
   flow showed that crystallization was more active in areas where the
   polymer melts were subjected to elongation. Moreover, a higher flow rate
   enhanced the crystallization kinetics by generating a larger molecular
   deformation, especially at lower temperatures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The equilibrium zeta adsorption isotherm for vapours indicates the
   amount adsorbed is finite for vapour-phase pressures approaching the
   saturation value, and is strongly supported by experimental measurements
   for a number of different vapour-solid surface systems. This isotherm
   assumes the adsorbate consists of differently sized molecular clusters
   in local equilibrium rather than the adsorbate being in layers. We use
   the local-equilibrium approximation and develop a method to determine
   the expression for chemical potential of the adsorbate in terms of the
   amount adsorbed, n(A)(t). This allows us to apply statistical rate
   theory to calculate n(A)(t) at five different vapour-phase pressures,
   x(V) (equivalent to P-V/P-sat), in terms of a parameter, r(e).
   Statistical rate theory indicates that r(e) describes the dynamics of a
   given isolated system under equilibrium conditions. We consider two
   methods for determining the value of r(e) that give the best agreement
   with the measurements performed at each of five values of x(V). In one
   method, we assume, r(e), is a function of both temperature, T, and
   pressure, x(V), and determine the five best-fit values of r(e). In the
   experiments, x(V) changes by a factor of more than two, but the standard
   deviation in the r(e) values is 6\%. In the second method, we assume
   r(e) is a function only of T; and find that the value of r(e) is not
   changed significantly. In all cases, the calculated n(A)(t) agree with
   the measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) plays an important role in
   trafficking cholesteryl esters between the core of high density
   lipoprotein and the liver. Interestingly, this integral membrane protein
   receptor is also implicated in the metabolism of cholesterol by cancer
   cells, whereby overexpression of SR-BI has been observed in a number of
   tumors and cancer cell lines, including breast and prostate cancers.
   Consequently, SR-BI has recently gained attention as a cancer biomarker
   and exciting target for the direct cytosolic delivery of therapeutic
   agents. This brief review highlights these key developments in
   SR-BI-targeted cancer therapies and imaging probes. Special attention is
   given to the exploration of high density lipoprotein nanomimetic
   platforms that take advantage of upregulated SR-BI expression to
   facilitate targeted drug-delivery and cancer diagnostics, and promising

Abstract = {{The Mg-Zn-Zr ternary system was experimentally investigated at 450
   degrees C using six diffusion couples and 16 key alloys. Four new
   ternary compounds, IM1, IM2, IM3 and IM4 were detected. The
   compositions, homogeneity ranges, phase relationships and the X-ray
   diffraction patterns of these compounds were identified using scanning
   electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometer
   and x-ray diffraction techniques. The homogeneity ranges of IM1, IM2,
   IM3 and IM4 are Mg(23-26)Zn66Zr(8-11), Mg(15-16)Zn66Zr(18-19),
   Mg(10-11)Zn66Zr(23-24) and Mg(9-13)Zn(79-87)Zr(5-8), respectively. IM1
   compound crystallizes in an MgZn2 structure type with hexagonal
   structure and P6(3)/mmc space group. The Mg Zn and Zn Zr binary
   compounds do not have extended solid solubility into the ternary system.
   The phase boundaries of Mg-Zn-Zr liquid phase at 450 degrees C were
   determined by several key alloys. The single phase liquid region
   extended into the ternary phase diagram only to around 1 at.\% Zr.
   However, phase regions containing liquid along with other phases existed
   in the vicinity of the Mg Zn side up to 10 at\% Zr. Based on the current
   experimental results, the isothermal section of the Mg Zn Zr ternary
   system at 450 degrees C was constructed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) electrodes with large surface areas are highly
   effective biomolecular sensors. These structures can be generated via
   the electrodeposition of gold inside microscale apertures patterned on
   the surface of a microelectronic chip. Such electrodes enable the
   ultrasensitive analysis of nucleic acids, proteins,;and small molecules.
   Since the performance of these electrodes is directly related to their
   surface area, the ability to control their microscale morphology is
   critical. Here, we explore an electrochemical model based on the theory
   of nucleation and growth to better understand how to control the
   morphology of these electrodes., The insights gained from this model
   enabled us to create preferential conditions for the formation of
   different morphological features. We demonstrate for the first time-that
   electrodepostion of 3D nanostructured microelectrodes inside a
   microscale aperture is governed by two stages of nucleation and growth.
   The first stage involves the creation of primary nuclei at the bottom of
   the aperture. The second stage features the generation of new nuclei
   upon exposure to the bulk solution. Depending on the overpotential, the
   deposition is then continued by either rapid growth of the original
   nuclei or, fast growth-of new nuclei. Faster,electrodeposition at high
   overpotentials,promotes. directional growth, generating spiky
   structures. More isotropic growth,is observed with low overpotentials,
   generating rounder features. Ultimately we determine the efficiency of
   DNA hybridization on a variety of structures and identify the optimal
   morphologies for rapid DNA-DNA duplex formation.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the first application of a unique boron subphthalocyanine
   (BsubPc) derivative, the oxygen bridged dimer mu-oxo(BsubPc)(2), as a
   multifunctional material within planar heterojunction organic
   photovoltaic (OPV) devices. We first explored the pairing of
   mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2) with well-known electron accepting and electron
   donating materials to explore its basic functionality. These preliminary
   device structures and metrics indicated that mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2) is best
   applied as an electron donating material when used in simple bilayer
   structures, as it yielded comparable OPV device efficiencies to that of
   the more. well established and highly optimized chloro-boron
   subphthalocyanine. (Cl-BsubPc) OPV device structures. Thereafter we
   established that the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2) are
   well-placed to apply it as a bifunctional donor/acceptor interlayer
   material in both energy and charge cascade OPV device architectures.
   Within this context, we found that mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2) was particularly
   effective in a charge cascade device as an interlayer between Cl-BsubPc
   and C-70. We finally found evidence of an alloying-like effect for
   devices with mixed electron donor layers of (Cl-BsubPc) and
   mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2), achieved through co-deposition. The overarching

Abstract = {{We present a sample of 59 periodic variables from the Palomar Transient
   Factory, selected from published catalogues of white dwarf (WD)
   candidates. The variability can likely be attributed to ellipsoidal
   variation of the tidally distorted companion induced by the gravity of
   the primary (WD or hot subdwarf) or to the reflection of hot emission by
   a cooler companion. We searched 11 311 spectroscopically or
   photometrically selected WD candidates from three hot star/WD
   catalogues, using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to single out promising
   sources. We present period estimates for the candidates, 45 of which
   were not previously identified as periodic variables, and find that most
   have a period shorter than a few days. Additionally, we discuss the
   eclipsing systems in our sample and present spectroscopic data on

Abstract = {{The photochemical release of chemical reagents and bioactive molecules
   provides a useful tool for spatio-temporal control of biological
   processes. However, achieving this goal requires the development of
   highly efficient one- and two-photon sensitive photo-cleavable
   protecting groups. Thiol-containing compounds play critical roles in
   biological systems and bioengineering applications. While potentially
   useful for sulfhydryl protection, the 6-bromo-7-hydroxy
   coumarin-4-ylmethyl (Bhc) group can undergo an undesired
   photoisomerization reaction upon irradiation that limits its uncaging
   efficiency. To address this issue, here we describe the development of
   6-bromo-7-hydroxy-3-methylcoumarin-4-ylmethyl (mBhc) as an improved
   group for thiol-protection. One- and two-photon photolysis reactions
   demonstrate that a peptide containing a mBhc-caged thiol undergoes clean
   and efficient photo-cleavage upon irradiation without detectable
   photoisomer production. To test its utility for biological studies, a
   K-Ras-derived peptide containing an mBhc-protected thiol was prepared by
   solid phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc-Cys(mBhc)-OH for the
   introduction of the caged thiol. Irradiation of that peptide using
   either UV or near IR light in presence of protein farnesyltransferase
   (PFTase), resulted in generation of the free peptide which was then
   recognized by the enzyme and became farnesylated. To show the utility of
   this caging group in biomaterial applications, we covalently modified
   hydrogels with mBhc-protected cysteamine. Using multi-photon confocal
   microscopy, highly defined volumes of free thiols were generated inside
   the hydrogels and visualized via reaction with a sulfhydryl-reactive
   fluorophore. The simple synthesis of mBhc and its efficient removal by
   one- and two-photon processes make it an attractive protecting group for
   thiol caging in a variety of applications.}},

   constellation mapping and a low-density parity-check code are developed
   for this regime to show a reach improvement of 7.1\%. These shaping
   schemes can also be extended to 64-QAM, where a reach improvement of

Journal = {{PROSTATE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{1169-1181}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-guided focal laser
   therapy has shown early promise in Phase 1 trial treating
   low/intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer (PCa), but the lack of
   tumor selectivity and low efficiency of heat generation remain as
   drawbacks of agent-free laser therapy. Intrinsic multifunctional
   porphyrin-nanoparticles (porphysomes) have been exploited to treat
   localized PCa by MRI-guided focal photothermal therapy (PTT) with
   significantly improved efficiency and tumor selectivity over prior
   methods of PTT, providing an effective and safe alternative to active
   surveillance or radical therapy.
   METHODS. The tumor accumulation of porphysomes chelated with copper-64
   was determined and compared with the clinic standard F-18-FDG in an
   orthotropic PCa mouse model by positron emission tomography (PET)
   imaging, providing quantitative assessment for PTT dosimetry. The PTT
   was conducted with MRI-guided light delivery and monitored by MR
   thermometry, mimicking the clinical protocol. The efficacy of treatment
   and adverse effects to surround tissues were evaluated by histology
   analysis and tumor growth in survival study via MRI.
   RESULTS. Porphysomes showed superior tumor-to-prostate selectivity over
   F-18-FDG (6: 1 vs. 0.36: 1). MR thermometry detected tumor temperature
   increased to greater than or less than 55 degrees C within 2min (671 nm
   at 500mW), but minimal increase in surrounding tissues. Porphysome
   enabled effective PTT eradication of tumor without damaging adjacent
   organs in orthotropic PCa mouse model.
   CONCLUSIONS. Porphysome-enabled MRI-guided focal PTT could be an
   effective and safe approach to treat PCa at low risk of progression,
   thus addressing the significant unmet clinical needs and benefiting an
   ever-growing number of patients who may be over-treated and risk
   unnecessary side effects from radical therapies. (C) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide
   (CO) is the first step in the synthesis of more complex carbon-based
   fuels and feedstocks using renewable electricity(1-7). Unfortunately,
   the reaction suffers from slow kinetics(7,8) owing to the low local
   concentration of CO2 surrounding typical CO2 reduction reaction
   catalysts. Alkali metal cations are known to overcome this limitation
   through non-covalent interactions with adsorbed reagent species(9,10),
   but the effect is restricted by the solubility of relevant salts. Large
   applied electrode potentials can also enhance CO2 adsorption(11), but
   this comes at the cost of increased hydrogen (H-2) evolution. Here we
   report that nanostructured electrodes produce, at low applied
   overpotentials, local high electric fields that concentrate electrolyte
   cations, which in turn leads to a high local concentration of CO2 close
   to the active CO2 reduction reaction surface. Simulations reveal tenfold
   higher electric fields associated with metallic nanometre-sized tips
   compared to quasi-planar electrode regions, and measurements using gold
   nanoneedles confirm a field-induced reagent concentration that enables
   the CO2 reduction reaction to proceed with a geometric current density
   for CO of 22 milliamperes per square centimetre at -0.35 volts
   (overpotential of 0.24 volts). This performance surpasses by an order of
   magnitude the performance of the best gold nanorods, nanoparticles and
   oxide-derived noble metal catalysts. Similarly designed palladium
   nanoneedle electrocatalysts produce formate with a Faradaic efficiency
   of more than 90 per cent and an unprecedented geometric current density
   for formate of 10 milliamperes per square centimetre at -0.2 volts,
   demonstrating the wider applicability of the field-induced reagent
   concentration concept.}},

Title = {{Wind farm layout optimization on complex terrains - Integrating a CFD

Abstract = {{In recent years, wind farm optimization has received much attention in
   the literature. The aim of wind farm design is to maximize energy
   production while minimizing costs. The wind farm layout optimization
   (WFLO) problem on uniform terrains has been tackled by a number of
   approaches; however, optimizing wind farm layouts on complex terrains is
   challenging due to the lack of accurate, computationally tractable wake
   models to evaluate wind farm layouts. This paper proposes an algorithm
   that couples computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with mixed-integer
   programming (MIP) to optimize layouts on complex terrains. CFD
   simulations are used to iteratively improve the accuracy of wake deficit
   predictions while MIP is used for the optimization process. The ability
   of MIP solvers to find optimal solutions is critical for capturing the
   effects of improved wake deficit predictions on the quality of wind farm
   layout solutions. The proposed algorithm was applied on a wind farm
   domain in Carleton-sur-Mer, Quebec, Canada. Results show that the
   proposed algorithm is capable of producing excellent layouts in complex
   terrains. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Photocatalytic decomposition of organic micropollutants using

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{351-361}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Organic micropollutants found in the environment are a diverse group of
   compounds that includes pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and
   endocrine disruptors. Their presence in the aquatic environment
   continues to be a concern as the risk they pose towards both the
   environment and human health is still inconclusive. Removal of these
   compounds from water and wastewater is difficult to achieve and often
   incomplete, but UV-TiO2 is a promising treatment approach. In this
   study, the efficiency of titanium dioxide (TiO2) immobilized on porous
   supports were tested for treatment of target pharmaceuticals and their
   metabolites under UV-LED exposure, a potential low energy and cost
   effective alternative to conventional UV lamps. Immobilization was
   completed using two different methods: (1) dip coating of TiO2 onto
   quartz fiber filters (QFT) or (2) thermal-chemical oxidation of porous
   titanium sheets (PIT). Comparison against experimental controls (dark
   QFT, dark PTT, and photolysis using UV LED only) showed that UV-LED/PTT
   and UV-LED/QFT treatments have the potential to reduce the
   concentrations of the target compounds. However, the treatments were
   found to be selective, such that individual pharmaceuticals were removed
   well using QFT and FIT but not both. The complementary treatment
   behavior is likely driven by electrostatic interactions of charged
   compounds with the membranes. QFT membranes are negatively charged at
   the experimental pH (4.5-5) while FIT membranes are positively charged.
   As a result, cationic compounds interact more with QFT while anionic
   compounds with FIT. Neutral compounds, however, were found to be
   recalcitrant under any treatment conditions suggesting that ionic
   interactions were important for reactions to occur. This behavior can be
   advantageous if specificity is required. The behavior of pharmaceutical
   metabolites is similar to the parent compounds. However, isomeric
   metabolites of atorvastatin with functional groups in para and ortho
   configurations behave differently, suggesting that the positioning of
   functional groups can have an impact in their interaction with the
   immobilized TiO2. It was also apparent that FIT can be reused after
   cleaning by heat treatment. Overall, these newly synthesized membrane
   materials have potential applications for treatment of trace organic
   contaminants in water. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   bitumen solutions via surfactant-mediated tip streaming}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{180}},
Pages = {{538-550}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{After extraction via surface mining, bitumen froth is purified by
   reducing its particle and water content in the naphthenic froth
   treatment section. The ineffectiveness of this treatment in reducing
   water content below 2 wt\% is, however, known only too well, and arises
   primarily due to the exceedingly small sizes of the emulsified water
   droplets. Using a flow-focusing microfluidic device, we demonstrate a
   possible mechanism for the formation of fine water droplets -
   surfactant-mediated tip streaming. Via this mechanism, a drop, when
   sheared in a flow, can produce droplets that can be more than two orders
   of magnitude smaller than the parent drop. The capillary number, which
   represents the strength of flow-induced drop stretching forces relative
   to shape-restoring interfacial tension forces, was found to range
   between 0.35 and 0.9 to observe tip streaming. It was discovered that
   naphthenic acids, and not asphaltenes, are the primary
   interfacially-active species responsible for tip streaming. Higher
   bitumen dilutions, which reduce viscosity contrast, and higher basic pH,
   which amplifies interfacial concentrations and decreases interfacial
   tension gradients, were found to suppress tip streaming. It was also
   demonstrated that even a mere second of exposure of water droplets to
   flow conditions conducive to tip streaming is capable of producing a
   volume fraction of micron/sub-micron water droplets comparable to the
   residual water fraction in bitumen after froth treatment. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{G protein-coupled receptors constitute the largest family of trans
   membrane signaling proteins and the largest pool of drug targets, yet
   their mechanism of action remains obscure. That uncertainty relates to
   unresolved questions regarding the supramolecular nature of the
   signaling complex formed-by receptor and G protein. We therefore have
   characterized the oligomeric status of eGFP tagged M-2 muscarinic
   receptor (M2R) and G(i1) by single-particle photobleaching of
   immobilized complexes. The method was calibrated With multiplexed
   controls comprising 1-4 copies of fused eGFP. The photobleaching
   patterns of eGFP-M2R were indicative of a tetramer and unaffected by
   muscarinic ligands; those of eGFP-G(i1) were indicative of a hexamer and
   unaffected by GTP gamma S. A complex of M2R and G(i1) was tetrameric in
   both, and activation by a full agonist plus GTP gamma S reduced the
   oligomeric size of G(i1) without affecting that of the receptor. A
   similar reduction was observed upon activation of eGFP-Ga-i1 by the
   receptor-mimic mastoparan plus GTP gamma S, and constitutively active
   eGFP-Ga-i1 was predominantly dimeric. The oligomeric nature of G(i1) in
   live CHO cells was demonstrated by means of Forster resonance energy
   transfer and dual-color fluorescence correlation spectroscopy in studies
   with eGFP- and mCherry-labeled G alpha(i1); stochastic FRET was ruled
   out by means of non-interacting pairs. These results suggest that the
   complex between M2R and holo-G(i1) is an octamer comprising four copies
   of each, and that activation is accompanied by a decrease in the
   oligomeric size of G(i1). The structural feasibility of such a complex
   was demonstrated in molecular dynamics simulations.}},

   greatest challenges currently facing modern medicine. The development of
   innovative techniques for the rapid and accurate identification of
   bacterial pathogens in point-of-care facilities using low-cost, portable

   This technology exploits bacteriocins, protein toxins naturally produced

   bacteriocins are integrated with an array of potassium-selective sensors
   in Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor technology to provide an
   inexpensive bacterial biosensor. An electronic platform connects the
   CMOS sensor to a computer for processing and real-time visualization. We
   have used this technology to successfully identify both Gram-positive

Abstract = {{In this work, pore network modelling was used to investigate the role of
   the microporous layer (MPL) in the redistribution of phosphoric acid
   (PA) in a high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell
   (HT-PEMFC) gas diffusion electrode (GDE). A HT-PEMFC GDE composed of a
   catalyst layer (sprayed in-house), MPL, and fibrous substrate was
   assembled, and its three-dimensional (3D) geometry was imaged using
   synchrotron X-ray microcomputed tomography. The spatial distribution of
   pore spaces and their connections were identified based on the 3D
   geometry, and an equivalent pore network of the GDE was obtained for
   simulating the PA transport with an invasion percolation algorithm. The
   predicted mass redistribution of PA in the GDE was found to be in
   excellent agreement with experimental values reported in the literature.
   The presence of the MPL was found to encourage the redistribution of PA
   within the CL and inhibited PA leaching toward the channel. To the
   authors' best knowledge, this study is the first numerical simulation of
   PA transport in a HT-PEMFC GDE. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Organolead halide perovskites are a family of hybrid organic-inorganic
   compounds whose remarkable optoelectronic properties have been under
   intensive scrutiny in recent years. Here we use inelastic x-ray
   scattering to study low-energy lattice excitations in single crystals of
   methylammonium lead iodide and bromide perovskites. Our findings confirm
   the displacive nature of the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition, which
   is further shown, using neutron and x-ray diffraction, to be close to a
   tricritical point. Lastly, we detect quasistatic symmetry-breaking
   nanodomains persisting well into the high-temperature cubic phase,
   possibly stabilized by local defects. These findings reveal key
   structural properties of these materials, and also bear important
   implications for carrier dynamics across an extended temperature range
   relevant for photovoltaic applications.}},

Abstract = {{Focused ultrasound offers a non-invasive way of depositing acoustic
   energy deep into the body, which can be harnessed for a broad spectrum
   of therapeutic purposes, including tissue ablation, the targeting of
   therapeutic agents, and stem cell delivery. Phased array transducers
   enable electronic control over the beam geometry and direction, and can
   be tailored to provide optimal energy deposition patterns for a given
   therapeutic application. Their use in combination with modern medical
   imaging for therapy guidance allows precise targeting, online
   monitoring, and post-treatment evaluation of the ultrasound-mediated
   bioeffects. In the past there have been some technical obstacles
   hindering the construction of large aperture, high-power,
   densely-populated phased arrays and, as a result, they have not been
   fully exploited for therapy delivery to date. However, recent research
   has made the construction of such arrays feasible, and it is expected
   that their continued development will both greatly improve the safety
   and efficacy of existing ultrasound therapies as well as enable
   treatments that are not currently possible with existing technology.
   This review will summarize the basic principles, current statures, and
   future potential of image-guided ultrasound phased arrays for therapy.}},

Abstract = {{With wearable electronics rapidly coming into fashion, research into
   flexible energy storage devices and in particular, pliable electrodes,
   is attracting a lot of attention. Pliable electrodes are usually
   fabricated by intercalating an active material in a flexible matrix with
   superior mechano-electrical properties, and can be grouped either as
   substrate-supported or free-standing. Depending on their mode of
   deformation the electrodes can be labeled as bendable, compressible or
   stretchable. Recent progress and challenges in the design and
   fabrication of pliable electrodes for constructing flexible lithium ion
   batteries and flexible supercapacitors are highlighted. 2 pliable
   core-shell structure electrodes fabricated from: a) carbon nanotube
   sponge embedded with MoS2 nanoparticles and b) electrospun polyethylene
   terephthalate fibers impregnated with graphene nanoplatelets are also
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{The neural stemcell decision to self-renewor differentiate is tightly
   regulated by its microenvironment. Here, we have asked about this
   microenvironment, focusing on growth factors in the embryonic cortex at
   a time when it is largely comprised of neural precursor cells (NPCs) and
   newborn neurons. We show that cortical NPCs secrete factors that promote
   their maintenance, while cortical neurons secrete factors that promote
   differentiation. To define factors important for these activities, we
   used transcriptome profiling to identify ligands produced by NPCs and
   neurons, cell-surface mass spectrometry to identify receptors on these
   cells, and computational modeling to integrate these data. The resultant
   model predicts a complex growth factor environment with multiple
   autocrine and paracrine interactions. We tested this communication
   model, focusing on neurogenesis, and identified IFNg, Neurturin (Nrtn),
   and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) as ligands with unexpected
   roles in promoting neurogenic differentiation of NPCs in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, X-ray Computed Tomography (X-CT) is used to study the
   structure of the bilayered gas diffusion layer (GDL) of polymer
   electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. This work presents a unique,
   calibrated segmentation procedure developed in-house to identify the
   distinct components of the bi-layer GDL, isolating the carbon fibre, the
   microporous layer and the void regions as individual phases. The novel
   use of the areal mass and areal volume of the GDL facilitates
   calibrated, reliable and repeatable multi-component segmentation and
   removes the high degree of subjectivity that might otherwise be
   encountered in typical thresholding procedures. Samples with and without
   MPLs are studied for the impact of rib channel compression on porosity
   profiles. Under the channel, the porosity profile is nearly identical to
   the uncompressed profile. Under the land region, there is a significant
   decrease in the GDL thickness. It is also observed that the majority of
   the compression is exhibited by the substrate region while the MPL
   undergoes significantly reduced compression. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{Certain unregulated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are more of a health
   concern than regulated DBPs. Brominated species are typically more
   cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated analogs. The impact of
   granular activated carbon (GAC) on controlling the formation of
   regulated and selected unregulated DBPs following chlorine disinfection
   was evaluated. The predicted cyto- and genotoxicity of DBPs was
   calculated using published potencies based on the comet assay for
   Chinese hamster ovary cells (assesses the level of DNA strand breaks).
   Additionally, genotoxicity was measured using the SOS-Chromotest
   (detects DNA-damaging agents). The class sum concentrations of
   trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, and unregulated DBPs, and the SOS
   genotoxicity followed the breakthrough of dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC), however the formation of brominated species did not. The
   bromide/DOC ratio was higher than the influent through much of the
   breakthrough curve (GAC does not remove bromide), which resulted in
   elevated brominated DBP concentrations in the effluent. Based on the
   potency of the haloacetonitriles and halonitromethanes, these
   nitrogen-containing DBPs were the driving agents of the predicted
   genotoxicity. GAC treatment of drinking or reclaimed waters with
   appreciable levels of bromide and dissolved organic nitrogen may not
   control the formation of unregulated DBPs with higher genotoxicity
   potencies.}},

Abstract = {{Systemic dissemination of microbes is critical for progression of many
   infectious diseases and is associated with most mortality due to
   bacterial infection. The physical mechanisms mediating a key
   dissemination step, bacterial association with vascular endothelia in
   blood vessels, remain unknown. Here, we show that endothelial
   interactions of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi under
   physiological shear stress mechanistically resemble selectin-dependent
   leukocyte rolling. Specifically, these interactions are mediated by
   transfer of mechanical load along a series of adhesion complexes and are
   stabilized by tethers and catch bond properties of the bacterial adhesin
   BBK32. Furthermore, we found that the forces imposed on adhesive bonds
   under flow may be small enough to permit active migration driven by
   bacterial flagellar motors. These findings provide insight into the
   biomechanics of bacterial-vascular interactions and demonstrate that
   disseminating bacteria and circulating host immune cells share widely
   conserved mechanisms for interacting with endothelia under physiological
   shear stress.}},

Abstract = {{Many signaling pathways act through shared components, where different
   ligand molecules bind the same receptors or activate overlapping sets of
   response regulators downstream. Nevertheless, different ligands acting
   through cross-wired pathways often lead to different outcomes in terms
   of the target cell behavior and function. Although a number of
   mechanisms have been proposed, it still largely remains unclear how
   cells can reliably discriminate different molecular ligands under such

   dimerization a very common motif in cellular signaling naturally
   incorporates a mechanism for the discrimination of ligands acting

Abstract = {{Recently, increasing heat transfer rate of heat exchangers and reducing
   their size without experiencing a significant increase in flow
   resistance has been the main focus of several studies. Through the
   course of these studies, a wide range of active and passive methods have
   been implemented. Among these methods, changing the geometry of the heat
   exchanger tubes has received an increasing attention due to its
   simplicity and cost-effectiveness. In this study, a new geometry called
   the alternating flattened tube is introduced and its performance against
   other widely used tubes is evaluated. To compare the heat transfer,
   pressure drop, and compactness of the tubes simultaneously, a parameter
   called tube performance enhancement ratio is introduced. Both
   experimental and numerical results show that the alternating flattened
   tube has a better performance enhancement ratio compared to the
   previously studied tubes and can be an advantageous alternative for the
   conventional circular tubes. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{Hydroxide (OH- ion)-conducting polymer electrolytes are essential for
   enabling cost effective, solid-state energy storage devices such as
   electrochemical capacitors (ECs). Ultra-high rate ECs using OH-
   ion-conducting polymer electrolytes have been developed and
   characterized. These polymer electrolytes comprised of aqueous
   tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) incorporated into poly(vinyl
   alcohol) (TEAOH-PVA), poly(ethylene oxide) (TEAOH-PEO), or poly(acrylic
   acid) (TEAOH-PAA). Solid EC cells enabled by TEAOH-PVA, TEOAH-PEO, and
   TEAOH-PAA were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
   and cyclic voltammetry under ambient conditions, demonstrating clear
   differences in performance. Through XRD and DSC analyses, the effects of
   the polymer hosts on the OH- ion-transport mechanism was revealed. The
   differences in OH- ion-transport in the polymer electrolytes is likely a
   result of differences in crystallinity, hydrophilicity, and functional
   group electronegativity of the polymer hosts. TEAOH-PVA and TEAOH-PAA
   based solid EC cells achieved an ionic conductivity of 5 mS cm(-1) and
   an ultra-high rate of 5000 V s(-1) making them suitable for EC

   Equivalent circuit models were used to interpret multifrequency
   impedance data to quantify each cell's cytoplasm conductivity and
   specific membrane capacitance. T24 cells were tested to validate the

   measuring two leukemia cell lines (AML-2 and HL-60) which were found to

Title = {{Aggregate Size Optimization in Microwells for Suspension-based Cardiac
   Differentiation of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Cardiac differentiation of human pluripotent stems cells (hPSCs) is
   typically carried out in suspension cell aggregates. Conventional
   aggregate formation of hPSCs involves dissociating cell colonies into
   smaller clumps, with size control of the clumps crudely controlled by
   pipetting the cell suspension until the desired clump size is achieved.
   One of the main challenges of conventional aggregate-based cardiac
   differentiation of hPSCs is that culture heterogeneity and spatial
   disorganization lead to variable and inefficient cardiomyocyte yield. We
   and others have previously reported that human embryonic stem cell
   (hESC) aggregate size can be modulated to optimize cardiac induction
   efficiency. We have addressed this challenge by employing a scalable,
   microwell-based approach to control physical parameters of aggregate
   formation, specifically aggregate size and shape. The method we describe
   here consists of forced aggregation of defined hPSC numbers in
   microwells, and the subsequent culture of these aggregates in conditions
   that direct cardiac induction. This protocol can be readily scaled
   depending on the size and number of wells used. Using this method, we
   can consistently achieve culture outputs with cardiomyocyte frequencies
   greater than 70\%.}},

Abstract = {{Replacing coke (coal) in a metallurgical furnace with other alternative
   fuels is beneficial for process economics and environmental

   ironmaking, and spent pot-lining (SPL) was conceptualized as an

   production, with high carbon value. Equilibrium thermodynamics was used
   to calculate the energy content of SPL, and the compositional changes
   during SPL combustion. In order to capture the kinetics and mass
   transfer aspects, a blast furnace tuyere region CFD model was developed.
   The results of SPL combustion were compared with standard PCI coals,
   which are commonly used in blast furnaces. The CFD model was validated
   with experimental results for standard high volatile coals. (C) ASM

Title = {{Human Envelope Following Responses to Amplitude Modulation: Effects of
   Aging and Modulation Depth}},
Journal = {{EAR AND HEARING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{E322-E335}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To record envelope following responses (EFRs) to monaural
   amplitude-modulated broadband noise carriers in which amplitude
   modulation (AM) depth was slowly changed over time and to compare these
   objective electrophysiological measures to subjective behavioral
   thresholds in young normal hearing and older subjects.
   Design: Participants: three groups of subjects included a young
   normal-hearing group (YNH 18 to 28 years; pure-tone average = 5 dB HL),
   a first older group ({''}01{''}; 41 to 62 years; pure-tone average = 19
   dB HL), and a second older group ({''}02{''}; 67 to 82 years; pure-tone
   average = 35 dB HL). Electrophysiology: In condition 1, the AM depth (41
   Hz) of a white noise carrier, was continuously varied from 2\% to 100\%
   (5\%/s). EFRs were analyzed as a function of the AM depth. In condition
   2, auditory steady-state responses were recorded to fixed AM depths
   (100\%, 75\%, 50\%, and 25\%) at a rate of 41 Hz. Psychophysics: A 3 AFC
   (alternative forced choice) procedure was used to track the AM depth
   needed to detect AM at 41 Hz (AM detection). The minimum AM depth
   capable of eliciting a statistically detectable EFR was defined as the
   physiological AM detection threshold.
   Results: Across all ages, the fixed AM depth auditory steady-state
   response and swept AM EFR yielded similar response amplitudes.
   Statistically significant correlations (r = 0.48) were observed between
   behavioral and physiological AM detection thresholds. Older subjects had
   slightly higher (not significant) behavioral AM detection thresholds
   than younger subjects. AM detection thresholds did not correlate with
   age. All groups showed a sigmoidal EFR amplitude versus AM depth
   function but the shape of the function differed across groups. The 02
   group reached EFR amplitude plateau levels at lower modulation depths
   than the normal-hearing group and had a narrower neural dynamic range.
   In the young normal-hearing group, the EFR phase did not differ with AM
   depth, whereas in the older group, EFR phase showed a consistent
   decrease with increasing AM depth. The degree of phase change (or phase
   slope) was significantly correlated to the pure-tone threshold at 4 kHz.
   Conclusions: EFRs can be recorded using either the swept modulation
   depth or the discrete AM depth techniques. Sweep recordings may provide
   additional valuable information at suprathreshold intensities including
   the plateau level, slope, and dynamic range. Older subjects had a
   reduced neural dynamic range compared with younger subjects suggesting
   that aging affects the ability of the auditory system to encode subtle
   differences in the depth of AM. The phase-slope differences are likely
   related to differences in low and high-frequency contributions to EFR.
   The behavioral-physiological AM depth threshold relationship was
   significant but likely too weak to be clinically useful in the present
   individual subjects who did not suffer from apparent temporal processing
   deficits.}},

Abstract = {{The large-scale integration of renewable generation directly affects the
   reliability of power grids. We investigate the problem of power
   balancing in a general renewable-integrated power grid with storage and
   flexible loads. We consider a power grid that is supplied by one
   conventional generator (CG) and multiple renewable generators (RGs) each
   co-located with storage, and is connected with external markets. An
   aggregator operates the power grid to maintain power balance between
   supply and demand. Aiming at minimizing the long-term system cost, we
   first propose a real-time centralized power balancing solution, taking
   into account the uncertainty of the renewable generation, loads, and
   energy prices. We then provide a distributed implementation algorithm,
   significantly reducing both computational burden and communication
   overhead. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is asymptotically
   optimal as the storage capacity increases and the CG ramping constraint
   loosens. Moreover, the distributed implementation enjoys a fast
   convergence rate, and enables each RG and the aggregator to make their
   own decisions. Simulation shows that our proposed algorithm outperforms
   alternatives and can achieve near-optimal performance for a wide range
   of storage capacity.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of molten smelt and water inside a recovery boiler
   dissolving tank produces loud noise and can be violent even during
   normal boiler operation. Inadequate shattering of the smelt stream leads
   to even more violent interaction, as evidenced by an increased acoustic
   intensity of the dissolving tank. On rare occasions, a violent
   dissolving tank can explode, causing equipment damage and even injury to
   personnel. To warn operators of changes in dissolving tank conditions,
   an acoustics-based monitoring system could be developed. To assess the
   feasibility of such a system, acoustic observations were recorded at
   three pulp mills. Analysis of the recordings indicates that when a smelt
   stream is not being shattered, the intensity of the dissolving tank
   soundscape increases significantly and the frequency spectrum changes.
   We also observed a large variation between different mills both in
   average intensity and in signal variance. The results of this study
   suggest that the development of a monitoring system is feasible.}},

Abstract = {{In academic conferences, the structure of the review process has always
   been considered a critical aspect of ensuring the quality of the
   conferences. Assigning reviews manually, by either the TPC chairs or
   Area Chairs, is time-consuming, and the process does not scale well to
   the number of submitted papers. Organizing a conference with multiple
   symposia (or tracks) helps its scalability, but predetermined boundaries
   between tracks may lead to inefficient use of reviewer expertise and
   suboptimal review assignment. Inspired by a rich literature on the
   problem of automated review assignment, we have designed and implemented
   a new review assignment system, called Erie, and successfully deployed
   it for IEEE INFOCOM 2015 and INFOCOM 2016. Implemented in Python, Erie
   is designed to use Latent Semantic Indexing to compute the suitability
   score between a submitted paper and a reviewer's representative papers,
   and to solve an optimization problem that maximizes the total
   suitability score across all submitted papers to the conference.
   Anecdotal evidence shows that Erie outperformed the accuracy of manual
   assignments by Area Chairs, and helped to improve the percentage of
   expert reviewers by a substantial margin.}},

Abstract = {{Viscoelastic-plastic (VEP) dampers are hybrid passive damping devices
   that combine the advantages of viscoelastic and hysteretic damping. This
   paper first formulates a semi-analytical procedure for predicting the
   peak response of nonlinear SDOF systems equipped with VEP dampers, which
   forms the basis for the generation of Performance Spectra that can then
   be used for direct performance assessment and optimization of VEP damped
   structures. This procedure is first verified against extensive nonlinear
   time-history analyses based on a Kelvin viscoelastic model of the
   dampers, and then against a more advanced evolutionary model that is
   calibrated to characterization tests of VEP damper specimens built from
   commercially available viscoelastic damping devices, and an adjustable
   friction device. The results show that the proposed procedure is
   sufficiently accurate for predicting the response of VEP systems without
   iterative dynamic analysis for preliminary design purposes. A design
   method based on the Performance Spectra framework is then proposed for
   systems equipped with passive VEP dampers and is applied to enhance the
   seismic response of a six-storey steel moment frame. The numerical
   simulation results on the damped structure confirm the use of the
   Performance Spectra as a convenient and accurate platform for the
   optimization of VEP systems, particularly during the initial design
   stage. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Current ACI Code shear provisions include some requirements that make
   the construction of complex heavily reinforced concrete structures more
   challenging. In particular, the 60 ksi (420 MPa) limit on the usable
   yield strength of shear reinforcement means it is not permissible to
   reduce shear reinforcement congestion by using high-strength bars. To
   investigate the consequences of using high-strength bars, 12 reinforced
   concrete specimens, representing wall elements of nuclear containment
   structures, were constructed with varying steel strengths and were
   loaded under different combinations of shear and biaxial stresses. The
   results demonstrate that high-strength bars can be effectively used in
   place of lower-strength reinforcement patterns. For the tested
   specimens, the ACI 318-14 shear provisions gave very conservative
   results, while the Modified Compression Field Theory was able to predict
   the failure shear stresses and strains well, along with the full load
   deformation response of all elements tested.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory equipment was designed and implemented to study the effect of
   water pressure on reinforced concrete structures. They included a
   pressure vessel, a video monitoring system, and a pressurizing system.
   Then, the hydraulic testing facility at the University of Toronto was
   brought into operation. The facility is capable of testing model
   offshore structures under high water pressure. A one-seventh-scale model
   of a buoyancy compartment of a small offshore oil platform was designed
   and constructed as a pilot specimen. Two pilot tests were carried out
   using the same pilot specimen to study its behavior. The failure water
   pressure was approximately three times the design pressure. At failure
   pressure, a major circumferential crack in the cylindrical shell near
   the slab-shell connection was formed. At this pressure, uncontrollable
   water leakage through large concrete cracks associated with steel
   yielding occurred. The concrete in compression was capable of preventing
   water flow through concrete cracks until the steel yielded.
   Post-yielding capacity of a section was unreliable in preventing water
   flow.}},

Abstract = {{The microbes responsible for anaerobic benzene biodegradation remain
   poorly characterized. In this study, we identified and quantified
   microbial populations in a series of 16 distinct methanogenic,
   benzenedegrading enrichment cultures using a combination of traditional
   16S rRNA clone libraries (four cultures), pyrotag 16S rRNA amplicon
   sequencing (11 cultures), metagenome sequencing (1 culture) and
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR; 12 cultures). An
   operational taxonomic unit (OTU) from the Deltaproteobacteria designated
   ORM2 that is only 84\% to 86\% similar to Syntrophus or Desulfobacterium
   spp. was consistently identified in all enrichment cultures, and
   typically comprised more than half of the bacterial sequences. In
   addition to ORM2, a sequence belonging to Parcubacteria (candidate
   division OD1) identified from the metagenome data was the only other OTU
   common to all the cultures surveyed. Culture transfers (1\% and 0.1\%)
   were made in the presence and absence of benzene, and the abundance of
   ORM2, OD1 and other OTUs was tracked over 415 days using qPCR. ORM2
   sequence abundance increased only when benzene was present, while the
   abundance of OD1 and other OTUs increased even in the absence of
   benzene. Deltaproteobacterium ORM2 is unequivocally the
   benzene-metabolizing population. This study also hints at laboratory
   cultivation conditions for a member of the widely distributed yet
   uncultivated Parcubacteria (OD1).}},

Abstract = {{If transit agencies wish to retain and attract riders, they need to
   provide reliable and efficient services. Transit agencies tend to run
   high-frequency bus routes during peak hours, and in many cities,
   different routes can also overlap along major corridors. In some
   instances, consecutive buses can arrive at a shared stop simultaneously
   or one bus may arrive while another bus is currently servicing the stop.
   This phenomenon, known as bus bunching, can delay buses and passengers,
   and is usually inefficient. In this study, we attempt to understand how
   bus bunching from the same or different routes can impact bus
   operations, specifically dwell and running times. This research uses
   stop-level records obtained from automatic vehicle location (AVL) and
   automatic passenger counter (APC) systems from TriMet, Portland, OR.
   Using linear modeling, we find that bus bunching increases both dwell
   and running times. Specifically, when different routes bunch or are
   scheduled to arrive at a bus stop within a short time frame, or when
   buses from the same route arrive with a short time frame, dwell times
   increase by similar to 10 s. Similarly, bus bunching from the same route
   or different route prolongs running times by similar to 40 s. Our
   findings suggest that bus schedulers and operators should consider
   adding more time between consecutive buses from different routes at
   shared stops to minimize the negative impacts that we observed from bus
   bunching.}},

Abstract = {{Stem cells are one of the key components in tissue engineering (TE) for
   tissue repair and regeneration. However, further studies are necessary
   in order to provide a suitable microenvironment for stem cells to

   much significant attention as tools for investigating and controlling
   stem cell biology and fate due to their remarkable characteristics,
   including unique mechanical properties, tunable surface chemistry, and
   high electrical conductivity. In this review paper, we describe
   applications of CNTs and graphene in stem cell differentiation and
   consequently tissue formation in both in vitro and in vivo conditions.
   Cytotoxicity of CNTs and graphene is also addressed. Finally, we discuss
   potential challenges and future directions for applications of CNTs and

   pseudo-second-order kinetics model, and the Langmuir equation is more
   appropriate to describe the adsorption behavior of MB on M-gamma FS.

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In the past decade, it has been well recognised that the tumour
   microenvironment contains microenvironmental components such as hypoxia
   that significantly influence tumour cell behaviours such, invasiveness
   and therapy resistance, all of which provide new targets for studying
   cancer biology and developing anticancer therapeutics. In response, a
   large number of two-dimensional and three-dimensional (3D) in vitro
   tumour models have been developed to recapitulate different aspects of
   the tumour microenvironment and enable the study of related biological
   questions. While more complex models enable new biological insight, such
   models often involve time-consuming and complex fabrication or analysis
   processes, which limit their adoption by the broader cancer biology
   community. To address this, we recently reported the development of a
   new platform that enables easy assembly and analysis of 3D tumour
   cultures, the tissue roll for analysis of cellular environment response
   (TRACER). The TRACER platform enables recapitulation of many spatial
   aspects of the tumour microenvironment to ask a variety of questions,
   however its original design contains only one cell type. In contrast
   tumours in vivo often contain a neoplastic and stromal compartment. To
   expand the types of questions the TRACER system is useful for asking,
   here we present a strategy to pattern distinct cell type domains into
   TRACER layers using a custom-built gelatin-dispensing pen. The pen
   allows deposition of a temporary gelatin barrier into the TRACER
   scaffold to define domain boundaries between cell populations. The
   gelatin can be melted away after cell seeding to allow interaction of
   cell populations from adjacent domains. Our device offers a simple
   strategy to generate complex multi-cell type tumour cultures for
   analysis of fundamental biology and drug development applications.}},

   The device, weighing 15 grams, enables imaging in a similar to 2 x 2 mm

   sampling rate. The imaging is performed through a chronically-implanted
   cranial window that remains optically clear between 2 to > 6 weeks after
   the craniotomy. This imaging method is well suited for longitudinal
   studies of chronic models of brain diseases and disorders. In this work,
   it is applied to monitoring neurovascular coupling during drug-induced
   absence-like seizures 6 weeks following the craniotomy. (C) 2016 Optical

Abstract = {{During the past few decades, there has been a surge of interest in
   research seeking to understand how personal and public health are
   affected by transportation systems. A large and diverse literature has
   recently emerged as a result, which complements a rich literature
   developed beginning in the early 20th century. In this manuscript, we
   identify five unique research trajectories in health and transportation
   that, in many cases, seem unrelated. After exploring these five areas,
   we argue that a holistic viewpoint that links all of the ways
   transportation systems impact health will provide new opportunities for
   health and transport researchers. To do this, we present a causal loop
   diagram, which illustrates a systems perspective on the complex
   relationships between health and transportation. Finally, a discussion
   on future directions points out ways that such a perspective will
   benefit researchers going forward. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The authors have introduced and extended the sequential Bayesian Monte
   Carlo model discrimination (SBMCMD) method described in previous studies
   by Masoumi et al. for the purpose of discriminating between mechanistic
   models via designed experiments. The features of the Markov Chain Monte
   Carlo methods utilized in SBMCMD allow this method to work with a wide
   range of nonlinear models. Here, SBMCMD has been applied to simulated
   copolymerization systems to compare its performance with other
   statistical discrimination methods used in previous studies by Burke et
   al. In addition, the Hsiang and Reilly method has been reapplied to the
   same copolymerization systems to address questions arising from previous
   work on this subject. The results of applying the SBMCMD method show
   that it is possible to choose the best model correctly with fewer
   experiments compared to the previously studied methods. Results also
   confirm that copolymer composition data do not provide enough
   information to discriminate between terminal and penultimate data.}},

Abstract = {{Cesium lead halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have emerged as a
   promising new platform for lighting applications. However, to date,
   light emitting diodes (LED) based on these materials exhibit limited
   efficiencies. One hypothesized limiting factor is fast nonradiative
   multiexciton Auger recombination. Using ultrafast spectroscopic
   techniques, we investigate multicarrier interaction and recombination
   mechanisms in cesium lead halide PQDs. By mapping the dependence of the
   biexciton Auger lifetime and the biexciton binding energy on
   nanomaterial size and composition, we find unusually strong Coulomb
   interactions among multiexcitons in PQDs. This results in weakly
   emissive biexcitons and trions, and accounts for low light emission
   efficiencies. We observe that, for strong confinement, the biexciton
   lifetime depends linearly on the PQD volume. This dependence becomes
   sublinear in the weak confinement regime as the PQD size increases
   beyond the Bohr radius. We demonstrate that Auger recombination is
   faster in PQDs compared to CdSe nanoparticles having the same volume,
   suggesting a stronger Coulombic interaction in the PQDs. We confirm this
   by demonstrating an increased biexciton binding energy, which reaches a
   maximum of about 100 meV, fully three times larger than in CdSe quantum
   dots. The biexciton shift can lead to low-threshold optical gain in
   these materials. These findings also suggest that materials engineering
   to reduce Coulombic interaction in cesium lead halide PQDs could improve
   prospects for high efficiency optoelectronic devices. Core-shell
   structures, in particular type-II nanostructures, which are known to
   reduce the bandedge Coulomb interaction in CdSe/CdS, could beneficially
   be applied to PQDs with the goal of increasing their potential in
   lighting applications.}},

Abstract = {{The field of solar fuels seeks to harness abundant solar energy by
   driving useful molecular transformations. Of particular interest is the
   photodriven conversion of greenhouse gas CO2 into carbon-based fuels and
   chemical feedstocks, with the ultimate goal of providing a sustainable
   alternative to traditional fossil fuels. Nonstoichiometric, hydroxylated
   indium oxide nanoparticles, denoted In2O3-x(OH)(y), have been shown to
   function as active photocatalysts for CO2 reduction to CO via the
   reverse water gas shift reaction under simulated solar irradiation.
   However, the relatively wide band gap (2.9 eV) of indium oxide restricts
   the portion of the solar irradiance that can be utilized to similar to
   9\%, and the elevated reaction temperatures required (150-190 degrees C)
   reduce the overall energy efficiency of the process. Herein we report a
   hybrid catalyst consisting of a vertically aligned silicon nanowire
   (SiNW) support evenly coated by In2O3-x(OH)(y) nanoparticles that
   utilizes the vast majority of the solar irradiance to simultaneously
   produce both the photogenerated charge carriers and heat required to
   reduce CO2 to CO at a rate of 22.0 mu mol.g(cat)(-1).h(-1). Further,
   improved light harvesting efficiency of the In2O3-x(OH)(y)/SiNW films
   due to minimized reflection losses and enhanced light trapping within
   the SiNW support results in a similar to 6-fold increase in
   photocatalytic conversion rates over identical In2O3-x(OH)(y) films
   prepared on roughened glass substrates. The ability of this
   In2O3-x(OH)(y)/SiNW hybrid catalyst to perform the dual function of
   utilizing both light and heat energy provided by the broad-band solar
   irradiance to drive CO2 reduction reactions represents a general advance
   that is applicable to a wide range of catalysts in the field of solar
   fuels.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{One of the key challenges for the FPGA industry going forward is to make
   the task of designing hardware easier. A significant portion of that
   design task is the creation of the interconnect pathways between
   functional structures. We present a synthesis tool that automates this
   process and focuses on the interconnect needs in the fine-grained
   (sub-IP-block) design space. Here there are several issues that prior
   research and tools do not address well: the need to have fixed,
   deterministic latency between communicating units (to enable
   high-performance local communication without the area overheads of
   latency insensitivity), and the ability to avoid generating unnecessary
   arbitration hardware when the application design can avoid it. Using a
   design example, our tool generates interconnect that requires 69\% fewer
   lines of specification code than a handwritten Verilog implementation,
   which is a 32\% overall reduction for the entire application. The
   resulting system, while requiring 6\% more total functional and
   interconnect area, achieves the same performance. We also show a
   quantitative and qualitative advantages against an existing commercial
   interconnect synthesis tool, over which we achieve a 25\% performance
   advantage and 15\%/57\% logic/memory area savings.

Abstract = {{Two distributed circuits based on MOS-HBT cascodes are reported in a
   55-nm SiGe BiCMOS technology and are aimed at a single-chip
   time-interleaved transceiver for future 1-Tb/s optical links. The first,
   a DC-135-GHz single-ended distributed amplifier (DA) was optimized for
   low noise, linear receivers, and has a measured noise figure (NF) < 7 dB
   up to 88.5 GHz, 800 mV(pp) of linear input range, and 8.5 dB gain.
   Operation was confirmed with PRBS-31 eye diagram measurements up to 120
   Gb/s. Additionally, a novel time-interleaved distributed power DAC test
   circuit was implemented as a proof-of-concept to investigate the maximum
   achievable output bandwidth at a differential output voltage swing of 6
   V-pp, as needed to directly drive an optical modulator. Simulations of
   the doubly segmented 6-bit DAC show 4-PAM output eye diagrams at up to
   120 GBaud. The measured clock-input-to-data-output small-signal
   bandwidth is 65 GHz. When the DAC is measured as a switching large-swing
   driver, the differential output voltage swing remains larger than 5.4
   V-pp beyond 50 Gb/s. Time interleaving of 4 thermometer MSBs is
   demonstrated experimentally to form a 1.8-V-pp differential, 10-GBaud
   3-PAM output signal. The experimental sampling rate is limited to 10
   GS/s by the capacitance and bandwidth of the low-frequency probes and
   pads used for the data lanes.}},

   The LDD consists of a capacitively-coupled voltage-mode high-frequency
   path and a direct-coupled path that provides low-frequency signal
   components. By increasing the low-frequency path bandwidth an order of
   magnitude compared to previous capacitively-coupled drivers, the on-chip
   coupling capacitor is reduced to 1.05 pF, occupying 3 times less area
   than prior art. The driver incorporates capacitively-coupled two-tap
   pre-emphasis to equalize the VCSEL's optical response. The VCSEL was
   modulated with an optical modulation amplitude (OMA) of up to +5.1 dBm
   and an extinction ratio of 9 dB at 15 Gb/s, the highest extinction ratio
   achieved in high-speed anode-driving CMOS LDDs. The driver is
   programmable and is also demonstrated with +2.3 dBm OMA at a power
   consumption of only 30 mW, corresponding to an energy efficiency of 2
   pJ/bit.}},

Abstract = {{We present a general theory for designing realistic omega-type
   bianisotropic metasurfaces (O-BMSs), unlocking their full potential for
   molding electromagnetic fields. These metasurfaces, characterized by
   electric surface impedance, magnetic surface admittance, and
   magnetoelectric coupling coefficient, were previously considered for
   wavefront manipulation. However, previous reports mainly considered
   plane-wave excitations, and implementations included cumbersome metallic
   features. In this paper, we prove that any field transformation that
   locally conserves real power can be implemented via passive and lossless
   meta-atoms characterized by closed-form expressions; this allows
   rigorous incorporation of arbitrary source and scattering
   configurations. Subsequently, we show that O-BMS meta-atoms can be
   implemented using an asymmetric stack of three impedance sheets, an
   appealing structure for printed circuit board fabrication. Our
   formulation reveals that, as opposed to Huygens' metasurfaces, which
   exhibit negligible magnetoelectric coupling, O-BMSs are not limited to
   controlling the phase of transmitted fields, but can rather achieve a
   high level of control over the amplitude and phase of reflected fields.
   This is demonstrated by designing O-BMSs for reflectionless wide-angle
   refraction, independent surface-wave guiding, and a highly directive
   low-profile antenna, verified with full-wave simulations. This
   straightforward methodology facilitates the development of O-BMS-based
   devices for controlling the near and far fields of arbitrary sources in
   complex scattering configurations.}},

Abstract = {{To localize the wireless sensor networks nodes, only the hop-based
   information (i.e., hops' number, average hop size, and so on) has been,
   so far, exploited by range-free techniques, with poor-accuracy, however.
   In this paper, we show that localization accuracy may greatly benefit
   from joint exploitation, at no cost, of the information already provided
   by the forwarding nodes (i.e., relays) between each anchor (i.e.,
   position aware) and sensor nodes pair. As such, we develop a novel
   range-free localization algorithm, derive its average location
   estimation error (LEE) in closed-form, and compare it in LEE performance
   with the best representative algorithms in the literature. We show that
   the proposed algorithm outperforms them in accuracy. In contrast to the
   latter, we further prove that it is able to achieve an LEE average and
   variance of about 0 when the number of sensors is large enough, thereby
   achieving an unprecedented accuracy performance among range-free
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Homomorphic encryption (HE) systems enable computations on encrypted
   data, without decrypting and without knowledge of the secret key. In
   this work, we describe an optimized Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE)
   based implementation of a variant of the HE system recently proposed by
   Gentry, Sahai andWaters (GSW). Although this system was widely believed
   to be less efficient than its contemporaries, we demonstrate quite the
   opposite behavior for a large class of applications. We first highlight
   and carefully exploit the algebraic features of the system to achieve
   significant speedup over the state-of-the-art HE implementation, namely
   the IBM homomorphic encryption library (HElib). We introduce several
   optimizations on top of our HE implementation, and use the resulting
   scheme to construct a homomorphic Bayesian spam filter, secure multiple
   keyword search, and a homomorphic evaluator for binary decision trees.
   Our results show a factor of 10x improvement in performance (under the
   same security settings and CPU platforms) compared to IBM HElib for
   these applications. Our system is built to be easily portable to GPUs
   (unlike IBM HElib) which results in an additional speedup of up to a
   factor of 103.5x to offer an overall speedup of 1,035x.}},

Abstract = {{The fracture loads of copper-solder-copper double cantilever beam (DCB)

   minimization of the solder peel stress and an optimal load sharing among
   the two joints. This behavior was also analytically modeled using both a
   continuous foundation model and a simplified discrete foundation model,
   which isolated the effects of joint geometry and the bending stiffness
   of the solder and substrates. The model predictions of the
   characteristic joint spacing for both DCB and three-point bending
   configurations were satisfactorily compared with the FEM and the
   experimental data. The proposed approach is useful in predicting the
   load sharing among the multiple solder joints typical of surface mount
   microelectronic devices and in designing joint with maximum strength.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate modeling of skin effect inside conductors is of capital
   importance to solve transmission line and scattering problems. This
   paper presents a surface-based formulation to model skin effect in
   conductors of arbitrary cross section, and compute the per-unit-length
   impedance of a multiconductor transmission line. The proposed
   formulation is based on the Dirichlet-Neumann operator that relates the
   longitudinal electric field to the tangential magnetic field on the
   boundary of a conductor. We demonstrate how the surface operator can be
   obtained through the contour integral method for the conductors of
   arbitrary shape. The proposed algorithm is simple to implement,
   efficient, and can handle arbitrary cross sections, which is the main
   advantage over the existing approach based on eigenfunctions, which is
   available only for canonical conductor's shapes. The versatility of the
   method is illustrated through a diverse set of examples, which includes
   transmission lines with trapezoidal, curved, and V-shaped conductors.
   Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy, versatility, and efficiency
   of the proposed technique.}},

Abstract = {{License plate recognition (LPR) sensors are embedded camera systems that
   monitor road traffic. When a vehicle passes by a sensor, the vehicle's
   license plate, the location, and the time of observation are recorded.
   Given a stream of such observations from a collection of sensors spread
   around the road network, our goal is to detect convoys: groups of two or
   more vehicles traveling with highly correlated trajectories. Some of the
   main challenges with modeling and processing data from LPR sensors
   include that the data-gathering process is event-driven, thus data are
   not regularly sampled in time or space. Also, an appropriate definition
   of convoy should be relative to background traffic patterns, which are
   temporally and spatially varying. This paper proposes novel models for
   LPR observations of traffic which are well suited for online convoy
   detection. Baseline traffic is modeled as following a mixture of
   semi-Markov processes, and specific models for temporal and spatial
   correlation of observations of vehicles traveling in a convoy are
   introduced. These models are used within a sequential hypothesis testing
   framework to obtain a system for real-time convoy detection. The model
   of baseline traffic may be of independent interest for forecasting road
   traffic patterns. Experiments with an extensive simulated dataset
   illustrate the performance of the scheme and offer insights into the
   tradeoffs between detection rate, false alarm rate, and the expected
   number of observations required to detect a convoy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a content-centric transmission design in a cloud
   radio access network by incorporating multicasting and caching. Users
   requesting the same content form a multicast group and are served by a
   same cluster of base stations (BSs) cooperatively. Each BS has a local
   cache, and it acquires the requested contents either from its local
   cache or from the central processor via backhaul links. We investigate
   the dynamic content-centric BS clustering and multicast beamforming with
   respect to both channel condition and caching status. We first formulate
   a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem of minimizing the weighted
   sum of backhaul cost and transmit power under the quality-of-service
   constraint for each multicast group. Theoretical analysis reveals that
   all the BSs caching a requested content can be included in the BS
   cluster of this content, regardless of the channel conditions. Then, we
   reformulate an equivalent sparse multicast beamforming (SBF) problem. By
   adopting smoothed l(0)-norm approximation and other techniques, the SBF
   problem is transformed into the difference of convex programs and
   effectively solved using the convex-concave procedure algorithms.
   Simulation results demonstrate significant advantage of the proposed
   content-centric transmission. The effects of heuristic caching
   strategies are also evaluated.}},

   plasmonic wave-guide and attenuated. The TE mode does not couple and
   passes through the polarizer. The polarizer was fabricated on the
   silicon-on-insulator platform. The device is 30 mu m long, has a high
   extinction ratio of more than 28 dB over 150 nm bandwidth, and has a
   good fabrication tolerance. Most important, the proposed polarizer has
   an ultra-low insertion loss of less than 0.04 dB for the TE mode. (C)

Abstract = {{Background
   Investigation of CF800, a novel PEGylated nano-liposomal imaging agent
   containing indocyanine green (ICG) and iohexol, for real-time near
   infrared (NIR) fluorescence and computed tomography (CT) image-guided
   surgery in an orthotopic lung cancer model in nude mice.
   Methods
   CF800 was intravenously administered into 13 mice bearing the H460
   orthotopic human lung cancer. At 48 h post-injection (peak imaging agent
   accumulation time point), ex vivo NIR and CT imaging was performed. A
   clinical NIR imaging system (SPY (R), Novadaq) was used to measure
   fluorescence intensity of tumor and lung. Tumor-to-background-ratios
   (TBR) were calculated in inflated and deflated states. The mean
   Hounsfield unit (HU) of lung tumor was quantified using the CT data set
   and a semi-automated threshold-based method. Histological evaluation
   using H\&E, the macrophage marker F4/80 and the endothelial cell marker
   CD31, was performed, and compared to the liposomal fluorescence signal
   obtained from adjacent tissue sections
   Results
   The fluorescence TBR measured when the lung is in the inflated state
   (2.0 +/- 0.58) was significantly greater than in the deflated state
   (1.42 +/- 0.380 (n = 7, p<0.003). Mean fluorescent signal in tumor was
   highly variable across samples, (49.0 +/- 18.8 AU). CT image analysis
   revealed greater contrast enhancement in lung tumors (a mean increase of
   110 +/- 57 HU) when CF800 is administered compared to the no contrast
   enhanced tumors (p = 0.0002).
   Conclusion
   Preliminary data suggests that the high fluorescence TBR and CT tumor
   contrast enhancement provided by CF800 may have clinical utility in
   localization of lung cancer during CT and NIR image-guided surgery.}},

Title = {{Shh pathway in wounds in non-diabetic Shh-Cre-eGFP/Ptch1-LacZ mice
   treated with MAA beads}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{198-208}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Previously, poly(methacrylic acid-co-methyl methacrylate) (MAA) beads
   were shown to improve vessel formation with a concomitant increase in
   the expression of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) gene, a pleiotropic factor
   implicated in vascularization. The aim of this study was to follow up on
   this observation in the absence of the confounding factors of diabetes
   in non-diabetic Shh-Cre-eGFP/Ptch1-LacZ mice; in this mouse, expression
   of GFP and beta-Gal is consistent with the transcription patterns of Shh
   and its receptor patched 1 (Ptch1), respectively. In agreement with
   studies in diabetic males, MAA beads improved vascularization in large
   (15 mm x 15 mm) wounds in non-diabetic males at day 7. Shh pathway
   activation was suggested, as the numbers of GFP+ (Shh) and beta-Gal+
   (Ptch1, a target of the pathway) cells increased in the granulation
   tissue. Shh signaling pathway modulation was also suggested in the
   healthy skin surrounding the wound bed, as evidenced by an increase in
   the number of GFP+ and beta-Gal+ cells in males at day 4. Gene
   expression analysis of the wounds confirmed increase in Ptch1 and showed
   the upregulation of a downstream transcription factor Gli3, involved in
   the vascular effect of the Shh pathway, implicating the pathway in the
   effect of MAA beads. The efficacy of MAA beads was also investigated in
   females; MAA beads modulated the Shh pathway within granulation tissue
   similarly as in males, but had no enhancement effect on the healthy skin
   and on vascularization. We believe that understanding the molecular and
   cellular mechanisms of MAA-based biomaterials and testing the efficacy
   of therapeutics in both sexes will inform the development of novel
   therapeutic biomaterials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The fracture toughness behavior of Al-Zn-Mg alloy, A7N01S-T5, welded
   joints was investigated using three points bending test with the J
   integral approach. The microstructures of the welded joints were

   propagation resistance, and the weld zone (WZ) and base metal (BM)
   behaved similarly. The stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behavior of the
   welded joints was investigated under a constant loading condition. The
   threshold stress intensity factor of SCC and the cracks' propagation
   rate were tested. The microstructure of the fracture was examined using
   optical microscope and scanning electron microscope. The results showed
   that both the BM and the HAZ were susceptible to SCC and the HAZ was
   smaller than the BM, but no cracks were detected in the WZ. A greater
   amount of H+ and a higher concentration of Zn and Mg accumulated at the
   crack front tips, which led to the SCC resistance weakening in the

Abstract = {{In this laboratory experiment, the synthesis of a supported solid

   impregnation of the silica support with copper(II) nitrate trihydrate as
   the precursor of the active phase. It was then dried, calcined, and
   reduced. Each step of the synthesis was characterized by color change.
   The catalytic reaction was performed as a continuous process in a flow
   reactor, and the postreaction mixture was analyzed using gas
   chromatography. The laboratory experiment showed practical aspects of
   heterogeneous catalysis and encouraged students to seek alternative,

Title = {{Design and validation of an MR-conditional robot for transcranial

Abstract = {{Purpose: Current treatment of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) involves
   cerebral shunt placement or an invasive brain surgery. Magnetic
   resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) applied to the brains of
   pediatric patients presents an opportunity to treat IVH in a noninvasive
   manner, termed ``incision-less surgery.{''} Current clinical and
   research focused ultrasound systems lack the capability to perform
   neonatal transcranial surgeries due to either range of motion or
   dexterity requirements. A novel robotic system is proposed to position a
   focused ultrasound transducer accurately above the head of a neonatal
   patient inside an MRI machine to deliver the therapy.
   Methods: A clinical Philips Sonalleve MRgFUS system was expanded to
   perform transcranial treatment. A five degree-of-freedom MR-conditional
   robot was designed and manufactured using MR compatible materials. The
   robot electronics and control were integrated into existing Philips
   electronics and software interfaces. The user commands the position of
   the robot with a graphical user interface, and is presented with
   real-time MR imaging of the patient throughout the surgery. The robot is
   validated through a series of experiments that characterize accuracy,
   signal-to-noise ratio degeneration of an MR image as a result of the
   robot, MR imaging artifacts generated by the robot, and the robot's
   ability to operate in a representative surgical environment inside an MR
   machine.
   Results: Experimental results show the robot responds reliably within an
   MR environment, has achieved 0.59 +/- 0.25 mm accuracy, does not produce
   severe MR-imaging artifacts, has a workspace providing sufficient
   coverage of a neonatal brain, and can manipulate a 5 kg payload. A full
   system demonstration shows these characteristics apply in an application
   environment.
   Conclusions: This paper presents a comprehensive look at the process of
   designing and validating a new robot from concept to implementation for
   use in an MR environment. An MR conditional robot has been designed and
   manufactured to design specifications. The system has demonstrated its
   feasibility as a platform for MRgFUS interventions for neonatal
   patients. The success of the system in experimental trials suggests that
   it is ready to be used for validation of the transcranial intervention
   in animal studies. (C) 2016 American Association of Physicists in

   monitor treatments and for the registration of preoperative computed
   tomography (CT)-data to the MR images at the time of treatment to
   correct the sound aberrations caused by the skull. For some
   applications, MRI is not an appropriate choice for therapy monitoring
   and its cost may limit the accessibility of these treatments. An
   alternative approach, using high frequency ultrasound measurements to
   localize the skull surface and register CT data to the ultrasound
   treatment space, for the purposes of skull-related phase aberration
   correction and treatment targeting, has been developed.
   Methods: A prototype high frequency, hemispherical sparse array was
   fabricated. Pulse-echo measurements of the surface of five ex vivo human
   skulls were made, and the CT datasets of each skull were obtained. The
   acoustic data were used to rigidly register the CT-derived skull surface
   to the treatment space. The ultrasound-based registrations of the CT
   datasets were compared to the gold-standard landmark-based
   registrations.
   Results: The results show on an average sub-millimeter (0.9 +/- 0.2 mm)
   displacement and subdegree (0.8. +/- 0.4.) rotation registration errors.
   Numerical simulations predict that registration errors on this scale
   will result in a mean targeting error of 1.0 +/- 0.2 mm and reduction in
   focal pressure of 1.0\% +/- 0.6\% when targeting a midbrain structure
   (e.g., hippocampus) using a commercially available low-frequency brain
   prototype device (InSightec, 230 kHz brain system).
   Conclusions: If combined with ultrasound-based treatment monitoring
   techniques, this registration method could allow for the development of
   a low-cost transcranial FUS treatment platform to make this technology
   more widely available. (C) 2016 American Association of Physicists in

Title = {{The cost of equity: Assessing transit accessibility and social disparity

Abstract = {{Social equity is increasingly incorporated as a long-term objective into
   urban transportation plans. Researchers use accessibility measures to
   assess equity issues, such as determining the amount of jobs reachable
   by marginalized groups within a defined travel time threshold and
   compare these measures across socioeconomic categories. However,
   allocating public transit resources in an equitable manner is not only
   related to travel time, but also related to the out-of-pocket cost of
   transit, which can represent a major barrier to accessibility for many
   disadvantaged groups. Therefore, this research proposes a set of new
   accessibility measures that incorporates both travel time and transit
   fares. It then applies those measures to determine whether people
   residing in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods in Montreal, Canada
   experience the same levels of transit accessibility as those living in
   other neighborhoods. Results are presented in terms of regional
   accessibility and trends by social indicator decile. Travel time
   accessibility measures estimate a higher number of jobs that can be
   reached compared to combined travel time and cost measures. However, the
   degree and impact of these measures varies across the social deciles.
   Compared to other groups in the region, residents of socially
   disadvantaged areas have more equitable accessibility to jobs using
   transit; this is reflected in smaller decreases in accessibility when
   fare costs are included. Generating new measures of accessibility
   combining travel time and transit fares provides more accurate measures
   that can be easily communicated by transportation planners and engineers
   to policy makers and the public since it translates accessibility
   measures to a dollar value. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{White-rot fungi are distinguished by their ability to efficiently
   degrade lignin via lignin-modifying type II peroxidases, including
   manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP). In the present
   study, time-of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was
   used to evaluate lignin modification in three coniferous and three
   deciduous wood preparations following treatment with commercial
   preparations of LiP and MnP from two different white-rot fungi. Percent
   modification of lignin was calculated as a loss of intact methoxylated
   lignin over nonfunctionalized aromatic rings, which is consistent with
   oxidative cleavage of methoxy moieties within the lignin structure.
   Exposure to MnP resulted in greater modification of lignin in coniferous
   compared to deciduous wood (28 vs. 18 \% modification of lignin); and
   greater modification of G-lignin compared to S-lignin within the
   deciduous wood samples (21 vs. 12 \%). In contrast, exposure to LiP
   resulted in similar percent modification of lignin in all wood samples
   (21 vs 22 \%), and of G- and S-lignin within the deciduous wood (22 vs.
   23 \%). These findings suggest that the selected MnP and LiP may
   particularly benefit delignification of coniferous and deciduous wood,
   respectively. Moreover, the current analysis further demonstrates the
   utility of ToF-SIMS for characterizing enzymatic modification of lignin
   in wood fibre along with potential advantages over UV and HPCL-MS
   detection of solubilized delignification products.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. To identify issues during donning and doffing of personal
   protective equipment (PPE) for infectious diseases and to inform PPE
   procurement criteria and design.
   DESIGN. A mixed methods approach was used. Usability testing assessed
   the appropriateness, potential for errors, and ease of use of various
   combinations of PPE. A qualitative constructivist approach was used to
   analyze participant feedback.
   SETTING. Four academic health sciences centers: 2 adult hospitals, 1
   trauma center, and 1 pediatric hospital, in Toronto, Canada.
   PARTICIPANTS. Participants (n = 82) were representative of the potential
   users of PPE within Western healthcare institutions.
   RESULTS. None of the tested combinations provided a complete solution
   for PPE. Environmental factors, such as anteroom layout, and the design
   of protocols and instructional material were also found to impact
   safety. The study identified the need to design PPE as a complete
   system, rather than mixing and matching components.
   CONCLUSIONS. Healthcare institutions are encouraged to use human factors
   methods to identify risk and failure points with the usage of their
   selected PPE, and to modify on the basis of iterative evaluations with
   representative end users. Manufacturers of PPE should consider usability
   when designing the next generation of PPE.}},

Abstract = {{A physics-based multi-scale model that couples viscoelasticity and
   time-dependent damage evolution for general multidirectional laminates
   subjected to long-term creep loading is developed. The viscoelastic ply
   behavior is evaluated using a nonlinear Schapery-type viscoelastic
   model, while a methodology employed within the framework of classical
   laminate theory is used to predict the corresponding laminate
   time-dependent response. The evolution of microscopic ply cracks in
   multiple plies with different orientations during creep loading is
   predicted using an energy-based approach, and the corresponding laminate
   stiffness degradation is evaluated using a synergistic damage
   mechanics-based model that relies on computational micromechanics in
   lieu of costly experimental data. The developed model is used to predict
   the evolution of ply cracks and the viscoelastic stress-strain response
   of various cross-ply and multidirectional laminates under quasi-static
   and creep loading. Predicted strains, compliance changes and crack
   density evolutions show excellent agreement with available experimental
   creep data for different laminate stacking sequences, providing
   validation for the model. Predictions are also made for two additional
   multidirectional laminates in order to investigate the effect of
   off-axis ply angle on the creep response, which demonstrates the
   versatility of the model and its usefulness in assessing the long-term
   durability of general multidirectional composite laminates.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Rigid water column (RWC) models simulate the unsteady-incompressible
   hydraulics of pressurized pipe networks. They conceptually lie between
   water hammer and quasi-steady models, yet despite their intrinsic
   strengths, existing RWC formulations suffer efficiency-, stability-, and
   interpretation-related challenges; thus, they are typically overlooked
   as a modeling alternative. To address the aforementioned limitations,
   this article presents the RWC global gradient algorithm (GGA), a novel
   formulation for pipe networks that has greater efficiency and overcomes
   the numerical challenges. The RWC GGA extends the generalized GGA
   (G-GGA) to consider inertial effects in addition to variable-area tanks
   and mixed (i.e., demand and pressure-dependent) outflows. Two pipe
   networks of simple and moderate complexity are used to compare the new
   approach against two other RWC algorithms, the G-GGA, and a water hammer
   model: the current work is shown to have improved stability and
   efficiency relative to previous work. The RWC GGA is also found to have
   a computational cost only slightly greater than that of the G-GGA for
   the same time-step size. Overall, this work highlights the practical
   utility of RWC models to simulate slow transient events and controlled
   operations.}},

   automated algorithm was employed to extract various spatiotemporal
   features including stance time, step length, step time and gait velocity
   from the recorded Kinect v2 sequences. Accuracy in terms of reliability,
   concurrent validity and limits of agreement was examined for each gait
   feature under different walking conditions. The 95\% Bland-Altman limits
   of agreement were narrow enough for the Kinect v2 to be a valid tool for
   measuring all reported spatiotemporal parameters of gait in all three
   conditions. An excellent intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2, (1))
   ranging from 0.9 to 0.98 was observed for all gait measures across
   different walking conditions. The inter trial reliability of all gait
   parameters were shown to be strong for all walking types (ICC3, (1) >
   0.73). The results of this study suggest that the Kinect for Windows v2
   has the capacity to measure selected spatiotemporal gait parameters for
   healthy adults. (C) 2016 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The discovery of homogeneous, solution-based molecular frustrated Lewis
   pairs, denoted FLPs, comprising main-group elements that can activate
   H-2 heralded a paradigm shift in chemistry and catalysis. In FLPs,
   unquenched Lewis base and Lewis acid sites (B center dot center dot
   center dot A)are able to polarize and dissociate H-2 heterolytically to
   form adjacent proton and hydride sites (BH-center dot center dot center
   dot AH(+)), which can enable reactions such as CO2 reduction. In this
   paper, we draw attention to a relationship between these well-known
   molecular FLPs and the surface active sites comprised of proximal Lewis
   base and Lewis acid pairs, which have been reported multiple times in
   the literature to be responsible for driving various heterogeneous
   catalytic reactions. From our recent studies that described one such
   surface site in a nanostructured defect laden indium oxide, capable of
   activating H-2 and enabling the hydrogenation of CO2, it was conjectured
   that these sites are surface FLPs. Significantly, the conversion rate
   for this hydrogenation reaction is observed to be more rapid in the
   light than in the dark. Kinetic measurements and density functional
   theory simulations are consistent with a reaction that proceeds via a
   surface FLP. It is found that the higher Lewis acidity and Lewis
   basicity in the excited state, which originates from trapping of the
   photogenerated hole and electron at the FLP acid and base sites,
   respectively, is responsible for the higher reactivity in the light in
   comparison to the dark. With the emerging experimental and theoretical
   understanding of the chemical and physical principles that underpin the
   reactivity of FLPs in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems, it is
   now possible to rationally conceive and synthetically target
   heterogeneous FLP materials that bear a compositional and structural
   connection to homogeneous FLP molecules, and vice versa. This
   synergistic relationship between FLP molecules and materials could prove
   beneficial in future efforts aimed at expanding the accrued scientific
   knowledge on photochemical versus thermochemical activation of CO2 and
   thereupon to exploit the perceived technological attributes of both
   systems in the catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide to value-added
   chemicals and fuels.}},

Abstract = {{Phase balancing is essential to safe power system operation. We consider
   a substation connected to multiple phases, each with single-phase loads,
   generation, and energy storage. A representative of the substation
   operates the system and aims to minimize the cost of all phases and to
   balance loads among phases. We first consider ideal energy storage with
   lossless charging and discharging, and propose both centralized and
   distributed real-time algorithms taking into account system uncertainty.
   The proposed algorithm does not require any system statistics and
   asymptotically achieves the minimum system cost with large energy
   storage. We then extend the algorithm to accommodate more realistic
   non-ideal energy storage that has imperfect charging and discharging.
   The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through extensive
   simulation and compared with that of a benchmark greedy algorithm.
   Simulation shows that our algorithm leads to strong performance over a
   wide range of storage characteristics.}},

Title = {{Alkanal transfer hydrogenation catalyzed by solid Bronsted acid sites}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{341}},
Pages = {{136-148}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Catalytic pathway and requirements for transfer hydrogenation of
   n-alkanals (CnH2nO, n = 3-6) on Bronsted acid sites (H+) immobilized in
   microporous MFI and FAU crystalline structures or dispersed on
   H4SiW12O40 polyoxometalate clusters are established by isolating its
   rates from those of the various concomitant catalytic cycles. Transfer
   hydrogenation of alkanals involves a kinetically-relevant,
   intermolecular hydride transfer step from substituted tetralins or
   cyclohexadienes produced from the parallel alkanal coupling and ring
   closure reactions as the hydride donor (R'H-2) to protonated alkanals
   (RCH2CHOH+) as the hydride acceptor, via a bi-molecular transition state
   with a shared hydride ion, (RCH2CHOH+--H---R'H+)(+). The rate constants
   for the inter-molecular hydride transfer step correlate directly to the
   hydride ion affinity difference between the carbenium ions of the
   H-donors (R'H+) and the protonated alkanals (RCH2CHOH'). As a result,
   smaller alkanals with higher hydride ion affinities are more effective
   in abstracting hydride ions and in transfer hydrogenation (C-4 > C-5 >
   C-6). Propanal is an exception, as it is less effective in transfer
   hydrogenation than butanal. The deviation of propanal from the
   reactivity trend is apparently caused by its smaller transition state
   for hydride transfer, which is solvated to a lesser extent in FAU cages.
   The transfer hydrogenation occurs much more effectively on partially
   confined H+ sites in FAU structures than in smaller pore MFI or
   unconfined H4SiW12O40 polyoxometalate clusters, an indication that FAU
   solvates and stabilizes the bulky transition state of hydride transfer
   via van der Waals interactions. These effects of local site structures
   and the thermo-chemical properties of reactant determine the reactivity
   of alkanal transfer hydrogenation and thus selectivity ratio of alkenes,
   dienes, aromatics, and larger oxygenates during deoxygenation catalysis.

   no convincing prior identification of how extreme downsizing and surface
   induced ligand effects influence structural distortion. Using forefront
   X-ray scattering techniques and density functional theory calculations,
   here we have identified that, at sizes below 8 nm, PbS and PbSe QDs
   undergo a lattice distortion with displacement of the Pb sublattice,
   driven by ligand-induced tensile strain. The resulting permanent
   electric dipoles may have implications on the oriented attachment of
   these QDs. Evidence is found for a Pb-deficient core and, in the
   as-synthesized QDs, for a rhombic dodecahedral shape with nonpolar
   \{110\} facets. On varying the nature of the surface ligands,
   differences in lattice strains are found.}},

Abstract = {{To achieve high-quality low-dose computed tomography (CT) images,
   compressed sensing (CS)-based CT reconstructions recover the images
   using fewer projections; and wavelet inverse Radon algorithms recover
   wavelet subbands of CT images from locally scanned projections.
   Moreover, it has been shown that subband CS algorithms accelerate the
   convergence of the CS recovery methods. Here, we propose an innovative
   combination of a newly developed accelerated wavelet inverse Radon
   transform and non-convex CS formulation to recover the wavelet subbands
   of CT images from a reduced number of locally scanned Xray projections.
   Fast pseudo-polar Fourier transform is used to decrease the
   computational complexity of CS recovery. Therefore, the proposed method,
   denoted by AWiR-SISTA, reduces the radiation dose by simultaneously
   decreasing the X-ray exposure area and the number of projections,
   decreases the CS computational complexity, and accelerates the CS
   recovery convergence rate. Phantom-based simulations show that
   high-quality ultra-low-dose local CT images can be reconstructed using
   the proposed method in few seconds, without numerical optimization.
   Clinical chest CT images are used to demonstrate the practical potential
   of the method.}},

Abstract = {{Dual-axis swallowing accelerometry has been proposed as a method for
   quantifying swallowing function. Acceleration signals in
   anterior-posterior and superior-inferior anatomical directions are
   processed and automatically segmented. However, the latter is often too
   liberal, admitting pre- and post-swallowing activity while also giving
   rise to non-swallow segments. These segmentation shortcomings adversely
   affect feature extraction and ultimately classification of swallowing
   function. In this paper, we propose a kernel density estimation-based
   algorithm to adaptively trim the swallow segments, and energy and
   noise-floor algorithms to reduce the number of false positive swallow
   segments. The balance between false positive reduction and loss of true
   positives can be adjusted according to algorithmic thresholds. Dramatic
   reductions (-85.4\%) in false positives can be achieved with a moderate
   loss of true positives (-15.1\%).}},

Title = {{Inhibition and Excitation of Bladder Function by Tibial Nerve
   Stimulation Using a Wirelessly Powered Implant: An Acute Study in
   Anesthetized Cats}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{196}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Tibial nerve stimulation is a minimally invasive
   neuromodulation treatment of overactive bladder. However, in addition to
   our limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms, there are also
   questions regarding the long- term delivery of tibial nerve stimulation
   therapy in patients. We aimed to characterize the effects of stimulation
   frequency using a wirelessly powered implantable stimulation device.
   Methods and Materials: Six alpha-chloralose anesthetized adult male cats
   were used in this study. A multicontact lead was surgically implanted
   subcutaneously in the hind limb and used to stimulate the tibial nerve.
   Using an isovolumetric bladder a short duration of electrical pulses was
   applied at amplitudes 3 times the motor threshold and at frequencies
   from 2 to 20 Hz.
   Results: Implant driven stimulation of the tibial nerve resulted in
   frequency dependent activation of bladder reflexes. Low frequency tibial
   nerve stimulation (2 Hz) consistently evoked excitatory responses (mean
   +/- SE 32.9\% +/- 3.8\%). In contrast, higher frequency tibial nerve
   stimulation (6 to 20 Hz) inhibited bladder function (overall mean 14.9\%
   +/- 2.4\%). Although low foot motor thresholds were achieved at initial
   implantation (mean 0.83 +/- 0.05 mA), a notable elevation in threshold
   amplitude was observed 5 hours after implantation.
   Conclusions: To our knowledge this study provides the first evidence of
   frequency dependent modulation of bladder function in anesthetized cats.
   The inhibitory influence of tibial nerve stimulation at frequencies
   above 6 Hz transitioned to an excitatory effect at 2 Hz. Taken together
   these preclinical data support the feasibility of using a wirelessly
   powered implantable device to potentially modulate bladder function in
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the reach control problem (RCP) using affine feedback

   are formulated in terms of scalar linear inequalities. Third,
   computationally efficient necessary conditions are proposed for checking
   the obstruction for multi -input systems as feasibility programs in
   terms of linear inequalities. In contrast to the previous work in the
   literature, no assumption is imposed on the set of possible equilibria,
   so the results are applicable to the general RCP. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Thirty-three extensive green roofs in southern Ontario were surveyed and
   samples of planting media recovered for hydrological laboratory
   analyses. The resulting data demonstrate a significant dominance of the
   role of organic matter in the physical and chemical properties of the
   media. This is very apparent owing to the local practice of basing some
   green roof media on composted materials rather than on the European
   recommendations of lightweight minerals or aggregates. The desirable
   characteristics of increased maximum water holding capacity and lower
   bulk density are both well correlated to the percentage of organic
   matter found in the media samples. Within the roofs surveyed, the
   percentage of organic matter, even in association with increasing
   maturation, was not a significant indicator for loss of green roof
   planting depth. Particle size distribution (PSD) parameters were also
   measured and compared to the water transport properties of the media
   (permeability and maximum water holding capacity). (C) 2016 Elsevier

   Implications for the Design Specifications of Future Flexible Endoscopic
   Instruments}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Recent innovations to expand the scope of intraventricular
   neuro-endoscopy have focused on transitioning multiple-incision
   procedures into single corridor approaches. However, the successful
   adoption of these combined procedures requires minimizing the unwanted
   torques applied to surrounding healthy structures.
   OBJECTIVE: To define the geometry of relevant anatomical structures in
   endoscopic third ventriculostomy (EN) and pineal region tumor biopsy
   (ETB). Second, to determine the optimal instrument shaft path required
   for collision-free single burr hole combined ETV/ETB.
   METHODS: Magnetic resonance and computed tomography data from 15
   pediatric patients who underwent both ETV and ETB procedures between
   2006 and 2014 was segmented by using the 3DSlicer software package to
   create virtual 3-D patient models. Anatomical regions of interest were
   measured including the foramen of Monro, the massa intermedia, the floor
   of the third ventricle, and the tumor margin. Utilizing the MATLAB
   software package, virtual dexterous instruments were inserted into the
   models and optimal dimensions were calculated.
   RESULTS: The diameters of the foramen of Monro, massa intermedia
   (anterior-posterior, superior-inferior), anterior third ventricle, and
   tumor margin are 6.85, 4.01, 5.05, 14.2, and 28.5 mm, respectively. The
   average optimal burr placement was determined to be 22.5 mm anterior to
   the corona! and 30 mm lateral to the sagittal sutures. Optimal flexible
   instrument geometries for novel instruments were calculated.
   CONCLUSION: We have established a platform for estimating the shape of
   novel curved dexterous instruments for collision-free targeting of
   multiple intraventricular points, which is both patient and tool
   specific and can be integrated with image guidance. These data will aid
   in developing novel dexterous instruments.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART A-APPLIED SCIENCE AND MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{67-74}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the interactions between dispersed carbon fibers and
   growing cells in high-pressure foam injection molding experiments using
   a polystyrene/carbon-fiber/carbon-dioxide system with an in-situ
   visualization technique. We found that the fibers exhibited both
   translational and rotational displacements in close proximity to the
   growing cells. Their rotational and translational displacements were
   measured quantitatively using visualization snapshots. These were found
   to be a strong function of the cell size, the initial cell-fiber
   distance, and the initial fiber angle. We developed an analytical model
   to describe the instantaneous fiber orientation and location as a
   function of the corresponding cell size and the fiber's initial
   orientation and location. The theoretical predictions were in a good
   agreement with the experimental results. This showed the model's
   accuracy in predicting the fiber displacement. Our research provides a
   deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which foaming influences
   the percolation threshold of conductive polymer composites. (C) 2016

Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART A-APPLIED SCIENCE AND MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{178-189}},

Abstract = {{The bending strength of underfilled and edge-bonded ball grid array
   (BGA) microelectronic packages assembled on printed circuit boards
   (PCBs) was compared using double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens. All
   specimens with fillets of the same size and shape failed at the same
   load, with cracks initiating and propagating within the PCB. This was
   consistent with measurements of the crack initiation strain energy
   release rate for PCB interfacial failure, which was significantly
   smaller than that of cohesive failure within the adhesives. Finite
   element analysis (FEA) indicated that the stress state in the PCB near
   the PCB fillet interface in both underfilled and edge-bonded specimens
   was only a function of the adhesive fillet size and shape, and
   independent of the extent of the adhesive layer between the PCB and the
   BGA, and independent of the adhesive mechanical and thermal properties
   over the broad range of properties of the tested adhesives. This
   explained why decreasing the fillet curvature in edge-bonded specimens
   produced a significant increase in the joint strength. The crack path in
   the PCB of the edge-bonded specimens was found to change with the
   adhesive cure temperature; however, this had a negligible effect on the
   failure load. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   tether dynamics is investigated. It is demonstrated that consideration
   of the finite size of the celestial body can have significant effects on
   the tether dynamics, while the effect of the asphericity of the
   celestial body on the tether dynamics is negligible. This study is of
   practical relevance for asteroid deflection using tethers, as well as
   for the development of space elevators on small planets/moons.}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Modular steel construction is a relatively new construction technique
   that considerably reduces the time spent on the construction site.
   However, due to the detailing and assembly requirements of multi-story
   modular steel buildings (MSBs), these systems are prone to undesirable
   failure mechanisms during large earthquakes. In this paper a 4-story MSB
   is designed considering realistic constraints posed during the modular
   construction. Using a detailed model in OpenSees an assessment of the
   seismic demand and capacity of this MSB is provided by performing
   nonlinear static pushover and incremental dynamic analyses (IDA) in two
   and three dimensions. Diaphragm interactions, relative displacements and
   rotations between modules, the force transfer through horizontal
   connections, column discontinuity coupled with possible high
   inelasticity concentration in vertical connections are some other
   important aspects that are specifically considered. The results that are
   summarized with relevant conclusions provide a better insight to the
   dynamic behavior of multi-story MSBs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of the response of multiaxially loaded concrete to the
   expansive reactions, such as alkali-silica reaction (ASR), remains a
   prerequisite to predict the long-term behavior of ASR-affected concrete
   structures, such as dams and containment structures. However, no
   suitable techniques exist to apply biaxial and triaxial stresses in
   concrete specimens, and to sustain the stresses for monitoring the
   long-term behavior of concrete. Consequently, state-of-the-art numerical
   modeling of concrete structures undergoing ASR relies on the
   experimental findings obtained from specimens with insufficient
   restraints. This paper presents the development of a new method to apply
   multiaxial (uniaxial, biaxial and triaxial) stresses. The stresses were
   applied to multiple concrete cube specimens, and were sustained for 1
   year as ASR evolved in the specimens subjected to an accelerated
   condition of 50 degrees C temperature and close to 100 \% relative
   humidity. The specimens were measured for longitudinal expansion in the
   three directions. The merit of the proposed method in the study of ASR
   is illustrated by presenting the results on the triaxial expansions of
   several unloaded and multiaxially loaded cube specimens until the
   exhaustion of the reaction. The results demonstrate a strong influence
   of multiaxial stress states on the ASR expansion of concrete.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{490-496}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Room temperature thermoelectrical transport was investigated on a series
   of thick (300 gm), fully-dense electrodeposited nanocrystalline Ni
   materials with grain sizes below 50 nm. Strong grain size effects were
   observed on both electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity. As
   grain size decreased from 47 to 28 nm, the nanocrystalline Ni exhibited
   an increase in electrical resistivity from 9.42 to 10.2 mu Omega cm, and
   a reduction of thermal conductivity from 74.7 to 67.3 W/m-K,
   respectively. Analysis shows that for the nanocrystalline Ni, the change
   in the values of thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity is
   mainly due to grain boundary contributions with limited impurity
   effects. Furthermore, the thermoelectrical transport behavior agrees
   well with the Wiedemann-Franz law. The corresponding Lorenz numbers
   varied only in a narrow range from 2.30 x 10(-8) to 2.37 x 10(-8) W
   Omega/K-2 for the nanocrystalline Ni and were well within the
   experimentally measured value range of 2.12-2.44 x 10(-8) W Omega/K-2(2

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{165-173}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In both industry and the research literature, Mixed Integer Programming
   (MIP) is often the default approach for solving scheduling problems. In
   this paper we present and evaluate four MIP formulations for the
   classical job shop scheduling problem (JSP). While MIP formulations for
   the JSP have existed since the 1960s, it appears that comprehensive
   computational studies have not been performed since then. Due to
   substantial improvements in MIP technology in recent years, it is of
   interest to compare the standard JSP models using modern optimization
   software. We perform a fully crossed empirical study of four MIP models
   using CPLEX, GUROBI and SCIP, focusing on both the number of instances
   that can be proved optimal and the solution quality over time. Our
   results demonstrate that modern MIP solvers are able to prove optimality
   for moderate-sized problems very quickly. Comparing the four MIP models,
   the disjunctive formulation proposed by Manne performs best on both
   performance measures. We also investigate the performance of MIP with
   multi-threading and parameter tuning using CPLEX. Noticeable performance
   gain is observed when compared to the results using only single thread
   and default parameter settings. Our results serve as a snapshot of the
   performance of modern MIP solvers for an important, well-studied
   scheduling problem. Finally, the results of MW is compared to constraint
   programming (CP), another common approach for scheduling, and the best
   known complete algorithm to provide a broad view among different
   approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Progress toward the development of minimally invasive liquid biopsies of
   disease is being bolstered by breakthroughs in the analysis of
   circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA): DNA released from cancer cells into the
   bloodstream. However, robust, sensitive, and specific methods of
   detecting this emerging analyte are lacking. ctDNA analysis has unique
   challenges, since it is imperative to distinguish circulating DNA from
   normal cells vs mutation-bearing sequences originating from tumors. Here
   we report the electrochemical detection of mutated ctDNA in samples
   collected from cancer patients. By developing a strategy relying on the
   use of DNA clutch probes (DCPs) that render specific sequences of ctDNA
   accessible, we were able to readout the presence of mutated ctDNA. DCPs
   prevent reassociation strands of a dsDNA accessible for hybridization to
   a probe, and they also deactivate other closely related sequences in
   solution. DCPs ensure thereby that only mutated sequences associate with
   chip-based sensors detecting hybridization events. The assay exhibits
   excellent sensitivity and specificity in the detection of mutated ctDNA:
   it detects 1 fg/mu L of a target mutation in the presence of 100 pg/mu
   L, of wild-type DNA, corresponding to detecting mutations at a level of
   0.01\% relative to wild type. This approach allows accurate analysis of
   samples collected from lung cancer and melanoma patients. This work
   represents the first detection of ctDNA without enzymatic amplification.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption of heptane vapour on a smooth silicon substrate with a
   lower temperature than the vapour is examined analytically and
   experimentally. An expression for the amount adsorbed under steady state
   conditions is derived from the molecular cluster model of the adsorbate
   that is similar to the one used to derive the equilibrium Zeta
   adsorption isotherm. The amount adsorbed in each of a series of steady
   experiments is measured using a UV-vis interferometer, and gives strong
   support to the amount predicted to be adsorbed. The cluster distribution
   is used to predict the subcooling temperature required for the adsorbed
   vapour to make a disorder-order phase transition to become an adsorbed
   liquid, and the subcooling temperature is found to be 2.7 +/- 0.4 K. The
   continuum approach for predicting the thickness of the adsorbed liquid
   film originally developed by Nusselt is compared with that measured and
   is found to over-predict the thickness by three-orders of magnitude.}},

Title = {{Biomusic: An Auditory Interface for Detecting Physiological Indicators
   of Anxiety in Children}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{For children with profound disabilities affecting communication, it can
   be extremely challenging to identify salient emotions such as anxiety.
   If left unmanaged, anxiety can lead to hypertension, cardiovascular
   disease, and other psychological diagnoses. Physiological signals of the
   autonomic nervous system are indicative of anxiety, but can be difficult
   to interpret for non-specialist caregivers. This paper evaluates an
   auditory interface for intuitive detection of anxiety from physiological
   signals. The interface, called ``Biomusic,{''} maps physiological
   signals to music (i.e., electrodermal activity to melody; skin
   temperature to musical key; heart rate to drum beat; respiration to a
   ``whooshing{''} embellishment resembling the sound of an exhalation).
   The Biomusic interface was tested in two experiments. Biomusic samples
   were generated from physiological recordings of typically developing
   children (n = 10) and children with autism spectrum disorders (n = 5)
   during relaxing and anxiety provoking conditions. Adult participants (n
   = 16) were then asked to identify ``anxious{''} or ``relaxed{''} states
   by listening to the samples. In a classification task with 30 Biomusic
   samples (1 relaxed state, 1 anxious state per child), classification
   accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 80.8\% {[}standard error
   (SE) = 2.3], 84.9\% (SE = 3.0), and 76.8\% (SE = 3.9), respectively.
   Participants were able to form an early and accurate impression of the
   anxiety state within 12.1 (SE = 0.7) seconds of hearing the Biomusic
   with very little training (i.e., <.10 min) and no contextual
   information. Biomusic holds promise for monitoring, communication, and
   biofeedback systems for anxiety management.}},

Abstract = {{The number of studies on organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites has soared
   in recent years. However, the majority of hybrid perovskites under
   investigation are based on a limited number of organic cations of
   suitable sizes, such as methylammonium and formamidinium. These small
   cations easily fit into the perovskite's three-dimensional (3D) lead
   halide framework to produce semiconductors with excellent charge
   transport properties. Until now, larger cations, such as ethylammonium,
   have been found to form 2D crystals with lead halide. Here we show for
   the first time that ethylammonium can in fact be incorporated
   coordinately with methylammonium in the lattice of a 3D perovskite
   thanks to a balance of opposite lattice distortion strains. This
   inclusion results in higher crystal symmetry, improved material
   stability, and markedly enhanced charge carrier lifetime. This crystal
   engineering strategy of balancing opposite lattice distortion effects
   vastly increases the number of potential choices of organic cations for
   3D perovskites, opening up new degrees of freedom to tailor their
   optoelectronic and environmental properties.}},

Title = {{Overcoming Spatial and Temporal Barriers to Public Access Defibrillators

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Immediate access to an automated external defibrillator (AED)
   increases the chance of survival for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
   (OHCA). Current deployment usually considers spatial AED access,
   assuming AEDs are available 24 h a day.
   OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to develop an optimization model
   for AED deployment, accounting for spatial and temporal accessibility,
   to evaluate if OHCA coverage would improve compared with deployment
   based on spatial accessibility alone.
   METHODS This study was a retrospective population-based cohort trial
   using data from the Toronto Regional RescuNET Epistry cardiac arrest
   database. We identified all nontraumatic public location OHCAs in
   Toronto, Ontario, Canada (January 2006 through August 2014) and obtained
   a list of registered AEDs (March 2015) from Toronto Paramedic Services.
   Coverage loss due to limited temporal access was quantified by comparing
   the number of OHCAs that occurred within 100 meters of a registered AED
   (assumed coverage 24 h per day, 7 days per week) with the number that
   occurred both within 100 meters of a registered AED and when the AED was
   available (actual coverage). A spatiotemporal optimization model was
   then developed that determined AED locations to maximize OHCA actual
   coverage and overcome the reported coverage loss. The coverage gain
   between the spatiotemporal model and a spatial-only model was computed
   by using 10-fold cross-validation.
   RESULTS A total of 2,440 nontraumatic public OHCAs and 737 registered
   AED locations were identified. A total of 451 OHCAs were covered by
   registered AEDs under assumed coverage 24 h per day, 7 days per week,
   and 354 OHCAs under actual coverage, representing a coverage loss of
   21.5\% (p < 0.001). Using the spatiotemporal model to optimize AED
   deployment, a 25.3\% relative increase in actual coverage was achieved
   compared with the spatial-only approach (p < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS One in 5 OHCAs occurred near an inaccessible AED at the time
   of the OHCA. Potential AED use was significantly improved with a
   spatiotemporal optimization model guiding deployment. (C) 2016 by the

Abstract = {{A self-assembled phospholipid monolayer at an air water interface is a
   well-defined model system for studying surface thermodynamics, membrane
   biophysics, thin-film materials, and colloidal soft matter. Here we
   report a study of two-dimensional phase transitions in the
   dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) monolayer at the air water
   interface using a newly developed methodology called constrained drop
   surfactometry (CDS). CDS is superior to the classical Langmuir balance
   in its capacity for rigorous temperature control and leak-proof
   environments, thus making it an ideal alternative to the Langmuir
   balance for studying lipid polymorphism. In addition, we have developed
   a novel Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) transfer technique that allows the direct
   transfer of lipid monolayers from the droplet surface under
   well-controlled conditions. This LB transfer technique permits the
   direct visualization of phase coexistence in the DPPC monolayer. With
   these technological advances, we found that the two-dimensional phase
   behavior of the DPPC monolayer is analogous to the three-dimensional
   phase transition of a pure substance. This study has implications in the
   fundamental understanding of surface thermodynamics as well as
   applications such as self-assembled monolayers and pulmonary surfactant
   biophysics.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, four-coordinated N,C-chelate organoboron compounds have been
   found to show many interesting photochemical transformations depending
   on the nature of their chelating framework. As such, the effect of
   substitution on the chelate ligand has been well-established and
   understood, but the impact of the aryl groups attached to the boron atom
   remains less clear. To investigate the effect of enhanced
   charge-transfer character, a series of new N,C-chelate organoboron
   compounds with donor-functionalized aryl groups have been synthesized
   and characterized using NMR, UV/Vis, and electrochemical methods. These
   compounds were found to possess bright and tunable charge-transfer
   luminescence which is dependent on the donor strength of the amino
   substituent. In addition, some of these compounds undergo photochromic
   switching, producing dark isomers of various colors. This work
   establishes that donor-functionalization of the aryl groups in
   N,C-chelate boron compounds is an effective strategy for tuning both the
   photophysical and photochemical properties of such systems. The new
   findings also help elucidate the influence of electronic structure on
   the photoreactivity of N,C-chelate organoboron compounds which appears
   to be as important as steric crowding around the boron atom.}},

Title = {{The usability of ventilators: a comparative evaluation of use safety and
   user experience}},
Journal = {{CRITICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: The design complexity of critical care ventilators (CCVs)
   can lead to use errors and patient harm. In this study, we present the
   results of a comparison of four CCVs from market leaders, using a
   rigorous methodology for the evaluation of use safety and user
   experience of medical devices.
   Methods: We carried out a comparative usability study of four CCVs:
   Hamilton G5, Puritan Bennett 980, Maquet SERVO-U, and Drager Evita V500.
   Forty-eight critical care respiratory therapists participated in this
   fully counterbalanced, repeated measures study. Participants completed
   seven clinical scenarios composed of 16 tasks on each ventilator. Use
   safety was measured by percentage of tasks with use errors or close
   calls (UE/CCs). User experience was measured by system usability and
   workload metrics, using the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire
   (PSSUQ) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load
   Index (NASA-TLX).
   Results: Nine of 18 post hoc contrasts between pairs of ventilators were
   significant after Bonferroni correction, with effect sizes between 0.4
   and 1.09 (Cohen's d). There were significantly fewer UE/CCs with SERVO-U
   when compared to G5 (p = 0.044) and V500 (p = 0.020). Participants
   reported higher system usability for G5 when compared to PB980 (p =
   0.035) and higher system usability for SERVO-U when compared to G5 (p <
   0.001), PB980 (p < 0.001), and V500 (p < 0.001). Participants reported
   lower workload for G5 when compared to PB980 (p < 0.001) and lower
   workload for SERVO-U when compared to PB980 (p < 0.001) and V500 (p <
   0.001). G5 scored better on two of nine possible comparisons; SERVO-U
   scored better on seven of nine possible comparisons. Aspects influencing
   participants' performance and perception include the low sensitivity of
   G5's touchscreen and the positive effect from the quality of SERVO-U's
   user interface design.
   Conclusions: This study provides empirical evidence of how four
   ventilators from market leaders compare and highlights the importance of
   medical technology design. Within the boundaries of this study, we can
   infer that SERVO-U demonstrated the highest levels of use safety and
   user experience, followed by G5. Based on qualitative data, differences
   in outcomes could be explained by interaction design, quality of
   hardware components used in manufacturing, and influence of consumer
   product technology on users' expectations.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the in operando determinations of liquid water saturation
   and corresponding effective diffusivities were measured for polymer
   electrolyte membrane fuel cell gas diffusion layers (GDLs).
   Through-plane liquid water saturation profiles were obtained by
   combining liquid water thicknesses measured from in operando synchrotron
   X-ray radiography and the GDL porosity distributions from ex situ X-ray
   computed tomography. The effective diffusivity of these partially
   saturated GDLs were determined from electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS) measurements combined with results from our
   one-dimensional fuel cell impedance model. The ratio of the effective
   diffusivity of the GDL to the oxygen bulk diffusivity was found to
   follow a power law relationship, (1 - s(avg))(2.80) which is in
   agreement with measurements typically reported in the literature from
   limiting current and three-dimensional mass transport models. The
   methodology presented in this paper provides a novel, in operando and
   complementary alternative technique for measuring the effective
   diffusivity of partially saturated GDLs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this work, the crystallization behavior of poly (lactic acid)
   (PLA)/amine-modified silica nanocomposites at different loadings of
   amine-modified silica (1, 2, and 8 wt \%) under isothermal,
   nonisothermal, and isothermal under compressed CO2 is studied. A
   significant improvement in crystallization rate was observed after
   introduction of the nanoparticles. A modified Hoffman-Lauritzen
   nucleation theory was utilized to explain the facilitation and
   acceleration of the crystallization process of nanocomposites with
   introducing the surface energy of the nanoparticles and interfacial
   energy between polymer/nanoparticle into the rate equation. After
   incorporation of the nanoparticles, three-dimensional spherulites formed
   sporadically in the PLA matrix based on the prediction of the Avrami
   exponents of the nanocomposites. High-pressure DSC results also showed
   an increase in the crystallization rate at 15 bar compared with the
   atmospheric pressure condition. However, an increase in pressure up to
   21 bar had no significant effect on the crystallization rate. The PLA
   nanocomposites with lower molecular weights and D-content also showed a
   significant increase in the crystallization rate but with no change in
   the crystallization mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Functionally graded (FG) materials owe their advantage over conventional
   composites to the continuous microstructure that eliminates many
   problems like delamination and stress jumps. Functionally graded porous
   structures have the added advantage of significant weight reduction
   while maintaining comparable strength to the solid precursor. One of the
   attractive applications of FG porous polymers is impact energy
   absorption. This is due to their viscoelastic nature that helps in
   energy dissipation, in addition to their light weight compared to metals
   and ceramics. In this work, FG porous structures of Acrylonitrile
   Butadiene Styrene (ABS) were fabricated with thermally activated
   microspheres. One-dimensional heat flow was introduced across the
   thickness with different terminal temperatures to induce a thermal
   gradient. Different compositions and processing conditions were carried
   out to investigate the relationship between impact energy and
   microstructure. Impact energy showed stronger correlation to pores'
   diameter gradient than to porosity. The fairly strong correlation
   between diameter gradient, permitted expansion ratio, and porosity
   indicates the potential to control the microstructure and hence impact
   energy absorption. Functionally graded porous structures of ABS
   demonstrated their superiority for impact absorption with
   strength-to-weight ratio of 46.02 J cm(3)/g compared to 25.71 J cm(3)/g
   for solid ABS. This work provides processing guidelines to fabricate FG
   porous structures of ABS in relation to impact energy. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Insights into the co-localization of magnitude-based versus

Abstract = {{The observed co-localization of disturbed flow and lesion prevalence at
   predisposed districts such as the carotid bifurcation has led to the
   identification of the wall shear stress (WSS) as biomechanical
   localizing factor of vascular dysfunction. In particular, a
   proatherogenic role is attributed to low and oscillatory WSS. However,
   the endothelial cells (ECs) are exposed to a complex hemodynamic milieu
   that can be only partially described by low/oscillatory WSS. Recently,
   in the attempt to close this gap, descriptors of the complex
   multidirectional nature of WSS have been proposed, i.e., the axial
   component of WSS (aligned with the vessel's centerline, to quantify flow
   reversal), and the transverse WSS (transWSS, quantifying the WSS
   component orthogonal to the cycle averaged WSS direction).
   Here we explore the relationship between recently-proposed indicators
   quantifying WSS multi directionality and ``established{''} WSS-based
   hemodynamic descriptors of low/oscillatory WSS, in a representative
   sample (N=46) of subject-specific computational hemodynamics models of
   ostensibly normal carotid bifurcations. To do it, we quantitatively
   assess the co-localization of those descriptors at the luminal surface,
   aiming at providing connections among the peculiar hemodynamic features
   captured by the different descriptors.
   According to our findings: (1) regions of flow reversal are moderately
   co-localized with low WSS; (2) high WSS oscillations (quantified by the
   oscillatory shear index, OSI) at the carotid bulb are prevalently
   aligned with the main flow, where flow reversal is predominant; (3)
   regions where transWSS is high do not co-localize with the other
   descriptors. We suggest that the investigated WSS-based descriptors
   might represent different hemodynamic disturbances with different impact
   on ECs homeostasis, potentially being part of WSS phenotypes more
   effective in localizing the map of vascular atherosclerotic lesions. (C)

Abstract = {{Discoveries have emerged highlighting the complex nature of the
   interorgan cross-talk between the kidney and the lung. Vascular
   rigidity, neurohormonal activation, tissue hypoxia, and abnormal immune
   cell signaling have been identified as common pathways leading to the
   development and progression of chronic kidney disease. However, our
   understanding of the causal relationships between lung injury and kidney
   injury is not precise. This review discusses a number of features and
   mechanisms of renal dysfunction in pulmonary disorders in relation to
   respiratory acidosis, impaired gas exchange, systemic congestion,
   respiratory support/replacement therapies, and other issues relevant to
   the clinical care of these patients. Biotrauma due to injurious
   ventilatory strategies can lead to the release of mediators into the
   lung, which may then translocate into the systemic circulation and cause
   end-organ dysfunction, including renal dysfunction. Right ventricular
   dysfunction and congestive states may contribute to alterations of renal
   perfusion and oxygenation, leading to diuretic resistance and recurrent
   hospitalization. In patients with concomitant respiratory failure,
   noninvasive ventilation represents a promising treatment option for the
   correction of impaired renal microcirculation and endothelial
   dysfunction. In patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,
   short- and long-term monitoring of kidney function is warranted, as they
   are at highest risk of developing acute kidney injury and fluid
   overload.}},

Abstract = {{Homogenization is very efficient tool in modeling of complex phenomena
   in heterogeneous media due to different length scales between the
   characteristic length of the microstructural features and the actual
   macroscale dimensions. This is particularly important when dealing with
   voided composite structures due to the high degree of microstructural
   irregularity. One of the challenges in designing polymeric porous or
   voided structures is the absence of accurate and robust viscoelastic
   homogenization technique that takes into account the microstructural
   details. Another challenge underlies in constructing the microstructure
   for numerical homogenization. This work proposes reduced 3D
   reconstruction procedure of voided composite structures based on
   statistical considerations and granular mechanics. Voids' diameters and
   fractions of the actual microstructure were extracted with a
   deterministic locally adaptive thresholding technique. The diameters
   were categorized with Freedman-Diaconis method but preserving the
   overall voids' fractions. The simulation box was then created from the
   reduced voids' diameters and fractions with granular mechanics.
   Numerical experiments were conducted with periodic boundary conditions
   to the walls of the simulation box. Voided structures of Acrylonitrile
   Butadiene Styrene (ABS) were fabricated with physical foaming agent and
   tested for creep compliance to validate the proposed procedure. The
   agreement with experimental results for creep compliance is very good
   with maximum error of 8.62\%. The contribution of the procedure is
   attributed to the simplicity and accuracy in developing representative
   voided structures from SEM images which otherwise need to be extracted
   from tedious processes like X-ray microtomography reconstruction. (C)

Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{323-339}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Conventional HVAC thermostats use a single temperature sensor at one
   fixed location in a controlled space to control the temperature of the
   whole space. However, in most applications only a small zone in the
   controlled space need to be controlled (for example where the people are
   located). Heating and cooling of the unnecessary zones lead to extra
   energy consumption that can be saved if only the required zones are
   controlled. Such a control system requires knowledge of the temperature
   distribution in the whole zone at all times. In this work, we have used
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to determine the distributive
   temperature inside the controlled space at all times and turn the HVAC
   system ON and OFF based on the temperature of the desired zone in the
   space. In this case, since the distributive temperature is not directly
   measured, and it is only calculated, the control system is referred to
   as a virtual thermostat for local temperature control. In this study, we
   have determined the energy savings by comparing the energy consumption
   of a thermostat controlled system with a locally controlled one. Several
   cases with different heat losses, and different inlet air velocities and
   directions are studied. Energy savings of more than 22\% is realized for
   the cases studied here. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper quantifies the benefits and limitations of cooperative
   communications by providing a statistical analysis of the downlink in
   network multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We consider an
   idealized model where the multiple-antenna base-stations (BSs) are
   distributed according to a homogeneous Poisson point process and
   cooperate by forming disjoint clusters. We assume that perfect channel
   state information is available at the cooperating BSs without any
   overhead. Multiple single-antenna users are served using zero-forcing
   beamforming with equal power allocation across the beams. For such a
   system, we obtain tractable, but accurate, approximations of the signal
   power and inter-cluster interference power distributions and derive a
   computationally efficient expression for the achievable per-BS ergodic
   sum rate using tools from stochastic geometry. This expression allows us
   to obtain the optimal loading factor, i.e., the ratio between the number
   of scheduled users and the number of BS antennas, that maximizes the
   per-BS ergodic sum rate. Further, it allows us to quantify the
   performance improvement of network MIMO systems as a function of the
   cooperating cluster size. We show that to perform zero-forcing across
   the distributed set of BSs within the cluster, the network MIMO system
   introduces a penalty in received signal power. Along with the inevitable
   out-of-cluster interference, we show that the per-BS ergodic sum rate of
   a network MIMO system does not approach that of an isolated cell even at
   unrealistically large cluster sizes. Nevertheless, network MIMO does
   provide significant rate improvement as compared to uncoordinated
   single-cell processing even at relatively modest cluster sizes.}},

Title = {{Fronthaul Compression and Transmit Beamforming Optimization for

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{16}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the joint fronthaul compression and transmit
   beamforming design for the uplink cloud radio access network (C-RAN), in
   which multi-antenna users communicate with a cloud-computing based
   centralized processor (CP) through multi-antenna base-stations (BSs)
   serving as relay nodes. A compress-and-forward relaying strategy, named
   the virtual multiple-access channel (VMAC) scheme, is employed, in which
   the BSs can either perform single-user compression or Wyner-Ziv coding
   to quantize the received signals and send the quantization bits to the
   CP via capacity-limited fronthaul links; the CP performs successive
   decoding with either successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver
   or linear minimum-mean square-error (MMSE) receiver. Under this setup,
   this paper investigates the joint optimization of the transmit
   beamformers and the quantization noise covariance matrices for
   maximizing the network utility. A novel weighted
   minimum-mean-square-error successive convex approximation (WMMSE-SCA)
   algorithm is first proposed for maximizing the weighted sum rate under
   the user transmit power and fronthaul capacity constraints with
   single-user compression. Assuming a heuristic decompression order, the
   proposed algorithm is then adapted for optimizing the transmit
   beamforming and fronthaul compression under Wyner-Ziv coding. This paper
   also proposes a low-complexity separate design consisting of optimizing
   transmit beamformers for the Gaussian vector multiple-access channel
   along with per-antenna quantizers with uniform quantization noise levels
   across the antennas at each BS. Numerical results show that majority of
   the performance gain brought by C-RAN comes from the implementation of
   SIC at the CP. Furthermore, the low complexity separate design already
   performs very close to the optimized joint design in regime of practical
   interest.}},

Abstract = {{Vibration energy harvesting has a great potential to achieve
   self-powered operations for wireless sensors, wearable devices and
   medical electronics, and thus has attracted much attention in academia
   and industry. The majority of research into this subject has focused on
   the piezoelectric effect of synthetic materials, especially the
   perovskite PZT ceramics. Recently the new-generation piezoelectric
   materials PMN-PT and PZN-PT single crystals have gained significant
   interest because of their outstanding piezoelectric properties. They can
   be used to replace the widely-adopted PZT ceramics for improving energy
   harvesters' performance substantially. However, there is little research
   on comparing PMN-PT and PZN-PT energy harvesters against PZT harvesters.
   In this paper, we present a systematic comparison between vibration
   energy harvesters using the PMN-PT, PZN-PT single crystals and those
   using the PZT ceramics. Key properties of the three materials are
   summarized and compared. The performance of the PMN-PT and PZN-PT energy
   harvesters is characterized under different conditions (beam length,
   resistance, frequency, excitation strength, and backward coupling
   effect), and is quantitatively compared with the PZT counterpart.
   Furthermore, the effect of the synchronized switch harvesting on
   inductor (SSHI) circuit on the three harvesters is discussed. The
   experimental results indicate that energy harvesters using the PMN-PT
   and PZN-PT single crystals can significantly outperform those using the
   PZT ceramics. This study provides a strong base for future research on
   high-performance energy harvesters using the new PMN-PT and PZN-PT
   single crystals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Naturally occurring vanadium is found in many heavy oils and bitumen,
   which are upgraded to synthetic crude oil via the coking process. During
   coking the vanadium concentrates in the solid heavy oil product,
   petroleum coke. However, potential releases of this toxic vanadium,
   either due to long term natural leaching from stockpiles or during
   combustion, presents environmental and health concerns. In this study,
   the vanadium present in petroleum coke was characterized using high
   resolution transmission electron microscope imaging with
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Vanadium was observed in
   nanocrystalline mineral clusters, and is consistently associated with
   silicon, oxygen, sulfur, and iron. A distinct lattice structure is
   observed in these nanocrystals. This result is different from previous
   theories, which predicted that the coking process did not decompose the
   vanadyl porphyrins present in bitumen. By identifying the vanadium
   nanocrystals in petroleum coke, the long term fate of vanadium in
   petroleum coke stockpiles in reclaimed land may be predicted. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The creation of a novel flexible nanocomposite fiber with conductive
   polymer polyaniline (PAni) coating on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
   substrate allowed for increased electrochemical performance while
   retaining ideal mechanical properties such as very high flexibility.
   Binderfree PAni-wrapped PET (PAni@PET) fiber with a core-shell structure
   was successfully fabricated through a novel technique. The PET nanofiber
   substrate was fabricated through an optimized electrospinning method,
   while the PAni shell was chemically polymerized onto the surface of the
   nanofibers. The PET substrate can be made directly from recycled PETE1
   grade plastic water bottles. The resulting nanofiber with an average
   diameter of 121 nm +/- 39 nm, with a specific surface area of 83.72 m(2)
   g(-1), led to better ionic interactions at the electrode/electrolyte
   interface. The PAni active layer coating was found to be 69 nm in
   average thickness. The specific capacitance was found to have increased
   dramatically from pure PAni with carbon binders. The specific
   capacitance was found to be 347 F g(-1) at a relatively high scan rate
   of 10 mV s(-1). The PAni/PET fiber also experienced very little
   degradation (4.4\%) in capacitance after 1500 galvanostatic
   charge/discharge cycles at a specific current of 1.2 A g(-1). The
   mesoporous structure of the PAni@PET fibrous mat also allowed for
   tunable capacitance by controlling the pore sizes. This novel
   fabrication method offers insights for the utilization of recycled PETE1
   based bottles as a high performance, low cost, highly flexible
   supercapacitor device.}},

Abstract = {{Bismuth-based hybrid perovskites are candidates for lead-free and
   air-stable photovoltaics, but poor surface morphologies and a high
   band-gap energy have previously limited these hybrid perovskites. A new
   materials processing strategy to produce enhanced bismuth-based
   thin-film photovoltaic absorbers by incorporation of monovalent silver
   cations into iodobismuthates is presented. Solution-processed AgBi2I7
   thin films are prepared by spin-coating silver and bismuth precursors
   dissolved in n-butylamine and annealing under an N-2 atmosphere. X-ray
   diffraction analysis reveals the pure cubic structure (Fd3m) with
   lattice parameters of a=b=c=12.223 angstrom. The resultant AgBi2I7 thin
   films exhibit dense and pinhole-free surface morphologies with grains
   ranging in size from 200-800 nm and a low band gap of 1.87 eV suitable
   for photovoltaic applications. Initial studies produce solar power
   conversion efficiencies of 1.22\% and excellent stability over at least
   10 days under ambient conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The solubility of carbon dioxide (CO2) and dimethyl ether (DME) blends
   in polystyrene (PS) is studied as a function of the temperature and the
   pressure. The solubility was measured by means of the gravimetric method
   and a visualizing dilatometer which determined the swollen volume to
   compensate for the buoyancy change due to swelling. The solubility of
   the blend gases for the ternary PS/CO2/DME system is also predicted by
   the Simha-Somcynsky (SS) equation of state (EOS). The theoretical
   prediction of the blend solubility was in agreement with the
   experimental results. Adding DME to PS not only decreased the pressure
   required to dissolve CO2 in PS but the effects of plasticization were
   also observed. The remarkable plasticization effect due to the presence
   of DME increased the CO2 solubility via an increased free volume of PS.

Abstract = {{Two low cost solid organic materials, sawdust and peat, were tested in
   laboratory batch microcosm and flow-through column experiments to
   determine their suitability for application in permeable reactive
   barriers (PRBs) supporting biodegradation of trichloroethene (TCE). In
   microcosms with peat, TCE (similar to 30 mu M) was sequentially and
   completely degraded to cis-dichloroethene (cDCE), vinyl chloride, and
   ethene through reductive dechlorination. In microcosms with sawdust,
   reductive dechlorination of TCE stopped at cDCE and high methane
   production (up to 3000 mu M) was observed. 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of
   Dehalobacter and Archaea were higher (1000 and 10 times, respectively)
   in sawdust microcosms than those in peat microcosms. Dehalococcoides and
   vcrA gene copy numbers were 10 times higher in peat microcosms than in
   sawdust microcosms. These gene copy number differences are consistent
   with the extent of TCE degradation and production of methane in the
   microcosms. Flow-through column experiments showed that hydraulic
   conductivity reduction with time was consistently greater in the sawdust
   column compared to the peat column. The greater conductivity reduction
   was likely due to biofouling and methane gas bubble formation. The
   experimental observations indicate that peat has potential to be a
   better solid organic material than sawdust to support reductive
   dechlorination of TCE in PRB applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Graphdiyne, a novel large pi-conjugated carbon hole transporting
   material, is employed as anode buffer layer in colloidal quantum dots
   solar cells. Power conversion efficiency is notably enhanced to 10.64\%
   from 9.49\% compared to relevant reference devices. Hole transfer from
   the quantum dot solid active layer to the anode can be appreciably
   enhanced only by using graphdiyne to lower the work function of the
   colloidal quantum dot solid. It is found that the all-carbon buffer
   layer prolongs the carrier lifetime, reducing surface recombination on
   the previously neglected back side of the photovoltaic device.
   Remarkably, the device also shows high long-term stability in ambient
   air. The results demonstrate that graphdiyne may have diverse
   applications in enhancing optoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Compared to port fuel injection (PFI) engine exhaust, gasoline direct
   injection (GDI) engine exhaust has higher emissions of black carbon
   (BC), a climate-warming pollutant. However, the relative increase in BC
   emissions and climate trade-offs of replacing PFI vehicles with more
   fuel efficient GDI vehicles remain uncertain. In this study, BC
   emissions from GDI and PFI vehicles were compiled and BC emissions
   scenarios were developed to evaluate the climate impact of GDI vehicles
   using global warming potential (GWP) and global temperature potential
   (GTP) metrics. From a 20 year time horizon GWP analysis, average fuel
   economy improvements ranging from 0.14 to 14\% with GDI vehicles are
   required to offset BC-induced warming. For all but the lowest BC
   scenario, installing a gasoline particulate filter with an 80\% BC
   removal efficiency and <1\% fuel penalty is climate beneficial. From the
   GTP-based analysis, it was also determined that GDI vehicles are climate
   beneficial within <1-20 years; longer time horizons were associated with
   higher BC scenarios. The GDI BC emissions spanned 2 orders of magnitude
   and varied by ambient temperature, engine operation, and fuel
   composition. More work is needed to understand BC formation mechanisms
   in GDI engines to ensure that the climate impacts of this engine
   technology are minimal.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},

Pages = {{4545-4557}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Continuous dose delivery in radiation therapy treatments has
   been shown to decrease total treatment time while improving the dose
   conformity and distribution homogeneity over the conventional
   step-and-shoot approach. The authors develop an inverse treatment
   planning method for Gamma Knife (R) Perfexion (TM) that continuously
   delivers dose along a path in the target.
   Methods: The authors' method is comprised of two steps: find a path
   within the target, then solve a mixed integer optimization model to find
   the optimal collimator configurations and durations along the selected
   path. Robotic path-finding techniques, specifically, simultaneous
   localization and mapping (SLAM) using an extended Kalman filter, are
   used to obtain a path that travels sufficiently close to selected
   isocentre locations. SLAM is novelly extended to explore a 3D, discrete
   environment, which is the target discretized into voxels. Further novel
   extensions are incorporated into the steering mechanism to account for
   target geometry.
   Results: The SLAM method was tested on seven clinical cases and compared
   to clinical, Hamiltonian path continuous delivery, and inverse
   step-and-shoot treatment plans. The SLAM approach improved dose metrics
   compared to the clinical plans and Hamiltonian path continuous delivery
   plans. Beam-on times improved over clinical plans, and had mixed
   performance compared to Hamiltonian path continuous plans. The SLAM
   method is also shown to be robust to path selection inaccuracies,
   isocentre selection, and dose distribution.
   Conclusions: The SLAM method for continuous delivery provides decreased
   total treatment time and increased treatment quality compared to both
   clinical and inverse step-and-shoot plans, and outperforms existing path
   methods in treatment quality. It also accounts for uncertainty in
   treatment planning by accommodating inaccuracies.}},

   Responses to Vibrotactile Stimuli}},

Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Artificial sensory feedback (ASF) systems can be used to compensate for
   lost proprioception in individuals with lower-limb impairments.
   Effective design of these ASF systems requires an in-depth understanding
   of how the parameters of specific feedback mechanism affect user
   perception and reaction to stimuli. This article presents a method for
   applying vibrotactile stimuli to human participants and measuring their
   response. Rotating mass vibratory motors are placed at pre-defined
   locations on the participant's thigh, and controlled through custom
   hardware and software. The speed and accuracy of participants'
   volitional responses to vibrotactile stimuli are measured for
   researcher-specified combinations of motor placement and vibration
   frequency. While the protocol described here uses push-buttons to
   collect a simple binary response to the vibrotactile stimuli, the
   technique can be extended to other response mechanisms using inertial
   measurement units or pressure sensors to measure joint angle and weight
   bearing ratios, respectively. Similarly, the application of vibrotactile
   stimuli can be explored for body segments other than the thigh.}},

Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{114}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The heterogeneous intra-tumoral accumulation of liposomes is a critical
   determinant of their efficacy. Both the chaotic tumor microcirculation
   and elevated IFP are linked to the heterogeneous intra-tumoral
   distribution of nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems such as
   liposomes. In the present study, the relationship between tumor
   microcirculation, elevated IFP, and accumulation of nanoparticles was
   investigated through in vivo experimentation. This was accomplished by
   evaluation of the tumor microcirculation using dynamic contrast enhanced
   computed tomography (DCE-CT) and measurement of tumor IFP using a novel
   image-guided robotic needle placement system connected to the micro-CT
   scanner. The intra-tumoral accumulation of liposomes was determined by
   CT image-based assessment of a nanoparticle liposomal formulation that
   stably encapsulate the contrast agent iohexol (CT-liposomes). CT imaging
   allowed for co-localization of the spatial distribution of tumor
   hemodynamics, IFP and CT-liposome accumulation in an individual
   subcutaneous xenograft mouse model of breast cancer. Measurements led to
   the discovery that perfusion and plasma volume fraction are strong
   mediators of the intra-tumoral distribution of liposomes. Furthermore,
   the results suggest that IFP plays an indirect role in mediating
   liposome distribution through modulating blood flow.}},

Abstract = {{Shoulder pain is one of the most commonly occurring health conditions in
   ordinary people as a result of improper or excessive arm usage. Patients
   with shoulder pain are not able to move their arm normally and usually
   need to visit a healthcare center to get proper rehabilitation. However,
   there is a cost in traveling and an elaborate procedure is used by the
   physiotherapist. Most prior works in the literature have tried to
   improve the assessment method in terms of range of motion (ROM) angle
   movement because they are concerned about the accuracy and reliability
   of the measurement and disease consideration. In this work, we proposed
   a new tele-rehabilitation system using an audio-biofeedback (ABF)
   technique that can lead patients to improved rehabilitation performance
   compared to a previously developed system without auditory aid. Twenty
   volunteers (11 men and 9 women) participated in our experiment to
   compare performance between ABF and non-ABF systems. The result shows
   that the ABF system performed significantly better than non-ABF system
   for all three target angles of rehabilitation exercise (90, 120, and 150
   degrees) (p < .001). Therefore, it can be concluded that using the
   proposed tele-rehabilitation system with ABF can lead patients to better
   rehab performance and would enable them to reduce traveling costs and
   time.}},

   focus exclusively on developing ways to improve the visual

Title = {{How to Diagonalize a MIMO Channel With Arbitrary Transmit Covariance?}},
Journal = {{IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{352-355}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) or multi-antenna communication is
   a key technique to achieve high spectral efficiency in wireless systems.
   For the point-to-point MIMO channel, it is a well-known result that the
   channel singular value decomposition (SVD) based linear precoding and
   decoding achieves the channel capacity, which also diagonalizes the MIMO
   channel into parallel single-input single-output sub-channels for
   independent encoding and decoding. However, in multi-user MIMO systems,
   the optimal transmit covariance of each MIMO link is generally not its
   channel SVD based as a result of the control and balance of the
   co-channel interference among users. Thus, it remains unknown whether
   the linear precoding/decoding strategy is still able to achieve the
   capacity of each MIMO link and yet diagonalize its MIMO channel, with a
   given set of optimal transmit covariance of all users. This letter
   solves this open problem by providing a closed-form capacity-achieving
   linear precoder/decoder design that diagonalizes a MIMO channel with
   arbitrary transmit covariance. Numerical examples are also provided to
   validate the proposed solution in various multi-user MIMO systems.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{402-414}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Tumor heterogeneity is increasingly implicated in the limited
   therapeutic efficacy exerted by nanomedicines in vivo. Such
   heterogeneity is manifold - existing at macro- and microscopic scales,
   and subject to tumor differentiation, region, intervention, and time.
   Further, variable patient response to nano-based therapy has called into
   question the current pursuit, and practices, of nano-formulation
   development. Long-standing concepts in advanced drug delivery may
   therefore benefit from renewed examination in light of ongoing
   elucidations into tumor pathophysiology. Tumor microenvironmental
   features bear significant structural and functional constraints to
   effective nanomedicine delivery. Importantly, the relationship between
   delivery and therapeutic efficacy has proved elusive, owing to
   inefficient drug release from nanocarriers and/or target site access
   resulting from physical or physiological hindrance. Characterization of
   local tumor parameters as potential determinants of nanomedicine
   efficacy may complement conventional whole-tumor measurements. The
   challenges in identifying key determinants of nanomedicine efficacy and
   monitoring their impact in space and time are non-trivial. Newly
   developed image-based methodologies provide a non-invasive and
   quantitative means of measuring the performance of both nanomedicine
   (e.g., pharmacodynamic effect) and microenvironmental properties (e.g.,
   abnormal supply and transport of nutrients/drugs), with the potential to
   enable appropriate treatment design. Ultimately, the personalization of
   anti-cancer therapies may require the characterization of underlying
   pathophysiological parameters, and their association with therapeutic
   outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Progress in therapeutics and biotechnologies leveraging new insights in
   our understanding of cancer biology and progression have had an
   underwhelming clinical significance thus far. A key challenge arising
   from the creation of nanomedicines consolidating multiple desirable
   functionalities into a `all-in-one' platform is that the layering of
   functionalities into a single agent introduces novel complexities that
   significantly impede clinical translation. An alternative design
   approach seeks to exploit intrinsically multi-functional building block
   to assemble nanomedicines from the bottom-up, yielding agents with a
   multiplicity of radiologic, pharmacologic, and therapeutic properties
   derived from a single constituent. Herein are highlighted recent

Abstract = {{A new low-profile, full-space, electronic beamsteering antenna
   architecture which combines the full-space beam-steering properties of
   reconfigurable transmitarrays with the low-profile feeding
   characteristics of leaky-wave antennas is proposed. The design uses an
   integrated leaky-wave feed to spatially distribute power across a
   reconfigurable transmitarray aperture in a low-profile manner while
   individual element phase control using varactor diodes enables
   full-space pencil-beam-steering. A 6x6 element array was fabricated and
   experimentally verified, and full-space (both azimuth and elevation)
   beamsteering was demonstrated at angles up to 45 degrees off broadside
   with a total efficiency for all scan angles on the order of 25\%-35\%.
   The design demonstrates a tenfold reduction in the overall thickness
   over the original transmitarray, improved aperture amplitude
   distribution control, as well as improved spillover control. The design
   also acts as a lower cost, scalable alternative to phased arrays as it
   does not require a complicated beamforming network and the feed and
   aperture are easily scaled.}},

Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{3284-3295}},

Abstract = {{The ergodic capacity of multiuser multiple-antenna amplify and forward
   relay networks with co-channel interference is investigated.
   Notwithstanding the system complexity, the proposed capacity analysis
   framework was made possible owing to the newly found complementary
   moment generating function transform. First, the exact expression for
   the ergodic capacity, under interference-aware opportunistic scheduling
   and Rayleigh fading, is derived for finite antenna and user counts. In
   addition, using extreme value theory, closed-form expressions for the
   asymptotic ergodic rates are derived for an unlimited number of users
   or/and antennas at the source. The large-scale analysis embodies,
   through new insightful formulas, common popular observations so far
   disclosed intuitively or empirically. Capitalizing on these novel
   scaling laws, we have been able to derive new closed-form expressions
   for capacity losses due to intercell interference at the relay and all
   users. Simulation results suggest a rather fast convergence of the
   capacity gains to the new asymptotic limits, thereby demonstrating the
   practical importance of our novel scaling results.}},

Journal = {{AIP ADVANCES}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the modeling and parametric analysis of the recently
   proposed nonlinear compressive-mode energy harvester (HC-PEH) under
   harmonic excitation. Both theoretical and experimental investigations
   are performed in this study over a range of excitation frequencies.
   Specially, a distributed parameter electro-elastic model is analytically
   developed by means of the energy-based method and the extended
   Hamilton's principle. An analytical formulation of bending and
   stretching forces are derived to gain insight on the source of
   nonlinearity. Furthermore, the analytical model is validated against
   with experimental data and a good agreement is achieved. Both numerical
   simulations and experiment illustrate that the harvester exhibits a
   hardening nonlinearity and hence a broad frequency bandwidth, multiple
   coexisting solutions and a large-amplitude voltage response. Using the
   derived model, a parametric study is carried out to examine the effect
   of various parameters on the harvester voltage response. It is also
   shown from parametric analysis that the harvester's performance can be
   further improved by selecting the proper length of elastic beams, proof
   mass and reducing the mechanical damping. (C) 2016 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{The health state of a rolling bearing keeps changing from a normal state
   to a slight degradation state followed eventually by a severely degraded
   state. To make reasonable inspection and maintenance plans, it is
   necessary to estimate the degradation state and predict the lifetime of
   a running rolling bearing accurately and in a timely fashion. This paper
   presents a new method for rolling bearing degradation state estimation
   and lifetime prediction based on curve similarity recognition. Different
   from existing methods, this method employs a dynamic time warping
   algorithm to recognize the curve similarity of those extracted features
   of rolling bearings in different states of health, which can reflect the
   intrinsic state of the rolling bearing; it discretizes the bearing
   degradation state reasonably through curve similarity. Next, the curve
   similarity is used to train the degradation state estimation model and a
   support vector machine based lifetime prediction model. Finally, this
   paper conducts a case study for a rolling bearing with impact
   degradation and one with wear degradation, respectively. The
   experimental results indicate that the new proposed method is highly
   efficient in recognizing the bearing's degradation state and predicting
   its lifetime.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The organization of nanoparticles in constrained geometries is an area
   of fundamental and practical importance. Spherical confinement of
   nanocolloids leads to new modes of packing, self-assembly, phase
   separation and relaxation of colloidal liquids; however, it remains an
   unexplored area of research for colloidal liquid crystals. Here we
   report the organization of cholesteric liquid crystal formed by nanorods
   in spherical droplets. For cholesteric suspensions of cellulose
   nanocrystals, with progressive confinement, we observe phase separation
   into a micrometer-size isotropic droplet core and a cholesteric shell
   formed by concentric nanocrystal layers. Further confinement results in
   a transition to a bipolar planar cholesteric morphology. The
   distribution of polymer, metal, carbon or metal oxide nanoparticles in
   the droplets is governed by the nanoparticle size and yields cholesteric
   droplets exhibiting fluorescence, plasmonic properties and magnetic
   actuation. This work advances our understanding of how the interplay of
   order, confinement and topological defects affects the morphology of
   soft matter.}},

Abstract = {{The cortex encodes a broad range of inputs. This breadth of operation
   requires sensitivity to weak inputs yet non-saturating responses to
   strong inputs. If individual pyramidal neurons were to have a narrow
   dynamic range, as previously claimed, then staggered all-or-none
   recruitment of those neurons would be necessary for the population to
   achieve a broad dynamic range. Contrary to this explanation, we show
   here through dynamic clamp experiments in vitro and computer simulations
   that pyramidal neurons have a broad dynamic range under the noisy
   conditions that exist in the intact brain due to background synaptic
   input. Feedforward inhibition capitalizes on those noise effects to
   control neuronal gain and thereby regulates the population dynamic
   range. Importantly, noise allows neurons to be recruited gradually and
   occludes the staggered recruitment previously attributed to
   heterogeneous excitation. Feedforward inhibition protects spike timing
   against the disruptive effects of noise, meaning noise can enable the
   gain control required for rate coding without compromising the precise

Abstract = {{Understanding workload characteristics is essential to storage systems
   design and performance optimization. With the emergence of flash memory
   as a new viable storage medium, the new design concern of flash
   endurance arises, necessitating a revisit of workload characteristics,
   in particular, of the write behavior. Inspired by Web caching studies
   where a Zipf-like access pattern is commonly found, we hypothesize that
   write count distribution at the block level may also follow Zipf's Law.
   To validate this hypothesis, we study 48 block I/O traces collected from
   a wide variety of real and benchmark applications. Through extensive
   analysis, we demonstrate that the Zipf-like pattern indeed widely exists
   in write traffic provided its disguises are removed by statistical
   processing. This finding implies that write skew in a large class of
   applications could be analytically expressed and, thus, facilitates
   design tradeoff explorations adaptive to workload characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a general methodology of inductive power delivery in
   wireless chronic rodent electrophysiology applications. The focus is on
   such systems design considerations under the following key constraints:
   maximum power delivery under the allowable specific absorption rate
   (SAR), low cost and spatial scalability. The methodology includes
   inductive coil design considerations within a low-frequency
   ferrite-core-free power transfer link which includes a scalable
   coil-array power transmitter floor and a single-coil implanted or worn
   power receiver. A specific design example is presented that includes the
   concept of low-SAR cellular single-transmitter-coil powering through
   dynamic tracking of a magnet-less receiver spatial location. The
   transmitter coil instantaneous supply current is monitored using a small
   number of low-cost electronic components. A drop in its value indicates
   the proximity of the receiver due to the reflected impedance of the
   latter. Only the transmitter coil nearest to the receiver is activated.
   Operating at the low frequency of 1.5 MHz, the inductive powering floor
   delivers a maximum of 15.9 W below the IEEE C95 SAR limit, which is over
   three times greater than that in other recently reported designs. The
   power transfer efficiency of 39\% and 13\% at the nominal and maximum
   distances of 8 cm and 11 cm, respectively, is maintained.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new computer-assisted ultrasound probe placement system
   is introduced to guide paramedics and first responders to conduct
   abdominal ultrasound imaging for diagnosing trauma patients in emergency
   situations where specialists are not present. Recently, telesonography
   has been employed to supervise paramedics by remote experts to perform
   ultrasound scan for triaging, although its utility is limited by
   unavailability of fast internet connectivity in remote regions. In the
   proposed solution of this paper, a paramedic is first instructed to
   place the ultrasound probe on an initial placement for imaging an organ
   of interest. Then, a three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound image is
   acquired and processed to determine the organ's shape misalignment with
   respect to a reference alignment. Afterward, the organ's shape
   misalignment is used to estimate the probe misalignment, and then, a
   probe placement command is generated to guide the paramedic. This
   process iterates until a correct organ's view of interest is obtained.
   As the advantage of the proposed solution over the existing technique,
   the proposed solution does not require a fast Internet connectivity and
   a dedicated remote specialist to conduct ultrasound imaging by a
   paramedic. The utility of the proposed solution is evaluated for a case
   study on the right upper quadrant (RUQ) view, which has a paramount
   importance in triaging trauma patients. Accuracy and robustness of the
   proposed solution is verified using actual and simulated 3-D ultrasound
   images of the RUQ view.}},

Title = {{Linear Stability Analysis and Dynamic Response of Shimmy Dampers for
   Main Landing Gears}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the analysis and study of common shimmy dampers used
   today for main landing gears with the use of analytical and numerical
   tools. The shimmy phenomenon is studied by using the tire stretched
   string theory model and by developing linear approximations of the
   dynamics of a single tire landing gear. The dynamics of commonly used
   shimmy dampers are then incorporated into the model. The objectives of
   this paper are to study already developed shimmy damper designs and to
   develop tools to design a new innovative and better shimmy damper for
   main landing gears, those which have non-steerable wheels. Two shimmy
   damper designs are studied in this paper, one developed by Boeing and
   another by UTC Aerospace Systems (UTAS). A linear approximation of the
   dynamics of these dampers is obtained, omitting the freeplay,
   saturation, and nonlinear dynamics. Stability plots are then created by
   changing the system's parameters, such as the velocity, caster length,
   and the shimmy damper stiffness and damping coefficients. These plots
   show the comparison of using a UTC two-arm design against the Boeing
   damper, for which the former spans larger zones of stability but
   requires higher damping coefficients due to the UTC damper's geometry
   which is very impractical. In addition, a multibody model is developed
   in MSC ADAMS (from MSC Software Corporation) to study the dynamic
   response of these systems and to create a modeling tool that can be used
   to design a new and improved shimmy damper for main landing gears. The
   simulation results from the model show the disadvantages of using the
   UTC two-arm damper, which include an asymmetrical vibration response.
   Further recommendations are given to design an improved shimmy damper.}},

   clusters in aqueous medium}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{340}},

Abstract = {{Catalytic pathways for acetic acid (CH3COOH) and hydrogen (H-2)
   reactions on dispersed Ru clusters in the aqueous medium and the
   associated kinetic requirements for C-O and C-C bond cleavages and
   hydrogen insertions are established from rate and isotopic assessments.
   CH3COOH reacts with H-2 in steps that either retain its carbon backbone
   and lead to ethanol, ethyl acetate, and ethane (47-95\%, 1-23\%, and
   21-7\% carbon selectivities, respectively) or break its C-C bond and
   form methane (1-43\% carbon selectivities) at moderate temperatures
   (413-523 K) and H-2 pressures (10-60 bar, 298 K). Initial CH3COOH
   activation is the kinetically-relevant step, during which CH3C(O)-OH
   bond cleaves on a metal site pair at Ru cluster surfaces nearly
   saturated with adsorbed hydroxyl (OH{*}) and acetate (CH3COO{*})
   intermediates, forming an adsorbed acetyl (CH3CO{*}) and hydroxyl
   (OH{*}) species. Acetic acid turnover rates increase proportionally with
   both H-2 (10-60 bar) and CH3COOH concentrations at low CH3COOH
   concentrations (<0.83 M), but decrease from first to zero order as the
   CH3COOH concentration and the CH3COO{*} coverages increase and the
   vacant Ru sites concomitantly decrease. Beyond the initial CH3C(O)-OH
   bond activation, sequential H-insertions on the surface acetyl species
   (CH3CO{*}) lead to C-2 products and their derivative (ethanol, ethane,
   and ethyl acetate) while the competitive C-C bond cleavage of CH3CO{*}
   causes the eventual methane formation. The instantaneous carbon
   selectivities toward C-2 species (ethanol, ethane, and ethyl acetate)
   increase linearly with the concentration of proton-type H delta+
   (derived from carboxylic acid dissociation) and chemisorbed H{*}. The
   selectivities toward C-2 products decrease with increasing temperature,
   because of higher observed barriers for C-C bond cleavage than
   H-insertion. This study offers an interpretation of mechanism and
   energetics and provides kinetic evidence of carboxylic acid assisted
   proton-type hydrogen (H delta+) shuffling during H-insertion steps in
   the aqueous phase, unlike those in the vapor phase, during the
   hydrogenation of acetic acid on Ru clusters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Calibrated CFD erosion modeling of abrasive slurry jet micro-machining
   of channels in ductile materials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Pages = {{90-101}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Abrasive slurry jet micro-machining (ASJM) uses a relatively high-speed
   jet of fine abrasive slurry to precisely machine controlled-depth
   micro-features such as channels. Existing surface evolution models,
   developed for air-driven erosion processes, cannot account for the
   effect of slurry flow on the channel sidewall erosion that leads to the
   progressive channel widening observed in the ASJM of ductile materials.
   This paper presents a novel numerical-empirical model to predict the
   profiles of micro-channels in ductile materials (i.e.
   polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), 6061-T6 aluminum alloy, 316L stainless
   steel and Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy) using ASJM. The specific erosion
   rates of these materials were measured as a function of jet angle using
   a 10 mu m nominal diameter aluminum oxide slurry. The erosion rate
   impact angle relations were corrected using computational fluid dynamic
   (CFD) models to account for the local impact angles and velocities of
   the particles. The erosion rate-impact angle relations were then used in
   three-dimensional CFD models to obtain the particle trajectories, impact
   angles, and velocities on a shallow eroded profile, and thus predict the
   erosion for deeper profiles. The model was verified by comparison with
   experiments which showed the previously-observed widening of the
   machined channels as the depth increased due to secondary erosion by
   particles impacting the channel sidewalls. The widening effect was found
   to be substantial in the PMMA but less important in Ti-6A1-4V titanium
   alloy due to its greater erosion resistance. The numerical-empirical
   approach could accurately estimate the widening and predicted the
   channel cross-sections up to an aspect ratio of approximately 1 with a
   maximum error of less than 5\%. (C) 2016 The Society of Manufacturing

Abstract = {{Dielectrophoretic (DEP) forces applied to microscopic particles are
   highly dependent on the gradient of the electric field experienced by
   the particles. These DEP forces can be used to selectively capture and
   remove cells from fluid flows within a micro-channel above the DEP
   electrodes. Modification of the geometry of the electrodes that generate
   the electric field is the main approach available to increase the
   electric field gradient over a wide area, and hence increase the applied
   dielectrophoretic force. Optimized DEP forces increase attraction or
   repulsion of target cells from the electrode surface, enhancing the
   efficacy of electrodes for cell sorting applications. In this paper, we
   present a design approach, using genetic optimization techniques, to
   develop novel electrode geometries that effectively capture target
   particles. The performance of candidate electrode designs is evaluated
   by calculating simplified particle trajectories.}},

Abstract = {{Steroid hormones, such as androgens, are common surface-water
   contaminants. However, literature on the ecophysiological relevance of
   steroid-degrading organisms in the environment, particularly in anoxic
   ecosystems, is extremely limited. We previously reported that
   Steroidobacter denitrificans anaerobically degrades androgens through
   the 2,3-seco pathway. In this study, the genome of Sdo. denitrificans
   was completely sequenced. Transcriptomic data revealed gene clusters
   that were distinctly expressed during anaerobic growth on testosterone.
   We isolated and characterized the bifunctional 1-testosterone
   hydratase/dehydrogenase, which is essential for anaerobic degradation of
   steroid A-ring. Because of apparent substrate preference of this
   molybdoenzyme, corresponding genes, along with the signature metabolites
   of the 2,3-seco pathway, were used as biomarkers to investigate androgen
   biodegradation in the largest sewage treatment plant in Taipei, Taiwan.
   Androgen metabolite analysis indicated that denitrifying bacteria in
   anoxic sewage use the 2,3-seco pathway to degrade androgens. Metagenomic
   analysis and PCR-based functional assays showed androgen degradation in
   anoxic sewage by Thauera spp. through the action of 1-testosterone
   hydratase/dehydrogenase. Our integrative `omics' approach can be used
   for culture-independent investigations of the microbial degradation of
   structurally complex compounds where isotope-labeled substrates are not
   easily available.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND CONTROL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{3312-3325}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Due to the advancements in data measurement and computer technology,
   automated data collection from multiple sensors has become common in
   recent years. However, very few papers have dealt with the cost-optimal
   early fault detection of gearboxes, condition based maintenance policy,
   and remaining useful life prediction when multiple sensors are used for
   data collection under varying load. The novel approach presented here is
   based on vector autoregressive vibration signal modeling and continuous
   time hidden Markov modeling using the optimal Bayesian control
   technique. System condition is modeled using a continuous time Markov
   chain with three states, namely, unobservable healthy state 0,
   unobservable warning state 1 and observable failure state 2. Model
   parameters are calculated using the expectation-maximization algorithm.
   The optimal control policy for the three-state model is represented by a
   Bayesian control chart for a multivariate observation process. The chart
   monitors the posterior probability that the system is in the warning
   state 1 and the system is stopped when this probability exceeds an
   optimal control limit. Prediction of mean residual life using a
   posterior probability is also developed in this paper. The validation of
   the proposed methodologies is carried out using actual gearbox vibration
   data obtained from multiple sensors.}},

Title = {{Pressure Standards in Water Distribution Systems: Reflection on Current
   Practice with Consideration of Some Unresolved Issues}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Pressure standards assist in the design of water distribution systems
   and the assessment of their performance. Although exact thresholds are
   sometimes rather vague, unusually high and low pressures are widely
   understood to increase costs and put systems at risk from events like
   pipe bursts at the high-pressure end to the risk of contaminant
   intrusion or poor firefighting conditions at the low-pressure end.
   Interestingly, because the definition of what conditions constitute
   acceptable pressures differs around the world, a delivery pressure might
   be considered acceptable in some regions and unacceptable in others. But
   if a wider range of system conditions is considered, including transient
   events, an interesting question arises as to what exactly the standards
   might mean and how violations should be evaluated. Specifically, what
   kinds of pressure transgressions are most crucial to system performance
   and economics and what kinds are merely inconvenient? Certainly the
   issue of evaluating consequences is relevant, but it is also complex
   because some consequences are not easily attributed to specific system
   conditions. As this paper considers, the frequency, duration, and
   intensity of the pressure violation are all relevant, but so is the
   vulnerability of the system to those violations. Few of these issues
   have yet received adequate attention, but it is to raising such a
   discussion that this paper is aimed. There is no doubt that pressure
   standards can help to assess system performance and to trigger system
   evolution (i.e.,operational and capital investments). But if the
   criteria themselves, and the means to evaluate them, are too vague, so
   will be the corrective outcomes.}},

Title = {{Heterogeneous reduction of carbon dioxide by hydride-terminated silicon
   nanocrystals}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Silicon constitutes 28\% of the earth's mass. Its high abundance, lack
   of toxicity and low cost coupled with its electrical and optical
   properties, make silicon unique among the semiconductors for converting
   sunlight into electricity. In the quest for semiconductors that can make
   chemicals and fuels from sunlight and carbon dioxide, unfortunately the
   best performers are invariably made from rare and expensive elements.
   Here we report the observation that hydride-terminated silicon
   nanocrystals with average diameter 3.5 nm, denoted ncSi: H, can function
   as a single component heterogeneous reducing agent for converting
   gaseous carbon dioxide selectively to carbon monoxide, at a rate of
   hundreds of mmol h(-1) g(-1). The large surface area, broadband visible
   to near infrared light harvesting and reducing power of SiH surface
   sites of ncSi: H, together play key roles in this conversion. Making use
   of the reducing power of nanostructured hydrides towards gaseous carbon
   dioxide is a conceptually distinct and commercially interesting strategy
   for making fuels directly from sunlight.}},

   (magnetoarticulography for the assessment of speech kinematics) designed
   to track detailed orofacial movements during magnetoencephalographic
   (MEG) measures of human brain activity. A three-dimensional
   electromagnetic-tracking method was employed using lightweight coils
   energized with high-frequency sinusoidal currents, creating magnetic
   dipoles that can be continuously localized by the MEG sensors. In
   addition to being compatible with commercial MEG devices, this system
   has advantages over optical or video methods in that it can record
   nonline-of-sight movements (e.g., tongue movements) and advantages over
   surface electromyographic recordings, which are prone to
   movement-related artifacts and signal crosstalk. Static and dynamic
   tracking accuracy was evaluated using calibration devices with fixed
   intercoil distances. MEG data were collected in two healthy adult
   volunteers to test feasibility of tracking movements during tongue and
   facial movement, and during overt speech. The MASK system was shown to
   have sufficient static and dynamic accuracy to track orofacial movements
   within the MEG helmet. We successfully acquired spatially precise
   kinematic information time-locked to brain activity with high temporal
   resolution. We demonstrated successful tracking of oromotor and speech
   movements together with brain activity using the MASK system. This novel
   technology will provide an innovative tool in support of research and
   clinical applications for individuals with speech and other oromotor
   disorders.}},

Abstract = {{SETTING: A 42-bed hospital operated by the Medical Research Council
   (MRC) Unit in The Gambia.
   OBJECTIVE: To devise, test and evaluate a cost-efficient uninterrupted
   oxygen system in the MRC Hospital.
   DESIGN: Oxygen cylinders were replaced with oxygen concentrators as the
   primary source of oxygen. An uninterruptable power supply (UPS) ensured
   continuity of power. Hospital staff were trained on the use of the new
   system. Eight years post-installation, an analysis of concentrator
   maintenance needs and costs was conducted and user feedback obtained to
   assess the success of the system.
   RESULTS: The new system saved at least 51\% of oxygen supply costs
   compared to cylinders, with savings likely to have been far greater due
   to cylinder leakages. Users SUMMARY indicated that the system is easier
   to use and more reliable, although technical support and staff training
   are still needed.
   CONCLUSION: Oxygen concentrators offer long-term cost savings and an
   improved user experience compared to cylinders; however, some technical
   support and maintenance are needed to upkeep the system. A UPS dedicated
   to oxygen concentrators is an appropriate solution for settings where
   power interruptions are frequent but short in duration. This approach
   can be a model for health systems in settings with similar
   infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{DUF89 family proteins occur widely in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes,
   but their functions are unknown. Here we define three DUF89 subfamilies
   (I, II, and III), with subfamily II being split into stand-alone
   proteins and proteins fused to pantothenate kinase (PanK). We
   demonstrated that DUF89 proteins have metal-dependent phosphatase
   activity against reactive phosphoesters or their damaged forms, notably
   sugar phosphates (subfamilies II and III), phosphopantetheine and its
   S-sulfonate or sulfonate (subfamily II-PanK fusions), and nucleotides
   (subfamily I). Genetic and comparative genomic data strongly associated
   DUF89 genes with phosphoester metabolism. The crystal structure of the
   yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) subfamily III protein YMR027W revealed
   a novel phosphatase active site with fructose 6-phosphate and Mg2+ bound
   near conserved signature residues Asp254 and Asn255 that are critical
   for activity. These findings indicate that DUF89 proteins are previously
   unrecognized hydrolases whose characteristic in vivo function is to
   limit potentially harmful buildups of normal or damaged
   phosphometabolites.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of the statistical properties of natural images has played a
   vital role in the design of no-reference (NR) image quality assessment
   (IQA) techniques. In this paper, we propose parametric models describing
   the general characteristics of chromatic data in natural images. They
   provide informative cues for quantifying visual discomfort caused by the
   presence of chromatic image distortions. The established models capture
   the correlation of chromatic data between spatially adjacent pixels by
   means of color invariance descriptors. The use of color invariance
   descriptors is inspired by their relevance to visual perception, since
   they provide less sensitive descriptions of image scenes against viewing
   geometry and illumination variations than luminances. In order to
   approximate the visual quality perception of chromatic distortions, we
   devise four parametric models derived from invariance descriptors
   representing independent aspects of color perception: 1) hue; 2)
   saturation; 3) opponent angle; and 4) spherical angle. The practical
   utility of the proposed models is examined by deploying them in our new
   general-purpose NR IQA metric. The metric initially estimates the
   parameters of the proposed chromatic models from an input image to
   constitute a collection of quality-aware features (QAF). Thereafter, a
   machine learning technique is applied to predict visual quality given a
   set of extracted QAFs. Experimentation performed on large-scale image
   databases demonstrates that the proposed metric correlates well with the
   provided subjective ratings of image quality over commonly encountered
   achromatic and chromatic distortions, indicating that it can be deployed
   on a wide variety of color image processing problems as a generalized
   IQA solution.}},

Abstract = {{In stick-slip positioning, friction between the stick-slip surfaces
   plays a critical role in positioning accuracy. Positioning performance
   varies when the load to drive changes. In this paper, by using a

   eliminate load influence. The stage is capable of operating in either a
   stepping mode or a scanning mode. Numerical modeling was conducted to
   analyze the static and dynamic characteristics of the stage design. In
   experiments, a number of parameters were tested on the constructed
   stage, and positioning performance was measured via laser-doppler
   vibrometry. Experimental results demonstrate that in the stepping mode,
   the stage has a travel range of 2 mm with incremental step sizes ranging
   from 30 nm to 2.3 mu m. In the scanning mode, the stage has a
   positioning resolution of 1.15 nm. The measured results also confirm
   that load variations on the stage have little influence on contact

Abstract = {{Nonlinear vibration is capable of effectively extending the frequency
   bandwidth of energy harvesters. Either hardening or softening
   nonlinearity has been used in various designs to achieve broad-bandwidth
   energy harvesting. In this paper, we propose a new method to achieve
   reversible hysteretic responses, i.e., both hardening and softening
   nonlinear responses, mechanically without additional magnetic
   interactions. This tunable nonlinearity endows energy harvesters with a
   great adaptability to environment. The proposed energy harvester is
   composed of a flexural center and two mass blocks, supported by a pair
   of elastic rods that are fixed on a vibration base. Different nonlinear
   responses are invoked by tilting the fixed-fixed elastic rods at
   different angles. A lumped-parameter model is developed to simulate the
   nonlinear electromechanical coupling system, and that is analytically
   solved by virtue of the high-order perturbation technique. The dynamic
   responses under different frequencies and accelerations are analytically
   characterized and comparedwellwith the experimental data measured from a
   fabricated prototype. Furthermore, a nonlinear conditioning circuit
   (self-powered series synchronized switch harvesting on inductor) is
   constructed and tested with the proposed nonlinear energy harvester,
   with which the performance is enhanced about 200\% for both resistive
   loads and capacitive loads.}},

   Heart rate and blood oxygen saturation (SaO2) were measured through a
   rodent oximeter and physiological monitor. Results: T-2({*}) decreases
   consistent with lowered SaO2 measurements were observed for hypercapnia
   and hypoxia, but decreases were significant only in liver and kidney
   cortex (P < 0.05) for > 10\% CO2 and < 15\% O2, with the new gas
   stimulus, hypercapnic hypoxia, producing the greatest T-2({*}) decrease.
   Hyperoxia-related T-2({*}) increases were accompanied by negligible
   increases in SaO2. T1 generally increased, if at all, in the liver and
   decreased in the kidney. Significance was observed (P < 0.05) only in
   kidney for > 90\% O2 and > 5\% CO2. Conclusion: T-2({*}) and T1 provide
   complementary roles for evaluating extracranial tissue response to a
   broad range of gas challenges. Based on both measured and known
   physiological responses, our results are consistent with T-2({*}) as a
   sensitive marker of blood oxygen saturation and T1 as a weak marker of
   blood volume changes. J. MAGN. RESON. IMAGING 2016; 44: 305-316.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a single-carrier asynchronous two-way amplify-and-forward
   relay network, where two single-antenna transceivers exchange
   information with the help of several single-antenna relay nodes. We
   assume that the propagation delay of each relaying path, originating
   from one transceiver, going through a certain relay, and ending at the
   other transceiver, can be different from those of the other relaying
   paths. This assumption turns the end-to-end link into a multi-path
   channel, which produces inter-symbol-interference at the transceivers.
   In a block transmission/reception scheme, ISI results in
   inter-block-interference (IBI) between successive transmitted blocks. To
   combat IBI, cyclic prefix insertion and deletion as well as pre-channel
   block equalization are used at the two transceivers. Assuming a limited
   total transmit power budget, we minimize the total mean squared error
   between the transmitted and received signals at both transceivers by
   optimally obtaining the transceivers' transmit powers and the relay
   beamforming weight vector as well as the pre-channel block equalizers at
   the transceivers. We prove that this optimization problem leads to a
   relay selection scheme, where only the relays contributing to one tap of
   the end-to-end channel impulse response, are turned on and the remaining
   relays are switched off. We present an efficient method to obtain the
   optimal values of the design parameters. Our simulation results show
   that compared to post-channel equalization, the proposed pre-channel
   equalization technique has the same performance as the post-channel
   equalization approach does, when the total available power is relatively
   low compared to the noise power at the transceivers, while offering
   receiver simplicity.}},

Abstract = {{Arc melting and suction casting was used to prepare
   (Zr57Ni20Al15Cu8)(100 - x)Nb-x bulk metallic glass alloys with Nb
   concentration ranging from 1.9 to 4.3 at.\%. The glass forming ability
   and crystallization behavior of these alloys were investigated-using
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). By varying the Nb
   concentration, a high glass forming range between 2 and 4 at.\% Nb was
   observed in XRD and SEM. It was also revealed that oxygen has a
   detrimental effect on the GFA within this high glass forming range and
   the severity was closely linked to the state in-which oxygen was
   present. Since thermal activation is an intrinsic property of
   crystallization, the activation energy for crystallization was computed
   from Kissinger, Ozawa and Cheng's method's based on non-isothermal DSC
   data. A comparison of activation energy models revealed that Kissinger
   and Ozawa show similar trends while Cheng's method depicted varied
   results for samples containing pre-existing crystals. For amorphous
   samples, Kissinger and Ozawa showed the highest value of activation
   energy (316 kJ/mol and 329 kJ/mol, respectively) at 2.7 at\%Nb, which is
   consistent with the supercooled liquid region and resulting in higher
   glass forming ability at this composition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Shift-Independent Model Reduction of Large-Scale Second-Order Mechanical

Abstract = {{Nonmodal model order reduction (MOR) techniques present accurate and
   efficient ways to approximate input-output behavior of large-scale
   mechanical structures. In this regard, Krylov-based model reduction
   techniques for second-order mechanical structures are typically known to
   require a priori knowledge of the original system parameters, such as
   expansion points (or eigenfrequencies). The calculation of the
   eigenfrequencies of the original finite-element (FE) model can be
   significantly time-consuming for large-scale structures. Existing
   iterative rational Krylov algorithm (IRKA) addresses this issue by
   iteratively updating the expansion points for first-order formulations
   until convergence criteria are achieved. Motivated by preserving the
   model properties of secondorder systems, this paper extends the IRKA
   method to second-order formulations, typically encountered in mechanical
   structures. The proposed second-order IRKA method is implemented on a
   large-scale system as an example and compared with the standard Krylov
   and Craig-Bampton reduction techniques. The results show that the
   second-order IRKA method provides tangibly reduced error for a
   multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) mechanical structure compared to the
   Craig-Bampton. In addition, unlike the standard Krylov methods, the
   second-order IRKA does not require the information on expansion points,
   which eliminates the need to perform a modal analysis on the original
   structure. This can be especially advantageous for large-scale systems
   where calculations of the eigenfrequencies of the original structure can
   be computationally expensive. For such large-scale systems, the proposed
   MOR technique can lead to significant reductions of the computational
   time.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(methacrylic acid-co-methyl methacrylate) (MAA) beads promote a
   vascular regenerative response when used in diabetic wound healing.
   Previous studies reported that MAA beads modulated the expression of
   sonic hedgehog (Shh) and inflammation related genes in diabetic wounds.
   The aim of this work was to follow up on these observations in a
   subcutaneous injection model to study the host response in the absence
   of the confounding factors of diabetic wound healing. In this model, MM
   beads improved vascularization in healthy mice of both sexes compared to
   control poly(methyl methacrylate) (MM) beads, with a stronger effect
   seen in males than females. MAA-induced vessels were perfusable, as
   evidenced from the CLARITY-processed images. In Shh-Cre-eGFP/Ptch1LacZ
   non-diabetic transgenic mice, the increased vessel formation was
   accompanied by a higher density of cells expressing GFP (Shh) and
   beta-GaI (patched 1, Ptch1) suggesting MM enhanced the activation of the
   Shh pathway. Ptch1 is the Shh receptor and a target of the pathway. MAA
   beads also modulated the inflammatory cell infiltrate in CD1 mice: more
   neutrophils and more macrophages were noted with MM relative to MM beads
   at days 1 and 7, respectively. In addition, MAA beads biased macrophages
   towards a MHCII-CD206+ ({''}M2{''}) polarization state. This study
   suggests that the Shh pathway and an altered inflammatory response are
   two elements of the complex mechanism whereby MM-based biomaterials
   effect vascular regeneration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to evaluate the structural performance of
   a typical wind turbine tower subjected to strong ground motions. A
   detailed finite element model of an 80 m wind turbine tower was
   developed and subjected to strong ground motions. Two sets of input
   ground motions were used: one with pulse-type near-fault motions and the
   other one with far-fault motions. The structural performance of the wind
   turbine tower was investigated through seismic fragility analysis. The
   potential limit states were defined as global buckling of the tower,
   first occurrence of yielding, overturning of the foundation and
   permanent deformation of the tower. It was found that the wind turbine
   tower investigated in this study is most vulnerable to the overturning
   in the event of an earthquake. Yielding of the tower is the second most
   probable failure mechanism, which is followed by development of
   permanent deformation and global buckling of the tower. Similar trends
   in the failure mechanism were observed for both near-fault and far-fault
   ground motions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A model paint consisting of resin dissolved in butanol was sprayed onto
   horizontal glass substrates to form films varying from 100 pm to 450 pm
   in thickness. The substrates were photographed at 5 s intervals and
   image analysis software used to measure the number, diameter and
   velocity of air bubbles trapped in the paint layer. Painted substrates
   were weighed to determine the rate of solvent evaporation. Bubbles
   escaped from the paint in 100-900 s, the time increasing with paint
   thickness. The Sauter mean diameter of bubbles in films less than 300 mu
   m in thickness decreased with time because larger bubbles escaped faster
   than small bubbles, while the mean diameter of bubbles in a 450 pm thick
   layer increased due to bubble coalescence. Bubble velocities due to
   movement of the liquid increased with paint thickness and reached 30 mu
   m/s. Bubbles were observed to escape from both upward and downwards
   facing surfaces. Concentration gradients due to solvent evaporation in a
   paint film create surface tension variations that drive Marangoni flows,
   which bring bubbles to the paint surface. An analytical one-dimensional
   model of solvent diffusion was used to calculate solvent concentration
   variations in the paint film and the Marangoni number. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The increasing occurrence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria is
   a global problem that requires the development of alternative techniques
   to eradicate these superbugs. Herein, we used a combination of
   thermosensitive biocompatible polymer and gold nanorods to specifically
   deliver, preserve and confine heat to the area of interest. Our data
   demonstrates that this technique can be used to kill both Gram positive
   and Gram negative antimicrobial resistant bacteria in vitro. Our
   approach significantly reduces the antimicrobial resistant bacteria load
   in experimentally infected wounds by 98\% without harming the
   surrounding tissues. More importantly, this polymer-nanocomposite can be
   prepared easily and applied to the wounds, can generate heat using a
   hand-held laser device, is safe for the operator, and does not have any
   adverse effects on the wound tissue and healing process. (C) 2016

   original fillet, formed in the underfilling process, was modified to
   create fillets of different sizes. Regardless of the underfill thermal
   and mechanical properties as well as its curing profile, the crack
   initiation load and the failure mode were solely a function of the size
   of the underfill fillet, and the failure always initiated within the
   PCB. Moreover, the strength of the underfilled solder joints was
   increased significantly (approximately 100\%) by the presence of a
   relatively large fillet. This effect of the underfill fillet on the
   crack path and the fracture load was then examined in terms of
   differences in the stress states using a finite element model. (C) 2016

Journal = {{PATTERN RECOGNITION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{100-115}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with a new expression recognition method by
   representing facial images in terms of higher-order two-dimensional
   orthogonal Gaussian-Hermite moments (GHMs) and their geometric
   invariants. Only the moments having high discrimination power are
   selected as a set of features for expressions. To obtain the
   differentially expressive components of the moments, the discriminative
   GHMs are projected on to a new expression-invariant subspace using the
   correlations among the neutral faces. Features obtained from the
   discriminative moments and differentially expressive components of the
   moments are used to recognize an expression using the well-known support
   vector machine classifier. Experimental results presented are obtained
   from commonly-referred databases such as the CK-AUC, FRGC, and MMI that
   have posed or spontaneous expressions as well as the GENKI database that
   has expressions in-the-wild. Experiments on mutually exclusive subjects
   reveal that the performance of expression recognition of the proposed
   method is significantly better than that of the existing or similar
   methods, which use the local or patch-based high dimensional binary
   patterns, directional number patterns generated from derivatives of
   Gaussian, Gabor- or other moment-based features. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This work presents a novel mixed-signal control scheme for a boost power
   factor correction (PFC) rectifier. The digital controller modulates the
   inductor peak current to produce a low-distortion ac line current in
   discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) and continuous conduction mode
   (CCM), without the need for average current sensing. A lookup table
   (LUT) optimizes efficiency at low input currents, by allowing operation
   at 125-500-kHz DCM based on calculated thresholds. At high input
   currents, the converter operates at 1-MHz CCM for reduced inductor
   footprint. An analog off-time generator with a digital frequency locked
   loop facilitates CCM operation, eliminating the need for slope
   compensation in the current loop and reduces frequency variations. The
   LUT is programmed with an adaptive output voltage of 250/450 V for
   low/highmains line voltage (85-265Vrms) to optimize efficiency over a
   broad range of conditions. The 150-W PFC prototype operates up to 1 MHz
   with a peak efficiency of 95\% and a total harmonic distortion of 5\%.}},

Abstract = {{Imidazolium cations derived from ionic liquids were demonstrated as
   effective linker molecules for the layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition of
   polyoxometalates (POMs) to increase the charge storage of multi-walled
   carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrodes. MWCNTs modified with GeMo12O404-
   (GeMo12) via an imidazolium cation linker demonstrated highly reversible
   redox reactions and a capacitance of 84 F cm(-3), close to 4 times
   larger than bare CNT. Compared to CNT-GeMo12 composites fabricated with
   a conventional polyelectrolyte linker poly(diallyldimethylammonium
   chloride), (PDDA), the imidazolium cations resulted in lower POM
   loading, but higher conductivity and in turn superior performance at
   fast charge discharge conditions. A polymerized imidazolium linker (PIL)
   was also synthesized based on the ethyl-vinyl-imidazolium monomer.
   CNT-GeMo12 composites fabricated with this PIL achieved high POM loading
   comparable to PDDA, while still maintaining the good conductivity and
   high rate capabilities shown by the monomer imidazolium units. The high
   conductivity imparted by the PIL is especially valuable for the
   fabrication of multilayer POM composites. Dual-layer GeMo12
   O-40(4-)-SiMo12O404- (GeMo12-SiMo12) electrodes built with this PIL
   demonstrated a combined contribution of the individual POMs resulting in
   a capacitance of 191 F cm(-3), over nine times larger than bare MWCNT.
   The PIL dual layer composites also maintained 72\% of this capacitance
   at a fast rate of 2 V s(-1), compared to just over 50\% retention for
   similar electrodes fabricated with PDDA.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{7727-7767}},
Month = {{JUL 27}},
Abstract = {{Although the Hertz-Knudsen (HK) relation is often used to correlate
   evaporation data, the relation contains two empirical parameters (the
   evaporation and condensation coefficients) that have inexplicably been
   found to span 3 orders of magnitude. Explicit expressions for these
   coefficients have yet to be determined. This review will examine sources
   of error in the HK relation that have led to the coefficients' scatter.
   Through an examination of theoretical, experimental, and molecular
   dynamics simulation studies of evaporation, this review will show that
   the HK relation is incomplete, since it is missing an important physical
   concept: the coupling between the vapor and liquid phases during
   evaporation. The review also examines a modified HK relation, obtained
   from the quantum-mechanically based statistical rate theory (SRT)
   expression for the evaporation flux and applying a limit to it in which
   the thermal energy is dominant. Explicit expressions for the evaporation
   and condensation coefficients are defined in this limit, with the
   surprising result that the coefficients are not bounded by unity. An
   examination is made with 127 reported evaporation experiments of water
   and of ethanol, leading to a new physical interpretation of the
   coefficients. The review concludes by showing how seemingly small
   simplifications, such as assuming thermal equilibrium across the liquid
   vapor interface during evaporation, can lead to the erroneous

Abstract = {{We report the synthesis and characterization of cadmium selenide
   nanocrystals with electroactive ligands directly attached to the
   surface. The conventional surfactant-assisted synthesis yields
   nanocrystals with surfaces functionalized with insulating organic
   ligands. These insulating ligands act as a barrier for charge transport
   between nanocrystals. Electroactive (reducing/oxidizing) ligands like
   ferrocene and cobaltocene have potential for applications as
   photoexcited hole conductors and photoredox systems. Although ferrocene
   ligands anchored to the nanocrystal surface through insulating
   long-chain hydrocarbon spacers have previously been reported, this
   approach is limited because the charge transfer between nanocrystal and
   ferrocene is highly sensitive to their separation. We report here
   ferrocene directly bound to the inorganic core of the nanocrystal, and
   as a result the distance between the nanocrystals and the electroactive
   moiety is minimized.}},

Abstract = {{Near infrared photoluminescent porous silicon
   nanocrystals(ncSi)-polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) polymer
   composites are synthesized using a combination of thermal
   hydrosilylation and polymerization between Vinyl-POSS and
   hydrogen-terminated silicon nanocrystals (ncSi:H). The synthesized
   materials are characterized by IR, powder X-ray diffraction and
   solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (C-13 and Si-29). The
   results demonstrate that the hydrosilylation-polymerization reaction
   proceeded to create chemically crosslinked Vinyl-POSS-ncSi composites in
   which the integrity of the POSS cages is maintained intact. Scanning
   electron microscope (SEM) results demonstrate that morphology of these
   materials depends on the weight ratio of ncSi:H to Vinyl-POSS.
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analyses establish that the
   composites have high surface areas ranging from 290.5 to 1047.2 m(2)
   g(-1) and pore volumes from 0.64 to 1.17 cm(3) g(-1). The pore sizes
   range from 6.08 to 3.54 nm and are dependent on the weight ratio of
   Vinyl-POSS to ncSi:H. Photoluminescence spectroscopy shows that the
   absolute quantum yield of the nanocomposites is not affected by the
   weight ratio of ncSi:H to Vinyl-POSS. Thermal gravimetric analysis
   results show that the POSS polymer composites with ncSi have lower
   thermal stability in nitrogen atmosphere as compared with the pure
   Vinyl-POSS polymer. It is envisioned that future applications for these
   composites will likely be found in the fields of advanced materials, gas
   adsorption media, and biomedicine.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the result of an experimental study on thermal
   performance of different metal foam heat sinks is presented and compared
   with conventional solid heat sink. Experiments were performed on
   aluminum metal foams having 93\% porosity with pore density of 4 and 8
   PPI (i.e. pores per inch). The forced convection results show that heat
   sink with thermal spray coating outperforms a thermally glued sample
   with up to 9.8\% more temperature drop under same operating test
   conditions. Air flow speed variations reveal that heat transfer rate
   changes significantly with the variation of air speed. Further studies
   with multiple fin samples show that 45 is the best orientation between
   the heat sink and the flow for maximum heat dissipation. For a single
   fin, the best orientation is 90. Results show that power dissipation at
   a fixed fin base temperature is an appropriate metrics for comparing
   thermal performance of metal foam heatsinks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Quantitative Comparison of Photothermal Heat Generation between Gold
   Nanospheres and Nanorods}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL 21}},
Abstract = {{Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are widely used for biomedical applications
   due to unique optical properties, established synthesis methods, and
   biological compatibility. Despite important applications of plasmonic
   heating in thermal therapy, imaging, and diagnostics, the lack of
   quantification in heat generation leads to difficulties in comparing the
   heating capability for new plasmonic nanostructures and predicting the
   therapeutic and diagnostic outcome. This study quantifies GNP heat
   generation by experimental measurements and theoretical predictions for
   gold nanospheres (GNS) and nanorods (GNR). Interestingly, the results
   show a GNP-type dependent agreement between experiment and theory. The
   measured heat generation of GNS matches well with theory, while the
   measured heat generation of GNR is only 30\% of that predicted
   theoretically at peak absorption. This then leads to a surprising
   finding that the polydispersity, the deviation of nanoparticle size and
   shape from nominal value, significantly influences GNR heat generation
   (> 70\% reduction), while having a limited effect for GNS (< 10\%
   change). This work demonstrates that polydispersity is an important
   metric in quantitatively predicting plasmonic heat generation and
   provides a validated framework to quantitatively compare the heating
   capabilities between gold and other plasmonic nanostructures.}},

Title = {{Predicting the role of assistive technologies in the lives of people
   with dementia using objective care recipient factors}},
Journal = {{BMC GERIATRICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: The population of people with dementia is not homogeneous.
   People with dementia exhibit a wide range of needs, each characterized
   by diverse factors including age, sex, ethnicity, and place of
   residence. These needs and characterizing factors may influence the
   applicability, and ultimately the acceptance, of assistive technologies
   developed to support the independence of people with dementia.
   Accordingly, predicting the needs of users before developing the
   technologies may increase the applicability and acceptance of assistive
   technologies. Current methods of prediction rely on the difficult
   collection of subjective, potentially invasive information. We propose a
   method of prediction that uses objective, unobtrusive, easy to collect
   information to help inform the development of assistive technologies.
   Methods: We develop a set of models that can predict the level of
   independence of people with dementia during 20 activities of daily
   living using simple, objective information. Using data collected from a
   Canadian survey conducted with caregivers of people with dementia, we
   create an ordered logistic regression model for each of the twenty daily
   tasks in the Bristol ADL scale.
   Results: Data collected from 430 Canadian caregivers of people with
   dementia were analyzed to reveal: most care recipients were mothers or
   husbands, married, living in private housing with their caregivers,
   English-speaking, Canadian born, clinically diagnosed with dementia 1 to
   6 years prior to the study, and were dependent on their caregiver. Next,
   we developed models that use 13 factors to predict a person with
   dementia's ability to complete the 20 Bristol activities of daily living
   independently. The 13 factors include caregiver relation, age, marital
   status, place of residence, language, housing type, proximity to
   caregiver, service use, informal primary caregiver, diagnosis of
   Alzheimer's disease or dementia, time since diagnosis, and level of
   dependence on caregiver. The resulting models predicted the aggregate
   level of independence correctly for 88 of 100 total responses
   categories, marginally for nine, and incorrectly for three.
   Conclusions: Objective, easy to collect information can predict
   caregiver-reported level of task independence for a person with
   dementia. Knowledge of task independence can then inform the development
   of assistive technologies for people with dementia, improving their
   applicability and acceptance.}},

Abstract = {{The thermodynamic phase of a fluid (liquid, vapor or supercritical) is
   fundamental to all chemical processes, and the critical point is
   particularly important for supercritical chemical extraction.
   Conventional phase measurement methods require hours to obtain a single
   datum on the pressure and temperature diagram. Here, we present the
   direct measurement of the full pressure temperature phase diagram, with
   10 000 microwells. Orthogonal, linear, pressure and temperature
   gradients are obtained with 100 parallel microchannels (spanning the
   pressure range), each with 100 microwells (spanning the temperature
   range). The phase-mapping approach is demonstrated with both a pure
   substance (CO2) and a mixture (95\% CO2 + 5\% N-2). Liquid, vapor, and
   supercritical regions are clearly differentiated, and the critical
   pressure is measured at 1.2\% error with respect to the NIST standard.
   This approach provides over 100-fold improvement in measurement speed
   over conventional methods.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) is an emerging technology for the
   remediation of contaminated sites. However, there are concerns related
   to the impact of nZVI on in situ microbial communities. In this study,
   the microbial community composition at a contaminated site was monitored
   over two years following the injection of nZVI stabilized with
   carboxymethyl cellulose (nZVI-CMC). Enhanced dechlorination of
   chlorinated ethenes to nontoxic ethene was observed long after the
   expected nZVI oxidation. The abundance of Dehalococcoides (Dhc) and
   vinyl chloride reductase (vcrA) genes, monitored using qPCR, increased
   by over an order of magnitude in nZVI-CMC-impacted wells. The entire
   microbial community was tracked using 16S rRNA gene amplicon
   pyrosequencing. Following nZVI-CMC injection, a clear shift in microbial
   community was observed, with most notable increases in the
   dechlorinating genera Dehalococcoides and Dehalogenimonas. This study
   suggests that coupled abiotic degradation (i.e., from reaction with
   nZVI) and biotic degradation fueled by CMC led to the long-term
   degradation of chlorinated ethenes at this field site. Furthermore,
   nZVI-CMC addition stimulated dehalogenator growth (e.g.,
   Dehalococcoides) and biotic degradation of chlorinated ethenes.}},

Title = {{Manual-Protocol Inspired Technique for Improving Automated MR Image
   Segmentation during Label Fusion}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUL 19}},
Abstract = {{Recent advances in multi atlas based algorithms address many of the
   previous limitations in model-based and probabilistic segmentation
   methods. However, at the label fusion stage, a majority of algorithms
   focus primarily on optimizing weight-maps associated with the atlas
   library based on a theoretical objective function that approximates the
   segmentation error. In contrast, we propose a novel
   method-Autocorrecting Walks over Localized Markov Random Fields
   (AWoL-MRF)-that aims at mimicking the sequential process of manual
   segmentation, which is the gold-standard for virtually all the
   segmentation methods. AWoL-MRF begins with a set of candidate labels
   generated by a multi-atlas segmentation pipeline as an initial label
   distribution and refines low confidence regions based on a localized
   Markov random field (L-MRF) model using a novel sequential inference
   process (walks). We show that AWoL-MRF produces state-of-the-art results
   with superior accuracy and robustness with a small atlas library
   compared to existing methods. We validate the proposed approach by
   performing hippocampal segmentations on three independent datasets: (1)
   Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Database (ADNI), (2) First Episode
   Psychosis patient cohort, and (3) A cohort of preterm neonates scanned
   early in life and at term equivalent age. We assess the improvement in
   the performance qualitatively as well as quantitatively by comparing
   AWoL-MRF with majority vote, STAPLE, and Joint Label Fusion methods.
   AWoL-MRF reaches a maximum accuracy of 0.881 (dataset 1), 0.897 (dataset
   2), and 0.807 (dataset 3) based on Dice similarity coefficient metric,
   offering significant performance improvements with a smaller atlas
   library (< 10) over compared methods. We also evaluate the diagnostic
   utility of AWoL-MRF by analyzing the volume differences per disease
   category in the ADNI1: Complete Screening dataset. We have made the
   source code for AWoL-MRF public at:

Abstract = {{Complex time series are widespread in physics and physiology.
   Multifractal analysis provides a tool to study the scaling dynamics of
   such time series. However, the temporal evolution of scaling dynamics
   has been ignored by traditional tools such as the multifractal spectrum.
   We present scaling maps that add the time dimension to the study of
   scaling dynamics. This is particularly important in cases in which the
   dynamics of the underlying processes change in time or in applications
   that necessitate real-time detection of scaling dynamics. In addition,
   we present a methodology for automatic clustering of existing scaling
   regimes in a signal. We demonstrate the methodology on time-evolving
   correlated and uncorrelated noise and the output of a physiological
   control system (i.e., cardiac interbeat intervals) in healthy and

Title = {{Post-acute pathways among hip fracture patients: a system-level analysis}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JUL 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Hip fractures among older adults are one of the leading
   causes of hospitalization and result in significant morbidity,
   mortality, and health care use. Guidelines suggest that rehabilitation
   after surgery is imperative to return patients to pre-morbid function.
   However, post-acute care (which encompasses rehabilitation) is currently
   delivered in a multitude of settings, and there is a lack of evidence
   with regards to which hip fracture patients should use which post-acute
   settings. The purpose of this study is to describe hip fracture patient
   characteristics and the most common post-acute pathways within a 1-year
   episode of care, and to examine how these vary regionally within a
   health system.
   Methods: This study took place in the province of Ontario, Canada, which
   has 14 health regions and universal health coverage for all residents.
   Administrative health databases were used for analyses.
   Community-dwelling patients aged 66 and over admitted to an acute care
   hospital for hip fracture between April 2008 and March 2013 were
   identified. Patients' post-acute destinations within each region were
   retrieved by linking patients' records within various institutional
   databases using a unique encoded identifier. Post-acute pathways were
   then characterized by determining when each patient went to each
   post-acute destination within one year post-discharge from acute care.
   Differences in patient characteristics between regions were detected
   using standardized differences and p-values.
   Results: Thirty-six thousand twenty nine hip fracture patients were
   included. The study cohort was 71.9 \% female with a mean age of 82.9
   (+/- 7.5SD). There was significant variation between regions with
   respect to the immediate post-acute discharge destination: four regions
   discharged a substantially higher proportion of their patients to
   inpatient rehabilitation compared to all others. However, the majority
   of patient characteristics between those four regions and all other
   regions did not significantly differ. There were 49 unique post-acute
   pathways taken by patients, with the largest proportion of patients
   admitted to either community-based or short-term institutionalized
   rehabilitation, regardless of region.
   Conclusions: The observation that similar hip fracture patients are
   discharged to different post-acute settings calls into question both the
   appropriateness of care delivered in the post-acute period and health
   system expenditures. As policy makers continue to develop
   performance-based funding models to increase accountability of
   institutions in the provision of quality care to hip fracture patients,
   ensuring patients receive appropriate rehabilitative care is a priority
   for health system planning.}},

Title = {{Early bone anchorage to micro- and nano-topographically complex implant
   surfaces in hyperglycemia}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{169-179}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of implant surface
   design on early bone anchorage in the presence of hyperglycemia. 108
   Wistar rats were separated into euglycemic (EG) controls and STZ-treated
   hyperglycemic (HG) groups, and received bilateral femoral custom
   rectangular implants of two surface topographies: grit blasted (GB) and
   grit-blast with a superimposed calcium phosphate nanotopography
   (GB-DCD). The peri-implant bone was subjected to a tensile disruption
   test 5, 7, and 9 days post-operatively (n = 28/time point); the force
   was measured; and the residual peri-implant bone was observed by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Disruption forces at 5 days were not
   significantly different from zero for the GB implants (p = 0.24) in
   either metabolic group; but were for GB+DCD implants in both metabolic
   groups (p < 0.001). Contact osteogenesis was greater on GB-DCD than the
   GB surface. The nano-and micro-surfaced implants showed significantly
   different disruption forces at all time points (e.g. >15 N and <5 N
   respectively at 9 days). Such differences were not seen within the GB
   implants, as all values were very low (<5 N). Even in hyperglycemia the
   GB-DCD surface outperformed the GB surfaces in both metabolic groups.
   Significantly, SEM of peri-implant bone showed compromised
   intra-fibrillar collagen mineralization in hyperglycemia, while
   inter-fibrillar and cement line mineralization remained unaffected.
   Enhanced bone anchorage to the implant surfaces was observed on the
   nanotopographically complex surface independent of metabolic group. The
   compromised intra-fibrillar mineralization observed provides a mechanism
   by which early bone mineralization is affected in hyperglycemia.
   Statement of Significance
   It is generally accepted that the hyperglycemia associated with diabetes
   mellitus compromises bone quality, although the mechanism by which this
   occurs is unknown. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia is therefore a
   contra-indication for bone implant placement. It is also known that
   nano-topographically complex implant surfaces accelerate early
   peri-implant healing. In this report we show that, in our experimental
   model, nano-topographically complex surfaces can mitigate the
   compromised bone healing seen in hyperglycemia. Importantly, we also
   provide a mechanistic explanation for compromised bone quality in
   hyperglycemia. We show that intra-fibrillar collagen mineralization is
   compromised in hyperglycemia, but that interfibrillar and cement line
   mineralization, remain unaffected. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

Title = {{Quantitative Analysis of Trap-State-Mediated Exciton Transport in

Abstract = {{Perovskite-shelled colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) with low trap-state
   density are promising candidates for large-scale, low-cost, and
   lightweight solar cell applications. However, even minimal trap states
   can significantly limit CQD-based solar cell efficiency. We reported
   trap-state-mediated exciton transports in methylammonium lead triiodide
   (MAPbI(3)) perovskite-passivated PbS CQD thin films. Excitation
   power-dependent photocarrier radiometry (PCR) intensity study
   demonstrated the free (electrons/holes)-to-bound (acceptors/donors) and
   trap-state-related transition-induced nonlinear response of CQD thin
   films to excitation. The existence of shallow trap states (activation
   energy: 33.8-40.7 meV) was characterized using photothermal emission
   spectra at different modulation frequencies. CQD thin films were imaged,
   for the first time, by InGaAs-camera-based nondestructive homodyne and
   heterodyne lock-in carrierographies (LIC; spectrally gated dynamic
   photoluminescence imaging), clearly showcasing photocarrier density
   diffusion-wave inhomogeneities that stem from defect-associated multiple
   effective exciton lifetimes. PCR frequency scans, coupled with the
   trap-state-mediated exciton transport model, extracted multiple material
   and carrier transport parameters such as effective exciton lifetime
   tau(E), hopping diffusivity D-h, dark and bright state separation energy
   Delta E, and carrier trapping rate N-T. Camera-based contactless
   homodyne and heterodyne LIC imaging of QD thin films was found to be a
   promising nondestructive characterization technique for monitoring
   optoelectronic qualities of QD materials and devices.}},

Abstract = {{Amyloids are fibrillar protein superstructures that are commonly
   associated with diseases in humans and with physiological functions in
   various organisms. The precise mechanisms of amyloid formation remain to
   be elucidated. Surprisingly, we discovered that a bacterial Escherichia
   coli chaperone-like ATPase, regulatory ATPase variant A (RavA), and
   specifically the LARA domain in RavA, forms amyloids under acidic
   conditions at elevated temperatures. RavA is involved in modulating the
   proper assembly of membrane respiratory complexes. LARA contains an
   N-terminal loop region followed by a b-sandwich-like folded core.
   Several approaches, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
   and molecular dynamics simulations, were used to determine the mechanism
   by which LARA switches to an amyloid state. These studies revealed that
   the folded core of LARA is amyloidogenic and is protected by its
   N-terminal loop. At low pH and high temperatures, the interaction of the
   N-terminal loop with the folded core is disrupted, leading to amyloid
   formation.}},

Title = {{Beyond the Randomized Controlled Trial: A Review of Alternatives in
   mHealth Clinical Trial Methods}},
Journal = {{JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have long been
   considered the primary research study design capable of eliciting causal
   relationships between health interventions and consequent outcomes.
   However, with a prolonged duration from recruitment to publication,
   high-cost trial implementation, and a rigid trial protocol, RCTs are
   perceived as an impractical evaluation methodology for most mHealth
   apps.
   Objective: Given the recent development of alternative evaluation
   methodologies and tools to automate mHealth research, we sought to
   determine the breadth of these methods and the extent that they were
   being used in clinical trials.
   Methods: We conducted a review of the ClinicalTrials.gov registry to
   identify and examine current clinical trials involving mHealth apps and
   retrieved relevant trials registered between November 2014 and November
   2015.
   Results: Of the 137 trials identified, 71 were found to meet inclusion
   criteria. The majority used a randomized controlled trial design (80\%,
   57/71). Study designs included 36 two-group pretest-posttest control
   group comparisons (51\%, 36/71), 16 posttest- only control group
   comparisons (23\%, 16/71), 7 one-group pretest-posttest designs (10\%,
   7/71), 2 one-shot case study designs (3\%, 2/71), and 2 static-group
   comparisons (3\%, 2/71). A total of 17 trials included a qualitative
   component to their methodology (24\%, 17/71). Complete trial data
   collection required 20 months on average to complete (mean 21, SD 12).
   For trials with a total duration of 2 years or more (31\%, 22/71), the
   average time from recruitment to complete data collection (mean 35
   months, SD 10) was 2 years longer than the average time required to
   collect primary data (mean 11, SD 8). Trials had a moderate sample size
   of 112 participants. Two trials were conducted online (3\%, 2/71) and 7
   trials collected data continuously (10\%, 7/68). Onsite study
   implementation was heavily favored (97\%, 69/71). Trials with four data
   collection points had a longer study duration than trials with two data
   collection points: F-4,F-56=3.2, P=. 021, eta(2)=0.18. Single-blinded
   trials had a longer data collection period compared to open trials:
   F-2,F-58=3.8, P=. 028, eta(2)=0.12. Academic sponsorship was the most
   common form of trial funding (73\%, 52/71). Trials with academic
   sponsorship had a longer study duration compared to industry
   sponsorship: F-2,F-61=3.7, P=.030, eta(2)=0.11. Combined, data
   collection frequency, study masking, sample size, and study sponsorship
   accounted for 32.6\% of the variance in study duration: F-4,F-55=6.6,
   P<.01, adjusted r(2)=.33. Only 7 trials had been completed at the time
   this retrospective review was conducted (10\%, 7/71).
   Conclusions: mHealth evaluation methodology has not deviated from common
   methods, despite the need for more relevant and timely evaluations.
   There is a need for clinical evaluation to keep pace with the level of
   innovation of mHealth if it is to have meaningful impact in informing
   payers, providers, policy makers, and patients.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the structural safety of the storage cells of some
   existing Condeep concrete offshore oil and gas platforms built in the
   1970s, a 1: 13 scale model of a typical upper dome-cell wall junction of
   a storage cell of such a platform was loaded to failure by increasing
   the external water pressure in the Hydraulic Testing Facility at the
   University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. A number of the early
   Condeep platforms use an internal pressurization system to restrict the
   pressure differential to approximately a 50 m (164 ft) head of water at
   the critical dome-cell wall junction. If this internal pressure system
   fails, the pressure differential across the domes and walls of the cells
   will approximately double. The question then becomes whether this
   increase in differential pressure will result in the failure of the
   structure. In the experiment, the model resisted a maximum pressure
   differential equivalent to a 147 m (482 ft) head of sea water.
   Immediately prior to failure, radial cracks could be seen near the base
   of the dome and water was flowing into the specimen at a rate of 139
   L/min (37 gal./min). The final failure was abrupt and involved a brittle
   shear failure encompassing one half of the circumference of the cell
   wall. At failure the dome displaced downwards approximately 25 mm (1
   in.) and the top of the cell wall was pushed approximately 10 mm (3/8
   in.) outwards.}},

Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{851-859}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study on 14 reinforced concrete membrane elements was
   performed to investigate shear-stress transfer across cracks. The
   variables were loading conditions (cyclic or reversed cyclic), concrete
   strength, and applied tension-to-shear loading ratio. During each
   experiment, shear and normal stresses across the main crack, crack
   widths, and crack slips were continuously monitored. All specimens
   failed in shear along the main crack plane. The results demonstrate that
   crack behavior is highly nonlinear and path-dependent. Load reversals
   have the effect of weakening the crack shear stress transfer mechanisms
   both in terms of strength and stiffness. Concrete strength plays a
   relatively minor role in crack behavior while reducing the
   tension-to-shear ratio results in narrower cracks and, thus, an overall
   crack response that is both stronger and stiffer.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A method is proposed for fused three-dimensional (3-D) shape estimation
   and visibility analysis of an unknown, markerless, deforming object
   through a multicamera vision system. Complete shape estimation is
   defined herein as the process of 3-D reconstruction of a model through
   fusion of stereo triangulation data and a visual hull. The differing
   accuracies of both methods rely on the number and placement of the
   cameras. Stereo triangulation yields a high-density, high-accuracy
   reconstruction of a surface patch from a small surface area, while a
   visual hull yields a complete, low-detail volumetric approximation of
   the object. The resultant complete 3-D model is, then, temporally
   projected based on the tracked object's deformation, yielding a robust
   deformed shape prediction. Visibility and uncertainty analyses, on the
   projected model, estimate the expected accuracy of reconstruction at the
   next sampling instant. In contrast to common techniques that rely on a
   priori known models and identities of static objects, our method is
   distinct in its direct application to unknown, markerless, deforming
   objects, where the object model and identity are unknown to the system.
   Extensive simulations and comparisons, some of which are presented
   herein, thoroughly demonstrate the proposed method and its benefits over
   individual reconstruction techniques. (C) 2016 SPIE and IS\&T.}},

Abstract = {{Overnight fluid shift from the legs to the neck and lungs may contribute
   to the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and central sleep
   apnoea (CSA). We hypothesised that exercise training will decrease the
   severity of OSA and CSA in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD)
   by decreasing daytime leg fluid accumulation and overnight rostral fluid
   shift.
   Patients with CAD and OSA or CSA (apnoea-hypopnoea index > 15 events per
   h) were randomised to 4 weeks of aerobic exercise training or to a
   control group. Polysomnography, with measurement of leg, thoracic and
   neck fluid volumes and upper-airway cross-sectional area (UA-XSA) before
   and after sleep, was performed at baseline and follow-up.
   17 patients per group completed the study. Apnoea-hypopnoea index
   decreased significantly more in the exercise group than in the control
   group (31.1 +/- 12.9 to 20.5 +/- 9.4 versus 28.1 +/- 13.5 to 27.0 +/-
   15.1 events per h, p=0.047), in association with a greater reduction in
   the overnight change in leg fluid volume (579 +/- 222 to 466 +/- 163
   versus 453 +/- 164 to 434 +/- 141 mL, p=0.04) and by a significantly
   greater increase in the overnight change in UA-XSA in the exercise group
   (p=0.04).
   In patients with CAD and sleep apnoea, exercise training decreases sleep
   apnoea severity via attenuation of overnight fluid shift and an increase
   in UA-XSA.}},

Title = {{Factors predisposing to worsening of sleep apnea in response to fluid
   overload in men}},
Journal = {{SLEEP MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Pages = {{65-72}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent in
   patients with fluid-retaining conditions. Using bioimpedance
   measurements, previous studies have shown that the greater the amount of
   fluid redistributed from the legs to the neck overnight, the greater the
   severity of OSA. Our objective was to investigate factors that
   predispose the development or worsening of OSA in response to
   experimental fluid overload.
   Methods: Fifteen normotensive and non-obese adult men with and without
   OSA underwent polysomnography (PSG) during which normal saline was
   infused intravenously at a minimal rate to keep the vein open (control)
   or as a bolus of 22 ml/kg body weight (approximately 2 L) in a random
   order and crossed over after a week.
   Results and Conclusions: Before and after sleep, neck circumference and
   bioimpedance were measured to calculate neck resistance, reactance,
   phase angle, and fluid volume. Subjects who experienced more than a
   twofold increase in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) or obstructive AHI from
   control to intervention and had an AHI>10 during intervention were
   considered susceptible to the development or worsening of OSA. Baseline
   neck circumference and phase angle before saline infusion were
   independently associated with increased susceptibility to developing or
   worsening OSA in response to saline infusion. In non-obese men, a larger
   neck circumference and bioimpedance phase angle of the neck, which may
   be associated with larger pharyngeal tissue content, is associated with
   increased susceptibility for worsening of OSA in response to fluid
   overloading. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We developed two methods to use terahertz (THz) spectroscopy to perform
   gas temperature measurement: using the area ratio of two H2O vapor
   absorbance peaks, and using the relative time delay of the THz signal,
   both of which change as a function of temperature. Both methods can be
   used in situations with high particle loading that would block
   traditional laser signals and degrade thermocouple performance, as THz
   signals do not attenuate due to particle scattering. The absorbance peak
   ratios were tested in the frequency range of 0.5-0.8 THz at temperatures
   of 523-773 K. The relationship between the gas temperature and line
   strength ratio of the peaks match those calculated using the HITRAN
   database, but has high uncertainty due to THz source instability. The
   time delay was tested at a frequency of 0.5 THz and temperatures of
   293-773 K, and is used to determine temperature by calculating the index
   of refraction of the gas. It is a more accurate method, but requires
   knowledge of the gas composition.}},

Abstract = {{A multiscale approach using Bridging Cell Method ( BCM) is applied to
   simulate the combined effect of temperature and alumina's common
   structural nanodefects such as nanovoids, precracks, and Mg impurities
   on the mechanical response of single crystal C-plane and M-plane
   sapphire. The BCM model consists of three domains of continuum,
   bridging, and atomistic, where the whole system is solved in a finite
   element ( FE) framework. Interatomic interaction potentials and
   temperature-dependent formulations are incorporated in the atomistic
   domain to conduct simulations for structures containing nanodefects at a
   range of finite temperatures from 300 to 1600 K. The results are
   compared for each case to analyze the effect of temperature and
   nanodefects. Mechanical response of the material is presented and
   discussed with respect to ultimate tensile strength ( UTS), stress
   distribution and elasticity. Results show different material behavior
   for C-plane and M-plane under the same biaxial loading conditions but
   containing different nanodefects. Precracks are found to be the most

Abstract = {{In this letter, we consider the Gaussian diamond-wiretap channel with
   conferencing links between relays for the following three cases: 1) both

   public, and the legitimate parties do not know which link is
   confidential or public. For all the cases, we establish the exact secure
   degrees of freedom (d.o.f.). Our results show that if at least one of
   conferencing links is confidential, the secure d.o.f. improves upon the
   case of no conferencing. In these cases of fully and partially
   confidential conferencing, it is shown to be sufficient to use the
   conferencing links only for transmitting noise symbols. On the other
   hand, if conferencing information is fully revealed to the eavesdropper,
   it is shown that there is no gain in secure d.o.f. due to conferencing,
   even if the conferencing information is also known to the legitimate

Abstract = {{We introduce Process Overview, a situation awareness characterisation of

   is based on observational studies of process control work in the

   to improve coupling between situation and awareness according to process
   plant properties and operator cognitive work. A companion article
   presents the empirical evaluation of the Process Overview Measure in a
   realistic process control setting. The Process Overview Measure
   demonstrated sensitivity and validity by revealing significant effects
   of experimental manipulations that corroborated with other empirical
   results. The measure also demonstrated adequate inter-rater reliability
   and practicality for measuring SA based on data collected by process
   experts.Practitioner Summary: The Process Overview Measure is a

Abstract = {{Optically transparent planar antennas made of transparent conductive
   oxide (TCO) have attracted considerable attention in research over the
   years, particularly for solar panel applications. However, their design
   has proved difficult due to their inherent conductor losses. This paper
   focuses on the design of an optically transparent reflectarray using
   indium tin oxide, which is a type of TCO. The design is composed of
   subwavelength rectangular patch elements that exhibit 272 degrees of
   phase range and mitigate conductor losses in reflectarray operation.
   This paper examines the behavior and response of lossy reflectarray unit
   cells and investigates different techniques to reduce the impact of loss
   in TCO reflectarray designs, primarily using different patch geometries
   and subwavelength elements. The proposed element design is simulated and
   experimentally characterized. A full reflectarray prototype operating at
   26 GHz is successfully demonstrated and fabricated, with the simulated
   and experimental results in good agreement.}},

Title = {{Single cell functional analysis of multiple myeloma cell populations
   correlates with diffusion profiles in static microfluidic coculture
   systems}},
Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Microfluidic cell culture systems are becoming increasingly useful for
   studying biology questions, particularly those involving small cell
   populations that are cultured within microscale geometries mimicking the
   complex cellular microenvironment. Depending on the geometry and spatial
   organization of these cell populations, however, paracrine signaling
   between cell types can depend critically on spatial concentration
   profiles of soluble factors generated by diffusive transport. In
   scenarios where single cell data are acquired to study cell population
   heterogeneities in functional response, uncertainty associated with
   concentration profiles can lead to interpretation bias. To address this
   issue and provide important evidence on how diffusion develops within
   typical microfluidic cell culture systems, a combination of experimental
   and computational approaches were applied to measure and predict
   concentration patterns within microfluidic geometries, and characterize
   the functional response of culture cells based on single-cell resolution
   transcription factor activation. Using a model coculture system
   consisting of multiple myeloma cells (MMCs) and neighboring bone marrow
   stromal cells (BMSCs), we measured concentrations of three cytokines
   (IL-6, VEGF, and TNF-alpha) in conditioned media collected from separate
   culture compartments using a multiplex ELISA system. A 3D numerical
   model was developed to predict biomolecular diffusion and resulting
   concentration profiles within the tested microsystems and compared with
   experimental diffusion of 20 kDa FITC-Dextran. Finally, diffusion was
   further characterized by controlling exogenous IL-6 diffusion and the
   coculture spatial configuration of BMSCs to stimulate STAT3 nuclear
   translocation in MMCs. Results showed agreement between numerical and
   experimental results, provided evidence of a shallow concentration
   gradient across the center well of the microsystem that did not lead to
   a bias in results, and demonstrated that microfluidic systems can be
   tailored with specific geometries to avoid spatial bias when desired.

   microenvironment for cultured organoids. Conventional sensing devices
   cannot be easily integrated with microfluidic organ-on-chip systems with
   low-volume bioreactors for continual monitoring. This paper reports on
   the development of a multi-analyte optical sensing module for dynamic
   measurements of pH and dissolved oxygen levels in the culture medium.
   The sensing system was constructed using low-cost electro-optics
   including light-emitting diodes and silicon photodiodes. The sensing
   module includes an optically transparent window for measuring light
   intensity, and the module could be connected directly to a perfusion
   bioreactor without any specific modifications to the microfluidic device
   design. A compact, user-friendly, and low-cost electronic interface was
   developed to control the optical transducer and signal acquisition from
   photodiodes. The platform enabled convenient integration of the optical
   sensing module with a microfluidic bioreactor. Human dermal fibroblasts
   were cultivated in the bioreactor, and the values of pH and dissolved
   oxygen levels in the flowing culture medium were measured continuously
   for up to 3 days. Our integrated microfluidic system provides a new
   analytical platform with ease of fabrication and operation, which can be
   adapted for applications in various microfluidic cell culture and
   organ-on-chip devices. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of a mobile handset chassis-mode antenna with a metal bezel
   is analyzed in this paper by utilizing the theory of characteristic
   modes (TCM). Two eigenmodes, one from the chassis (0.5 lambda-dipole
   mode) and the other one from the bezel (1 lambda-perimeter mode), are
   merged by a monopole exciter to broaden the antenna bandwidth below 1
   GHz. A new eigenmode from the bezel (1.5 lambda-perimeter mode) is also
   exploited to achieve multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) performance.
   The characteristics of the antenna are verified with an experimental
   prototype and measurements. The measured input reflection bandwidths
   from the two ports are 263 MHz (742-1005 MHz) and 93 MHz (863-956 MHz),
   respectively. The port isolation is more than 7.4 dB across the whole
   band of interest. Finally, the monopole exciter, which excites two
   eigenmodes in the low-frequency band, is modified to provide more
   resonances in the upper frequency band, providing coverage in the range
   of 1715-2060 MHz and 2280-2710 MHz.}},

Title = {{A Review of Oxidation Phenomena in Ni Alloys Exposed to Hydrogenated

Abstract = {{The following is a review of the accumulated literature over the past 20
   years for oxidation in Ni-Fe-Cr alloys exposed to 400 degrees C to 500
   degrees C hydrogenated steam. Hydrogenated steam at temperatures of 500
   degrees C and below is considered to simulate 300 degrees C to 360
   degrees C deaerated water often used in the primary circuit of nuclear
   power plants. Alloy 600 (Ni-16Cr-9Fe) is highly susceptible to stress
   corrosion cracking (SCC) in primary water and the peak crack growth rate
   is observed near the Ni/NiO equilibrium potential. It is believed that
   the oxidation tendency, internal and/or external, is directly related to
   the mechanism of SCC in Alloy 600. An initial review will be conducted
   exploring inter-and intragranular oxidation in Alloy 600 and the
   relationship to embrittlement and SCC. Following this, investigations
   into oxidation phenomena, in particular the possibility of internal
   oxidation, in alloys with high reactive element contents, such as Alloy
   690 and Alloy 800, will be analyzed. Finally, the practical
   applicability and validity of a high-temperature hydrogenated steam
   environment as a simulant for accelerated primary water conditions will
   be reviewed through comparisons to oxidation phenomena commonly reported
   in 300 degrees C to 360 degrees C deaerated water. In general,
   evaluation of the literature suggests that intergranular oxidation
   phenomena and the mechanism of SCC/embrittlement in Alloy 600 are likely
   to be similar, ranging from 300 degrees C deaerated water to 500 degrees
   C hydrogenated steam.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the effects of intense physical exercise on
   postural stability of children with cerebral palsy (CP). Center of
   pressure (CoP) was measured in 9 typically developing (TD) children and
   8 with CP before and after a maximal aerobic shuttle-run test (SRT)
   using a single force plate. Anteroposterior and mediolatetal sway
   velocities, sway area, and sway regularity were calculated from the CoP
   data and compared between pre- and postexercise levels and between
   groups. Children with CP demonstrated significantly higher pre-SRT CoP
   velocities than TD children in the sagittal (18.6 7.6 vs. 6.75 1.78 m/s)
   and frontal planes (15.4 +/- 5.3 vs. 8.04 +/- 1.51 m/s). Post-SRT, CoP
   velocities significantly increased for children with CP in the sagittal
   plane (27.0 +/- 1.2 m/s), with near-significant increases in the frontal
   plane (25.0 +/- 1.5m/s). Similarly, children with CP evidenced larger
   sway areas than the TD children both pre- and postexercise. The
   diminished postural stability in children with CP after short but
   intense physical exercise may have important implications including
   increased risk of falls and injury.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with optimal maintenance decision making in the
   presence of model misspecification. Specifically, we are interested in
   the situation where the decision maker fears that a nominal Bayesian
   model may be miss-specified or unrealistic, and would like to find
   policies that work well even when the underlying model is flawed. To
   this end, we formulate a robust dynamic optimization model for
   condition-based maintenance in which the decision maker explicitly
   accounts for distrust in the nominal Bayesian model by solving a
   worst-case problem against a second agent, ``nature,{''} who has the
   ability to alter the underlying model distributions in an adversarial
   manner. The primary focus of our analysis is on establishing structural
   properties and insights that hold in the face of model
   miss-specification. In particular, we prove (i) an explicit
   characterization of nature's optimal response through an analysis of the
   robust dynamic programming equation, (ii) convexity results for both the
   robust value function and the optimal robust stopping region, (iii) a
   general robustness result for the preventive maintenance paradigm, and
   (iv) the optimality of a robust control limit policy for the important
   subclass of Bayesian change point detection problems. We illustrate our
   theoretical result on a real-world application from the mining industry.}},

Abstract = {{Background-With its inherent limitations, determining local activation
   times has been the basis of cardiac mapping for over a century. Here, we
   introduce omnipolar electrograms that originate from the natural
   direction of a travelling wave and from which instantaneous conduction
   velocity amplitude and direction can be computed at any single location
   without first determining activation times. We sought to validate
   omnipole-derived conduction velocities and explore potential application
   for localization of sources of arrhythmias.
   Methods and Results-Electrograms from omnipolar mapping were derived and
   validated using 4 separate models and 2 independent signal acquisition
   methodologies. We used both electric signals and optical signals
   collected from monolayer cell preparations, 3-dimensional constructs
   built with cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells,
   simultaneous optical and electric mapping of rabbit hearts, and in vivo
   pig electrophysiology studies. Conduction velocities calculated from
   omnipolar electrograms were compared with wavefront propagation from
   optical and electric-mapping studies with a traditional local activation
   time-based method. Bland-Altman analysis revealed that omnipolar
   measurements on optical data were in agreement with local activation
   time methods for wavefront direction and velocity within 25 cm/s and 30
   degrees, respectively. Similar agreement was also found on electric
   data. Furthermore, mathematical operations, such as curl and divergence,
   were applied to omnipole-derived velocity vector fields to locate
   rotational and focal sources, respectively.
   Conclusions-Electrode orientation-independent cardiac wavefront
   trajectory and speed at a single location for each cardiac activation
   can be determined accurately with omnipolar electrograms.
   Omnipole-derived vector fields, when combined with mathematical
   transforms may aid in real-time detection of cardiac activation sources.}},

Title = {{Preliminary Design and Experimental Investigation of a Novel Pneumatic
   Conveying Method to Disperse Natural Fibers in Thermoset Polymers}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Natural fibers can be attractive reinforcing materials in thermosetting
   polymers due to their low density and high specific mechanical
   properties. Although the research effort in this area has grown
   substantially over the last 20 years, manufacturing technologies to make
   use of short natural fibers in high volume fraction composites; are
   still limited. Natural fibers, after retting and preprocessing, are
   discontinuous and easily form entangled bundles. Dispersion and mixing
   these short fibers with resin to manufacture high quality, high volume
   fraction composites presents a significant challenge. In this paper, a
   novel pneumatic design for dispersion of natural fibers in their
   original discontinuous form is described. In this design, compressed air
   is used to create vacuum to feed and convey fibres while breaking down
   fibre clumps and dispersing them in an aerosolized resin stream. Model
   composite materials, made using proof-of-concept prototype equipment,
   were imaged with both optical and X-ray tomography to evaluate fibre and
   resin dispersion. The images indicated that the system was capable of
   providing an intimate mixture of resin and detangled fibres for two
   different resin viscosities. The new pneumatic process could serve as
   the basis of a system to produce well-dispersed high-volume fraction
   composites containing discontinuous natural fibres drawn directly from a
   loosely packed source.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The use of hydrogels for therapeutic delivery is a burgeoning area of
   investigation. These water-swollen polymer matrices are ideal platforms
   for localized drug delivery that can be further combined with specific
   ligands or nanotechnologies to advance the controlled release of
   small-molecule drugs and proteins. Due to the advantage of hydrophobic,
   electrostatic, or specific extracellular matrix interactions,
   affinity-based strategies can overcome burst release and challenges
   associated with encapsulation. Future studies will provide innovative
   binding tools, truly stimuli-responsive systems, and original
   combinations of emerging technologies to control the release of
   therapeutics spatially and temporally. Local drug delivery can be
   achieved by directly injecting a therapeutic to its site of action and
   is advantageous because off-target effects associated with systemic
   delivery can be minimized. For prolonged benefit, a vehicle that
   provides sustained drug release is required. Hydrogels are versatile
   platforms for localized drug release, owing to the large library of
   biocompatible building blocks from which they can be formed. Injectable
   hydrogel formulations that gel quickly in situ and provide sustained
   release of therapeutics are particularly advantageous to minimize
   invasiveness. The incorporation of polymers, ligands or nanoparticles
   that have an affinity for the therapeutic of interest improve control
   over the release of small-molecule drugs and proteins from hydrogels,
   enabling spatial and temporal control over the delivery. Such
   affinity-based strategies can overcome drug burst release and challenges
   associated with protein instability, allowing more effective therapeutic
   molecule delivery for a range of applications from therapeutic contact
   lenses to ischemic tissue regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{The graphical notion of effective resistance has found wide-ranging
   applications in many areas of pure mathematics, applied mathematics and
   control theory. By the nature of its construction, effective resistance
   can only be computed in undirected graphs and yet in several areas of
   its application, directed graphs arise as naturally ( or more naturally)
   than undirected ones. In Part I of this work, we propose a
   generalization of effective resistance to directed graphs that preserves
   its control-theoretic properties in relation to consensus-type dynamics.
   We proceed to analyze the dependence of our algebraic definition on the
   structural properties of the graph and the relationship between our
   construction and a graphical distance. The results make possible the
   calculation of effective resistance between any two nodes in any
   directed graph and provide a solid foundation for the application of
   effective resistance to problems involving directed graphs.}},

Abstract = {{Glucuronic acid (GlcAp) and/or methylglucuronic acid (MeGlcAp) decorate
   the major forms of xylan in hardwood and coniferous softwoods as well as
   many cereal grains. Accordingly, the complete utilization of
   glucuronoxylans or conversion to sugar precursors requires the action of
   main chain xylanases as well as -glucuronidases that release the -
   (12)-linked (Me)GlcAp side groups. Herein, a family GH115 enzymefrom the
   marine bacterium Saccharophagus degradans 2-40(T), SdeAgu115A,
   demonstrated activity toward glucuronoxylan and oligomers thereof with
   preference toward MeGlcAp linked to internal xylopyranosyl residues.
   Unique biochemical characteristics of NaCl activation were also
   observed. The crystal structure of SdeAgu115A revealed a five-domain
   architecture, with an additional insertion C+ domain that had
   significant impact on the domain arrangement of SdeAgu115A monomer and
   its dimerization. The participation of domain C+ in substrate binding
   was supported by reduced substrate inhibition upon introducing W773A,
   W689A, and F696A substitutions within this domain. In addition to
   Asp-335, the catalytic essentiality of Glu-216 was revealed by
   site-specific mutagenesis. A primary sequence analysis suggested that
   the SdeAgu115A architecture is shared by more than half of GH115
   members, thus defining a distinct archetype for GH115 enzymes.}},

Title = {{ErbB2 Blockade with Herceptin (Trastuzumab) Enhances Peripheral Nerve
   Regeneration after Repair of Acute or Chronic Peripheral Nerve Injury}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{80}},

Pages = {{112-126}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Attenuation of the growth supportive environment within the
   distal nerve stump after delayed peripheral nerve repair profoundly
   limits nerve regeneration. Levels of the potent Schwann cell mitogen
   neuregulin and its receptor ErbB2 decline during this period, but the
   regenerative impact of this change is not completely understood. Herein,
   the ErbB2 receptor pathway is inhibited with the selective monoclonal
   antibody Herceptin (trastuzumab) to determine its significance in
   regulating acute and chronic regeneration in a rat hindlimb.
   Methods: The common peroneal nerve of Sprague-Dawley rats was transected
   and repaired immediately or after 4 months of chronic denervation,
   followed by administration of Herceptin or saline solution. Regenerated
   motor and sensory neurons were counted using a retrograde tracer 1, 2,
   or 4, weeks after repair. Distal myelinated axon outgrowth after 4 weeks
   was quantified using histomorphometry. Immunofluorescent imaging was
   used to evaluate Schwann cell proliferation and epidermal growth factor
   receptor (EGFR) activation in the regenerating nerves.
   Results: Herceptin administration increased the rate of motor and
   sensory neuron regeneration and the number of proliferating Schwann
   cells in the distal stump after the first week. Herceptin also increased
   the number of myelinated axons that regenerated 4 weeks after immediate
   and delayed repair. Reduced EGFR activation was observed using
   immunofluorescent imaging.
   Interpretation: Inhibition of the ErbB2 receptor with Herceptin
   unexpectedly enhances nerve regeneration after acute and delayed nerve
   repair. This finding raises the possibility of using targeted molecular
   therapies to improve outcomes of peripheral nerve injuries. The
   mechanism may involve a novel inhibitory association between ErbB2 and
   EGFR.}},

Abstract = {{RASP, also now called VecTor6, is a nonlinear finite element program for
   the analysis of reinforced concrete structures that uses 3-dimensional
   stress-strain relation of cracked concrete based on the modified
   compression field theory. RASP was used to predict the behavior of a
   3-dimensional 1: 13 scale model of a typical upper dome-cell wall
   junction of a storage cell in an early Condeep structure. It predicted a
   flexure-shear failure at the top of the cell wall when it was subjected
   to a pressure differential equivalent to 129-134 m head of water. Yet,
   there was deviation between the theoretical and the observed response of
   the model since the analysis ignored the detrimental effect of water
   pressure in the cracks. Before applying the results of the pressure test
   on the scale model to the prototype structure the size effect in shear
   was examined. It was concluded that because the failure was triggered by
   flexural yielding the size effect in shear was not significant for this
   case.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a Class-C PA-VCO cell tailored to FSK/GFSK transmitters
   is presented. In the proposed solution, a Class-C VCO and a common-gate
   stage PA are stacked in a current-reuse architecture operating with 1.2
   V power supply. The PA and the VCO efficiencies are maximized by
   adjusting their voltage headroom without the use of any DC-DC
   converters. The PA-VCO is inserted in a transmitter based on an openloop
   architecture. The presented prototype, fabricated in 0.13 mu m CMOS
   technology, occupies an active area of 0.2 mm(2). A maximum TX
   efficiency of 17.5\% is achieved while the TX is delivering an output
   power of -1 dBm at 2.45 GHz. A phase noise of -129 dBc/Hz at 2.5 MHz
   frequency offset results in a carrierfrequency drift below 7 Hz/s and an
   FSK error below 0.7\%, which allows the transmitter to operate in
   open-loop while delivering long data-packets. The transmitter is also
   compliant to BLE specifications when FSK and GFSK modulations with index

Abstract = {{A versatile three-lane transmitter/repeater array was designed and
   manufactured in a production 28nm ultra-thin body and BOX (UTBB) FD-SOI
   CMOS technology. Each lane in the array can operate at 60 Gb/s with
   adjustable output swing between 2.6 and 4.3 V-PP with a measured input
   sensitivity of 10 m V-PP at 40 Gb/s, and requires at least 40m V-PP
   input signal level to fully saturate the output driver for maximum swing
   operation at 60 Gb/s. Scaled, cascaded single-ended CMOS inverter
   transimpedance amplifiers with resistive and inductive feedback and
   interstage series inductive peaking were used to form the preamplifiers
   of each lane. These were optimized for maximum bandwidth and large gain,
   and drive the > 4 V-PP swing seriesstacked cascoded CMOS inverter output
   stage. The single-ended CMOS-inverter topologies ensure that the total
   power consumption scales with the data rate and reduce the lane
   footprint to that of a ground-signal pad I/O. The measured lane-to-lane
   isolation is better than 40 dB up to 55 GHz, while the measured Tx-toRx
   dynamic range, defined as the ratio of the maximum output swing and
   corresponding minimum input voltage and sensitivity, is larger than 54

   the switching attack is simple, only requiring knowledge of the sign of

   is modeled to be resource constrained, choosing to act only during
   select intervals of time. We make use of an iterated game-theoretic
   formulation to describe the interactions of the parties and its effect
   on system stability. Analytic results indicate the potential of the
   constrained controller to achieve transient stabilization over time
   using zero-determinant strategies. Numerical results of the New England
   39-bus power system demonstrate the potential for such a controller to
   increase system resilience during cyber-attacks.}},

Abstract = {{A parametric controller is proposed for transient stability of
   synchronous generators after the occurrence of a disturbance in the
   power grid. The proposed controller based on feedback linearization
   control theory relies on receiving timely phasor measurement unit (PMU)
   information from selected parts of the power grid to employ fast acting
   flywheels that are situated near synchronous generators. The local
   storage devices aim to balance a swing equation model of the synchronous
   generator to drive the associated rotor speed to stability. The
   advantages of the proposed controller include that it is tunable and
   integrates well with existing governor controls in contrast to other
   forms of PMU-based control. Further, a comparison is drawn between the
   proposed controller and recently proposed nonlinear controllers for
   transient stabilization. Numerical results show the effectiveness and
   robustness of the proposed controller when applied to the 39-bus
   10-generator New England power system.}},

   (3IP)(2)-SiPc and (2secBP)(2)-SiPc both experienced a parallel stacking
   of two of the peripheral aromatic groups. In all three cases, the
   solubility of these molecules was increased by the addition of phenoxy
   groups while maintaining pi-pi interactions between the aromatic SiPc
