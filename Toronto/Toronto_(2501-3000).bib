Abstract = {{Monitoring and actuation represent critical tasks for electric power
   utilities to maintain system stability and reliability. As such, the
   utility is highly dependent on a low latency communication
   infrastructure for receiving and transmitting measurement and control
   data to make accurate decisions. This dependency, however, can be
   exploited by an adversary to disrupt the integrity of the grid. We
   demonstrate that Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, even if perpetrated on
   a subset of cyber communication nodes, has the potential to succeed in
   disrupting the overall grid. One countermeasure to DoS attacks is
   enabling cyber elements to distributively reconfigure the system's
   routing topology so that malicious nodes are isolated. We propose a
   collaborative reputation-based topology configuration scheme and through
   game theoretic principles we prove that a low-latency Nash Equilibrium
   routing topology always exists for the system. Numerical results
   indicate that during an attack on a subset of cyber nodes, the proposed
   algorithm effectively enables the remaining nodes to converge quickly to
   an equilibrium topology and maintain dynamical stability in the specific
   instance of an islanded microgrid system.}},

Abstract = {{Today's power grid is provisioned conservatively for rarely occurring
   demand peaks. These peaks are served by flexible generation systems that
   are typically costly and have significant carbon footprint. Distributed
   power sources such as wind turbines and solar panels are sustainable but
   unreliable as these have inherently variable generation capacities. An
   effective power dispatch management system is necessary to harness the
   significant generation potential of these intermittent systems. In this
   work, a novel scheme is proposed which leverages upon the recent
   cyber-enablement in the power grid to distributively dispatch a large
   number of strategically interacting small-scale variable generators. We
   incorporate evolutionary game theoretic techniques into the formulation
   of the dispatch strategy as it provides an opportunity to model the
   aggregate behaviour of tactical agents making inter-dependent decisions
   and aids with establishing deterministic steady state predictions of the
   system state. Numerical and theoretical results presented in this work
   show that the proposed strategy is highly scalable and enables real-time
   power dispatch of intermittent systems while maintaining low
   computational overhead.}},

Abstract = {{There is now significant interest in OpenCL for FPGAs because it is the
   first time the FPGA vendors have provided a programming model and a
   computing platform with integrated high-level synthesis. OpenCL is
   intended for heterogenous platforms, not just FPGAs, and the standard
   continues to evolve. Recently, OpenCL has introduced Shared Virtual
   Memory (SVM) with the goal of simplifying the programming model by
   allowing hosts and devices to access the same memory space more easily.
   In this paper, we propose different approaches to implement SVM in an
   OpenCL framework built specifically to study OpenCL in the context of
   embedded applications running on FPGAs. We evaluate these different
   approaches and compare the trade-offs between an OpenCL framework with
   SVM support and without SVM support. Our results show that the approach
   that implements the virtual address to physical address translation with
   a dedicated Memory Management Unit (MMU) performs better than the other
   approaches. Our results also show that, for input sizes less than 1MB
   for a vector addition benchmark, the OpenCL framework with SVM support
   performs better than the OpenCL framework without SVM support until the
   SVM handling in the kernel starts to dominate.}},

Abstract = {{The University of Toronto's ongoing work towards the improvement and
   further development of multi-platform simulation methods is presented in
   this paper. These developments include a ten-element hybrid simulator
   and a generalized OpenSees substructure element. Hybrid simulation which
   encompasses development of new integration algorithms, simulation
   frameworks, and applications has been an active research area in the
   past decade. Yet, unless the physically tested element significantly
   contributes to the overall lateral response of the structure in terms of
   stiffness, strength and energy dissipation, the improvement in the
   accuracy of results from the use of hybrid simulation may only be
   marginal. In most cases, the number of physically tested elements in the
   hybrid simulation is limited by the availability of experimental
   resources such as actuators, controllers, and laboratory space. As a
   step towards overcoming this limitation, a novel experimental apparatus,
   the UT10 Hybrid Simulator, is being developed at the University of
   Toronto. The UT10 is being developed to allow up to ten elements, such
   as braces and hysteretic dampers, to be concurrently tested and
   integrated into a hybrid simulation. The system can test up to ten
   physical specimens with peak force capacity ranging between 800 kN or
   1,600 kN per specimen depending on the total number of tested specimens.
   The main design requirements, current development status, and potential
   applications of the UT10 Hybrid Simulator are presented in this paper.
   To integrate the potential numerical or physical substructures into
   distributed multi-platform simulations such as hybrid simulations, a
   generalized substructure element is being developed for OpenSees. The
   main research focus in this development is to standardize the data
   exchange format and communication protocol such that any other potential
   experimental and numerical substructure modules can be readily
   integrated into the simulation. The data exchange format is defined such
   that the number of degrees of freedom, data type, and error checks can
   be communicated in a seamless manner between modules. Designing a
   versatile data exchange format and a communication protocol is expected
   to facilitate simulation of coupled systems including diverse
   substructure modules and other loading scenarios such as thermal
   loading. The data exchange format and example implementations will be
   made available to the research community in the near future. To
   illustrate the current developments, an example of multi-platform
   simulation with a numerical substructure is presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Decision making for modern infrastructure megaprojects is involved in a
   complex interaction among all social organizations which are necessary
   to complete functionality of the system and influence its performance.
   Public communities in such a scenario cannot be considered a background

   interests more directly. Decision making would then be a networked
   process towards a consensus on different aspects of the project. In
   order to address the dependency on public community impacts,
   traditionally re-active Public Involvement practices are evolving to
   more proactive methods through communication channels available by the
   Social Web. Formation and evolution of discussion networks around civil
   infrastructure projects (referred to as Infrastructure Discussion
   Network-IDN) have been studied by the authors in previous works. This
   paper suggests a framework to evaluate stakeholders' impact on
   infrastructure megaprojects through analysis of big data captured from
   online social media. For this purpose, influence level, interest, and
   position of internal and external stakeholders involved in IDNs are
   evaluated via social network analytics and semantic methods. The results
   can be combined to form stakeholder's impact and aggregated over all

Abstract = {{Programmability in wireless access networks can provide unprecedented
   flexibility in meeting the communications needs of a diverse set of
   wireless devices under changing demand and network conditions.
   Programmability also holds the promise of enabling multiple simultaneous
   virtual operators providing a variety of access networks that offer
   different services using different business models. In this paper we
   present our work on enabling wireless access network programmability in
   the SAVI testbed. We introduce an architecture for Software-Defined
   Infrastructure that offers virtualized heterogeneous resources in
   support of services and applications. Central to this architecture is
   the Janus SDI resource manager that can coordinate the actions of a set
   of controllers, e.g. OpenStack, OpenFlow, and other controllers such as
   a wireless access controller. We describe a design where Janus is used
   to integrate the wireless access network into a Smart Edge node. We
   introduce use cases that exploit the flexibility offered by this design,
   and we present experimental results from our implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time content delivery services such as live media streaming, news
   casting and real-time event subscription/publication systems have become
   popular in recent years. Unlike traditional content delivery
   applications, real-time content delivery requires live content to be
   processed and delivered to end users in a timely and efficient manner.
   Furthermore, as both content producers and consumers may change
   over-time, it is a challenge to provision resources for these
   applications to achieve high service quality while minimizing total
   operational costs.
   Fortunately, the recent development of Cloud computing and Software
   Defined Networking (SDN) enables efficient implementation of real-time
   content delivery systems. Recently, the concept of Software Defined
   Infrastructure aims at combining Cloud computing and SDN to provide an
   unified framework for application deployment and management. In this
   paper, we present Kaleidoscope, an architecture for real-time content
   delivery in Software Defined Infrastructures. Kaleidoscope leverages
   network virtualization, SDN-based broadcasting and dynamic cloud
   resource provisioning to achieve high resource efficiency and service
   performance. Specifically, we present a resource management scheme that
   controls Cloud resource allocation and network configuration at run-time
   in accordance with service demand. Experiments show that Kaleidoscope is
   able to achieve lower resource cost while providing high service
   quality.}},

   using an expressive Domain Specific Language that allows users to easily
   express commonly used network topologies while hiding the underlying

Abstract = {{We consider discrete-event systems (DES) consisting of parallel arrays
   of machines and buffers. The machines are divided into groups in each of
   which the members have identical (isomorphic) structure. This feature
   allows event relabeling of the machines in a given group to a standard
   prototype machine. With respect to buffer specifications (prohibiting
   overflow and underflow) it is shown that optimal supervisory control of
   the original DES (with many machines) can be reduced to control of the
   much smaller collection of prototype machines. The result is a small
   ``template{''} supervisor which is proved to be independent of the total
   number of original component machines, as long as the buffer sizes are
   held fixed. This result is applied to efficient reconfiguration
   triggered by the addition or removal of machines.}},

   relay channel with an out-of-band finite-capacity relay-to-destination
   link in which noises at the relay and destination are correlated due to
   common sources of interference. This scenario is motivated by the
   possibility of using device-to-device links for inter-cell interference
   mitigation in cellular networks. We characterize the necessary and
   sufficient conditions on the number of antennas under which the relay
   link rate can result in a near one-to-one improvement to the overall
   throughput in the high signal-to-noise-ratio and
   interference-to-noise-ratio regime. We show that these conditions
   coincide with the necessary and sufficient condition under which full
   cooperation between relay and destination can improve the degrees of
   freedom of the relay channel. Simultaneous diagonalization by

Abstract = {{Storage services play an important role in a public cloud. By
   outsourcing data to the remote cloud, users do not need to maintain a
   local storage infrastructure and can significantly lower the storage
   cost. To protect the privacy, documents must be encrypted before
   outsourcing. This raises a new challenge for the document owner: how
   should the encrypted documents be securely searched in a public cloud?
   While many mechanisms have been proposed to support secure search over
   the encrypted documents, most of these mechanisms require secure
   channels to transmit the secret information, such as the secret keys and
   trapdoors, and is difficult to deploy in cloud systems. Moreover, some
   existing mechanisms require an authority to control the access requests
   of users, which inevitably increases the complexity of cloud
   infrastructure.
   This paper considers a more stringent security model where an
   eavesdropper exists in the cloud and can eavesdrop on all transmission
   channels. We propose a novel mechanism that supports multi-user keyword
   search over the encrypted data without relying on any secure channel or
   authority. The eavesdropper can neither forge valid trapdoors from the
   intercepted information nor can it directly use the intercepted
   trapdoors to complete the keyword search. Security analysis shows that
   the proposed mechanism is secure.}},

Abstract = {{With mobile offloading, computation-intensive tasks can be offloaded
   from mobile devices to the cloud to conserve energy. In principle, the
   idea is to trade the relatively low communication energy expense for
   high computation power consumption. In this paper, we propose that
   computation-intensive tasks can be distributed among nearby mobile
   devices, and focus on the case that a group of mobile users may
   collaborate with one another with one common target job. In particular,
   a user can reduce its own energy consumption by delegating a portion of
   the job to nearby users in a coalition. We propose distributed
   collaboration strategies based on game theory, and formulate the problem
   as a non-transferable utility coalition formation game in which users
   join or split from coalitions depending on the local preference. The
   stability of the resulting partition is studied. We show through
   simulations that our proposed algorithm reduces up to 22\% of the
   average energy costs compared to the noncooperative case, and the
   running time scales well as the number of users grows.}},

Abstract = {{The flexibility of cloud computing has afforded users the ability to
   develop and deploy fully customizable cloud-based applications and
   services. Thus far, this flexibility has primarily been constrained to
   the likes of x86 servers and storage devices. The SAVI application
   platform testbed was developed to realize the hypothesis that all
   physical infrastructure resources can be virtualized. Key to this work
   is a novel control and management framework based on Software-Defined
   Infrastructure (SDI), a concept which provides a unified programmable
   interface over heterogeneous infrastructures. In this paper, we present
   the architecture of the Canadian SAVI national testbed based on the SDI
   framework. The design of an autonomous SAVI node will be described and
   the multi-node deployment that comprise the national testbed will be
   discussed. In addition, the orchestration of applications across the
   multi-node testbed will be described. Lastly, we will report on the
   progress of our recent efforts to federate the SAVI testbed with the
   American GENI national testbed.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated high efficiency tri-mode DC-DC converter that can operate
   in buck, boost and buck-boost configurations is presented. A power
   transmission gate is implemented in the tri-mode converter as the high
   side driver of the H-bridge output stage to extend the range of the
   output voltage to be lower than 1.5 V. The converter also incorporates
   segmented power output stages with dedicated top level metal layouts
   according to the direction of the current flow. The ability to select
   the size of the power transistors allows the optimization of the power
   conversion efficiency by trading off conduction loss with gate-drive
   loss over a wide range of output currents. A peak efficiency of 90\% is
   measured in boost mode with V-in = 3.7 V-out = 5 V at 1.5 MHz and a
   maximum output current of 0.5 A. The proposed integrated converter is

Abstract = {{Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) with ZrO2 as gate dielectric have
   been fabricated on glass substrates. The gate dielectric is annealed in
   N-2 at different temperatures to investigate the effects of annealing
   temperatures on the performance of the OTFTs. The devices show low
   threshold voltage and small subthreshold slope, and thus are suitable
   for low-voltage and low-power applications. It is also found that
   raising the annealing temperature can initially enhance the electrical
   properties of OTFTs. This is attributed to the improved dielectric and
   interface quality by the thermal annealing treatment. ZrO2 annealed at
   150 degrees C, 250 degrees C and 350 degrees C can lower the maximum
   density of surface states by 8 \%, 32 \% and 42 \% respectively. Further
   increasing the annealing temperature to 550 degrees C is found to
   degrade the device performance. Among the studied devices. OTFTs with
   ZrO2 annealed at 350 degrees C exhibits the best device performance,
   such as a small threshold voltage of -0.89 V and a low sub-threshold
   slope of 1,05 V/decade.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-level cell for STT-MRAM is proposed using biaxial magnetic
   tunnel junction (MTJ). The proposed cell consists of one transistor and
   one MTJ (1T1MTJ) with biaxial magnetic layer to store two bits per cell.
   Using the four stable states of the biaxial layer, the proposed cell
   allows 2 bits to be stored per cell without voltage headroom
   limitations. Current pulses with different amplitudes are applied during
   write operation to switch the magnetization vector to the corresponding
   region. This avoids multi-step write operations required for previously
   proposed multi-level cells using uniaxial MTJs. On average, the
   simulated write speed of the proposed cell is 33\% faster than that of
   previous work, and the proposed cell consumes 8\% less power. Also,
   current sensing vs. voltage sensing is compared for the biaxial MTJ;
   Current sensing provides uniform distribution of the sense margin.}},

Abstract = {{In an era of urbanization there is an increasing need to benchmark the
   performance of cities and do this against a robust set of measures that
   can be repeated and replicated over time. Open city data initiatives are
   on the increase and with the release of IS037120 city indicators it is
   timely to critically appraise the synergies between open data and city
   indicators. Hence, in this paper we present a novel measure for
   assessing the completeness of open city data in the context of measuring
   city indicators. We apply this measure known as the ``City Indicator
   Data Openness Measure{''} (CIDOM) in the context of two global cities,
   Toronto and Melbourne. Specifically we do this in the context of the ISO
   37120 educational indicator 6.4: ``Primary Education Student/Teacher
   Ratio. This exercise has identified that there exists fundamental
   barriers in realizing the vision of open data if it is to support the
   reporting and analysis of city indicators. It raises further issues
   about sourcing data and also provides another argument towards
   developing a semantic approach for city indicators.}},

Abstract = {{The Index Coding problem can be considered as one of the basic problems
   in information theory. In this problem a relay node needs to deliver a
   set of packets to a set of clients over a broadcast wireless channel.
   Each client might posses some side information related to the
   transmissions by the relay node. The goal is to minimize number of
   transmissions from the relay node by taking advantage of the side
   information. The Index Coding problem has been proven to be NP-hard and
   NP-hard to approximate. The Complementary Index Coding problem is a
   complementary problem of the Index Coding problem. In the Complementary
   Index Coding problem the objective is to maximize number of the saved
   transmissions, i. e., the number of transmissions that are saved by
   encoding packets compared to the solution that does not perform coding.
   This work aims at improving the gains of the Complementary Index Coding
   problem by proposing a Set Cover based solution that guarantees an
   approximation ratio of 1/1-H-k vertical bar S vertical bar/n. Moreover,
   we propose a scheme for transforming the Index Coding problem into the
   Set Cover problem. In addition to this, we compare the proposed
   algorithm with the current state of the art. The experimental results
   show that the proposed solution out performs current state of the art
   both in terms of coding advantage, and running time.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the down-link transmission of an OFDMA-based
   multi-cell virtualized wireless network (VWN) to serve users belonging
   to different service providers (slices) with the quality-of-service
   (QoS) requirements in terms of each slice's minimum reserved rate. In
   order to improve energy efficiency, we formulate a joint base station
   (BS) assignment, sub-carrier and power allocation problem to minimize
   the total transmit power of all the BSs subject to the QoS constraints.
   This problem is inherently a non-convex optimization problem. To tackle
   its computational complexity, we apply successive convex approximation
   (SCA) and complementary geometric programming (CGP) to convert the
   problem into a computationally efficient formulation and propose an
   iterative algorithm for solving the problem. We introduce a variable
   called user association factor (UAF) for jointly assigning users to both
   BSs and sub-carriers. Simulation results illustrate the performance
   enhancement of the VWN achieved through our formulation for different
   network scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a robust resource allocation approach in virtualized
   wireless networks (VWNs) to address the uncertainty in channel state
   information (CSI) at the base station (BS) due to estimation error and
   mobility of users. In this set-up, the resources of an OFDMA-based
   wireless network are shared among different slices where the minimum
   reserved rate is considered as the quality-of-service (QoS) requirement
   of each slice. We formulate the robust resource allocation problem
   against the worst-case CSI uncertainty, aiming to maximize the overall
   energy efficiency (EE) of VWN in terms of a newly defined slice utility
   function. Uncertain CSI is modeled as the sum of its true estimated
   value and an error assumed to be bounded in a specific uncertainty
   region. The formulated problem suffers from two major issues:
   computational complexity and energy-efficiency degradation due to the
   considered error in the maximum extent. To deal with these issues, we
   consider a specific form of uncertainty region to solve the robust
   resource allocation problem via an iterative algorithm. The simulation
   results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Multiscale electromagnetic problems occur frequently in practical
   applications. Unfortunately, the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD)
   method can lose its remarkable efficiency when small and large
   geometrical features are present simultaneously. Small geometrical
   features impose a fine spatial grid, increasing memory consumption and
   CPU time. Moreover, because of the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL)
   stability condition, time step has to be also reduced, further
   increasing the overall computational cost. We propose a new method to
   accelerate FDTD simulations with local grid refinements. The FDTD
   equations for the fine region are first compressed using model order
   reduction. The stability limit of the resulting equations is extended to
   match the stability limit of the coarse grid using a suitable
   perturbation approach. Finally, the reduced models of the fine regions
   are embedded into the main coarse grid. Owing to their enhanced
   stability, the whole simulation can be run at the large time step
   supported by the coarse grid. The proposed technique thus provides a way
   to perform stable FDTD simulations with subgridding at the CFL limit of
   the coarse grid. A numerical example demonstrates the remarkable
   speed-ups that can be obtained with the proposed method with respect to
   FDTD and spatial subgridding.}},

   cascaded transmission lines where the characteristic impedances are
   stochastically given and independent from each other. As an example, a
   stepped impedance filter is analyzed containing up to 31 transmission
   line segments. The modeling approach is validated with Monte-Carlo (MC)
   and shows a very good agreement and a significant speedup. The presented

Abstract = {{Transportation and land use planners and modelers often use zone systems
   to take advantage of readily available socio-economic data in their
   modelling exercises. The most important issue is that analysis zone size
   is usually large, and therefore, homogeneous or single-type land uses
   cannot be achieved in many cases. Subsequently, intra-zone travel and
   mixed activities distribution cannot be captured and modeling accuracy
   has to be compromised. This study analyzes the form and spatial
   structure/pattern of different LUs within zone and find correlations
   between LU types and several morphological properties (building height,
   building area, building perimeter, building compactness, and parcel
   area) of parcels and their spatial arrangement indexes (Gabriel Line and
   Gabriel Length). Binary logistic model is then applied and fitted to the
   morphological properties and spatial indexes in order to extract
   residential and commercial LUs. The final Result demonstrates that
   residential and commercial LUs are extracted with an overall accuracy of
   98.4\% and 69.0\% respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there has been increased interest in designing stand-alone
   Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRES) for remote communities. Several
   methodologies have been proposed to tackle the design optimization
   problem, to develop strategies for optimal operation/dispatch, or to
   address both problems concurrently. So far, however, these methods have
   been developed only for specific communities or system configurations
   (e.g., wind-diesel; PV-diesel). In this study, we propose a multilevel
   design optimization method that considers both optimal component
   selection and dispatch strategy that can be applied to any community
   regardless of the available renewable resources, thus overcoming the
   limitations of previous studies. The new approach considers a wide range
   of renewable and non-renewable energy technologies, a database of
   commercially available components, and leverages state-of-the-art
   methods for solving each optimization subproblem. The novel algorithm
   was evaluated with a set of meteorological conditions that emulate
   different remote communities. In addition, two pricing scenarios for
   diesel are studied to explore how the HRES design is influenced by this
   parameter.}},

Abstract = {{Optimizing the turbine layout in a wind farm is crucial to minimize wake
   interactions between turbines, which can lead to a significant reduction
   in power generation. This work is motivated by the need to develop wake
   interaction models that can accurately capture the wake losses in an
   array of wind turbines, while remaining computationally tractable for
   layout optimization studies. Among existing wake interaction models, the
   sum of squares (SS) model has been reported to be the most accurate.
   However; the SS model is unsuitable for wind farm layout optimization
   using mathematical programming methods, as it leads to non-linear
   objective functions. Hence, previous work has relied on approximated
   power calculations for optimization studies. In this work, we propose a
   mechanistic linear model for wake interactions based on energy balance,
   with coefficients determined based on publicly available data from the
   Horns Rev wind farm. A series of numerical tests was conducted using
   test cases from the wind farm layout optimization literature. Results
   show that the proposed model is solvable using standard mathematical
   programming methods, and resulted in turbine layouts with higher
   efficiency than those found by previous work}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the environmental impact of wind farms has been receiving
   increasing attention. As land is more extensively exploited for onshore
   wind farms, they are more likely to be in proximity with human
   dwellings, infrastructure (e.g. roads, transmission lines) and
   environmental features (e.g. rivers, lakes, forests). As a result of
   regulatory constraints, this proximity causes significant portions of
   the wind farm terrain to become unusable for turbine placement. In this
   work, we present a constrained, continuous-variable model for layout
   optimization that takes noise and energy as objective functions, based
   on Jensen's wake model and ISO-9613-2 noise calculations. A
   multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to solve the
   optimization problem, considering a set of land use constraints, which
   are handled with static and dynamic penalty functions. A set of test
   cases with different number of turbines and percentages of land
   availability are solved. Results from this bi-objective optimization
   model illustrate how the severity of the land use constraints affects
   the trade-off between energy generation and noise production.}},

   mitigation strategies from contact networks that are generated from
   publicly available census data. The goal is to provide public policy
   makers additional information concerning the type of people they should
   aim to target vaccination, quarantine, or isolation measures towards. We
   focus on pandemic disease mitigation, but the approach can be applied to
   other domains, such as bioterrorism. The approach begins by constructing
   a representative contact network for the geographic area (we use the
   Greater Toronto Area of approximate to 5.5 million individuals) from
   census information. Then, network centrality measures are employed to
   ascertain the importance of each individual to the proper topological
   functioning of the network. The top-ranked individuals' characteristics,
   as defined by census information, are then used as input to decision
   tree classifiers. The resulting output is a set of high-level rules that
   identify potential types of individuals to target in order to mitigate
   disease spread. Experimental evidence for the efficacy of the approach
   is also provided.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a lightweight open-source MIPS-ISA processor, wherein
   performance and area can be flexibly traded-off with one another. The
   processor contains an ultra-low-cost co-processor capable of executing
   programs comprised of SUBLEQ instructions (subtract and branch if the
   difference is <= 0), which recent work has shown to be sufficient for
   any computation. Area/performance trade-offs are realized by
   implementing a user-selectable subset of MIPS instructions with
   functionally equivalent SUBLEQ sub-routines that run on the
   co-processor. Silicon area is reduced as more MIPS instructions are
   implemented with the co-processor, rather than ``natively{''} using
   functional units within the host MIPS. The processor is described in the
   C language and synthesized to an FPGA hardware implementation with
   high-level synthesis (HLS). Since it is specified at a high level of
   abstraction, it is straightforward to tailor to any application. As
   such, the processor can be viewed as a family of processors with
   different area/performance/power characteristics. In an experimental
   study, we compare a variety of processor variants, wherein different
   subsets of MIPS instructions are handled by the co-processor. We also
   compare the proposed synthesizable processor with a hand-designed
   5-pipeline-stage MIPS implementation, and achieve area reductions
   ranging from 2.5-4x.}},

Abstract = {{Soot emissions are by-products of combustion that are well documented to
   have adverse effects on human health and the environment. Consequently,
   these emissions are becoming a target for stricter regulations. However,
   obstacles exist in the implementation of soot models in Computational
   Fluid Dynamics codes with complex geometry, such as ensuring carbon mass
   conservation as soot forms. This challenge is due to the thermochemistry
   interactions in turbulent codes being preprocessed (included in look-up
   tables), and not solved for directly. This study considers the
   development of a soot model for kerosene combustion. Coupling is
   introduced between the soot and gas phase by including nucleation rates
   within the fiamelet library, and by adjusting the concentrations of key
   soot precursors through additional transport equations. Validation has
   been performed for turbulent coflow kerosene flames at pressures of 1
   and 4.8 bar. This simplified model reasonably predicts the soot volume
   fraction without tuning of the inception rate.}},

   configuration obtained. We explore two alternative heuristics that use
   different groupings of the optimizations. We show that, relative to a
   random sampling of the space and an expert search, our strategy achieves
   a reduction in the number of configurations explored of up to 80\% and

Abstract = {{Virtual machine (VM) migration occurs very frequently in cloud
   computing. VM Migration enables a running OS, including memory and
   storage to move from one physical host to another physical host. A
   particular case of interest is live migration where the process of
   migrating the full state from one OS to the other should happen
   continuously and without any connection disruption. In order to have a
   seamless VM migration process the system has to be able to resume
   network connectivity very quickly. Fast resumption has proved to be a
   challenging problem. In this paper, we present a scheme to efficiently
   to migrate VMs networking resources using SDN techniques to achieve fast
   network flow resumption on SDN. We formulate the problem by an integer
   programming problem, we prove its NPcompleteness and we propose a
   heuristic algorithm to solve the problem. Software simulation and real
   testbed implementation are done to demonstrate the performance of the
   flow migration scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Galfenol, a novel magnetostrictive and ferromagnetic material, has been
   employed in various applications because of the material's outstanding
   mechanical properties. For high frequency applications, the energy loss
   of eddy-current is a critical criterion because this loss not only
   reduces the power efficiency for Galfenol material, but also rapidly
   generates large amounts of heat that can destabilize the system. While
   laminating ferromagnetic material has been proved to be an effective way
   that minimises eddy-current, the objective of this research is to
   investigate the laminated Galfenol material's plausibility in high
   frequency applications. For the prescribed geometry, an accurate model
   for the generated eddy-current is derived based on the Maxwell
   equations. Combining a built magnetic coupled dynamic model, the
   relationship between the strain response and the applied magnetic field
   is derived under high frequency conditions. The simulative results of
   the laminated Galfenol rods are compared to those rods without
   laminations. The comparison shows that the laminated Galfenol rod
   exhibits a milder hysteresis than the non-laminated Galfenol rod.
   Furthermore, the laminated Galfenol rod is able to maintain a high
   strain output with a broader frequency range compared to the
   non-laminated Galfenol rod. This work proves that laminating Galfenol
   rods are capable of restricting the generation of eddy-current and
   improving high frequency characteristics significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a bacterial infection, most
   often contracted in the hospital. With symptoms ranging from mild

   in the last decade. As the infection rate increases alarmingly, it
   becomes a burden on patients and their healthcare providers to manage.
   Coupled with this increase is the imminent threat of recurring episodes,
   termed recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (RCDI). As
   hypervirulent strains evade conventional drug therapies, investment in
   fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) becomes a viable alternative.
   Specific advantages of the approach over conventional treatment are its
   relative efficacy and cost effectiveness. Here, we survey this

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel approach to achieve blind stain
   decomposition in histo-pathology images. The method is based on stain
   color estimation, followed by stain absorbing vector generation and
   matrix computation. Unlike conventional approaches adopting linear
   processing algorithms to analyze chromatic information in the
   cylindrical-coordinate color spaces, which may be inappropriate for
   circular data such as hue, we propose the use of circular thresholding
   on saturation-weighted hue histogram to compute candidates for stain
   representative colors. Experimental results suggest that our stain
   decomposition method is capable to address spectral variation in stains
   effectively. We compare the proposed method to state-of-the-art blind
   stain separation algorithms for nuclei segmentation on breast
   histo-pathology images, and demonstrate that the segmentation scheme
   adopting our method in its pre-processing step achieves the best
   segmentation results.}},

Abstract = {{Recently Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been proposed as a biometric
   modality which offers liveliness detection. The fact that ECG is a vital
   signal makes it challenging to work with as it is affected by physical
   and psychological changes. In realistic applications, this type of
   biometrics still needs to be verified in conditions related to the
   practical use. In real life our body posture changes frequently,
   therefore in the context of a biometric system our body posture may be
   different in enrolment and verification which can potentially decrease
   the performance of the system. In this paper we first investigate the
   effect of the body posture on the accuracy of ECG biometric systems.
   Second, a new method is presented that is able to clearly distinguish
   the ECG signal of different postures of an individual. Finally, we
   propose a posture-detection verification system in order to mitigate the
   effect of body posture by first detecting the posture of a subject and
   then identifying it.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems enable high
   spectral efficiency by employing large antenna arrays at both the
   transmitter and the receiver of a wireless communication link. In
   traditional MIMO systems, full digital beamforming is done at the
   baseband; one distinct radio-frequency (RF) chain is required for each
   antenna, which for large-scale MIMO systems can be prohibitive from
   either cost or power consumption point of view. This paper considers a
   two-stage hybrid beamforming structure to reduce the number of RF chains
   for large-scale MIMO systems. The overall beamforming matrix consists of
   analog RF beamforming implemented using phase shifters and baseband
   digital beamforming of much smaller dimension. This paper considers
   precoder and receiver design for maximizing the spectral efficiency when
   the hybrid structure is used at both the transmitter and the receiver.
   On the theoretical front, bounds on the minimum number of transmit and
   receive RF chains that are required to realize the theoretical capacity
   of the large-scale MIMO system are presented. It is shown that the
   hybrid structure can achieve the same performance as the fully-digital
   beamforming scheme if the number of RF chains at each end is greater
   than or equal to twice the number of data streams. On the practical
   design front, this paper proposes a heuristic hybrid beamforming design
   strategy for the critical case where the number of RF chains is equal to
   the number of data streams, and shows that the performance of the
   proposed hybrid beamforming design can achieve spectral efficiency close
   to that of the fully-digital solution.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a system-level performance comparison of two
   fundamentally different transmission strategies for the downlink of a
   cloud radio access network. The two strategies, namely the data-sharing
   strategy and the compression-based strategy, differ in the way the
   limited backhaul is utilized. While the data-sharing strategy uses the
   backhaul to carry raw user data, the compression strategy uses the
   backhaul to carry compressed beamformed signals. Although these
   strategies have been individually studied in the literature, a fair
   comparison of the two schemes under practical network settings is
   challenging because of the complexity in jointly optimizing user
   scheduling, beamforming, and power control for system level performance
   evaluation, along with the need to optimize cooperation clusters for the
   data-sharing, strategy and quantization noise levels for the compression
   strategy. This paper presents an optimization framework for both the
   data-sharing and compression strategies, while taking into account
   losses due to practical modulation in terms of gap to capacity and
   practical quantization in terms of gap to rate-distortion limit. The
   main conclusion of this paper is that the compression based strategy,
   even with a simple fixed-rate uniform quantizer, outperforms the
   data-sharing strategy under medium to high capacity backhauls. However,
   the data-sharing, strategy outperforms the compression strategy under
   low capacity backhauls primarily because of the large quantization loss
   at low backhaul capacity with compression.}},

   adjusting the contention window of each station (STA) according to its

   simple random access scheme. To model the proposed Adaptive CSMA/CA
   (A-CSMA/CA) protocol, a three-dimensional Markov chain is developed.
   With the aid of such model, performance of the proposed A-CSMA/CA is
   analytically studied in terms of saturation throughput. Furthermore,
   illustrative results confirm that A-CSMA/CA significantly improves the

Abstract = {{This paper presents an adaptive hybrid TDMA-CSMA MAC protocol to improve
   network performance and isolation among service providers (SPs) in a
   virtualized 802.11 network. Aiming to increase network efficiency,
   wireless virtualization provides the means to slice available resources
   among different SPs, with an urge to keep different slices isolated.
   Hybrid TDMA-CSMA can be a proper MAC candidate in such scenario
   benefiting from both the TDMA isolation power and the CSMA opportunistic
   nature. In this paper, we propose a dynamic MAC that schedules
   high-traffic users in the TDMA phase with variable size to be
   determined. Then, the rest of active users compete to access the channel
   through CSMA. The objective is to search for a scheduling that maximizes
   the expected sum throughput subject to SP reservations. In the absence
   of arrival traffic statistics, this scheduling is modeled as a
   multi-armed bandit (MAD) problem, in which each arm corresponds to a
   possible scheduling. Due to the dependency between the arms, existing
   policies are not directly applicable in this problem. Thus, we present
   an index-based policy where we update and decide based on learning
   indexes assigned to each user instead of each arm. To update the
   indexes, in addition to TDMA information, observations from CSMA phase
   are used, which adds a new exploration phase for the proposed MAD
   problem. Throughput and isolation performance of the proposed
   self-exploration-aided index-based policy (SIP) are evaluated by
   numerical results.}},

Abstract = {{Crowdsourcing allows for rapid deployment of indoor localization
   systems. However, compared to the conventional methods, crowdsourcing
   might collect fewer received signal strength (RSS) values, hence result
   in greater influence to outliers in RSS values. In this paper, we
   propose an algorithm to detect such outliers and to substitute them with
   more suitable RSS values. In particular, we investigate the relationship
   of RSS values between adjacent locations using a signal propagation
   model and show that the outliers can be corrected using a signal
   propagation model. We propose the Signal Propagation-based Outlier
   Reduction Technic (SPORT) for identifying and adjusting outlier values
   in both the of line training phase and the online localization phase.
   Experimental results show that SPORT greatly smoothens the radio map and
   improves the location accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Genetically modified Mecp2-deficient mice provide a unique model of
   epilepsy associated with Rett syndrome. Examination of intracranial
   electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings from mice lacking mecp2 function
   have revealed the presence of spontaneous epileptiform activity. To date
   the majority of these studies have focused on the low frequencies
   oscillations (LFOs), however, recent findings suggest there may be a
   link between high frequency oscillations (HFOs) and epileptogenesis. In
   this study the coupling of LFO phase to HFO amplitude was examined and
   identified modulation of HFO amplitude (400-600 Hz) by the phase of the
   high delta band (3-6 Hz) in male Mecp2-deficient mice diminishes after
   mecp2 gene reactivation therapy. These delta-HFO modulations were found
   to be strongly associated with long duration epileptiform discharges
   found primarily in the male non-rescue Mecp2-deficient mice. Differences
   in HFO interactions with high delta LFOs in male non-rescue and rescue
   mice could potentially be used as a biomarker for identifying the
   presence of seizure activity.}},

Abstract = {{Ontologies help represent knowledge as a hierarchy of concepts within a
   domain and highlights the relationships between these concepts. Many
   businesses implement ontologies to use it to create and define their
   enterprise architecture framework. Business that specialize in
   customization use ontologies not only to define their business model but
   to use it to make inferences and grow their capabilities. In this paper
   we create an ontology of joints for a furniture customization company
   that could be used to make further inferences about all the possible
   furniture combinations in the scope of the domain. To achieve this
   objective, axioms that describe the various joint types are specified in
   first order logic and tested in Prover9/Mace4. The results demonstrate
   that the ontology captures the intended semantics of the different types
   of joints within furniture manufacturing and can be extended to make
   further inferences about possible furniture compositions.}},

Abstract = {{When liquid droplets are sprayed onto a solid surface during spray
   painting and coating, defects may be created due to non-uniformity of
   the liquid film. The time scale required for leveling the liquid film is
   of utmost importance. In this paper, the leveling of a droplet line was
   modeled numerically using a three-dimensional parallel code, based on a
   two-step projection method with a volume-of-fluid technique used to
   model free surface flow. Simulations and experiments were performed with
   a high viscosity liquid (87\%wt glycerin in water solution and
   commercial paint) where a droplet line was deposited with varying
   center-to-center distance between the droplets and the time scale for
   leveling was measured. Predictions from the numerical model for droplet
   line thickness and variation in the thickness agreed well with
   experimental measurements. Simulation and experimental measurements
   clearly showed that the drastic portion of thickness change happened in
   the first 30 seconds. When the droplets were dispensed close to one
   another (initially thicker films), there was a lot of interaction
   between the droplets and therefore there was a huge variation in the
   thickness of the droplet line until the variation died down and the line
   was level. On the other hand, when droplets were dispensed further apart
   (initially thinner films), there was less interaction between the
   droplets and therefore less variation of the film thickness from the
   beginning and the leveling occurred much sooner.}},

Abstract = {{The assessment of real-time intelligent transportation system (ITS)
   applications, such as traffic management and adaptive route guidance
   systems, requires the use of fast and near real-time dynamic traffic
   simulation models. Even off-line applications, used for testing planning
   scenarios, often require fast-enough traffic simulation models that
   enable the required repetitive simulations. This is even more critical
   for large-scale networks with millions of vehicles. This paper
   investigates the speedup of DTA simulation models, using compiler
   optimizations and parallelism. DynusT as a widely used DTA model was
   evaluated as a test case, while its results could be generalized because
   we have used real-networks and calibrated them using real data sets in
   the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA). Extensive testing is
   performed to evaluate various dimensions for speed-up including: network
   size, number of processors, various optimization levels and operating
   systems. The performance results show that compiler optimizations and
   parallelism allow to: 1) double the speed required for a 4-hour
   simulation after 12 iterations to reach equilibrium, and 2) bring down
   the initial simulation time (required for network loading) by 2.5 times;
   enabling the testing of various real-time ITS applications.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) can potentially mitigate traffic
   congestion. Research and development in the area of ATSC have produced a
   number of new systems with promising potential; however the performance
   of these systems under real-life conditions has been always a concern
   for practitioners as well as researchers. Therefore, testing and
   refining new ATSC systems on actual hardware and under representative
   traffic conditions prior to field implementation is essential. In this
   paper, a hardware in-the-loop simulation (HILS) framework is developed
   to evaluate MARLIN, as an example of a new self-learning ATSC system.
   HILS is used for evaluating hardware components running the ATSC
   software in a simulation environment in which an actual traffic signal
   controller and an embedded computer are physically connected to a
   microscopic traffic simulator. Our focus is on the development,
   implementation of the HILS framework and the evaluation of MARLIN, on an
   intersection that suffers significant traffic fluctuation and delays -
   at the City of Burlington, Ontario, Canada. The performance of MARLIN is
   demonstrated with HILS, which consists of a PEEK ATC-1000 traffic
   controller, an embedded computer running the ATSC system, and Paramics
   microscopic simulation model. HILS results indicated that MARLIN-ATSC
   has the potential to reduce the intersection average delay by up to 20\%
   on average compared to the optimized and coordinated actuated signal
   timing plans.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic congestion can be alleviated by infrastructure expansions;
   however, improving the existing infrastructure using traffic control is
   more plausible due to the obvious constraints on financial resources and
   physical space. Independent applications of Adaptive Traffic Signal
   Control (ATSC) and Ramp Metering (RM) have shown strong potential to
   effectively alleviate urban traffic congestion by adjusting the signal
   timings in real-time in response to traffic fluctuations to achieve
   desirable objectives (e.g., minimize delay at intersections or minimize
   travel time along freeways). This paper presents the problem formulation
   and the framework for addressing traffic control problem using an
   integrated solution combining ATSC and RM. According to that problem
   definition, an optimal closed-loop approach for ATSC and RM can be
   designed using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach.
   Authors' previous studies of MARL on a large-scale simulated network of
   59 intersections in the lower downtown core of the City of Toronto for
   the morning rush hour have shown unprecedented reduction in the average
   intersection delay up to 39\% at the network level; and travel time
   savings of up 2to 26\% along the busiest routes in downtown Toronto.
   Additionally, authors' studies of MARL applied to a calibrated
   microsimulation model of the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto, Canada
   resulted in 50\% reduction in total travel time compared with the base
   case scenario.}},

Abstract = {{We study the scheduling of computational tasks on one local processor
   and one remote processor with communication delay. This problem has
   important application in cloud computing. Although the communication
   time to transmit a task can be inferred from the known data size of the
   task and the transmission bandwidth, the processing time of the task is
   generally unknown until it is processed to completion. Given a set of
   independent tasks with unknown processing times, we propose a
   Semi-online Partitioning and Communication (SPaC) algorithm, to jointly
   select the subset of tasks to be offloaded to the remote processor and
   their order of transmission, with an aim to minimize the overall
   makespan to process all tasks. Even though the offline version of this
   problem, with a priori known processing times, is NP-hard, we show that
   the proposed semi-online algorithm achieves a small competitive ratio
   when the communication times of tasks are smaller than their processing
   times at the remote processor. For general communication times, we use
   simulation to demonstrate that SPaC outperforms online list scheduling
   and performs comparably well with known offline heuristics.}},

Abstract = {{In the later part of the 1980s, the telephony industry struggled with
   the cost of connecting subscribers over the last mile to serve millions
   of people in the developing world. While the cost of switching and
   transmission lines is shared across hundreds or thousands of
   subscribers, this advantage diminishes at the edge of the network where
   the cost must be borne by fewer and ultimately individual subscribers.
   In power grids today a similar situation exists.
   The Last-mile Problem was resolved when the cost of cellular telephones
   was reduced by integrating functions and components into silicon
   circuits and when African entrepreneurs found novel financial models to
   enable even the poorest to acquire a cell phone. Using parallel
   principles to provide energy where the infrastructure and the required
   capital investment do not exist, the self-forming nano-grid project
   discussed in this paper can start from a single photovoltaic (PV) panel
   and battery each with attached inverters yet scale up to tens of
   kilowatts. This system also incorporates load management in a power
   distribution panel to set priority for load shedding to keep critical
   loads powered in the face of minimal generation and no conventional grid
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of boron nitride (BN) - graphene hybrid materials is now a
   reality that has opened opportunities for creation of new nanostructures
   with enhanced mechanical, electronic and thermal properties, of
   particular interest for nanoelectronics applications. Properties of
   these materials are still not well understood, and modelling approaches
   are needed to support engineering design of these novel nanostructures.
   In this work, we study thermal transport in BN-graphene superlattices
   from a phonon transport perspective. We predict phonon properties
   (phonon group velocities and phonon lifetimes) using normal mode
   analysis based on phonon spectral energy density (SED) in these
   superlattices, with especial emphasis on the role of the orientation of
   the atoms at the BN - graphene interfaces. We consider various
   superlattices compositions with two highly symmetric orientation, i.e.,
   zig-zag and armchair. Our results show that phonon group velocities are
   higher for the zig-zag interface orientation. We also found that phonon
   modes at small frequencies are more sensitive to the superlattice
   configurations.}},

Abstract = {{Polymeric cellular materials were primarily developed as means to reduce
   density of solid polymers and thus saving cost for applications where
   mechanical strength is not required like the packaging industry.
   Nevertheless, functionally graded cellular materials showed an
   attractive mechanical behavior in experimental studies. The fatigue life
   of porous polycarbonate (PC) with above 90\% relative density is
   reported to be as much as four times that of a solid PC, and greater
   impact strength with relative density over 60\%. The focus of this paper
   is on fabricating bio-polymeric-based functionally graded porous
   material with polylactic acid (PLA) and analyze the buckling behavior of
   their plate-like structures. The analysis includes numerical modeling
   supported with experimental findings. The modeling is carried out with a
   higher order shear deformation plate theory (HSDT) accounting for
   extension in the transverse direction. The proposed HSDT satisfies the
   constraint on the consistency of transverse shear strain energy a priori
   in addition to the traction conditions on plate surfaces. Few theories
   in the area satisfy both conditions. Finite element is used to implement
   the HSDT with C-1 continuity using conforming elements. The
   through-thickness varying properties are homogenized at planar-level
   with the generalized self consistent scheme. The graded cellular
   structure is manufactured to vary through the plate thickness while
   being uniform on-average for the other two planar dimensions.
   Constrained foaming process is adopted to control the pores' size and
   structure through the plate thickness.}},

Abstract = {{A major benefit of advanced fiber-reinforced polymer composites is that
   they can be tailored and optimized to suit a particular structural
   application by orienting the reinforcing fibers along multiple
   directions. For practical load-bearing structural components
   manufactured from multidirectional laminates, predicting their
   mechanical behaviour is quite complex. This is specifically the case for
   progressive failure analysis of these materials when subjected to
   quasi-static or fatigue loading since local cracks will initiate and
   evolve in multiple directions simultaneously. The difficulty of the
   problem increases further when these laminates are subjected to complex
   multiaxial stress states. This is due to the fact that the
   multidirectional crack state will be subjected to additional crack
   driving stress components, which will ultimately alter the crack
   evolution characteristics. A synergistic damage mechanics (SDM)
   methodology has recently been developed to address these issues in
   progressive damage analyses of composite laminates containing multiple
   damage modes and subjected to uniaxial loading {[}1]. By combining
   micromechanics and continuum damage mechanics, the SDM methodology
   provides a rigorous and practical tool for accurate prediction of
   progressive damage behaviour in composite structures. This is essential
   for accurately predicting the integrity and durability of practical
   structures, which will lead to safer and more efficient designs.
   The main focus of this study is to improve the capability of the SDM
   approach by including the effects of multiaxiality to the prediction
   model. Micromechanical fmite element models of various crack-containing
   laminates are developed in order to evaluate the damage model parameters
   for many multiaxial loading scenarios, while a continuum-based damage
   constitutive law for the laminate is developed to represent the
   corresponding stiffness degradation. The long-term goal is to predict
   damage evolution in practical composite structures subjected to
   multiaxial stresses by implementing the SDM prediction model into a
   commercial fmite element (FE) software package, and the current study is
   the first step towards this goal.}},

Abstract = {{Polymers make up an important component of the manufacturing industry.
   Their density and mechanical properties makes them desirable for many
   applications. Currently much polymer produced is from non-renewable
   sources which adds to waste after disposal. PLA is a bio-based polymer
   shown to be promising in many studies but its inherent brittleness
   prevents wide scale application of the polymer. One readily feasible
   alternative is to reinforce PLA with fillers as a means to improve
   mechanical properties. Two types of PLA based bio-composites were
   considered: PLA-Lignin \& PLA-Tannin composites. PLA was the matrix in
   these composites with the fillers either being Lignin or Tannin.
   Composites containing 5, 10, and 15 wt \% of the fillers were studied.
   The composites were fabricated by means of melt blending in a twin screw
   compounder followed by injection molding. SEM morphological, mechanical,
   and dynamic mechanical evaluations of the composites were performed. Tan
   delta values of both Lignin and Tannin based PLA composites increased
   with increasing addition of fillers with the exception of PLA with 5
   wt\% Tannin. Lignin appears to have a plasticizing effect on the initial
   tensile stiffness while tannin appears to have a stiffening effect on
   the initial tensile stiffness. Glass transition temperatures of all
   composites do not seem to change significantly from that of pure PLA.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel approach to achieve diagnostic color
   estimation for histological objects in pathology images. The method is
   based on a von Mises mixture model for hue histogram, followed by
   implicit pixel clustering via maximum likelihood estimation and
   representative color computation. Unlike conventional approaches
   adopting linear processing algorithms to analyze hue histogram which is
   characterized by a nature of periodicity, we build a circular cluster
   model composed of multiple von Mises distributions to address the
   directional nature of hue. Experimental results on synthetic circular
   data suggest that the proposed circular model outperforms both classical
   linear thresholding methods and the state-of-art circular thresholding
   approach in terms of cluster parameter estimation. The color estimation
   experiment on publicly-accessible cytopathology images demonstrates that
   our method is capable to accurately estimate object's diagnostic color,
   which can be used for subsequent image analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Gallium arsenide is the second most used semiconductor material with
   applications in light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, and
   integrated circuits. Thus, understanding and controlling the thermal
   conductivity of gallium arsenide is crucial to design devices for such
   applications. The goal of this study is to predict the thermal
   conductivity of gallium arsenide as a function of temperature and
   vacancy concentration. Thermal conductivities are predicted using an
   equilibrium molecular dynamics method based on the Green-Kubo formalism
   with temperatures between 300 K and 900 K and vacancy concentrations up
   to 0.5\%. Our results show that the thermal conductivities of the
   vacancy-free system predicted by our model are in good agreement with
   experimental values around the Debye temperature. In addition, our model
   predicts that conductivities significantly decrease with increasing
   vacancy concentration. At 300 K conductivities drop by 39.5\% with a
   0.1\% defect content and 74.4\% with 0.5\% respect to that of the pure
   system. The power spectra of thermal conductivities and heat current
   auto correlation functions indicate that phonon scattering produced near
   the vacancies reduces the contribution of the acoustic frequencies. The
   density of states quantifies the decrease of acoustic and optic
   frequencies by increasing the vacancy concentration.}},

Title = {{Automatic segmentation of the hippocampus for preterm neonates from
   early-in-life to term-equivalent age}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{176-193}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The hippocampus, a medial temporal lobe structure central
   to learning and memory, is particularly vulnerable in preterm-born
   neonates. To date, segmentation of the hippocampus for preterm-born
   neonates has not yet been performed early-in-life (shortly after birth
   when clinically stable). The present study focuses on the development
   and validation of an automatic segmentation protocol that is based on
   the MAGeT-Brain (Multiple Automatically Generated Templates) algorithm
   to delineate the hippocampi of preterm neonates on their brain MRIs
   acquired at not only term-equivalent age but also early-in-life.
   Methods: First, we present a three-step manual segmentation protocol to
   delineate the hippocampus for preterm neonates and apply this protocol
   on 22 early-in-life and 22 term images. These manual segmentations are
   considered the gold standard in assessing the automatic segmentations.
   MAGeT-Brain, automatic hippocampal segmentation pipeline, requires only
   a small number of input atlases and reduces the registration and
   resampling errors by employing an intermediate template library. We
   assess the segmentation accuracy of MAGeT-Brain in three validation
   studies, evaluate the hippocampal growth from early-in-life to
   term-equivalent age, and study the effect of preterm birth on the
   hippocampal volume. The first experiment thoroughly validates
   MAGeT-Brain segmentation in three sets of 10-fold Monte Carlo
   cross-validation (MCCV) analyses with 187 different groups of input
   atlases and templates. The second experiment segments the neonatal
   hippocampi on 168 early-in-life and 154 term images and evaluates the
   hippocampal growth rate of 125 infants from early-in-life to
   term-equivalent age. The third experiment analyzes the effect of
   gestational age (GA) at birth on the average hippocampal volume at
   early-in-life and term-equivalent age using linear regression.
   Results: The final segmentations demonstrate that MAGeT-Brain
   consistently provides accurate segmentations in comparison to manually
   derived gold standards (mean Dice's Kappa > 0.79 and Euclidean distance
   <1.3 mm between centroids). Using this method, we demonstrate that the
   average volume of the hippocampus is significantly different (p <
   0.0001) in early-in-life (621.8 mm(3)) and term-equivalent age (958.8
   mm(3)). Using these differences, we generalize the hippocampal growth
   rate to 38.3 +/- 11.7 mm(3)/week and 40.5 +/- 12.9 mm(3)/week for the
   left and right hippocampi respectively. Not surprisingly, younger
   gestational age at birth is associated with smaller volumes of the
   hippocampi (p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: MAGeT-Brain is capable of segmenting hippocampi accurately
   in preterm neonates, even at early-in-life. Hippocampal asymmetry with a
   larger right side is demonstrated on early-in-life images, suggesting
   that this phenomenon has its onset in the 3rd trimester of gestation.
   Hippocampal volume assessed at the time of early-in-life and
   term-equivalent age is linearly associated with GA at birth, whereby
   smaller volumes are associatedwith earlier birth. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Automated segmentation of abdominal organs in 3D ultrasound images is an
   important and challenging task toward computer assisted emergency
   diagnosis. However, speckle noise, low-contrast organ tissues,
   intensity-profile inhomogeneity, and partial organ visibility are some
   ultrasound challenges which limits the utility of the automated
   diagnosis solutions. In this paper, an atlas-based method to
   automatically segment an organ of interest in abdominal 3D ultrasound
   images is proposed. The atlas model contains texture information and
   shape knowledge of the organ, which facilitates an accurate
   discrimination of organ from non-organ voxels in input 3D ultrasound
   images. The proposed method offers a mechanism to automatically detect
   the organ, and therefore, it eliminates the need of manual
   initialization of organ segmentation. The proposed method is applied to
   automatically segment the right kidney in 3D ultrasound images. The
   experimental results indicate that the proposed method provides a higher
   detection and segmentation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art.}},

Abstract = {{Fluid shift from the legs and into the neck during sleep has been shown
   to increase tissue pressure around the upper airway and increase sleep
   apnea severity. Recently, acute fluid overload via saline infusion
   during sleep was shown to increase sleep apnea severity in an older men
   (>= 40 years of age) but not the younger men (<40 years of age). The
   purpose of this study was to estimate the changes in the autonomic
   nervous system response to saline infusion in the younger and older men
   using well studied time-and frequency domain heart rate variability
   metrics (HRV).
   Eighteen healthy men (10 in the younger group and 8 in the older group)
   slept for up to 3 hours during the day while approximate to 2L of saline
   was intravenously injected during sleep. An electrocardiogram was
   collected continuously during the sleep period. Two five minute segments
   of stage 1 or 2 sleep were selected for analysis of HRV: one before
   saline infusion and one after completion of saline infusion. Time-and
   frequency domain metrics of HRV were used to characterize autonomic
   nervous system response. Results generally showed increased HRV as
   measured by time-domain statistical measures in the younger men after
   saline infusion. In the frequency domain, the change in high frequency
   power from pre- to post-saline infusion was significantly greater in the
   younger compared to the older men. In addition, there was a borderline
   significant trend showing an increase in HF power from pre- to
   post-saline infusion in the younger, but not the older men. These
   results suggest that only in the younger men and not the older men,
   parasympathetic nervous activity increased in response to acute fluid
   overload. This might be one of the mechanisms that increased the
   severity of OSA in older and not the younger men.}},

Abstract = {{Rostral fluid shift during sleep from the lower body part into the neck
   can increase neck circumference (NC) and narrow the upper airway. Such
   narrowing in the upper airway may increase turbulence of airflow passing

   study was to investigate the effects of changes in NC during sleep on
   snoring sound characteristics. Fifteen non-obese men slept supine, and
   their sleep was monitored by a regular polysomnography. Snoring sounds
   were recorded with a microphone attached to the neck. NC was measured
   before and after sleep with a measuring tape. Snoring sounds' average
   power was calculated in different frequency ranges of 100 - 4000 Hz, 100
   - 150 Hz, 150 - 450 Hz, 450 - 600 Hz, 600 - 1200 Hz, 1200 - 1800 Hz,
   1800 - 2500 Hz and 2500 - 4000 Hz. Statistical analysis showed that

   pellucida (ZP) in embryos with the use of a laser, is a required step in
   many embryonic surgical procedures such as assisted hatching and

   specific locations of the ZP while minimizing potential harmful thermal
   effects to important structures of the embryo, namely the blastomeres.
   Current thermal analyzes of lasers used in LZD only encompass the use of
   a single pulse, whereas LZD is typically performed using multiple

   introduce a linear approximation method for multi-pulse LZD.
   Furthermore, we describe a novel method of measuring the thermal effect

Abstract = {{Recent studies have implicated astrocytes in multiple active roles in
   neuronal networks. In particular they have been shown to be able to
   moderate and alter neural firing patterns both in normal and epileptic
   conditions. In addition, it has been proposed that one of the roles of
   gap junctions between astrocytes, as well as neurons is in increasing
   synchronization of neuronal firing and potential epileptogenic effect.
   In this study we build upon a model of a network that incorporates both
   pyramidal cells and interneurons as well as astrocytes with potassium
   clearance mechanisms and basic calcium dynamics. We include electrotonic
   connections between cells to be able to separate the effects of synaptic
   connections and gap junctions on neuronal hyperexcitability. Preliminary
   findings of this model show that under normal conditions, when gap
   junctions are blocked the network exists in an interictal-like state.
   When the system is put in a zero calcium environment (i.e. synaptic
   connections are disabled), the network enters spontaneous rhythmic
   bursting with very regular spiking. This suggests that electrotonic
   connections play a crucial role in the epileptogenesis within the
   neuronal network.}},

Abstract = {{A method of generating a rough, robust estimate of tensile modulus,
   elongation at break, and tear out of tissue from histology for the
   purpose of accelerating medical device and simulator design is
   presented. The known properties of the individual structural components
   of tissue are utilized by organizing these components according to
   existing histological data. This method was able to predict the elastic
   modulus of esophageal tissue by layer and direction with accuracy close
   to the standard deviation of the tissue properties, to provide a robust
   upper limit on tear out force for small (<0.2mm or 3-0) sutures or
   clips, and predict force distribution between the layers during tear

Abstract = {{Timely recognition of cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer's disease
   is of great significance. Many smart systems, developed to continuously
   monitor older adults' health and cognition, use a number of predefined
   measures associated with the older adults' activity in their homes.
   However, this approach has been demonstrated to focus on idiosyncratic
   nuances of the individual subjects, and thus could potentially not
   perform as well when tested on new subjects. In this paper, we address
   this problem by building proper statistical models of older adults'
   in-home walking speed. Using the data pertaining to 15 older adults
   monitored for an average period of 3 years, we used linear regression
   with a Gaussian likelihood to model the subjects' in-home walking speed,
   and we used dynamic time warping to demonstrate significant difference
   between the walking speed distributions of the subjects when cognitively
   intact and when having mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Using a simple
   thresholding approach of the dynamic time warping costs, we were able to
   detect MCI in older adults with areas under the ROC curve and the
   precision-recall curve of 0.906 and 0.790, respectively, using a time
   frame of 12 weeks.}},

Abstract = {{Polysomnography is a comprehensive modality for diagnosing sleep apnea
   (SA), but it is expensive and not widely available. Several technologies
   have been developed for portable diagnosis of SA in the home, most of
   which lack the ability to detect sleep status. Wrist actigraphy
   (accelerometry) has been adopted to cover this limitation. However, head
   actigraphy has not been systematically evaluated for this purpose.
   Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of head
   actigraphy to detect sleep/wake status. We obtained full overnight
   3-axis head accelerometry data from 75 sleep apnea patient recordings.
   These were split into training and validation groups (2: 1). Data were
   preprocessed and 5 features were extracted. Different feature
   combinations were fed into 3 different classifiers, namely support
   vector machine, logistic regression, and random forests, each of which
   was trained and validated on a different subgroup. The random forest
   algorithm yielded the highest performance, with an area under the
   receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.81 for detection of
   sleep status. This shows that this technique has a very good performance
   in detecting sleep status in SA patients despite the specificities in
   this population, such as respiration related movements.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-convulsive drug treatments of epilepsy typically produce varied
   outcomes from one patient to the next, often necessitating patients to
   go through several anticonvulsive drug trials until an appropriate
   treatment is found. The focus of this study is to predict treatment
   outcome using a priori electroencephalogram (EEG) features for a rare
   genetic model of epilepsy seen in patients with Rett Syndrome. Previous
   work on Mecp2-deficient mice, exhibiting the symptoms of Rett syndrome,
   have revealed EEG-based biomarkers that track the pathology well.
   Specifically the presence of cross-frequency coupling of the delta-like
   (3-6 Hz) frequency range phase with the fast ripple (400 - 600 Hz)
   frequency range amplitude in long duration discharges was found to track
   seizure pathology. Support Vector Machines (SVM) were trained with
   features generated from phase-amplitude comodulograms and tested on
   (n=6) Mecp2-deficient mice to predict treatment outcome to Midazolam, a
   commonly used anti-convulsive drug. Using SVMs it was shown that it is
   possible to generate a likelihood score to predict treatment outcomes on
   all of the animal subjects. Identifying the most appropriate treatment a
   priori would potentially lead to improved treatment outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder in adults
   characterized by repetitive collapse of the pharynx. OSA prevalence
   increases in fluid retaining patients such as those with heart or renal
   failure, and worsens with overnight fluid accumulation in the neck. The
   objective of this study was to develop a new method of measuring changes
   in intracellular water (ICW) in the neck, and investigate metrics that
   represent total neck impedance and their relationship to sleep apnea
   severity.
   In 18 non-obese men, neck fluid volume (NFV) was measured before and
   after sleep using bioelectrical impedance at 50 kHz. For each
   participant, resistance and reactance was extracted from the impedance
   measurements. A model was developed to estimate the cell membrane
   capacitance which could represent changes in intracellular fluid in the
   neck. OSA severity was assessed using polysomnography to estimate the
   apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) as well as the obstructive AHI (OAHI). Our
   results showed a strong correlation between the changes in NFV from
   before to after sleep with the changes in cell membrane capacitance from
   before to after sleep, indicating an increase in ICW in the neck during
   sleep. Using linear stepwise regression we were also able to develop
   models to accurately predict AHI and OAHI using baseline anthropometric
   and bioimpedance measurements. These promising results demonstrate that
   non-invasive measurements of bioimpedance can be used to develop a novel
   biomarker to model sleep apnea severity, and assess patients at high
   risk of OSA.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the relation between Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome
   tremors in the left and right hands of patients. By analyzing 122
   recordings from 61 patients in emergency departments, we found a weak
   relationship between the left and right hand tremor frequencies
   (correlation coefficient of 0.63). We found a much stronger relationship
   between the expert physician tremor ratings (on CIWA-Ar 0-7 scale) of
   the two hands, with a correlation coefficient of 0.923. Next, using a
   smartphone to collect the tremor data and using a previously developed
   model for obtaining estimated tremor ratings, we also found a strong
   correlation (correlation coefficient of 0.852) between the estimates of
   each hand. Finally, we evaluated different methods of combining the data
   from the two hands for obtaining a single tremor rating estimate, and
   found that simply averaging the tremor ratings of the two hands results
   in the lowest tremor estimate error (an RMSE of 0.977). Looking at the
   frequency dependence of this error, we found that higher frequency
   tremors had a much lower estimation error (an RMSE of 1.102 for tremors
   with frequencies in the 3-6Hz range as compared to 0.625 for tremors
   with frequencies in the 7-10Hz range).}},

Abstract = {{In patients with intractable epilepsy, surgical resection is a promising
   treatment; however, post surgical seizure freedom is contingent upon
   accurate identification of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Identification
   of the SOZ in extratemporal epilepsy requires invasive intracranial EEG
   (iEEG) recordings as well as resource intensive and subjective analysis
   by epileptologists. Expert inspection yields inconsistent localization
   of the SOZ which leads to comparatively poor post surgical outcomes for
   patients. This study employs recordings from 6 patients undergoing
   resection surgery in order to develop an automated and scalable system
   for identifying regions of interest (ROIs). Leveraging machine learning
   techniques and features used for seizure detection, a classification
   system was trained and tested on patients with Engel class I to class IV
   outcomes, demonstrating superior performance in the class I patients.
   Further, classification using features based upon both high frequency
   and low frequency oscillations was best able to identify channels suited
   for resection. This study demonstrates a novel approach to ROI
   identification and provides a path for developing tools to improve
   outcomes in epilepsy surgery.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a wireless cellular network with multiple

   communication of multiple source-destination pairs with relay
   transmission beamforming. Our objective is to minimize the maximum
   interference power among all active receivers in a neighboring cell
   subject to per-relay power and minimum received SNR constraints. We
   propose an efficient algorithm to obtain the optimal relay beamforming
   vectors. We show that even though the optimization problem is
   non-convex, it has zero Lagrange duality gap and can be converted to a
   semidefinite programming problem. The performance of the proposed
   algorithm is studied numerically, both for the case where the
   interference channel information is exactly known and for the case of
   inaccurate channel information due to either limited feedback or channel
   estimation error. It is demonstrated that the min-max interference
   approach substantially outperforms the alternative where we simply
   minimize the maximum relay transmission power.}},

Abstract = {{Code offloading to remote infrastructures has been a common practice for
   mobile users who seek extra power or computing resources to perform
   computation-intensive tasks. Existing works, however, have so far mainly
   focused on code offloading from a single mobile device to remote cloud
   servers, which restricts the potential of code offloading only to
   devices with available Internet access. In this paper, we propose Circa,
   a new framework that demonstrates the feasibility of code offloading
   among multiple mobile devices in close proximity to one another,
   leveraging the presence of iBeacons. Our objective is to eliminate the
   costs incurred by running virtual machine instances in the cloud, and
   the need to connect remotely to the cloud as well. With the assistance
   of iBeacons, devices in the same vicinity can discover and support one
   another through collaborative code offloading with short-range
   communication, obviating the need for centralized servers. We have
   implemented Circa on the iOS platform and validated its feasibility
   using iOS devices. According to our experimental results, with more than
   two collaborators, Circa is capable of reducing the total execution time
   of an offloaded task substantially, while preserving satisfactory
   performance of the mobile application.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a novel use of device-to-device link for
   cooperative communication wherein a nearby user terminal acts as a relay
   in enabling both signal enhancement and common interference rejection at
   the intended destination. Assuming Gaussian transmission and Gaussian
   compress-and-forward relaying strategy for the multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) relay channel with a finite-capacity out-of-band
   relay-destination link and with arbitrarily correlated noises, this
   paper proposes a coordinate ascent approach for iteratively optimizing
   the transmit covariance matrix at the source and the quantization noise
   covariance matrix at the relay. We show that the optimization of
   quantization noise covariance matrix under fixed input can be solved in
   closed form using a simultaneous diagonalization approach, while the
   optimization of transmit covariance matrix under fixed quantization can
   be cast as a convex optimization problem. This paper further introduces
   the concept of antenna pooling and illustrates the importance of
   accounting for the noise correlation across the user terminals due to
   common interference. We show that the optimized transmission and
   device-to-device relaying strategies that take advantage of the noise
   correlation can significantly improve the user throughput in a cellular
   environment by enabling interference rejection across the user
   terminals.}},

Abstract = {{Though HTTP adaptive video streaming has been widely adopted in the
   industry, it has been shown that it suffers from lackluster performance
   with respect to a number of desirable properties: fairness, efficiency,
   and stability, especially when multiple players compete for a bottleneck
   link. Effective algorithms have been proposed for single-server HTTP
   adaptive streaming to mitigate these problems.
   In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis on these desirable
   properties in the context of using HTTP adaptive streaming from multiple
   servers, which demonstrate that these properties will no longer hold
   with the existing algorithms. To address this challenge, we present
   Presto, a new protocol designed to improve the user experience by
   providing better fairness, efficiency and stability in the context of
   multi-server HTTP adaptive streaming. Our real-world experimental
   results indicate that Presto substantially outperforms existing
   protocols in the multiple server scenario.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing availability of low-cost hardware along with the rapid
   growth of wireless devices has enabled the development of Wireless
   Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs). Multimedia content such as video and
   audio streaming is transmitted over a WMSN which can easily be deployed
   with low cost. However, enabling real-time data applications in those
   networks demands not only Quality of Service (QoS) awareness, but also
   efficient energy management. Sensor network devices have limited energy
   resources. The limited energy poses significant threats on the QoS of
   WMSNs. In this paper, to improve the efficiency of QoS-aware routing, we
   examine an angle-based QoS and energy-aware dynamic routing scheme
   designed for WMSNs. The proposed approach uses the inclination angle and
   the transmission distance between nodes to optimize the selection of the
   forwarding candidate set and extend network lifetime. Simulation results
   indicate that considerable lifetime values can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new soft-bodied millimeter-scale swimmer actuated
   by rotating uniform magnetic fields. The proposed swimmer moves through
   internal undulatory deformations, resulting from a magnetization profile
   programmed into its body. To understand the motion of the swimmer, a
   mathematical model is developed to describe the general relationship
   between the deflection of a flexible strip and its magnetization
   profile. As a special case, the situation of the swimmer on the water
   surface is analyzed and predictions made by the model are experimentally
   verified. Experimental results show the controllability of the proposed
   swimmer under a computer vision-based closed-loop controller. The
   swimmers have nominal dimensions of 1.5 x 4.9 x 0.0 6 mm and a top speed
   of 50 mm/s (10 body lengths per second). Waypoint following and
   multi-agent control are demonstrated for swimmers constrained at the
   air-water interface and underwater swimming is also shown, suggesting
   the promising potential of this type of swimmer in biomedical and

   use of data generated from physical trials. Transfer Learning (TL)
   allows for this data to come from a different, similar system. This
   paper studies a simplified TL scenario with the goal of understanding in
   which cases a simple, alignment-based transfer of data is possible and
   beneficial. Two linear, time-invariant (LTI), single-input,
   single-output systems are tasked to follow the same reference signal. A
   scalar, LTI transformation is applied to the output from a source system
   to align with the output from a target system. An upper bound on the
   2-norm of the transformation error is derived for a large set of
   reference signals and is minimized with respect to the transformation
   scalar. Analysis shows that the minimized error bound is reduced for
   systems with poles that lie close to each other (that is, for systems
   with similar response times). This criterion is relaxed for systems with
   poles that have a larger negative real part (that is, for stable systems
   with fast response), meaning that poles can be further apart for the
   same minimized error bound. Additionally, numerical results show that
   using the reference signal as input to the transformation reduces the
   minimized bound further.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of a reflectarray antenna from the point
   of view of an impedance surface instead of the traditional array-based
   methods. The proposed design methodology is based on the Bessel filter
   with its group delay bandwidth maximized. It will be shown that the
   reflectarrays can fully capitalize this bandwidth without using
   true-time-delay devices. A proof-of-concept 1-D reflectarray is designed
   using the developed methodology. Simulated far-field patterns are shown
   and compared to a parabolic reflector.}},

   and 3) hierarchical control that entails a combination of centralized
   (tier-2) and distributed (tier-1) control. We compare the performance of
   the three control approaches against various faults in the system and we

Abstract = {{Today's electric power grid aims to provide reliable power service that
   meets (even the most rarely occurring) demand peaks. Consequently, this
   necessitates the grid be equipped with ample generation sources that can
   be costly and unsustainable. Demand response (DR) is one popular
   approach to reduce peak demand that requires communications and
   coordination amongst DR participants. In this paper, we propose a novel
   distributed DR strategy that employs simplistic cost signals broadcasted
   by the electric power utility for coordination and convergence to a
   desired aggregate peak demand reduction. We make use of evolutionary
   game theoretic concepts to analytically and empirically establish
   important convergence properties. Our results indicate that our strategy
   is real-time and highly scalable demonstrating promise for practical

   composition on casting performance for specific steels. A flux with
   reasonable basicity and additives was designed for the casting of
   heat-resistant steel (Incoloy 800) to reduce surface cracks. Another
   flux was designed for the casting of non-magnetic steel containing high

Abstract = {{A Monte Carlo simulation was built to estimate the percolation threshold
   of fibers in a system under different fiber orientations. A 3-D model
   was built. The orientation effect was modeled by introducing a degree of
   alignment in the randomly generated fibers via appropriate mathematical
   relationships and various degrees of uniaxial strain were applied. The
   critical volume fraction was then analyzed in both normal direction
   (through-plane) and parallel direction (in-plane) to that of the
   cross-section plane. The effect of uniaxial orientation was modeled by
   measuring the through-plane percolation threshold under tensile strain.
   The effect of biaxial orientation was modeled by measuring the in-plane
   percolation threshold under compressive strain. The results indicated
   that the introduction of fiber alignment changed both through-plane and
   in-plane threshold values, albeit with different trends. With the
   introduction of slight uniaxial orientation, the through-plane
   percolation threshold reached a minimum value and further uniaxial
   orientation gave it a rise, while the in-plane threshold continuously
   increased with an increase in uniaxial orientation. On the other hand,
   under compression, an increase in biaxial orientation resulted in a
   monotonic increase in the through-plane threshold, whereas the in-plane
   threshold showed a minimal behavior before its rise. The results of this
   study indicate that the percolation threshold is minimized when fibers
   are slightly oriented (both uniaxial and biaxial) rather than being
   completely isotropic, and therefore, generation of conductive paths in a
   particular direction of interest can be induced via a proper choice of
   applied orientation with a lower critical concentration, thereby
   potentially reducing the filler loading. One particular implication of
   this work is modeling the percolation threshold in cellular polymer
   composites where local stresses are applied on the fillers around the
   cell walls during bubble growth.}},

Abstract = {{Optical tweezers has become a powerful tool in automated cell
   transportation control and has been used in a variety of biological
   applications. The use of optical tweezers for cell surgery has great
   potential for various biomedical applications such as microinjection,
   organelle extraction and modification, and preimplantation genetic
   diagnosis (PGD). In these cell surgical manipulation tasks, the cell of
   interest must be oriented properly such that the desired component,
   e.g., the polar-body or organelles, can be visualized by optical
   microscopy; thus cell rotation becomes a necessary procedure. Currently,
   cell rotational control can be carried out by laser tools that are
   usually handled by skilled people. The open-loop manual operation cannot
   be readily used for applications requiring precise and high throughput
   cell rotational control. This highlights the need of developing an
   automated controlled robot manipulator to rotate biological cells more
   accurately and efficiently. In this paper, we propose a cell surgery
   system that utilizes two optical traps, generated by robotically
   controlled holographic optical tweezers (HOT), to manipulate the cell
   for rotation, where the optical tweezers functions as special robot
   manipulators. Through dynamic modeling using T-matrix approach, the
   relationship between the applied torques and the spherical coordinates
   of the optical tweezers is characterized. A rotational controller is
   further developed to rotate the cell to the pre-desired orientation
   accurately. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical force is an integral part of tissue morphogenesis and
   patterning. We have developed an automated micro-aspiration system to
   investigate how mouse limb bud tissue responds to extrinsic forces in
   order to understand whether tissue-generated forces can be a part of the
   mechanism causing oriented cell behaviors observed in mouse limb bud
   morphogenesis. The system is capable of performing automated
   micropipette tracking, tissue-tip contact detection, pressure control,
   and prolonged application of constant pressure. A three-dimensional
   tissue tracking algorithm is developed based on the processing of
   time-lapsed confocal Z-stack images. 3D visual feedback from confocal
   microscopy imaging, for the first time, is used to realize 3D visual
   servoing to control the micropipette position to compensate for tissue
   movement. This enables stable force application in a biologically
   relevant time scale (e.g., 60 minutes) during which cell remodeling
   occurs. Experimental results demonstrate that micro-aspiration on mouse
   limb bud is capable of creating tension anisotropy which causes
   force-responsive cells to dynamically remodel through polarized cell
   division and rosette resolution.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the first robotic system for vitrification of
   mammalian embryos. Vitrification is a technique for preserving oocytes
   and embryos in clinical IVF (in vitro fertilization). The procedure
   involves multiple steps of stringently timed pick-and-place operation
   for processing an oocyte/embryo in vitrification media. In IVF clinics,
   vitrification is conducted manually by highly skilled embryologists.
   Processing one oocyte/embryo occupies the embryologist 1520 minutes,
   depending on protocols chosen to implement. Due to poor reproducibility
   and inconsistency across operators, success rates and survival rates
   also vary significantly. Through collaboration with IVF clinics, we are
   in process to realize robotic vitrification and aim ultimately to
   standardize clinical vitrification from manual operation to fully
   automated robotic operation. Our robotic system is embedded with two
   contact detection methods to determine the relative Z positions of the
   vitrification micropipette, embryo, and vitrification straw. A 3D
   tracking algorithm is developed for visually servoed embryo transfer and
   real-time monitoring of embryo volume changes during vitrification.
   Excess medium is automatically removed from around the vitrified embryo
   on the vitrification straw to achieve a high cooling rate. Tests on
   mouse embryos demonstrate that the system is capable of performing
   vitrification with a throughput at least three times that of manual
   operation and achieved a high survival rate (88.9\%) and development
   rate (93.8\%).}},

Abstract = {{Handwriting biomechanics may bear biometric value. Kinematic and kinetic
   handwriting characteristics of authentic and forged handwriting samples
   have been contrasted in previous research. However, past research has
   only considered pen-on-paper forces while grip kinetics, i.e., the
   forces applied by writers' fingers on the pen barrel, have not been
   examined in this context. This study compares multiple grip kinetic
   features between repeated samples of authentic signatures and skilled
   forgeries in a sample of 20 functional adult writers. Grip kinetic
   features differed between authentic and well-practiced bogus signatures
   in less than half of the participants. In instances where forces
   differed between authentic and bogus, there was no clear trend in the
   difference. Forgeries are not necessarily associated with different or
   more variable grip kinetics. As long as the written text is
   well-practiced and written naturally, the handwriting kinetics tend to
   be similar to those of authentic signature writing.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-radio access technology (RAT) cellular communication systems limit
   connected users to utilizing a single RAT even when employing multi-mode
   user equipment (UE) capable of utilizing multi-RATs. Single-mode access,
   combined with static spectrum partitioning between co-deployed RATs and
   independent resource allocation for employed RATs, results in suboptimal
   spectrum utilization in multi-RAT systems. This paper models user access
   in multi-RAT systems and proposes enabling multi-mode UE to
   simultaneously utilize multiple RATs, using multi-RAT carrier
   aggregation, to improve the performance and spectrum utilization of
   multi-RAT systems. Several realizations of multi-mode access with
   varying implementation requirements are presented and discussed.
   Detailed system-level simulations, for a system co-deploying High Speed
   Packet Access (HSPA) and Long-Term Evolution (LTE), are performed to
   investigate the gains and limitations of different user access

Abstract = {{Modern digital systems are growing in size and complexity, introducing
   significant organizational and verification challenges in the design
   cycle. Verification today takes as much as 70\% of the design time with
   debugging being responsible for half of this effort. Automation has
   mitigated part of the resource-intensive nature of rectifying erroneous
   designs. Nevertheless, most tools target failures in isolation. Since
   regression verification can discover myriads of failures in one run,
   automation is also required to guide an engineer to rank them and
   expedite debugging. To address this growing regression pain, this paper
   presents a framework that utilizes traditional machine learning
   techniques along with historical data in version control systems and the
   results of functional debugging. Its aim is to rank revisions based on
   their likelihood of being responsible for a particular failure. Ranking
   prioritizes revisions that ought to be targeted first, and therefore it
   speeds-up the localization of the error source. This effectively reduces
   the number of debug iterations. Experiments on industrial designs
   demonstrate a 68\% improvement in the ranking of actual erroneous
   revisions versus the ranking obtained through existing industrial
   methodologies. This benefit arrives with negligible run-time overhead.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of maintenance resource planning
   for utility wood poles for a power distribution company. The poles are
   currently replaced with new ones either when they fail or are found in
   poor condition at regular inspections. As the poles age, a large number
   of failures might occur, yielding an unexpected increase in the demand
   for maintenance resources. Timely preventive replacement of poles is one
   strategy to prevent such an increase in maintenance demand. Therefore,
   changing the maintenance program such that poles whose ages exceed a
   threshold value are also replaced at regular inspections can reduce the
   number of failures in the future and consequently the unplanned demand
   for maintenance resources. However, determining the threshold age is
   challenging. To solve the problem, we assume that the failure time of
   poles follows a Weibull distribution and estimate its parameters by the
   maximum likelihood method from the available left truncated and right
   censored data. To justify the necessity of preventive replacement, we
   then use the delayed renewal process theorem to calculate the expected
   number of failures in any given interval in the future assuming poles
   are replaced only at failure. Finally, we propose a mathematical
   programming model to determine the threshold age ensuring that the
   expected number of failures in a given future interval is limited. The
   methodology developed in this paper can be used by any utility to limit
   the number of unplanned replacements.}},

Abstract = {{The new technologies for maintenance can vastly improve safety and
   efficiency. E-Maintenance is a technology that can aggregate data from
   multiple databases. Internet of Things (IoT) is defined as a novel
   paradigms to enable ``things{''} (any object with a computational device
   able of communicating) to communicate, exchanging data with each other.
   IoT can detect and read the environment and equipments in real time.
   These advances in technology can result in work practice improvements
   for maintenance technicians if they are well applied.
   To bring these technologies to technicians, a maintenance system needs
   to consider the data they actually need to perform better in their
   current context. The system's User Interface needs to be goal-driven,
   providing the right information at the right time.
   This paper explores the challenge of delivering knowledge to technicians
   in a way that improves their efficiency and safety. It introduces a
   conceptual framework to Situation Awareness (SA) that can be applied in
   designing systems for maintenance technicians. This framework defines
   seven entities of importance (personal, procedure, equipments, system,
   environment, team and enterprise) in maintenance work and how they
   affect the user's SA. The objective is to fill the current knowledge gap
   in studies of SA and assist the process of understanding data and
   situations of maintenance activities.}},

Abstract = {{We study a new concept of relative coobservability in decentralized
   supervisory control of discrete-event systems under partial observation.
   This extends our previous work on relative observability from a
   centralized setup to a decentralized one. A fundamental concept in
   decentralized supervisory control is coobservability (and its several
   variations); this property is not, however, closed under set union, and
   hence there generally does not exist the supremal element. Our proposed
   relative coobservability, although stronger than coobservability, is
   algebraically well-behaved, and the supremal relatively coobservable
   sublanguage of a given language exists. We present an algorithm to
   compute this supremal sublanguage. Moreover, relative coobservability is
   weaker than conormality, which is also closed under set union; unlike
   conormality, relative coobservability imposes no constraint on disabling
   unobservable controllable events.}},

   balloons, and provides an efficient method to synthesize decentralized
   controllers for very large systems. Feedback laws are synthesized using
   a novel method which maintains the distributed structure in the balloon
   system: the balloons' geometry imposes a block circulant pattern in the
   system matrices, and the synthesis method guarantees that the feedback
   found will also be block circulant. The block circulant feedback has a
   clear method of decentralization, and this decentralized control can
   then be used on systems much larger than the one for which the feedback
   was initially designed. Simulations affirm that the response time is
   practically unchanged between the original system and the larger
   decentralized system, so the feedback is both robust and scalable.}},

Abstract = {{This paper adopts an input-output framework to provide sufficient
   conditions under which robust output synchronization is achieved in a
   network of uncertain compartmental models. The network model consists of
   compartments each of which is composed of interconnected nonlinear
   subunits. A distinctive feature of the approach is that it takes into
   account nonlinear perturbations on the diffusive coupling interaction
   among the compartments. The main result is sufficient conditions for
   robust synchronization in the form of an L-2 estimate of the
   synchronization error over an arbitrarily long observation period. The
   results are illustrated with a network of Goodwin oscillators where the
   diffusive coupling is affected by nonlinear perturbations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a water distribution system (WDS), as an example of
   resource distribution problems, is investigated. To achieve an adequate
   level of service to satisfy the demands, the flow of water should be
   controlled. A novel game-theoretic approach is utilized to keep the WDS
   under control. The feedback interconnection of the WDS and the
   game-theoretic-based controller reaches an asymptotically stable
   equilibrium point where its stability analysis uses passivity concepts
   and the Lyapunov stability theorem for the closed-loop system. Moreover,
   a generalization to a class of distribution problem that maintains the
   same stability properties is provided. The effectiveness of the method
   is subsequently verified by simulations under different scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the railway timetabling problem to utilize
   regenerative braking energy produced by trains in a railway network. An
   electric train produces regenerative energy while braking, which is
   often lost in present technology. A positive overlapping time between
   braking and accelerating phases of a suitable train pair makes it
   possible to save electrical energy by transferring the regenerative
   energy of the braking train to the accelerating one. We propose a novel
   optimization model to determine a timetable that saves energy by
   maximizing the total overlapping time of all suitable train pairs. We
   apply our optimization model to different instances of a railway network
   for a time horizon spanning six hours. For each instance, our model
   finds an optimal or near-optimal timetable within an acceptable running
   time. We observe significant increase in the final overlapping time
   compared to the existing timetable for every instance, thus making it
   possible to save the associated electrical energy.}},

Abstract = {{We study optimal radio resource allocation across multiple tiers of a
   heterogeneous wireless network in order to maximize the downlink sum
   throughput. Different from prior works, we consider both the randomness
   of base stations in space and dynamic user traffic session arrivals in
   time, accounting for both elastic and inelastic user traffic. A new
   stochastic analysis framework, which accommodates both spatial and
   temporal dimensions, is proposed to quantify the throughput objective.
   The derived throughput function is not in closed form and is non-concave
   in terms of the radio resource allocation factors to be optimized,
   hindering the search for an efficient optimization solution. Therefore,
   we further develop closed-form concave bounds that envelop the
   throughput function, to form convex approximations of the original
   optimization problem that can be solved efficiently. We characterize the
   performance gap when these bounds are used instead of the original
   objective. Both analytical bounding and simulation experiments
   demonstrate that the proposed solution is nearly optimal.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral polarization control refers to two specific polarization effects:
   Namely, linear polarization rotation and circular polarization
   selectivity. Here we discuss the realization of these effects in two
   examples, not using naturally chiral media, but using cascaded tensor
   impedance surfaces. In the first example, we show measured results for a
   polarization rotator using two back-to-back tensor Huygens surfaces.
   Huygens surfaces consist of orthogonal electric and magnetic dipoles
   which have high transmission and low reflection. By cascading them we
   are able to realize a polarization rotation with large transmission. In
   the second example we develop a multi-mode transmission-line model for
   cascaded impedance surfaces made out of electric dipoles. We use this
   multimode model to semi-analytically find the required tensor impedances
   to demonstrate a design for circular polarization selectivity.}},

Title = {{Test-Retest Reliability of the Susceptibility to Driver Distraction
   Questionnaire}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2518}},
Pages = {{54-59}},
Abstract = {{The Susceptibility to Driver Distraction Questionnaire (SDDQ)
   investigates voluntary and involuntary factors associated with driver
   distraction. The questionnaire consists of 39 items in six subscales:
   (a) self-reported distraction engagement, (b) attitudes toward
   distractions, (c) perceived control of driving while engaged in
   distractions, (d) injunctive social norms associated with distraction
   engagement, (e) descriptive social norms associated with distraction
   engagement, and (f) susceptibility to involuntary distractions. A sample
   of 43 adults, ages 25 to 39 years, was used to assess the test-retest
   reliability of the SDDQ. The mean time between test and retest
   conditions was approximately 20 days. For sub scale averages, intraclass
   correlation (ICC) statistics were used to assess test retest
   reliability; weighted kappa statistics were used to assess individual
   items. The ICC results suggest good to excellent test retest reliability
   for subscales of self-reported distraction engagement, attitudes toward
   distractions, and descriptive social norms. Perceived control of driving
   while engaged in distractions had fair test retest reliability, and the
   injunctive norms and susceptibility to involuntary distraction subscales
   had poor test retest reliabilities. The latter two subscales may have to
   be redesigned; this paper provides relevant suggestions for revision in
   the discussion of the results. As an additional preliminary analysis,
   data from a sample of 10 additional participants were used to
   investigate the consistency of responses across longer periods of time.
   The mean time between test retest conditions in this sample was
   approximately 8 months. In general, the findings were similar to those
   in the main sample. Overall, the SDDQ appears to have good test retest
   reliability. A larger sample is recommended for further validation of
   these results, in particular across long test retest periods.}},

Abstract = {{With continual thinning of crystalline silicon solar cells the carrier
   lifetime of the device becomes progressively more dependent on the
   quality of the surface passivation of the device. Thermal oxide growth
   can degrade crystalline silicon bulk properties through defect migration
   and can induce thermal stresses particularly in the context of
   ultra-thin silicon. This has motivated research into a range of
   passivation techniques that can be implemented at low temperatures. Here
   we report on the use of low temperature ozone ambient grown native oxide
   and PECVD grown silicon nitride bilayer structure to passivate
   crystalline silicon. The effective minority carrier lifetime is examined
   as a function of the thicknesses of the bilayers. Inferred interfacial
   defect and fixed charge densities are investigated vis-a-vis the native
   oxide and nitride layer thicknesses. Hydrogen content at the interface
   is determined by elastic recoil detection and Rutherford backscattering.
   Our results indicate that thicker silicon nitride enhances lifetime
   through reduced interfacial defect density albeit the trapped charge
   density decreases marginally with thickness. Preliminary ion
   spectroscopy results show a link to an increase in the hydrogen content
   beyond the oxide interface. Also, increasing oxide thickness grown at
   room temperature enhances the surface passivation.}},

Abstract = {{Coverage of the inflight explosion of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo on
   October 31st, 2014, exposes a gap between Virgin's polished public face
   and the technical realities of its aim to provide accessible space
   travel. In the days following the crash, Branson used his various media
   arms to communicate concern, support, and his faith in the importance of
   his company's space mission. Meanwhile, the National Transportation
   Safety Board (NTSB) began their ongoing investigation into the incident,
   releasing four video briefings in the week following the crash. These
   two media events-Branson's online handling of the fallout from the
   incident, and the NTSB's Acting Chairman Chris Hart's briefings-provide
   an interesting case study in the way that scientific material is
   disseminated by and for expert and non-expert audiences, and how this
   interacts with expectations around the marketing and promotion of
   scientific discovery. This paper will analyze the contrasting coverage
   of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo crash from the NTSB, Virgin's media
   arms and popular journalism, to consider how we balance scientific
   accuracy with attempts to capture and promote public interest in the
   sciences.}},

Abstract = {{The development of a symbolic computer algebra toolbox for the
   computation of two dimensional (2D) Fourier transforms in polar
   coordinates is presented. Multidimensional Fourier transforms are widely
   used in image processing, tomographic reconstructions and in fact any
   application that requires a multidimensional convolution. By examining a
   function in the frequency domain, additional information and insights
   may be obtained. The advantages of our method include:
   The implementation of the 2D Fourier transform in polar coordinates
   within the toolbox via the combination of two significantly simpler
   transforms.
   The modular approach along with the idea of lookup tables implemented
   help avoid the issue of indeterminate results which may occur when
   attempting to directly evaluate the transform.
   The concept also helps prevent unnecessary computation of already known
   transforms thereby saving memory and processing time. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a framework for human recognition based on
   Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. We particularly consider a verification
   scenario in which only one recording session is available for enrolling
   a subject. Capturing the non-stationarity of ECG and constructing a
   robust model which can be well generalized to unseen data may not be
   possible via having only one training session. Under this scenario, we
   propose to use an auxiliary multisession ECG data set to extract a prior
   knowledge about the behaviour of ECG signal across sessions. A pool of
   different types of features is formed and a subset of good features is
   selected using auxiliary data set. By considering only the selected
   features for enrollment and test, significant performance improvement is
   achieved. Existing feature selection approaches are designed to be used
   in conventional classification problems which are based on a set of
   training samples and a vector of class labels. Our work is different
   from the previous works in that we not only consider the class labels
   but also consider session labels. Features selected from a multisession
   auxiliary data set are used as a prior knowledge to build robust
   templates in the enrollment stage where only one training session is
   available. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of the
   proposed method to cope with non-stationarity of ECG signals across
   different sessions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an open source inertial sensor network is presented. The
   network has multiple sensor nodes connecting to a consumer electronic
   device with Bluetooth Smart. Each sensor node contains the following
   components: (a) an inertial sensor measuring acceleration, angular
   velocity, and magnetic field with good accuracy; (b) a microcontroller
   with capacity to handle real-time floating number calculations; (c) a
   Bluetooth Smart module broadcasting the data with low power consumption.
   The sensor nodes are designed to be small, allowing the users to wear
   them conveniently. For demonstration, a basic Personal Navigation System
   is developed using 4 of these sensor nodes and an Android smartphone.
   The experiments show that the sensor nodes could output accurate results
   with small noises when at rest or in slow motion. The example Personal
   Navigation System could measure total distance walked by a pedestrian
   with less than 10\% error.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal storage units such as residential electric hot waters are
   feasible candidates to be used in a direct load control programs. They
   can store electric power in form of heat for later use. PowerShift
   Atlantic (PSA) is a leading project in developing a demand-side
   management program to provide up to 32MW reserve capacity through
   electric water heaters. To control water heaters properly, the
   controller needs to have an estimation of the on/off status of each
   individual water heaters in advance. This paper presents a monte-carlo
   statistical based method to create a short-term load forecast of the
   individual loads. This method was compared with a traditional neural
   network based load forecast. This paper also presents a model to
   estimate the relative error of the aggregated load forecast. The
   proposed methods were deployed on the PSA pilot and the experimental
   results are discussed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Microgrids (MGs) with renewable energy resources have shown competitive
   operational advantages for smart grid integration. In the wake of recent
   blackout events, more interest has been directed on the deployment of
   MGs in rural and remote areas where main grid connectivity may not be
   possible. This work focuses on the development of an autonomous
   distributed framework for cooperation amongst a set of MGs without
   support from a traditional centralized grid. This work proposes a
   distributed algorithm that supports autonomous operation, enhances cost
   efficiency, and increases reliability of the overall system. This paper
   uses a complete information game theoretic approach via coalition
   formation formulation. The effects of rate policies on the dynamics of
   cooperation are also investigated in this work. The proposed distributed
   algorithm empowers the MGs to coordinate and match significant part of
   energy demand and supply with cooperating MGs. Results of this work show
   cooperation gains for the microgrid network after implementing the
   proposed algorithm.}},

   the commonsense notion of participation as a relation between objects,
   activities, and time. We discuss the obstacles faced to formalize the
   relationships between these ontologies and provide an overview of the
   methodology undertaken to bridge the ontologies together. New ontologies
   are introduced to bring the PSL and DOLCE ontologies together to allow
   us to specify the mappings between them. We illustrate how ontology
   verification is used to show faithful interpretations between the two
   upper ontologies. We also explore applications of ontology transfer
   between a mathematical ontology and an upper ontology as an additional
   means of specifying bridges between ontologies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a fuzzy interactive approach to find the optimal
   location of Optimal Unified Power Flow Controller (OUPFC) device as a
   multi-objective optimization problem. The problem formulation is based
   on Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem while the metric function and
   weighting method are added to ensure the collaboration among objective
   functions. The objective functions are the total fuel cost, power
   losses, and system loadability with and without the minimum cost of
   OUPFC installation. The proposed algorithm is implemented on IEEE 14-and
   118-bus systems. The solution procedure uses nonlinear programming with
   discontinuous derivatives (DNLP) to solve the optimal location and
   settings of OUPFC device to enable power system dispatcher to improve
   the power system operation. The optimization problem is modeled in
   General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) software using CONOPT solver.
   Furthermore, the results obtained by OUPFC are compared with those of
   the Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) device. The OUPFC is
   outperformed by UPFC in the power system operation from the economic and

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Centroid of general type-2 fuzzy set can be used as a measure of
   uncertainty in highly uncertain environments. Computing centroid of
   general type-2 fuzzy set has received an increasing research attention
   during recent years. Although computation complexity of such sets is
   higher than that of interval type-2 fuzzy sets, with the advent of new
   representation techniques, e.g. alpha-planes and z-Slices, computation
   efforts needed to deal with general type-2 fuzzy sets have decremented.
   A very first method to calculate the centroid of a general type-2 fuzzy
   set was to use Karnik-Mendel algorithm on each alpha-plane,
   independently. Because of the iterative nature of this method, running
   time in this approach is rather high. To tackle such a drawback, several
   emerging algorithms such as Sampling method, Centroid-Flow algorithm,
   and, recently, Monotone Centroid-Flow algorithm have been proposed. The
   aim of this paper is to present a new method to calculate centroid
   intervals of each alpha-plane, independently, while reducing convergence
   time compared with other algorithms like iterative use of Karnik-Mendel
   algorithm on each alpha-plane. The proposed approach is based on
   estimating an initial switch point for each alpha-plane. Exhaustive
   computations demonstrate that the proposed method is considerably faster
   than independent implementation of existing iterative methods on each
   alpha-plane. (C) 2015 Sharif University of Technology. All rights

Title = {{The impact of deep vein thrombosis in critically ill patients: a

Journal = {{BLOOD TRANSFUSION}},

Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{559-568}},
Abstract = {{Background. Critically ill patients appear to be at high risk of
   developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism during
   their stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, little is known
   about the clinical course of venous thromboembolism in the ICU setting.
   We therefore evaluated, through a systematic review of the literature,
   the available data on the impact of a diagnosis of DVT on hospital and
   ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality in critically
   ill patients. We also tried to determine whether currently adopted
   prophylactic measures need to be revised and improved in the ICU
   setting.
   Materials and methods. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched up to
   week 4 of June 2012. Two reviewers selected studies and extracted data.
   Pooled results are reported as relative risks and weighted mean
   differences and are presented with 95\% confidence intervals (CI).
   Results. Seven studies for a total of 1,783 patients were included. A
   diagnosis of DVT was frequent in these patients with a mean rate of
   12.7\% (95\% CI: 8.7-17.5\%). DVT patients had longer ICU and hospital
   stays compared to those without DVT (7.28 days; 95\% CI: 1.4-13.15; and
   11.2 days; 95\% CI: 3.82-18.63 days, respectively). The duration of
   mechanical ventilation was significantly increased in DVT patients
   (weighted mean difference: 4.85 days; 95\% CI: 2.07-7.63). DVT patients
   had a marginally significant increase in the risk of hospital mortality
   (relative risk 1.31; 95\% CI: 0.99-1.74; p=0.06), and a not
   statistically significant increase in the risk of ICU mortality (RR
   1.64; 95\% CI: 0.91-2.93; p=0.10).
   Conclusions. A diagnosis of DVT upon ICU admission appears to affect
   clinically important outcomes including duration of ICU and hospital
   stay and hospital mortality. Larger, prospective studies are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an investigation of the mode choice behavior of
   cross regional commuters in the greater Toronto and Hamilton area of
   Ontario, Canada. A survey of cross-regional intermodal passenger travel
   (called SCRIPT) was developed and conducted during the spring and the
   fall of 2014. SCRIPT collects data on respondents' revealed preference
   in daily commuting trips to pivot each respondent's mode choice stated
   preference experiment separately. An innovative multimodal trip planner
   tool was developed to generate feasible travel options for each stated
   preference experiment with information on household auto ownership
   level, proximity to transit, work start time, and total travel time from
   home to work, as well as predeveloped discrete choice models to identify
   access station locations of intermodal travel modes. The stated
   preference experiments were based on the D-efficient design technique.
   The survey used 1,203 randomly selected cross-regional commuters. The
   paper reports on a mode choice model estimated by the revealed
   preference data portion of the survey to verify the validity of the
   survey design, sampling procedure, and data quality. An empirical model
   provides insight into cross-regional commuters' mode choice behavior.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a framework for inferring activity travel given
   nearby land use information that can be obtained from a location-based
   social network (LBSN) such as Foursquare. The first component of the
   framework implements a generic method for acquiring land use data from
   LBSN services, which is a prerequisite for the inference algorithm.
   Three inference algorithms are suggested, and situations in which each
   algorithm might be a better fit are discussed. Finally, a case study is
   presented for activity inference applied to a data set collected in the
   greater Toronto and Hamilton area, Ontario, Canada, during the fall of
   2012. Results are encouraging and suggest that it is possible to infer
   daily activity travel automatically; this possibility could
   significantly reduce the burdens of personal travel surveys and allow
   for collection of long period travel diary data that is not easily
   achievable with traditional survey methods.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum key distribution (QKD) needs to close the big gap between theory
   and practice to be a suitable technology for achieving
   information-theoretic secure communications. Indeed, recent studies on
   side-channel attacks have exposed the vulnerabilities of QKD
   implementations against an eavesdropper who may try to attack both the
   source and the measurement device. Here, we review two potential
   approaches that, combined, could bring this goal closer:
   measurement-device-independent QKD and the loss-tolerant QKD protocol.
   The former removes all possible side-channels from the measurement
   apparatus and guarantees a high performance over long distances. The
   latter appears as a robust solution against typical source flaws and it
   offers similar key rates as those of standard QKD systems. Most
   importantly, the feasibility of both solutions has already been
   demonstrated in several lab and field-test experiments.}},

Title = {{Estimation of Base-Year Floor Space Data Comparison of Census-Based and
   Lidar-Geographic Information System Approaches}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2494}},
Pages = {{21-28}},
Abstract = {{Base-year floor space data are essential for integrated land use
   transport models. This information has traditionally been estimated on
   the basis of limited population or employment data provided by the
   census, with unknown accuracy. Advances in geographic information
   systems (GIS) and remote sensing technology enable the accuracy of this
   conventional method to be evaluated with geographic data of high
   precision. This study assessed the accuracy of the census-based approach
   in estimating base-year floor space data; the paper describes the use of
   a hybrid method that combines lidar and geographic vector data (referred
   to as the ``lidar-GIS method{''}) to develop a ground truth building
   floor space database for the City of Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada.
   A ground survey proved that the developed ground truth building data set
   provided highly accurate estimates of building heights, footprint areas,
   and therefore floor space. Through a case study, the floor space at the
   dissemination area level estimated with the traditional census-based
   method was compared with the floor space estimated with the lidar-GIS
   method for various land use categories. The results showed that for the
   residential floor space estimation, the average absolute percentage
   error of the census-based approach was 15\%. The accuracy of the
   conventional method was much lower for nonresidential land use
   categories, with average errors of 50\% or higher. These statistics
   indicate that the traditional census-based approach is unreliable and
   inaccurate for use in the estimation of base-year floor space and
   suggests that a method that incorporates the above-mentioned modern
   information technologies be used.}},

   Composite Indicator}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2533}},
Pages = {{91-99}},
Abstract = {{Reliability is cited as a key aspect of service quality, but many of the
   indicators in use today do not measure reliability from the user's
   perspective. A review of earlier work on transit user behavior concluded
   that the traveler's perspective of reliability was driven by punctuality
   in arriving at the destination, short waiting times at the origin stop,
   and consistent wait and travel times. Twenty indicators were assessed,
   but none were well suited to capturing all of these elements of
   reliability. A new measure, journey time buffer index (JTBI), was
   therefore proposed; the index used estimates of wait times at bus stops
   while capturing variability in wait and travel times that tended to
   increase the disutility of transit travel. Alternative formulations were
   developed for short and long headway service, and the new indicator was
   applied to the London Transit Commission's bus network in London,
   Ontario, Canada. This procedure demonstrated that the JTBI was better
   suited to identifying the factors contributing to unreliable service
   than metrics that focused on a single component of reliability. A linear
   regression analysis also highlighted that route length, stop spacing,
   time of day, route orientation relative to the city center, and
   passenger load all influenced reliability although the low adjusted R-2
   value of .298 showed that some major causes of reliability were not
   captured by the model.}},

Journal = {{DEMENTIA AND GERIATRIC COGNITIVE DISORDERS EXTRA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{492-502}},
Abstract = {{Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with selective
   attention impairments, which could contribute to cognitive and
   functional deficits. Selective attention can be explored through
   examination of novelty preference. Aims: In this study, we quantified
   novelty preference in AD patients by measuring visual scanning behaviour
   using an eye tracking paradigm. Methods: Mild-to-moderate AD patients
   and elderly controls viewed slides containing novel and repeated images
   simultaneously. The outcome measure was time spent on specific images,
   with novelty preference defined by greater relative fixation time (RFT)
   on novel versus repeated images. Cognitive status (Standardized
   Mini-Mental State Examination, SMMSE) and attention (Digit Span, DS)
   were also measured. Results: AD patients (age 79.2 +/- 6.7 years, SMMSE
   22.2 +/- 4.0, n = 41) and controls (age 76.2 +/- 6.4 years, SMMSE 28.1
   +/- 2.0, n = 24) were similar in age, education and sex. Compared with
   controls, AD patients had lower RFT on novel than on repeated images
   (F-1,F-63 = 11.18, p = 0.001). Further, reduced RFT was associated with
   lower scores on SMMSE (r(63) = 0.288, p = 0.020) and DS (r(63) = 0.269,
   p = 0.030). Within individuals, novelty preference was detected in
   92.3\% of patients and in 100\% of controls. Conclusion: These findings
   suggest that novelty preference, measured by visual scanning behaviour,
   can differentiate cognitively healthy and impaired people and may offer
   a nonverbal, less cognitively demanding method of assessing selective
   attention. (C) 2015 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Pages = {{106981-106988}},
Abstract = {{Supercritical fluid foaming technology has been investigated for use in
   silicone rubber foam production due to its many unique properties. The
   viscoelastic properties of silicone rubber play a vital role in the
   supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) foaming process. This paper
   investigated for the first time the effect of silica content, saturation
   temperature and pressure on the viscoelastic properties of silicone
   rubber compounds. Further, the cellular morphology of silicone rubber
   foams generated by scCO2 was investigated with rheological analysis,
   which will be helpful for uncovering the connection between the cellular

Abstract = {{Grab-bars and transfer poles are common sit-to-stand aids for mobility
   limited older adults. This study investigated differences in kinetics
   and kinematics to characterize the lower-limb strength and dynamic
   balance requirements across different pole configurations and positions
   in nine mobility limited older adults. Poles were varied by location
   (near and far) and configuration (single vertical pole, double vertical
   poles, vertical pole with a horizontal bar). Results indicated that the
   far pole condition resulted in increased trunk (p<0.001) and hip flexion
   (p<0.01 and < 0.0001 for contralateral and ipsilateral sides,
   respectively), and a reduced peak vertical force applied to the pole
   (p<0.001). Peak extension moments at the hip and knee were unchanged,
   and, therefore, pole position had no effect on task demands. Placing the
   pole unilaterally introduced a small kinetic asymmetry, which
   significantly increased peak knee extension moments on the ipsilateral
   side (p<0.05). Finally, dynamic balance was relatively unchanged across
   pole conditions. These findings offer novel insight into pole use and
   the effect of varying pole location and configuration in a sample of
   older adults with mobility impairment, and provide the basis for future
   work.}},

Title = {{Identification of the meta-instability stage via synergy of fault
   displacement: An experimental study based on the digital image
   correlation method}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85-86}},
Pages = {{216-224}},
Abstract = {{In stick-slip experiments modeling the occurrence of earthquakes, the
   meta-instability stage (MIS) is the process that occurs between the peak
   differential stress and the onset of sudden stress drop. The MIS is the
   final stage before a fault becomes unstable. Thus, identification of the
   MIS can help to assess the proximity of the fault to the earthquake
   critical time. A series of stick-slip experiments on a simulated
   strike-slip fault were conducted using a biaxial servo-controlled press
   machine. Digital images of the sample surface were obtained via a high
   speed camera and processed using a digital image correlation method for
   analysis of the fault displacement field. Two parameters, A and S, are
   defined based on fault displacement. A, the normalized length of local
   pre-slip areas identified by the strike-slip component of fault
   displacement, is the ratio of the total length of the local pre-slip
   areas to the length of the fault within the observed areas and
   quantifies the growth of local unstable areas along the fault. S, the
   normalized entropy of fault displacement directions, is derived from
   Shannon entropy and quantifies the disorder of fault displacement
   directions along the fault. Based on the fault displacement field of
   three stick-slip events under different loading rates, the experimental
   results show the following: (1) Both A and S can be expressed as power
   functions of the normalized time during the non-linearity stage and the
   MIS. The peak curvatures of A and S represent the onsets of the distinct
   increase of A and the distinct reduction of S, respectively. (2) During
   each stick-slip event, the fault evolves into the MIS soon after the
   curvatures of both A and S reach their peak values, which indicates that
   the MIS is a synergetic process from independent to cooperative behavior
   among various parts of a fault and can be approximately identified via
   the peak curvatures of A and S. A possible application of these
   experimental results to field conditions is provided. However, further
   validation is required via additional experiments and exercises. (C)

Abstract = {{A combination of high dielectric permittivity (epsilon') and low
   dielectric loss (tan delta) is required for charge storage applications.
   In percolative systems such as conductive polymer composites, however,
   obtaining high epsilon' and low tan delta is very challenging due to the
   sharp insulation-conduction transition near the threshold region. Due to
   the particular arrangement of conductive fillers induced by both foaming
   and injection molding processes, they may address this issue. Therefore,
   this work evaluates the application of foam injection molding process in
   fabricating polymer nanocomposites for energy storage.
   Polypropylene-multiwalled carbon nanotubes (PP-MWCNT) composites were
   prepared by melt mixing and foamed in an injection molding process.
   Electrical conductivity (sigma), epsilon' and tan delta were then
   characterized. Also, scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM
   and TEM) was used to investigate the carbon nanotube's arrangement as
   well as cellular morphology. The results showed that foam
   injection-molded composites exhibited highly superior dielectric
   properties to those of solid counterparts. For instance, foamed samples
   had epsilon'= 68.3 and tan delta = 0.05 (at 1.25 vol.\% MWCNT), as
   opposed to epsilon'= 17.8 and tan delta= 0.04 in solid samples (at 2.56
   vol.\% MWCNT). The results of this work reveal that high performance
   dielectric nanocomposites can be developed using foam injection molding
   technologies for charge storage applications.}},

Abstract = {{Medical imaging plays an important role in the field of healthcare
   industry both in clinical settings and in research and development. It
   is used in prevention, early detection of disease, in choosing the
   optimal treatment, during surgical interventions and monitoring of the
   treatment effects. Despite much advancement in the last few decades,
   rapid change on its technology development and variety of imaging
   parameters that differ with the manufacturer restrict its further
   development. Imaging phantom is a calibrating medium that is scanned or
   imaged in the field of medical imaging to evaluate, analyze and tune the
   performance of various imaging devices. A phantom used to evaluate an
   imaging device should respond in a similar manner to how human tissue
   and organs would act in that specific imaging modality. There has been
   many research on the phantom materials; however, there has been no
   attempt to study on the material that mimics the structure of lung or
   fibrous tissue. So with the need for development of gel with such
   structure, we tried to mimic this structure with aerogel. Silica
   aerogels have unique properties that include low density (0.003g/cm) and
   mesoporosity (pore size 2-50nm), with a high thermal insulation value
   (0.005W/mK) and high surface area (500-1200m(2)/g).] In this study, we
   cross-linked with di-isocyanate, which is a group in polyurethane to
   covalently bond the polymer to the surface of silica aerogel to enhance
   the mechanical properties. By formation of covalent bonds, the structure
   can be reinforced by widening the interparticle necks while minimally
   reducing porosity.}},

Abstract = {{Optimization of porous material microstructures can lead to the design
   of lightweight foams that can effectively withstand applied loads and
   mitigate damage. Functionally graded foams have shown several advantages
   in experimental studies, including tailorable fracture touglmess,
   ability to withstand over 50\% strain without a significant decrease in
   strength and tailorable density. An important aspect of the use of such
   functionally graded porous media (FGPM) in structural applications is
   their weight-saving potential. An accurate analysis tool can help in
   understanding the parameters that will be best suited for a given
   application. A higher order plate theory is being developed in this work
   that accounts for extensibility and parabolic transverse shear strain.
   The developed theory considers the coupling between principal modes of
   plate deformation which enables capturing the anisotropic and
   heterogeneous nature of FGPM. Pores size and shape is assumed to vary
   through the plate thickness and that being accounted for through
   homogenization techniques. The accuracy of the theory is being validated
   against experimental data and existing 3D elasticity solutions. The
   mechanical response to static stimulations was tested in the scope of
   local pore size/shape and overall growth rate through the plate
   thickness.}},

Abstract = {{Bead foaming technology with double crystal melting peak structure has
   been recognized as a promising method to produce low-density foams with
   complex geometries. During the molding stage of the bead foams, the
   double peak structure generates a strong bead-to-bead sintering and
   maintains the overall foam structure. During recent years, polylactide
   (PLA) bead foaming has been of the great interest of researchers due to
   its origin from renewable resources and biodegradability. However, due
   to the PLA's low melt strength and slow crystallization kinetics, the
   attempts have been limited to the manufacturing methods used for
   expanded polystyrene. In this study, for the first time, we developed
   microcellular PLA bead foams with double crystal melting peak structure.
   Microcellular PLA bead foams were produced with expansion ratios and
   average cell sizes ranging from 3 to 30-times and 350 nm to 15 mu m,
   respectively. The generated high melting temperature crystals during the
   saturation significantly affected the expansion ratio and cell density
   of the PLA bead foams by enhancing the PLA's poor melt strength and
   promoting heterogeneous cell nucleation around the crystals.}},

Abstract = {{Shape memory polymers (SMP) are a class of stimuli-responsive materials
   which are able to respond to external stimulus such as temperature and
   deformation by changing their shape, and return to their original shape
   upon reversal or removal of the external stimulus. Although SMP
   materials have been studied extensively and have been used in a wide
   range of applications such as medicine, aerospace, and robotics, only
   few studies have looked at the potential of designing multifunctional
   SMP foams and blends. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of a
   design of SMP foam materials and blends. The actuator construct will
   contain a core SMP epoxy and blend of polylactic acid and polyurethane.
   The effects of the processing parameters of shape memory polymer (SMP)
   foams on the shape memory effect (SME) were investigated. The solid
   state foaming technique was employed to obtain the desired foamed
   cellular structure. One particular point of interest is to understand
   how the processing parameters affect the SMP and its glass transition
   temperature (T-g). By correctly tailoring these parameters it is
   possible to modify the SMP to have an improved shape memory effect SME.}},

Abstract = {{It has been demonstrated that relatively low intensity ultrasound in
   combination with microbubbles is capable of inducing a vascular shutdown
   in preclinical tumor models, and that this can lead to growth
   inhibition. In previous reports we have shown that this effect can be
   coupled with anticancer agents to achieve potent antitumor effects, by a
   means that is not linked to increases in drug uptake. Work to date has
   been conducted with commercial agents such as Definity or experimental
   formulations with bubble size distributions designed for resonance at
   the exposure frequencies employed (0.5-3 MHz). Here we investigate the
   potential of an experimental agent comprised of micron to submicron
   sized bubbles to induce antivascular effects in tumors. Experiments were
   conducted with KHT sarcoma tumors initiated intramuscularly in the hind
   legs of C3H mice and grown to approximately 200 mm3 in size. Control and
   treated groups were evaluated (n=5-6/group), with ultrasound exposures
   conducted at 1 MHz with a peak negative pressure of 1.6 MPa. This
   experimental, lipid-encapsulated, perfluorobutane microbubble agent had
   a volume peak at approximately 1 micron. The agent was injected into
   mice with injection gas volume fractions matched to Definity doses, and
   monitored with a Philips L12-5 probe in contrast mode. Tumor tissue was
   harvested after a pre-sacrifice perfusion stain injection (DiOC7). Agent
   characterization experiments included frequency dependant attenuation
   measurements (1-40 MHz) and cavitation detection and analysis. The agent
   frequency response was such that insonations occurred well below the
   resonant frequency and exposures were at a level that produced wideband
   acoustic emissions associated with inertial cavitation. Rapid perfusion
   reductions were observed in the tumors after treatments as evidenced by
   perfusion staining and contrast imaging. The particular characteristics
   of micron-sized formulations may offer advantages in the context of
   clinical implementations compared to commercial bubbles with larger size
   distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Perfluorocarbon nanodroplets (PFC NDs) have been proposed as in situ
   microbubble precursors for cancer imaging and therapy. Unlike
   microbubbles that are purely intravascular agents, PFC NDs can
   accumulate in solid tumours from leaky tumour vasculature before their
   conversion to echogenic microbubbles by externally applied ultrasound.
   If anti-cancer drugs can be effectively incorporated into the PFC NDs,
   it may be possible to expand the use of PFC NDs towards the controlled
   in vivo delivery of high concentrations of toxic cancer drugs with high
   temporal and spatial precision to tumours. However, due to the
   hydrophobic and lipophobic characters of PFCs, the formation of both
   high quality nanoscale droplets and the efficient loading of drugs into
   PFC NDs remain a challenge. In this study, a lipophilic solvent that is
   co-miscible in both PFC and water is explored as a means to load
   lipophilic drug molecules into PFCs and as a way to produce high
   quality, monodisperse PFC agents on the nanometer size regime. Diethyl
   ether (DEE) was selected as the drug-loading and size-reducing solvent,
   and a fluorescent molecule, DiI, was selected as the lipophilic drug
   surrogate. Monodisperse, micron-scale precursor droplets were produced
   using standard microfluidics. After the removal of DEE, this method
   resulted in a similar to 5 fold reduction in size from the precursor
   droplets to monodisperse DiI-loaded PFC droplets. The successful loading
   of DiI into monodisperse PFC NDs suggests that this cosolvent method can
   be used to produce lipophilic anti-cancer drug-loaded PFC NDs for
   evaluation in US-mediated cancer therapy.}},

Title = {{The position and frequency of fluorine atoms changes the electron
   donor/acceptor properties of fluorophenoxy silicon phthalocyanines
   within organic photovoltaic devices}},

Abstract = {{In a previous study we have shown the first example of silicon
   phthalocyanines (SiPcs) applied within organic photovoltaic (OPV)
   devices. In that study we showed the electronic performance of a SiPc is
   significantly increased by replacing the axial chloride groups with
   pentafluoro phenoxy moieties. It was further demonstrated that
   bis(pentafluoro phenoxy) SiPc (F-10-SiPc) is best applied as an electron
   accepting material within a fullerene-free planar heterojunction (PHJ)
   OPV. Within this study we have synthesized a new series of fluorophenoxy
   silicon phthalocyanines ((XF)(2)-SiPc) whereby the frequency of the
   fluorine atoms on the fluorophenoxy groups was systematically reduced
   from 5. These relatively small changes resulted in small changes in
   UV-Vis absorption properties, thermal stability, electrochemical
   behavior, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy characteristics and
   solid state arrangement in both single crystals and in thin films
   obtained by thermal evaporation. Single crystal X-ray diffraction
   determined that all (XF)(2)-SiPcs have significantly enhanced pi-pi
   interactions compared with dichlorosilicon phthalocyanine (Cl-2-SiPc)
   and depending on the position and frequency of the fluorine atoms, the
   solid state arrangement varied significantly. The complete series of
   (XF)(2)-SiPcs were then introduced into PHJ OPVs as both electron
   accepting and electron donating materials when paired with pentacene,
   alpha-sexithiophene or C-60. It was found that depending on the
   structure of the (XF)(2)-SiPcs the most favourable role for the material
   would either be as an electron donating or electron accepting material
   and in most cases the (XF)(2)-SiPcs outperformed Cl-2-SiPc and
   F-10-SiPc. One material, (246F)(2)-SiPc, did however emerge as one
   material that has dual functionality. Unoptimized PHJ OPV devices were
   generally characterized with open circuit voltages (V-OC) as high as
   0.94 V and power conversion efficiencies >2.0\%. As only the second
   example of SiPcs being integrated into PHJ OPV devices, these results
   show that versatile phenoxylation chemistry can impact the application
   and performance and therefore also demonstrates great promise for this
   class of significantly understudied organic electronic materials.
   Finally these results give indications of the direction phenoxy-SiPc
   molecular design should take in order to potentially further improve
   their overall performance in PHJ OPV devices.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-level nanophotonic structure is a major goal in providing
   advanced optical functionalities as found in photonic crystals and
   metamaterials. A three-level nano-grating phase mask has been fabricated
   in an electron-beam resist (ma-N) to meet the requirement of holographic
   generation of a diamond-like 3D nanostructure in photoresist by a single
   exposure step. A 2D mask with 600 nm periodicity is presented for
   generating first order diffracted beams with a preferred pi/2 phase
   shift on the X-and Y-axes and with sufficient 1st order diffraction
   efficiency of 3.5\% at 800 nm wavelength for creating a 3D periodic
   nanostructure in SU-8 photoresist. The resulting 3D structure is
   anticipated to provide an 8\% complete photonic band gap (PBG) upon
   silicon inversion. A thin SiO2 layer was used to isolate the grating
   layers and multiple spin-coating steps served to planarize the final
   resist layer. A reversible soft coating (aquaSAVE) was introduced to
   enable SEM inspection and verification of each insulating grating layer.
   This e-beam lithographic method is extensible to assembling multiple
   layers of a nanophotonic structure.}},

Abstract = {{N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a chloramination disinfection
   by-product (DBP). Despite extensive research on NDMA occurrence and
   evaluation of formation potential from select precursors and in
   different matrices, less information exists on the kinetics of NDMA
   formation. A kinetic model is developed and parameterizered using the
   limited amount of previously published kinetic data involving addition
   of model compounds to pH buffered ultrapure water and/or surface waters
   containing organic matter. A simple second-order kinetic model was
   developed using a NDMA precursor concentration, based upon a measured
   maximum NDMA concentration as the initial precursor concentration, and
   measured monochloramine concentrations. The second order model was able
   to fit NDMA formation kinetics well by determining the best-fit apparent
   rate constant (k(app)), suggesting the model represents a common rate
   limiting step and/or an intermediate product. An associated reaction may
   exist during the transformation of a wide variety of precursors into
   NDMA. Values for k(app) ranged by approximately one-order of magnitude
   and were lower in the presence of natural organic matter (NOM), which
   may suggest that more reactive chloramine species or NDMA intermediate
   products are scavenged by NOM. Overall, the modeling suggests lines of
   future research to help elucidate and predict NDMA formation mechanisms
   such that strategies to control its formation could be applied during
   drinking water treatment.}},

   possible operations to enable: point to link, link to group and swipe to

Title = {{Rheology, thermal properties, and foaming behavior of high D-content
   polylactic acid/cellulose nanofiber composites}},
Journal = {{RSC Advances}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{111}},
Pages = {{91544-91557}},
Abstract = {{Amorphous polylactic acid (PLA)/cellulose nanofiber (CNF) composites
   were prepared using the solution casting method. We investigated the
   effects of the CNFs on the PLA's rheological and thermal properties and
   on its foaming behavior. The rheological measurements showed that the
   incorporated CNFs substantially increased the PLA's viscosity in a low
   frequency range. This was attributed to both the interaction between the
   PLA molecular chains and the CNFs and the entanglement of CNFs. A batch
   foaming visualization system showed that the CNFs were effective
   cell-nucleating agents, and that they suppressed cell coalescence during
   the foaming process. In solid-state batch foaming processes, the
   addition of CNFs led to higher cell densities and decreased cell sizes
   in the composite foams. As the CNF content was increased, the
   cell-nucleating power and the resultant cell density increased. The cell
   sizes became more uniform. The improved foam morphology was also
   attributed to the CO2- and the CNF-induced crystallization during the
   gas-saturation and foaming processes. Thermal and wide angle X-ray
   diffraction (WAXD) analyses showed that the presence of CNFs and CO2
   enhanced the PLA's crystallization kinetics. An amorphous grade of PLA
   with a 12\% D-content developed a high crystallinity of 21\% after CO2
   gas saturation. The formed crystals, especially those around the CNFs,
   promoted cell nucleation by local stress variations that were generated
   in the surrounding area. The crystals and CNFs also increased the PLA's
   viscosity, which restricted cell growth and reduced cell coalescence. On
   the other hand, due to increased stiffness, an excessive CNF content
   suppressed foaming.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in travel behavior near the Sheppard Subway Line in Toronto,

   initial mode shift was assessed through an analysis of bus boardings,
   subway platform counts, and traffic counts made between 2000 and 2012.
   Longitudinal changes in mode share were assessed with the use of transit
   survey data. For the first 6 years of operation, the Sheppard Subway
   Line produced more greenhouse gas (GHG) per passenger kilometer traveled
   (PKT) than the bus that it had replaced. A net GHG reduction of 66.4
   kilotons of CO2 equivalent was calculated but was wholly dependent on
   avoided car PKTs that may have been offset in their entirety by induced

Abstract = {{Much biomedical equipment consisting of or containing plastic polymer(s)
   must come into contact with blood - an interaction that, at the
   molecular level, may unfortunately prompt biological processes with
   potentially deleterious, short- or long-term effects such as thrombosis.
   In the present investigation, this problem is alleviated for poly(vinyl
   chloride) (PVC) through chemical surface modification with an ultrathin,
   monoethylene glycol-based coating - a transformation that is
   characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) supplemented
   by contact angle goniometry (CAG). Antithrombogenic properties are
   assessed through calculation (for the first 10 min, and after 60 min) of
   the surface coverage percentage due to platelet adhesion, aggregation
   and thrombus formation upon continuous exposure to
   fluorescently-labelled whole human blood. At all shear rates
   investigated (300, 900, and 1500 s(-1)), surface coverage decreases by >
   99\% with respect to bare PVC (10 min, short- term contact with blood).
   Most importantly, antithrombogenic performance is retained for
   longer-term exposure experiments (60 min), regardless of applied shear
   rate as well.}},

Title = {{Disaggregate Analysis of Relationships Between Commercial Vehicle
   Parking Citations, Parking Supply, and Parking Demand}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2478}},
Pages = {{28-34}},
Abstract = {{Over the past several decades, road space and curb space have become
   increasingly scarce in urban areas. Commercial vehicles are then forced
   to compete with passenger vehicles for this limited space; this
   situation leads to an increase in illegal commercial vehicle parking.
   Increased commercial vehicle parking causes increased congestion,
   reduced safety for other road users, and an increase in the cost of
   final goods and services. For appropriate policies to be selected to
   address this problem, the relationships between illegal commercial
   vehicle parking and the built environment must be better understood.
   This research aimed to quantify the relationships of illegal commercial
   vehicle parking, parking supply, and parking demand through the
   estimation of a distance-decay-weighted regression model. Data on
   commercial vehicle parking citations from 2012 for the City of Toronto,
   Ontario, Canada, are presented. This information was used together with
   employment data and a parking inventory to estimate the number of
   tickets issued by address. A distance-decay-weighted method was applied
   in an attempt to capture the spatial relationships between these
   variables. Results of this model showed that off-street parking
   facilities, such as loading bays, surface lots, and parking garages,
   were related to lower rates of illegal commercial vehicle parking,
   whereas higher business densities and the restriction of existing
   on-street parking spaces were related to increased illegal commercial
   vehicle parking. These results suggest that policies encouraging the
   creation of off-street loading facilities for commercial vehicles and
   making off-street parking more attractive for passenger vehicles may
   help reduce the incidence of illegal commercial vehicle parking.}},

Abstract = {{A family of five axial aryl-substituted boron subphthalocyanine (BsubPc)
   derivatives bearing a hydrido, methyl, methoxy, phenyl, or fluoro
   substituent at the para position of the aryl were synthesised from
   Br-BsubPc and the corresponding aryl Grignard reagent in moderate
   yields. The physicochemical characterisation of these derivatives gave
   similar absorption, photoluminescence, and cyclic voltammetry profiles
   and photoluminescence quantum yields, indicating that the nature of the
   substituent at the para position does not influence the basic
   photophysical properties of this generic class of BsubPcs. Conversely,
   the solid-state structural arrangement obtained from single crystals is
   highly dependent on the para substituent; for the non-polar hydrido,
   methyl, and phenyl substituents, only concave isoindole pi interactions
   are present. Substitution for the polar methoxy or fluoro ligand affords
   one-dimensional ribbons formed by convex p interactions, where these
   ribbons further interact through concave isoindole p interactions with
   the adjacent ribbon, creating an extended two-dimensional p network. On
   incorporation of the hydrido, methyl, and fluoro derivatives into
   organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, similar results and device metrics
   were obtained with the methyl and fluoro derivatives. Both, however,
   were significantly outperformed by the hydrido derivative. The
   uniqueness of the hydrido derivative is only realised once incorporated
   into OPVs as it shares the same basic physical properties as the other
   derivatives. Given these findings, we identify the hydrido derivative as
   the aryl-BsubPc with the most promise for future work in OPVs.}},

Abstract = {{Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common type of cancer worldwide
   and remains challenging for effective treatment due to the proximity to
   critical anatomical structures in the head and neck region, which
   increases the probability of toxicity from surgery and radiotherapy, and
   therefore emphasizes the importance of maximizing the targeted ablation.
   We have assessed the effectiveness of porphysome nanoparticles to
   enhance fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging of head and neck tumors
   in rabbit and hamster models. In addition, we evaluated the
   effectiveness of this agent for localized photothermal ablative therapy
   of head and neck tumors. We have demonstrated that porphysomes not only
   enabled fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging of buccal and tongue
   carcinomas, but also allowed for complete targeted ablation of these
   tumors. The supremacy of porphysome-enabled photothermal therapy over
   surgery to completely eradicate primary tumors and metastatic regional
   lymph node while sparing the adjacent critical structures' function has
   been demonstrated for the first time. This study represents a novel
   breakthrough that has the potential to revolutionize our approach to
   tumor diagnosis and treatment in head and neck cancer and beyond.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology has been developed to obtain a cubic structure of the
   mixed halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3-xClx that involves thermal annealing
   of a vacuum-deposited perovskite layer. In this process, a
   tetragonal-cubic transition of the mixed halide perovskite
   CH3NH3PbI3-xClx has been observed using a variety of characterization
   techniques, e.g., X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), and optical and Hall effect measurements. According to the XRD,
   the tetragonal structure of CH3NH3PbI3-xClx changed into the cubic phase
   when the temperature increased to above the transition temperature, at
   which point all iodine atoms move towards the central axis while PbI6
   rotates around the C-N bond. After annealing, the stable cubic structure
   of the mixed halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3-xClx has a smaller band gap
   and a better optical absorption than the original tetragonal structure.
   Meanwhile, the microstructure has shown an increase of grain size after
   annealing, which could be given the fastest mobility of 13.5 cm(2) V-1
   S-1, yielded from the Hall effect measurements. The potential benefits
   of the stable cubic structure and large grain size in the mixed halide
   perovskite CH3NH3PbI3-xClx are to improve the device performance of
   solar cells from the viewpoint of bandgap engineering and crystalline
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{The representation of events plays a key role in a wide range of
   Semantic Web applications, and several ontologies have been proposed to
   support this task. However, a review of existing event ontologies on the
   web reveals limited reasoning being done in their applications. To
   investigate this, we designed a set of reasoning problems (competency
   questions) aimed at providing a pragmatic assessment of the reasoning
   capabilities of three well-known Semantic Web event ontologies - SEM,
   The Event Ontology, and LODE. Using OWL and SWRL axiomatizations of the
   Process Specification Language (PSL) Ontology, we specify maximal
   extensions of the existing event ontologies. We then evaluate the
   resulting set of OWL and SWRL ontologies against our reasoning problems,
   using the results to both assess the abilities of existing Semantic Web
   event ontologies, and to explore the potential gains that may be
   achieved through additional axioms.}},

Abstract = {{Effective coagulation is essential to achieving drinking water treatment
   objectives when considering surface water. To minimize settled water
   turbidity, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been adopted to
   predict optimum alum and carbon dioxide dosages at the Elgin Area Water

   dioxide and alum dosages with correlation (R-2) values of 0.68 and 0.90,
   respectively. ANNs were also used to developed surface response plots to
   ease optimum selection of dosage. Trained ANNs were used to predict
   turbidity outcomes for a range of alum and carbon dioxide dosages and
   these were compared to historical data. Point-wise confidence intervals
   were obtained based on error and squared error values during the
   training process. The probability of the true value falling within the
   predicted interval ranged from 0.25 to 0.81 and the average interval
   width ranged from 0.15 to 0.62 NTU. Training an ANN using the squared
   error produced a larger average interval width, but better probability
   of a true prediction interval.}},

Abstract = {{One large-scale, 33-ft-span, simply supported Warren truss was tested to
   assess the performance of welds in rectangular hollow structural section

   truss, were designed to be weld-critical and sequentially failed by
   producing an axial force distribution with a point load, applied
   quasi-statically, to strategic panel points. The structural reliability
   (or safety index) of the existing AISC Specification formulas for the
   effective length of welds in rectangular HSS overlapped K-connections,
   in Table K4.1 of the 2010 AISC Specification for Structural Steel
   Buildings, was determined from the tests. The results indicate that
   these provisions are conservative; hence, a modification to the current
   requirements that limits the effective width of the transverse weld
   elements is proposed. The proposal establishes a more economical and yet
   still safe weld design method for rectangular HSS overlapped

Abstract = {{There is a growing need for analytical tools that can accurately model
   the behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) structures under extreme loads,
   particularly with respect to blast and impact. Current capabilities are
   almost entirely confined to hydrocodes (e.g., LS-DYNA) and such
   procedures have often met with limited success as they typically require
   complex micro-modeling representations of the structure, which is
   expensive in preparation and computation, and many of the commercial
   programs have shown deficiencies in their abilities to adequately
   capture cracked concrete response, particularly with regard to brittle
   shear-critical behavior.
   This paper presents the application of an alternative modeling procedure
   for RC slabs and shells subjected to blast and impact loads. The
   nonlinear finite element program employed uses a layered thick-shell
   element with RC constitutive modeling done in accordance with the
   formulations of the Disturbed Stress Field Model, a smeared rotating
   crack procedure shown to be capable of accurately capturing the behavior
   of shear-critical elements under conventional static loads. The smeared
   modeling approach differs from that typically employed by hydrocodes and
   results in simple model construction and reduced computation cost. The
   program is used to model the response of intermediate-scale RC and steel
   fiber-reinforced concrete slabs tested under repeated high-mass
   low-velocity impacts. Using simple finite element meshing techniques and
   material behavioral models requiring only basic user input, good
   correlation between the observed and modeled slab response was attained.
   The analyses provided high accuracy estimates of peak and residual
   displacements and successfully captured the punching shear failure modes
   observed experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{Polyurethane foams have very diverse mechanical properties making them

   been found to improve the compressive modulus and plateau stress of the
   foams. In this study elastic glass fibers were used to reinforce
   viscoelastic polyurethane foams; the compressive behaviour of the
   resulting foam was observed at various strain rates. At all strain
   rates, the fibers reinforced the foams, improving the modulus and
   plateau stress when compared to the properties of neat foam. A coupling
   between the fiber content and strain rate-dependence was observed in the
   modulus and plateau stress of the foams. Lastly despite the increase in
   strength and stiffness of the foams, addition of fibers did not reduce
   the energy absorption of the foams.}},

Title = {{High activity of aluminated bifunctional mesoporous silica nanoparticles
   for cumene hydrocracking and measurement of molar absorption coefficient}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Bifunctional mesoporous silica nanomaterials (MSN) with various Si/Al
   molar ratios of 7, 10, 20 and 50 in platinum supported (Pt/HAlMSN) were
   synthesized using sol-gel methods followed by post-synthesis methods.
   XRD and nitrogen sorption results confirmed the mesoporous structure
   with surface areas of 537-775 m(2) g(-1). Al-27 NMR spectroscopy
   confirmed aluminium loading with tetrahedral, pentahedral and octahedral
   structures. Pyridine adsorption IR results indicated that incorporation
   of aluminium led to the generation of strong Bronsted and Lewis acidic
   sites. Catalytic activity was investigated for cumene hydrocracking in a
   pulse microcatalytic reactor in the temperature range of 323-573 K which
   revealed that this activity depends on the number of Lewis and Bronsted
   sites. The high yield of cumene conversion increased from Si/Al molar
   ratios of 50 to 10 and decreased for the Si/Al molar ratio of 7 due to
   the presence of pentahedral Al and/or inactive tetrahedral Al atoms in
   Pt/HAlMSN-7. The high selectivity of a-methylstyrene showed the
   important role of Lewis acid sites in these bifunctional catalysts. In
   spite of the coke formation in the Pt/HAlMSN catalysts, reactivation
   recovered the activity of the catalysts after 100 h of reaction. The
   molar absorption coefficients of Pt/HAlMSN were measured using pyridine
   followed by water adsorption monitored by FTIR.}},

Title = {{Field evaluation of five volatile organic compound measurement
   techniques: Implications for green building decision making}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{67-79}},
Abstract = {{Measurements of volatile organic compounds can be necessary to ensure
   healthy indoor environments. Many methods exist to collect and analyze
   volatile organic compounds, and each technique is associated with
   characteristic issues that affect the identification and quantification
   of some volatile organic compounds. In this study, simultaneous samples
   of volatile organic compounds were collected during 30 test visits in 14
   retail stores. Time-integrated measurements were made using Summa
   canisters, Tenax-GR sorbent tubes, and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine tubes.
   Time-resolved measurements were collected using photoionization
   detectors and colorimetric formaldehyde multimode monitors. Sampling
   with Summa canisters is less field intensive than with sorbent tubes;
   however, samples collected using Tenax-GR sorbent tubes indicated more
   possible exceedances of health guidelines compared to Summa canister
   samples. Photoionization detector total volatile organic compound
   concentrations were not directly correlated with Summa canister results
   even after correction for differential response to different volatile
   organic compounds. Formaldehyde monitor results were strongly correlated
   with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine tube results for formaldehyde, and the
   two sampling techniques agreed on all exceedances of the National
   Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) chronic recommended
   exposure limit (16 ppb) but not on exceedances of the stricter Office of
   Environmental Health Hazard Assessment chronic recommended exposure
   limit (7.3 ppb) at two stores. The formaldehyde monitor showed promising
   characteristics, supporting its further consideration as an indicator to
   control ventilation and/or environmental parameters in buildings where
   formaldehyde concentrations are of concern. The variation in results
   from various volatile organic compound sampling approaches can lead to
   different compliance levels with green building standards for a single
   building.}},

Abstract = {{How to improve placement accuracy of needle insertion into liver tissue
   is of paramount interest to physicians. A robot-assisted system was
   developed to experimentally demonstrate its advantages in needle
   insertion surgeries. Experiments of needle insertion into porcine liver
   tissue were performed with conic tip needle (diameter 8 mm) and bevel
   tip needle (diameter 1.5 mm) in this study. Manual operation was
   designed to compare the performance of the presented robot-assisted
   system. The real-time force curves show outstanding advantages of
   robot-assisted operation in improving the controllability and stability
   of needle insertion process by comparing manual operation. The
   statistics of maximum force and average force further demonstrates
   robot-assisted operation causes less oscillation. The difference of
   liver deformation created by manual operation and robot-assisted
   operation is very low, 1 mm for average deformation and 2 mm for maximum
   deformation. To conclude, the presented robot-assisted system can
   improve placement accuracy of needle by stably control insertion
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Nanofibrillar supramolecular hydrogels are hierarchical structures
   formed by physical association of high-aspect-ratio nanoscale building
   blocks, each containing many molecules held together via supramolecular

   driving forces involved in the formation of nanofibrillar structures
   include hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic forces, forces of electrostatic
   origin, and guest host interactions. Nanofibrillar hydrogels are formed
   by biopolymers such as proteins and polysaccharides, and by synthetic
   supramolecular units such as cylindrical micelles of block copolymers
   and peptide amphiphiles. In the present review, we discuss the
   hierarchical assembly of nanofibrillar hydrogels, give examples of
   hydrogels formed by the most important groups of polymers, discuss
   structure property relationships of these nanofibrillar hydrogels, and
   review their current and potential applications in the fields of

Abstract = {{Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of dissolved air flotation

   flow layers at the top of the separation zone) and its impact on
   improved DAF efficiency. However, there has been a lack of experimental
   validation of CFD predictions, especially in the presence of solid
   particles. In this work, for the first time, both two-phase (air-water)
   and three-phase (air-water-solid particles) CFD models were evaluated at
   pilot scale using measurements of residence time distribution, bubble
   layer position and bubble-particle contact efficiency. The pilot-scale
   results confirmed the accuracy of the CFD model for both two-phase and
   three-phase flows, but showed that the accuracy of the three-phase CFD
   model would partly depend on the estimation of bubble-particle
   attachment efficiency.}},

Title = {{Plume-based analysis of vehicle fleet air pollutant emissions and the
   contribution from high emitters}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{3263-3275}},
Abstract = {{An automated identification and integration method has been developed
   for in-use vehicle emissions under real-world conditions. This technique
   was applied to high-time-resolution air pollutant measurements of in-use
   vehicle emissions performed under real-world conditions at a near-road
   monitoring station in Toronto, Canada, during four seasons, through
   month-long campaigns in 2013-2014. Based on carbon dioxide measurements,
   over 100 000 vehicle-related plumes were automatically identified and
   fuel-based emission factors for nitrogen oxides; carbon monoxide;
   particle number; black carbon; benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and
   xylenes (BTEX); and methanol were determined for each plume. Thus the
   automated identification enabled the measurement of an unprecedented
   number of plumes and pollutants over an extended duration. Emission
   factors for volatile organic compounds were also measured roadside for
   the first time using a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass
   spectrometer; this instrument provided the time resolution required for
   the plume capture technique. Mean emission factors were characteristic
   of the light-duty gasoline-dominated vehicle fleet present at the
   measurement site, with mean black carbon and particle number emission
   factors of 35 mg kg fuel(-1) and 7.5 x 10(14) \# kg fuel(-1),
   respectively. The use of the plume-by-plume analysis enabled isolation
   of vehicle emissions, and the elucidation of co-emitted pollutants from
   similar vehicle types, variability of emissions across the fleet, and
   the relative contribution from heavy emitters. It was found that a small
   proportion of the fleet (<25 \%) contributed significantly to total
   fleet emissions: 100, 100, 81, and 77\% for black carbon, carbon
   monoxide, BTEX, and particle number, respectively. Emission factors of a
   single pollutant may help classify a vehicle as a high emitter; however,
   regulatory strategies to more efficiently target multi-pollutant
   mixtures may be better developed by considering the co-emitted
   pollutants as well.}},

Title = {{Localizing Wireless Sensors with Diverse Granularities in Wireless
   Sensor Networks}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{To obtain accurate location information of individual sensor nodes is of
   vital importance in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), especially for
   objective tracking applications. However, it is challenging to acquire
   fine-grained localization accuracy because of resource constraints of
   sensor nodes, unreliable wireless communication, and cost. Moreover,
   heterogeneous characteristics of both sensor nodes and applications make
   this problem even harder to solve. In this paper, we propose NLMR, a
   novel on-demand node localization technology based on multiresolution
   model. NLMR comprises three phases: (1) subregion classification, which
   categorizes regions into subregions with either uniform node deployment
   or nonuniform node deployment; (2) multiresolution model construction,
   which creates a multiresolution model that caters for diverse
   localization granularity; (3) node localization, which allows the
   control center to estimate the locations of sensor nodes in a
   centralized manner. Our analysis and simulation results demonstrate the
   performance of NLMR and verify that our scheme can provide diverse
   localization granularity with high probability.}},

   that have superb sensitivity for electroanalysis. Here we report the
   integration of NMEs with the versatile fluid-handling system digital
   microfluidics (DMF), for eventual application to distributed diagnostics
   outside of the laboratory. In the new methods reported here, indium tin
   oxide DMF top plates were modified to include Au NMEs as well as counter
   and pseudoreference electrodes. The new system was observed to
   outperform planar sensing electrodes of the type that are typically
   integrated with DMF. A rubella virus (RV) IgG immunoassay was developed
   to evaluate the diagnostic potential for the new system, relying on
   magnetic microparticles coated with RV particles and analysis by
   differential pulse voltammetry. The limit of detection of the assay
   (0.07 IU mL(-1)) was >100x below the World Health Organization defined
   cut-off for rubella immunity. The sensitivity of the integrated device
   and its small size suggest future utility for distributed diagnostics.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that information will play an important role in
   enhancing emerging power system operation. However, questions naturally
   arise as to when the increased data-dependence may be considered
   excessive. Two practical considerations emerge: 1) communications and
   computational overhead, in which redundant and irrelevant information
   acquisition and use results in heavy computational burden with limited
   performance return, and 2) increasing risks of cyber attack whereby
   indiscriminate cyber-dependence and -connectivity increases attack scope
   and impact. In this chapter, we present a hierarchical cyber-physical
   framework of power system operation based on flocking theory in the
   context of the smart grid stability problem. We study strategies to
   harness an appropriate degree of cyber technology by effectively
   leveraging physical couplings. Our formulation enables the
   identification of large-scale distributed control strategies for robust
   power grid operation. Furthermore, our formulation also enables a novel
   witness-based cyber-physical protocol whereby physical coherence is
   leveraged to probe and identify phasor measurement unit data corruption
   and estimate the true information values for attack mitigation.}},

Title = {{An assessment of the utility of LiDAR data in extracting base-year
   floorspace and a comparison with the census-based approach}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},

Pages = {{708-729}},
Abstract = {{A literature review indicates that most integrated land-use transport
   models (ILUTMs) estimate base-year floorspace data according to limited
   population and employment data provided by the census and, in general,
   the accuracy is unknown. This paper assesses the utility of airborne
   Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) technology as a valuable tool for
   extracting base-year floorspace using the following three datasets: a
   geographic vector building footprint layer, a LiDAR dataset, and field
   survey data for the south side of the City of Fredericton, Canada. It is
   found through a statistical comparison with the results from the field
   survey that LiDAR data can be used to extract buildings and estimate
   floorspace with a good degree of accuracy. Further, two base-year
   floorspace estimation methods, one based on the LiDAR data and the other
   on census data, are compared. In general, our results show that the
   traditional census-based approach may not be reliable for estimating
   base-year floorspace. Using the extracted floorspace from the LiDAR data
   as the basis, for residential floorspace estimation the average absolute
   percentage errors (APE) of the census-based approach is 16\% and the
   95th percentile APE is 34\%. On the other hand, for employment
   floorspace estimation, the accuracy of the census-based approach is even
   lower, with average errors of 50\% or higher and the 95th percentile
   APEs as high as 163\% up to 400\% for several land-use categories. All
   the above statistics indicate that the traditional census-based approach
   is unreliable and inaccurate for modelers and planners to prepare their
   base-year floorspace, and therefore suggest a better way be explored.
   Study results clearly show the utility of LiDAR data and imply that it
   can be used as a powerful add-on for ILUTMs in general.}},

Title = {{Size reduction of cosolvent-infused microbubbles to form acoustically
   responsive monodisperse perfluorocarbon nanodroplets}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{3581-3590}},
Abstract = {{Perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanodroplet agents are exciting new biomaterials
   that can be remotely vapourized by ultrasound or light to change into
   micron-scale gas bubbles in situ. After PFC nanodroplet vapourization,
   the micron-scale gas bubble can interact strongly with ultrasound
   radiation, such that the bubbles can be used for cancer imaging and
   therapy. For these phase-change agents to be useful, however, PFC
   nanodroplets must be produced in the range of 100 to 400 nm in diameter
   with high size control and monodispersity, restrictions that remain a
   challenge. Here, we address this challenge by taking advantage of the
   size control offered by microfluidics, in combination with the size
   reduction provided by cosolvent-infused PFC bubbles through both
   condensation and cosolvent dissolution. In this approach, PFC bubbles
   with a high percentage of cosolvent (in this study, diethyl ether, DEE)
   are produced using microfluidics at a temperature above the boiling
   point. After synthesis, these bubbles become much smaller through both
   condensation of the gas into liquid droplets and from dissolution of the
   DEE into the continuous phase. This approach demonstrates that
   monodisperse, cosolvent-incorporated PFC bubbles can directly form
   monodisperse PFC nanodroplets a factor of 24 times smaller than the
   precursor bubbles. We also demonstrate that these nanoscale droplets can
   be converted to echogenic microbubbles after exposure to ultrasound,
   showing that these PFC nanodroplets are viable for the in situ
   production of ultrasound contrast agents. We show that this system can
   overcome the minimum droplet size limit of standard microfluidics, and
   is a powerful new tool for generating monodisperse, PFC phase-change
   ultrasound contrast agents for treating and imaging cancer.}},

Title = {{Investigating Moorella thermoacetica metabolism with a genome-scale
   constraint-based metabolic model}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{869-882}},
Abstract = {{Moorella thermoacetica is a strictly anaerobic, endospore-forming, and
   metabolically versatile acetogenic bacterium capable of conserving
   energy by both autotrophic (acetogenesis) and heterotrophic
   (homoacetogenesis) modes of metabolism. Its metabolic diversity and the
   ability to efficiently convert a wide range of compounds, including
   syngas (CO + H-2) into acetyl-CoA have made this thermophilic bacterium
   a promising host for industrial biotechnology applications. However,
   lack of detailed information on M. thermoacetica's metabolism is a major
   impediment to its use as a microbial cell factory. In order to overcome
   this issue, a genome-scale constraint-based metabolic model of Moorella
   thermoacetica, iAI558, has been developed using its genome sequence and
   physiological data from published literature. The reconstructed
   metabolic network of M. thermoacetica comprises 558 metabolic genes, 705
   biochemical reactions, and 698 metabolites. Of the total 705 model
   reactions, 680 are gene-associated while the rest are non-gene
   associated reactions. The model, in addition to simulating both
   autotrophic and heterotrophic growth of M. thermoacetica, revealed
   degeneracy in its TCA-cycle, a common characteristic of anaerobic
   metabolism. Furthermore, the model helped elucidate the poorly
   understood energy conservation mechanism of M. thermoacetica during
   autotrophy. Thus, in addition to generating experimentally testable
   hypotheses regarding its physiology, such a detailed model will
   facilitate rapid strain designing and metabolic engineering of M.
   thermoacetica for industrial applications.}},

Title = {{Sub-optimal phenotypes of double-knockout mutants of Escherichia coli
   depend on the order of gene deletions}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{930-939}},
Abstract = {{Metabolic networks are characterized by multiple redundant reactions
   that do not have a clear biological function. The redundancies in the
   metabolic networks are implicated in adaptation to random mutations and
   survival under different environmental conditions. Reactions that are
   not active under wild-type growth conditions, but get transiently
   activated after a mutation event such as gene deletion are known as
   latent reactions. Characterization of multiple-gene knockout mutants can
   identify the physiological roles of latent reactions. In this study, we
   characterized double-gene deletion mutants of E. coli with the aim of
   investigating the sub-optimal physiology of the mutants and the possible
   roles of latent reactions. Specifically, we investigated the effects of
   the deletion of the glyoxylate-shunt gene aceA (encoding a latent
   reaction enzyme, isocitrate lyase) on the growth characteristics of the
   mutant E. coli Delta pgi. The deletion of aceA reduced the growth rate
   of E. coli Delta pgi, indicating that the activation of the glyoxylate
   shunt plays an important role in adaptation of the mutant E. coli Delta
   pgi when no other latent reactions are concurrently inactivated. We also
   investigated the effect of the order of the gene deletions on the growth
   rates and substrate uptake rates of the double-gene deletion mutants.
   The results indicate that the order in which genes are deleted
   determines the phenotype of the mutants during the sub-optimal growth
   phase. To elucidate the mechanism behind the difference between the
   observed phenotypes, we carried out transcriptomic analysis and
   constraint-based modeling of the mutants. Transcriptomic analysis showed
   differential expression of the gene aceK (encoding the protein
   isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase) involved in controlling the isocitrate
   flux through the TCA cycle and the glyoxylate shunt. Higher acetate
   production in the E. coli Delta aceA(1) Delta pgi(2) mutant was
   consistent with the increased aceK expression, which limits the TCA
   cycle flux and causes acetate production via overflow metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Inert gas shrouding is a common practice in tundish metallurgy and has
   manifold benefits. However, there are a few detrimental aspects
   associated with it, and one of them is the formation of an exposed `eye'
   around the ladle shroud which results in higher heat losses, and more
   importantly re-oxidation of the liquid steel and inclusion formation.
   Hence, it is essential to gain proper insights about the formation, and
   evolution of slag `eye's in tundishes so as to improve the operations,
   and enhance liquid metal quality. In the present work, the behavior of
   slag `eye' in tundishes have been simulated using the finite volume
   based program ANSYS-FLUENT 15. The mathematical modeling was performed
   using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method, and discrete phase method,
   coupled with the standard k-epsilon turbulence model. The predictions
   from mathematical modeling were validated against one-third scale water
   model experiments. Although the present numerical results over-predicted
   the experimental results by 17\%, they are well within reasonable limits
   considering the complexity, and stochastic nature of the problem.}},

Abstract = {{The morphology and surface characteristics of manganese dioxide (MnO2)
   formed in situ, which was prepared through the oxidation of MnSO4 using
   KMnO4, were studied. The effects of factors including the form of MnO2,
   dosage, pH, dosing sequence of in situ MnO2 on the enhanced coagulation
   were systematically evaluated. The results of analysis by the UV254 and
   permanganate index CODMn methods indicated that humic acid removal
   increased from 9.2 and 2.5\% to 55.0 and 38.9\%, when 10 mg/L of the in
   situ MnO2 was added in the presence of 2 mg/L of polyaluminum sulfate.
   The studies of orthogonal experiment revealed that coagulation was most
   affected by the pH, whereas the dosage of in situ MnO2 and slow stirring
   duration exhibited a weaker effect. At a pH value of 4.0, in situ MnO2
   dosage of 10 mg/L, slow stir over 40 min, and the total solids content
   was 20 mg/L, the humic acid removal by UV254 and CODMn methods reached
   71.2 and 61.2\%. These results indicated that the presence of in situ

Title = {{Heterogeneous Surface Wear Models for the Prediction of the Specific

Journal = {{POLYMERS \& POLYMER COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{359-367}},
Abstract = {{Heterogeneous surface wear (HSW) models have been derived to predict the
   specific wear rates of woven carbon fibre reinforced epoxy composite
   materials. The specific wear rates of unidirectional carbon fibre/epoxy
   composites, with fibres orientated both parallel and antiparallel to the
   direction of sliding, are used as input variables. The first model (EW
   mode) is based on an assumption of uniform thickness reduction during
   wear, but uneven surface pressure. The second model (EP mode) is based
   on an assumption of even surface pressure throughout the test. The
   specific wear rates of plain and 5HS woven composite panels were
   measured to validate the accuracy of the models. It was found that the
   EW model was able to accurately predict the specific wear rates of the
   two types of woven composites under mild abrasive conditions (120 grit
   sandpaper). However, under more severe abrasive conditions (36 grit
   sandpaper), the woven panels exhibited a new wear mechanism caused by
   tearing of the out-of-plane fibres at the crossover points of warp and
   weft fibres. This mechanism caused both models to under-predict the
   specific wear rates of the woven composites in severe abrasive
   conditions. However, the EW model can be used with confidence under less
   abrasive conditions, where the asperities do not have significant
   interactions with the out of plane fibres.}},

Abstract = {{Power source is critical to achieve independent and autonomous
   operations of electronic mobile devices. The vibration-based energy
   harvesting is extensively studied recently, and recognized as a
   promising technology to realize inexhaustible power supply for
   small-scale electronics. Among various approaches, the piezoelectric
   energy harvesting has gained the most attention due to its high
   conversion efficiency and simple configurations. However, most of
   piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) to date are based on bending-beam
   structures and can only generate limited power with a narrow working
   bandwidth. The insufficient electric output has greatly impeded their
   practical applications. In this paper, we present an innovative lead
   zirconate titanate (PZT) energy harvester, named high-efficiency
   compressive-mode piezoelectric energy harvester (HC-PEH), to enhance the
   performance of energy harvesters. A theoretical model was developed
   analytically, and solved numerically to study the nonlinear
   characteristics of the HC-PEH. The results estimated by the developed
   model agree well with the experimental data from the fabricated
   prototype. The HC-PEH shows strong nonlinear responses, favorable
   working bandwidth and superior power output. Under a weak excitation of
   0.3 g (g = 9.8 m/s(2)), a maximum power output 30 mW is generated at 22
   Hz, which is about ten times better than current energy harvesters. The
   HC-PEH demonstrates the capability of generating enough power for most
   of wireless sensors.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{60}},
Pages = {{12000-12003}},
Abstract = {{Despite widespread clinical use, delivery of taxane chemotherapeutics
   remains a challenge due to poor solubility and lack of selectively.
   Polymeric nanomicelle strategies have been pursued to overcome these
   issues; however current formulations are often limited by low drug
   loading and poor serum stability. To achieve a drug delivery system that
   addresses these issues,
   poly(D,L-lactide-co-2-methyl-2-carboxytrimethylene
   carbonate)-g-poly(ethylene glycol) was covalently modified with the
   taxol binding peptide - a peptide from the beta-tubulin-taxane binding
   site. This modification resulted in drug loadings five times higher than
   unmodified polymers, which is significantly higher than typical
   hydrophobic modifications, including with benzyl and docetaxel
   functionalization. Unlike many formulations with high drug loading,
   these nanomicelles were stable in serum for up to 24 h and maintained
   docetaxel cytotoxicity. By incorporating the taxane binding peptide into
   the polymer chemistry, a new twist was applied to an old problem, which
   is broadly applicable to other polymeric micelle systems and
   drug-peptide combinations in general.}},

   study for pesticides}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES \& IMPACTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1228-1237}},
Abstract = {{The main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a
   model for simulating the uptake of various pesticides on passive air
   samplers (PAS). From 2006-2007 a series of PAS using XAD-resin were
   deployed at Egbert, a rural agricultural site in southern Ontario,
   Canada, to measure the uptake of pesticides for time periods ranging
   from two months to one year. A continuous increase in sequestered
   amounts was observed for most pesticides, except for trifluralin and
   pendimethalin, which could conceivably be subject to substantial
   degradation inside the sampler. Continuous low-volume active air samples
   taken during the same period, along with data on weather conditions,
   allowed for the simulation of the uptake of the pesticides using the
   model (PAS-SIM). The modelled accumulation of pesticides on the PAS over
   the deployment period was in good agreement with the experimental data
   in most cases (i.e., within a factor of two) providing insight into the
   uptake kinetics of this type of sampler in the field. Passive sampling
   rates (PSR, m(3) d(-1)) were determined from the empirical data
   generated for this study using three different methods and compared with
   the PSRs generated by the model. Overall, the PAS-SIM model, which is
   capable of accounting for the influence of temperature and wind
   variations on PSRs, provided reasonable results that range between the
   three empirical approaches employed and well-established literature
   values. Further evaluation and application of the PAS-SIM model to
   explore the potential spatial and temporal variability in PAS uptake
   kinetics is warranted, particularly for established monitoring sites
   where detailed meteorological data are more likely to be available.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{3116-3124}},
Abstract = {{Microalgal biofuel is an emerging sustainable energy resource.
   Photosynthetic growth is heavily dependent on irradiance, therefore
   photobioreactor design optimization requires comprehensive screening of
   irradiance variables, such as intensity, time variance and spectral
   composition. Here we present a microfluidic irradiance assay which
   leverages liquid crystal display technology to provide multiplexed
   screening of irradiance conditions on growth. An array of 238
   microreactors are operated in parallel with identical chemical
   environments. The approach is demonstrated by performing three
   irradiance assays. The first assay evaluates the effect of intensity on
   growth, quantifying saturating intensity. The second assay quantifies
   the influence of time-varied intensity and the threshold frequency for
   growth. Lastly, the coupled influence of red-blue spectral composition
   and intensity is assessed. Each multiplexed assay is completed within
   three days. In contrast, completing the same number of experiments using
   conventional incubation flasks would require several years. Not only
   does our approach enable more rapid screening, but the short optical
   path avoids self-shading issues inherent to flask based systems.}},

Abstract = {{Sickle cell trait (SCT) is a condition in which an individual inherits
   one sickle hemoglobin gene (HbS) and one normal beta hemoglobin gene
   (HbA). It has been hypothesized that under extreme physical stress, the
   compromised mechanical properties of the red blood cells (RBCs) may be
   the underlying mechanism of clinical complications of sickle cell trait
   individuals. However, whether sickle cell trait (SCT) should be treated
   as physiologically normal remains controversial. In this work, the
   mechanical properties (i.e., shear modulus and viscosity) of individual
   RBCs were quantified using a microsystem capable of precisely
   controlling the oxygen level of RBCs' microenvironment. Individual RBCs
   were deformed under shear stress. After the release of shear stress, the
   dynamic cell recovery process was captured and analyzed to extract the
   mechanical properties of single RBCs. The results demonstrate that RBCs
   from sickle cell trait individuals are inherently stiffer and more
   viscous than normal RBCs from healthy donors, but oxygen level
   variations do not alter their mechanical properties or morphology.}},

Abstract = {{The potential application of fluorescence spectroscopy for monitoring of
   organic matter concentration and character at four water treatment
   facilities was investigated. Results are presented showing impacts on
   natural organic matter (NOM) due to intake location on the same water
   body and from individual unit processes including ozonation,
   granular-activated carbon filtration, and coagulation/ flocculation. For
   validation and comparison of fluorescence methods, organic matter was
   quantified and characterized using liquid chromatography-organic carbon
   detection (LC-OCD). Principal component analysis (PCA) and parallel
   factors analysis were used for dimensionality reduction and to represent
   individual organic components observed through fluorescence
   excitation-emission matrices. Fluorescence results generally agreed with
   LC-OCD characterization, indicating that complete treatment reduced
   organic concentrations and preferential removal of humic-like material
   was associated with coagulation/ flocculation. PCA results indicated
   higher concentrations of humiclike material at the Island water
   treatment plant intake that was not well reduced by inline polyaluminum
   chloride coagulation and direct filtration. Through fluorescence
   spectroscopy, ozonation increased Rayleigh scattering, which is
   correlated to small colloidal/ particulate concentrations. Full-scale
   results from four water treatment plants presented demonstrate that
   fluorescence methods can characterize NOM, providing similar
   identification of trends to LC-OCD, with possible online application and
   use in real-time water treatment process control.}},

Title = {{Campus sustainability initiatives and performance: do they correlate?}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{474-490}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to test the hypothesis that there
   are correlations between campus sustainability initiatives and
   environmental performance, as measured by resource consumption and waste
   generation performance metrics. Institutions of higher education would
   like to imply that their campus sustainability initiatives are good
   proxies for their environmental performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using data reported through the
   Association for the Advancement in Higher Education's Sustainability
   Tracking and Rating System (AASHE STARS) framework, a series of
   univariate multiple linear regression models were constructed to test
   for correlations between energy, greenhouse gas (GHG), water and waste
   performance metrics, and credit points awarded to institutions for
   various campus sustainability initiatives.
   Findings - There are very limited correlations between institutional
   environmental performance and adoption of campus sustainability
   initiatives, be they targeted operational or coordination and planning
   best practices, or curricular, co-curricular or research activities.
   Conversely, there are strong correlations between environmental
   performance and campus characteristics, namely, institution type and
   climate zone.
   Practical implications - Institutional decision makers should not assume
   that implementing best practices given credit by AASHE STARS will lead
   to improved environmental performance. Those assessing institutional
   sustainability should be wary of institutions who cite initiatives to
   imply a certain level of environmental performance or performance
   improvement.
   Originality/value - This is the first paper to use data reported through
   the AASHE STARS framework to assess correlations between campus
   initiatives and environmental performance. It extends beyond previous
   research by considering energy, water and waste performance metrics in
   addition to GHG emissions, and it considers campus sustainability
   initiatives in addition to campus characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{This talk will review and compare the different optofluidic techniques
   for enhancing the retrieved Raman signal of nanomaterials in liquids and
   aerosols. Recent progress on this front utilizing optofluidics such as

   spectroscopy will be also reviewed. Challenges and future opportunities
   to advance optofluidics-assisted Raman spectroscopy that are carried out
   using portable Raman spectrometers and controlled using handheld
   controllers such as mobile phones will be presented. As an example, a
   detailed, non-destructive characterization of CdTe nanoparticles using
   Raman spectroscopy using concentrations of 2 mg/mL, will be highlighted.
   Our platform allows clear vibrational modes corresponding to the
   structure and interactions of the QDs to be observed. These vibrational
   modes include those of the CdTe core, Te defects, CdSTe interface, thiol
   agent and carboxylate-metal complexes. These modes are correlated with
   the crystallinity of the QD core, interfacial structure formed upon
   stabilization, QD-thiol interaction mechanisms, water solubility of the
   QDs and their potential bio-conjugation abilities.}},

Title = {{Uncertainty-based MDO for aircraft conceptual design}},
Journal = {{AIRCRAFT ENGINEERING AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{345-356}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the consideration of
   uncertainty from analysis modules for aircraft conceptual design by
   implementing uncertainty-based design optimization methods.
   Reliability-Based Design Optimization (RBDO), Possibility-Based Design
   Optimization (PBDO) and Robust Design Optimization (RDO) methods were
   developed to handle uncertainties of design optimization. The RBDO
   method is found suitable for uncertain parameters when sufficient
   information is available. On the other hand, the PBDO method is proposed
   when uncertain parameters have insufficient information. The RDO method
   can apply to both cases. The RBDO, PBDO and RDO methods were considered
   with the Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) method to generate
   conservative design results when low fidelity analysis tools are used.
   Design/methodology/approach - Methods combining MDO with RBDO, PBDO and
   RDO were developed and have been applied to a numerical analysis and an
   aircraft conceptual design. This research evaluates and compares the
   characteristics of each method in both cases.
   Findings - The RBDO result can be improved when the amount of data
   concerning uncertain parameters is increased. Conversely, increasing
   information regarding uncertain parameters does not improve the PBDO
   result. The PBDO provides a conservative result when less information
   about uncertain parameters is available.
   Research limitations/implications - The formulation of RDO is more
   complex than other methods. If the uncertainty information is increased
   in aircraft conceptual design case, the accuracy of RBDO will be
   enhanced.
   Practical implications - This research increases the probability of a
   feasible design when it considers the uncertainty. This result gives
   more practical optimization results on a conceptual design level for
   fabrication.
   Originality/value - It is RBDO, PBDO and RDO methods combined with MDO
   that satisfy the target probability when the uncertainties of low
   fidelity analysis models are considered.}},

Title = {{Accelerated Compressed Sensing Based CT Image Reconstruction}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{In X-ray computed tomography (CT) an important objective is to reduce
   the radiation dose without significantly degrading the image quality.
   Compressed sensing (CS) enables the radiation dose to be reduced by
   producing diagnostic images from a limited number of projections.
   However, conventional CS-based algorithms are computationally intensive
   and time-consuming. We propose a new algorithm that accelerates the
   CS-based reconstruction by using a fast pseudopolar Fourier based Radon
   transform and rebinning the diverging fan beams to parallel beams. The
   reconstruction process is analyzed using a maximum-a-posterior approach,
   which is transformed into a weighted CS problem. The weights involved in
   the proposed model are calculated based on the statistical
   characteristics of the reconstruction process, which is formulated in
   terms of the measurement noise and rebinning interpolation error.
   Therefore, the proposed method not only accelerates the reconstruction,
   but also removes the rebinning and interpolation errors. Simulation
   results are shown for phantoms and a patient. For example, a 512 x 512
   Shepp-Logan phantom when reconstructed from 128 rebinned projections
   using a conventional CS method had 10\% error, whereas with the proposed
   method the reconstruction error was less than 1\%. Moreover, computation
   times of less than 30 sec were obtained using a standard desktop
   computer without numerical optimization.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{27}},
Pages = {{5435-5446}},
Abstract = {{The actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in the deformability of the cell
   and in mechanosensing. Here we analyze the contributions of three major
   actin cross-linking proteins, myosin II, alpha-actinin and filamin, to
   cell deformability, by using micropipette aspiration of Dictyostelium
   cells. We examine the applicability of three simple mechanical models:
   for small deformation, linear viscoelasticity and drop of liquid with a
   tense cortex; and for large deformation, a Newtonian viscous fluid. For
   these models, we have derived linearized equations and we provide a
   novel, straightforward methodology to analyze the experiments. This
   methodology allowed us to differentiate the effects of the cross-linking
   proteins in the different regimes of deformation. Our results confirm
   some previous observations and suggest important relations between the
   molecular characteristics of the actin-binding proteins and the cell
   behavior: the effect of myosin is explained in terms of the relation
   between the lifetime of the bond to actin and the resistive force; the
   presence of alpha-actinin obstructs the deformation of the cytoskeleton,
   presumably mainly due to the higher molecular stiffness and to the lower
   dissociation rate constants; and filamin contributes critically to the
   global connectivity of the network, possibly by rapidly turning over
   crosslinks during the remodeling of the cytoskeletal network, thanks to
   the higher rate constants, flexibility and larger size. The results
   suggest a sophisticated relationship between the expression levels of
   actinbinding proteins, deformability and mechanosensing.}},

Pages = {{2799-2807}},
Abstract = {{Rapid phenotyping of bacteria to identify drug-resistant strains is an
   important capability for the treatment and management of infectious
   disease. At present, the rapid determination of antibiotic
   susceptibility is hindered by the requirement that, in existing devices,
   bacteria must be pre-cultured for 2-3 days to reach detectable levels.
   Here we report a novel electrochemical approach that achieves rapid
   readout of the antibiotic susceptibility profile of a bacterial
   infection within one hour. The electrochemical reduction of a
   redox-active molecule is monitored that reports on levels of
   metabolically-active bacteria. Bacteria are captured in miniaturized
   wells, incubated with antimicrobials and monitored for resistance. This
   electrochemical phenotyping approach is effective with
   clinically-relevant levels of bacteria, and provides results comparable
   to culture-based analysis. Results, however, are delivered on a much
   faster timescale, with resistance profiles available after a one hour
   incubation period.}},

Title = {{Bubble pump: scalable strategy for in-plane liquid routing}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{2842-2853}},
Abstract = {{We present an on-chip liquid routing technique intended for application
   in well-based microfluidic systems that require long-term active pumping
   at low to medium flowrates. Our technique requires only one fluidic
   feature layer, one pneumatic control line and does not rely on flexible
   membranes and mechanical or moving parts. The presented bubble pump is
   therefore compatible with both elastomeric and rigid substrate materials
   and the associated scalable manufacturing processes. Directed liquid
   flow was achieved in a microchannel by an in-series configuration of two
   previously described ``bubble gates{''}, i.e., by gas-bubble enabled
   miniature gate valves. Only one time-dependent pressure signal is
   required and initiates at the upstream (active) bubble gate a
   reciprocating bubble motion. Applied at the downstream (passive) gate a
   time-constant gas pressure level is applied. In its rest state, the
   passive gate remains closed and only temporarily opens while the liquid
   pressure rises due to the active gate's reciprocating bubble motion. We
   have designed, fabricated and consistently operated our bubble pump with
   a variety of working liquids for >72 hours. Flow rates of 0-5.5 mu l
   min(-1), were obtained and depended on the selected geometric
   dimensions, working fluids and actuation frequencies. The maximum
   operational pressure was 2.9 kPa-9.1 kPa and depended on the interfacial
   tension of the working fluids. Attainable flow rates compared favorably
   with those of available micropumps. We achieved flow rate enhancements
   of 30-100\% by operating two bubble pumps in tandem and demonstrated
   scalability of the concept in a multi-well format with 12 individually
   and uniformly perfused microchannels (variation in flow rate <7\%). We
   envision the demonstrated concept to allow for the consistent on-chip
   delivery of a wide range of different liquids that may even include
   highly reactive or moisture sensitive solutions. The presented bubble
   pump may provide active flow control for analytical and point-of-care
   diagnostic devices, as well as for microfluidic cells culture and
   organ-on-chip platforms.}},

Title = {{Adaptively Tuned Iterative Low Dose CT Image Denoising}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Improving image quality is a critical objective in low dose computed
   tomography (CT) imaging and is the primary focus of CT image denoising.
   State-of-the-art CT denoising algorithms are mainly based on iterative
   minimization of an objective function, in which the performance is
   controlled by regularization parameters. To achieve the best results,
   these should be chosen carefully. However, the parameter selection is
   typically performed in an ad hoc manner, which can cause the algorithms
   to converge slowly or become trapped in a local minimum. To overcome
   these issues a noise confidence region evaluation (NCRE) method is used,
   which evaluates the denoising residuals iteratively and compares their
   statistics with those produced by additive noise. It then updates the
   parameters at the end of each iteration to achieve a better match to the
   noise statistics. By combining NCRE with the fundamentals of block
   matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) approach, a new iterative CT image
   denoising method is proposed. It is shown that this new denoising method
   improves the BM3D performance in terms of both the mean square error and
   a structural similarity index. Moreover, simulations and patient results
   show that this method preserves the clinically important details of low
   dose CT images together with a substantial noise reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure ulcers (PUs) in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI)
   present a persistent and costly problem. Continuing effort in developing
   new technologies that support self-managed care is an important
   prevention strategy. Specifically, the aims of this scoping review are
   to review the key concepts and factors related to self-managed
   prevention of PUs in individuals with SCI and appraise the technologies
   available to assist patients in self-management of PU prevention
   practices. There is broad consensus that sustaining long-term adherence
   to prevention regimens is a major concern. Recent literature highlights
   the interactions between behavioral and physiological risk factors. We
   identify four technology categories that support self-management:
   computer-based educational technologies demonstrated improved short-term
   gains in knowledge (2 studies), interface pressure mapping technologies
   demonstrated improved adherence to pressure-relief schedules up to 3 mo
   (5 studies), electrical stimulation confirmed improvements in tissue
   tolerance after 8 wk of training (3 studies), and telemedicine programs
   demonstrated improvements in independence and reduced hospital visits
   over 6 mo (2 studies). Overall, self-management technologies
   demonstrated low-to-moderate effectiveness in addressing a subset of
   risk factors. However, the effectiveness of technologies in preventing
   PUs is limited due to a lack of incidence reporting. In light of the key
   findings, we recommend developing integrated technologies that address
   multiple risk factors.}},

Abstract = {{Many efforts have been devoted to modeling the diffusive impedance of
   conjugated polymer (CP) based actuators using their equivalent
   electrical circuits. Employing the same methodology, CP based mechanical
   sensors can also be treated by an equivalent transmission line circuit
   and their overall impedance can be modeled, correspondingly. Due to the
   large number of resources to study the electrical circuits, this
   technique is a practical tool. Therefore, in this study, an equivalent
   RC-circuit model including electrochemical parameters is determined to
   obtain a better perception of the sensing mechanism of these mechanical
   sensors. Conjugated polymers are capable of generating an output current
   or voltage upon an induced mechanical deformation or force. This
   observed behavior in polymer based mechanical sensors is considered as
   the reverse actuation process. Many outstanding properties of the
   conjugated polymer actuators including their light weight and
   biocompatibility are still retained by these sensors. Sensors with a
   trilayer configuration are capable of operating in air in response to a
   mechanically induced bending deformation. However, due to their
   nonlinear behavior and multivariable characteristics, it is required to
   propose a systematic approach in order to optimize their performance and
   gain the optimal values of their constituent decision variable.
   Therefore, the proposed mathematical model is used to define the output
   voltage of the PPy based mechanical sensor along with the sensitivity of
   the model to the applied frequency of the induced deformation. Applying
   a multiobjective optimization algorithm, the optimization problem was
   solved and the tracking ability of the proposed model was then verified.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the influence of the liquid water inlet boundary
   conditions at the gas diffusion layer (GDL)/catalyst layer interface on
   the spatial distribution of liquid water within the GDL was studied. We
   used pore network modeling with invasion percolation to simulate liquid
   water transport in a commercially available GDL, where the detailed, 3D
   microstructure of the GDL was obtained through X-ray imaging. Three
   inlet boundary conditions were studied: uniform pressure (single
   reservoir), uniform flux (completely discretized reservoirs), and
   distributed uniform pressure (random spatial- and size-distributions of
   reservoirs). We presented the distributed uniform pressure boundary
   condition as a more realistic inlet, where inlets are randomly
   distributed reservoirs that are connected to multiple inlet pores. It
   was found that the overall saturation ranged from 6\% to 28\% when the
   number of inlets ranged from 20 to 300; however, the GDL/catalyst layer
   delamination dominated water transport behavior. (C) The Author(s) 2015.

Abstract = {{Synchrotron X-ray radiography was utilized to visualize the liquid water
   distribution in a fuel cell with an active area of 0.48 cm(2) with an
   effective spatial resolution of 10 mu m. Water content was measured in

   thicknesses ranged between 0 and 150 mu m. The distribution of liquid
   water in a substrate-free polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell
   with a 50 mu m-thick MPL was also determined. It was observed that the
   presence of an MPL significantly reduced the water content at the
   interfacial region between the catalyst layer and GDL, and increasing
   the thickness of the MPL led to a reduction of liquid water accumulation
   at the interface between the substrate and MPL. (C) The Author(s) 2015.

Abstract = {{We present a compact microfluidic platform for the automated, multimodal
   assessment of intact small blood vessels. Mouse olfactory artery
   segments were reversibly loaded onto a microfluidic device and kept
   under physiological (i.e., close to in vivo) environmental conditions.
   For immunohistochemical endpoint protein analysis, automated on chip
   fixation and staining of the artery eliminated the need for any
   subsequent tissue sectioning or processing outside the chip. In a first
   case study, we demonstrate the blood vessel abluminal structure based on
   the positions of smooth muscle cell nuclei, actin filaments and voltage
   gated calcium channels. In a second case study we incubated smooth
   muscle cells (SMCs) with a calcium-sensitive dye to simultaneously
   assess time-dependent, agonist-induced calcium and diameter changes of
   pressurized resistance arteries. We expect the presented microfluidic
   platform to promote routine on-chip staining and quantitative
   fluorescence imaging of intact blood vessels from different vascular
   beds, tissue engineered vascular constructs and vascularized
   microtissues. The at least tenfold reduction in required aliquot volumes
   for functional assessment and staining was achieved by on-board fluid
   manipulation of the syringe-pump free platform and may promote its
   applications for screening of newly synthesized compounds.}},

Title = {{Illuminating CO2 reduction on frustrated Lewis pair surfaces:
   investigating the role of surface hydroxides and oxygen vacancies on
   nanocrystalline In2O3-x(OH)(y)}},

Abstract = {{Designing catalytic nanostructures that can thermochemically or
   photochemically convert gaseous carbon dioxide into carbon based fuels
   is a significant challenge which requires a keen understanding of the
   chemistry of reactants, intermediates and products on surfaces. In this
   context, it has recently been reported that the reverse water gas shift
   reaction (RWGS), whereby carbon dioxide is reduced to carbon monoxide
   and water, CO2 + H-2 -> CO + H2O, can be catalysed by hydroxylated
   indium oxide nanocrystals, denoted In2O3-x(OH)(y), more readily in the
   light than in the dark. The surface hydroxide groups and oxygen
   vacancies on In2O3-x(OH)(y) were both shown to assist this reaction.
   While this advance provides a first step toward the rational design and
   optimization of a single-component gas-phase CO2 reduction catalyst for
   solar fuels generation, the precise role of the hydroxide groups and
   oxygen vacancies in facilitating the reaction on In2O3-x(OH)(y)
   nanocrystals has not been resolved. In the work reported herein, for the
   first time we present in situ spectroscopic and kinetic observations,
   complemented by density functional theory analysis, that together
   provide mechanistic information into the surface reaction chemistry
   responsible for the thermochemical and photochemical RWGS reaction.
   Specifically, we demonstrate photochemical CO2 reduction at a rate of
   150 mu mol gcat(-1) hour(-1), which is four times better than the
   reduction rate in the dark, and propose a reaction mechanism whereby a
   surface active site of In2O3-x(OH)(y), composed of a Lewis base
   hydroxide adjacent to a Lewis acid indium, together with an oxygen
   vacancy, assists the adsorption and heterolytic dissociation of H-2 that
   enables the adsorption and reaction of CO2 to form CO and H2O as
   products. This mechanism, which has its analogue in molecular frustrated
   Lewis pair (FLP) chemistry and catalysis of CO2 and H-2, is supported by
   preliminary kinetic investigations. The results of this study emphasize
   the importance of engineering the surfaces of nanostructures to
   facilitate gas-phase thermochemical and photochemical carbon dioxide
   reduction reactions to energy rich fuels at technologically significant
   rates.}},

Abstract = {{Novel axially phenoxylated aluminium phthalocyanines, pentafluorophenoxy
   aluminium phthalocyanine (F5PhO-AlPc) and p-nitrophenoxy aluminium
   phthalocyanine (NO2PhO-AlPc), were synthesized through a one-step
   reaction starting from the commonly used photoactive material, chloro
   aluminium phthalocyanine (Cl-AlPc), and the respective phenols.
   Reactions with other phenols did not yield corresponding AlPc
   derivatives. Optical, electrical, and thermal analyses were carried out
   on F5PhO-AlPc and NO2PhO-AlPc using UV-Vis measurements (solution and
   thin-film), cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential-pulse voltammetry
   (DPV), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). A simple thermodynamic
   model was used to explain the lack of reaction when Cl-AlPc was treated
   a variety of alkylated phenols. We noted a side reaction producing
   fluoro aluminium phthalocyanine (F-AlPc) when the synthesis of
   F5PhO-AlPc was attempted in DMF. The model also explains this
   observation. F5PhO-AlPc and NO2PhO-AlPc were integrated into organic
   photovoltaic devices (OPVs) both as electron-donating and as
   electron-accepting materials. The phenoxy-AlPcs enable an enhancement of
   the open-circuit voltage (V-OC) of the OPVs when applied as either an
   electron donor or as an electron acceptor compared to Cl-AlPc. The
   results within the OPV, specifically the increased V-OC, are consistent
   with the steric shielding effect seen in other OPVs.}},

Abstract = {{Rational design of the programmable soft matter requires understanding
   of the effect of a complex metric on shape transformations of thin
   non-Euclidean sheets. In the present work, we explored experimentally
   and using simulations how simultaneous or consecutive application of two
   orthogonal perturbations to thin patterned stimuli-responsive hydrogel
   sheets affects their three-dimensional shape transformations. The final
   shape of the sheet is governed by the metric, but not the order, in
   which the perturbations are applied to the system, and is determined by
   the competition of small-scale bidirectional stresses. In addition, a
   new, unexpected transition from a planar state to an equilibrium helical
   shape of the hydrogel sheet is observed via a mechanism that is yet to
   be explained.}},

Title = {{Effect of Slag Compositions and Additive on Heat Transfer and
   Crystallization of Mold Fluxes for High-Al Non-magnetic Steel}},
Journal = {{ISIJ INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1000-1009}},
Abstract = {{Intense reaction between silica in mold fluxes and aluminium in liquid
   steel during casting of high-Al non-magnetic steel 20Mn23AlV (1.5-2.5 Al
   in mass percent) would significantly alter both chemical compositions
   and properties of mold fluxes. This would subsequently lead to severe
   casting problems such as lots of slag rims, breakout and poor surface
   quality. Investigation carried out in this paper started with plant
   sampling, followed by a look at how the variation of Al2O3/SiO2 ratio
   with reaction time can affect the casting process and product quality.
   Thus, this work focuses on the study of increasing Al2O3/SiO2 and
   partial substitution of CaO with BaO in CaO-SiO2 system mold fluxes in
   terms of heat transfer and crystallization behavior. The techniques
   implemented are heat flux simulator and single hot thermocouple
   technique (SHTT). The results showed that an increase in Al2O3/SiO2
   inhibits heat transfer, increases crystallization temperature and
   critical cooling rate while shortens incubation time, additionally,
   accelerates precipitation of phase with high melting temperature.
   However, greater substitution of CaO with BaO accelerates heat transfer,
   reduces crystallization temperature and critical cooling rate at the
   cost of longer incubation time even at elevated Al2O3/SiO2. Eventually,
   partial substitution of CaO with BaO, to some extent, counteracts the
   effect of increasing Al2O3/SiO2 on heat transfer and crystallization
   properties of mold fluxes for casting of high-Al steels.}},

   and physicochemical properties}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{9664-9675}},
Abstract = {{Cellular association of nanoparticles (NPs) in biological fluids is
   affected by proteins adsorbed onto the NP surface, forming a ``protein
   corona{''}, thereby impacting cellular bioactivity. Here we investigate,
   based on an extensive gold NPs protein corona dataset, the relationships
   between NP-cell association and protein corona fingerprints (PCFs) as
   well as NP physicochemical properties. Accordingly, quantitative
   structure-activity relationships (QSARs) were developed based on both
   linear and non-linear support vector regression (SVR) models making use
   of a sequential forward floating selection of descriptors. The SVR model
   with only 6 serum proteins and zeta potential had higher accuracy (R-2 =
   0.895) relative to the linear model (R-2 = 0.850) with 11 PCFs.
   Considering the initial pool of 148 descriptors, the APOB, A1AT, ANT3,
   and PLMN serum proteins along with NP zeta potential were identified as
   most significant to correlating NP-cell association. The present study
   suggests that QSARs exploration of NP-cell association data, considering
   the role of both NP protein corona and physicochemical properties, can
   support the planning and interpretation of toxicity studies and guide
   the design of NPs for biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the sensitivity and specificity of backscattered
   ultrasound (US) and backscattering photoacoustic (PA) signals for bone
   composition variation assessment. The conventional approach in the
   evaluation of bone health relies on measurement of bone mineral density
   (BMD). Although, a crucial and probably the most important parameter,
   BMD is not the only factor defining the bone health. New trends in
   osteoporosis research, also pursue the changes in collagen content and
   cross-links with bone diseases and aging. Therefore, any non-invasive
   method that can assess any of these parameters can improve the
   diagnostic tools and also can help with the biomedical studies on the
   diseases themselves. Our previous studies show that both US and PA are
   responsive to changes in the BMD, PA is, in addition, sensitive to
   changes in the collagen content of the bone. Measurements were performed
   on bone samples before and after mild demineralization and
   decollagenization at the exact same points. Results show that combining
   both modalities can enhance the sensitivity and specificity of
   diagnostic tool.}},

Pages = {{12796-12803}},
Abstract = {{The buckling of hybrid boron nitride-carbon nanotubes (BN-CNTs) with
   various BN compositions and locations of the BN domain is investigated
   using molecular dynamics. We find that BN-CNTs with large BN composition
   (>38\%) only undergo local shell-like buckling in their BN domain.
   Although similar local shell-like buckling can occur in BN-CNTs with a
   relatively small BN composition, it can transfer to the global
   column-like buckling of the whole BN-CNT with increasing strains. The
   critical strains for local shell-like and global column-like buckling
   decrease with increasing BN composition. In addition, critical strains
   and buckling modes of the global column-like buckling of BN-CNTs also
   strongly depend on the location of their BN domain. As a possible
   application of the buckling of BN-CNTs, we demonstrate that the BN-CNT
   can serve as a water channel integrated with a local natural valve using
   the local buckling of its BN domain.}},

Abstract = {{Digital cancer diagnosis is a research realm where signal processing
   techniques are used to analyze and to classify color histo-pathology
   images. Different from grayscale image analysis of magnetic resonance
   imaging or X-ray, colors in histopathology images convey large amount of
   histological information and thus play significant role in cancer
   diagnosis. Though color information is widely used in histopathology
   works, as today, there is few study on color model selections for
   feature extraction in cancer diagnosis schemes.
   This paper addresses the problem of color space selection for digital
   cancer classification using H\&E stained images, and investigates the
   effectiveness of various color models (RGB, HSV, CIE L{*}a{*}b{*}, and
   stain-dependent H\&E decomposition model) in breast cancer diagnosis.
   Particularly, we build a diagnosis framework as a comparison benchmark
   and take specific concerns of medical decision systems into account in
   evaluation. The evaluation methodologies include feature discriminate
   power evaluation and final diagnosis performance comparison.
   Experimentation on a publicly accessible histopathology image set
   suggests that the H\&E decomposition model outperforms other assessed
   color spaces. For reasons behind various performance of color spaces,
   our analysis via mutual information estimation demonstrates that color
   components in the H\& E model are less dependent, and thus most feature
   discriminate power is collected in one channel instead of spreading out
   among channels in other color spaces.}},

Abstract = {{Widely tunable mid infrared radiation achievable using quantum cascade
   lasers (QCLs) often requires external cavities and several QCL chips to
   cover a large bandwidth similar to the range reported here (similar to
   1000s nm). The cost and mechanical stability of these designs leaves
   room for alternative more rugged approaches, which require no cavities
   to achieve very broad band tunability. While difference frequency
   generation (DFG) will unlikely match the power levels achievable from
   QCLs, it can provide spectral brightness and extremely wide tunablity,
   which can be valuable for numerous applications.
   Recently, we have demonstrated that dispersion engineering techniques
   can be used for phase matching of second order nonlinearities near the
   bandgap in monolithic waveguides. In this work we demonstrate an
   extremely simple structure to grow and fabricate, which utilizes
   dispersion engineering not only to achieve phase matching but also to
   expand the tuning range of the frequency conversion achieved in a
   waveguide through difference frequency generation. Frequency conversion
   in monolithic AlGaAs single-sided Bragg reflection waveguides using
   chi((2)) nonlinearities produced widely tuneable, coherent infrared
   radiation between 2-3 mu m and 7-9 mu m. The broad tunability afforded
   by dispersion engineering and possible current injection, waveguide
   width chirping and temperature tuning makes it possible to produce a
   single multi-layer substrate to generate mid-IR signals that span mu ms
   in wavelength.}},

Abstract = {{C<\^{}>C-star chelated Pt(II) compounds that contain an N-heterocyclic
   carbene (NHC) donor have recently attracted great interest as blue or
   white phosphorescent emitters for organic light-emitting devices
   (OLEDs). To overcome the tendency for excimer formation in Pt(II)
   compounds, an alpha-duryl-beta-diketonato ligand was selected as the
   ancillary ligand for blue phosphorescent C<\^{}>C-star chelated Pt(II)
   compounds. Using this approach, a series of NHC-based C<\^{}>C-star
   chelated Pt(II) compounds has been designed and synthesized. The chelate
   ligands used in the new C<\^{}>C-star chelated Pt(II) compounds include
   1-phenylimidazol-2-ylidene in Pt1, 1-phenyl-1,2,4-triazol-5-ylidene in
   Pt2, p-TMS-1-phenylimidazol-2-ylidene in Pt3, and
   p-TMS-1-phenyl-1,2,4-triazol-5-ylidene in Pt4. A single-crystal X-ray
   diffraction analysis revealed that the presence of the
   alpha-duryl-beta-diketonato ligand in the Pt(II) compounds effectively
   suppresses the dimer formation in the crystal lattice. Pt1, Pt2, Pt3,
   and Pt4 display blue phosphorescence at room temperature. The p-TMS
   substituted complex Pt3 was found to display the most efficient blue
   phosphorescence at lambda(em) = 468 nm with a Phi(PL) of 0.68.
   Spectroscopic and computational studies established that the blue
   phosphorescence in the phenyl-imidazolylidene chelated complexes
   originates mainly from a (MLCT)-M-3 state while that in the
   phenyl-triazolylidene chelated compounds arises from a (ILCT)-I-3 state.
   Electroluminescent devices using Pt1 and Pt3 as the dopant were
   fabricated which display both monomer and exciplex emission, leading to
   pure white light electroluminescence with CIE coordinates of (0.32,
   0.31).}},

Abstract = {{Photodynamic therapy (PDT) delivers a localized cytotoxic dose that is a
   function of tissue oxygen availability, photosensitive drug
   concentration, and light fluence. Providing safe and effective PDT
   requires an understanding of all three elements and the physiological
   response to the radicals generated. Interstitial PDT (IPDT) for solid
   tumours poses particular challenges due to complex organ geometries and
   the associated limitations for diffusion theory based fluence rate
   prediction, in addition to restricted access for light delivery and dose
   monitoring.
   As a first step towards enabling a complete prospective IPDT
   treatment-planning platform, we demonstrate use of our previously
   developed FullMonte tetrahedral Monte Carlo simulation engine for
   modelling of the interstitial fluence field due to intravesicular
   insertion of fibre light sources. The goal is to enable a complete
   treatment planning and monitoring workflow analogous to that used in
   ionizing radiation therapy, including plan evaluation through
   dose-volume histograms and algorithmic treatment plan optimization.
   FullMonte is to our knowledge the fastest open-source tetrahedral MC
   light propagation software. Using custom hardware acceleration, we
   achieve 4x faster computing with 67x better power efficiency for
   limited-size meshes compared to the software. Ongoing work will improve
   the performance advantage to 16x with unlimited mesh size, enabling
   algorithmic plan optimization in reasonable time.
   Using FullMonte, we demonstrate significant new plan-evaluation
   capabilities including fluence field visualization, generation of organ
   dose-volume histograms, and rendering of isofluence surfaces for a
   representative bladder cancer mesh from a real patient. We also discuss
   the advantages of MC simulations for dose-volume histogram generation
   and the need for online personalized fluence-rate monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{We report on a novel miniature head-mounted imaging system for

   blood oxygenation in a rat. Measurements of blood flow speeds are
   accomplished using Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) technique,

   Signal Imaging (IOSI) technique. A single multi-wavelength (wavelength =
   680, 795, 850 nm) package of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers
   (VCSELs) is used as the sole brain illumination source. VCSELs enable
   rapid toggling between wavelengths, and between high-coherence and
   low-coherence modes, necessary for LSCI and IOSI, respectively. The
   combination of a miniature light source and a small 10-bit CCD camera
   sensor lead to a sub-20 g device mass. The miniature imaging system,
   including the lens, camera, and illumination lasers, is packaged as a
   module, and is mounted on a chronic implanted observation window that is
   surgically placed in the skull, allowing for repeated measurements and
   removal of the imaging system from the rats head after the imaging
   session. The imaging system allows for a 2mm-diameter field of view and
   a resolution of 7.4 mu m. It will allow neurophysiologists to correlate

Abstract = {{Electrosprayed nanodroplets impacting on covalently bonded materials at
   velocities of a few kilometers per second strongly modify their surfaces
   by sputtering atoms, amorphizing the region surrounding the impact, and
   carving craters of comparable size. This article investigates the
   effects of the projectile's molecular mass on the phenomenology of the
   impact on Si, SiC, Ge, and GaAs at impact velocities significantly
   higher than previously studied. An appropriate range of molecular mass
   is covered by electrospraying the ionic liquids ethylammonium nitrate,
   EAN, and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)
   imide, EMI-Im, which have molecular masses of 108 and 391 amu,
   respectively. The beamlets are characterized with the time-of-flight
   technique to determine the impact velocity, stagnation pressure, and
   molecular kinetic energy of the projectiles, and to estimate their
   average diameters. The ranges of these parameters are 7-17 km/s, 40-190
   GPa, 50-420 eV, and 10-14 nm. Under these conditions, we find that the
   molecular mass has a strong effect on sputtering: the sputtering yield
   for the heavier EMI-Im molecule is always higher than for EAN, with
   maximum values for Si, SiC, Ge, and GaAs of 4.3, 11.5, 10.9, and 9.4
   atoms per EMI-Im molecule, and 1.1, 3.9, 3.3, and 2.9 in the case of
   EAN. More importantly, droplets of the same diameter (10 nm) and kinetic
   energy eject significantly different numbers of atoms, with average
   ratios between the EMI-Im and EAN droplets of 1.8, 1.5, 1.7, and 1.5 for
   Si, SiC, Ge, and GaAs. Molecular dynamics simulations reproduce the
   observed enhancement of the sputtering at increasing molecular mass.}},

   organic aerosol formation}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{Many atmospheric and chemical variables influence the partitioning
   equilibrium between gas phase and condensed phases of compounds
   implicated in the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). The
   large number of factors and their interaction makes it often difficult
   to assess their relative importance and concerted impact. Here we
   introduce a two-dimensional space which maps regions of dominant
   atmospheric phase distribution within a coordinate system defined by
   equilibrium partition coefficients between the gas phase, an aqueous
   phase and a water-insoluble organic matter (WIOM) phase. Placing
   compounds formed from the oxidation of n-alkanes, terpenes and
   mono-aromatic hydrocarbons on the maps based on their predicted
   partitioning properties allows for a simple graphical assessment of
   their equilibrium phase distribution behaviour. Specifically, it allows
   for the simultaneous visualisation and quantitative comparison of the
   impact on phase distribution of changes in atmospheric parameters (such
   as temperature, salinity, WIOM-phase polarity, organic aerosol load, and
   liquid water content) and chemical properties (such as oxidation state,
   molecular size, functionalisation, and dimerisation). The graphical
   analysis reveals that the addition of hydroxyl, carbonyl and carboxyl
   groups increases the affinity of aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic
   hydrocarbons for the aqueous phase more rapidly than their affinity for
   WIOM, suggesting that the aqueous phase may often be relevant even for
   substances that are considerably larger than the C2 and C3 compounds
   that are typically believed to be associated with aqueous SOA. In
   particular, the maps identify some compounds that contribute to SOA
   formation if partitioning to both WIOM and aqueous phase is considered
   but would remain in the gas phase if either condensed phase were
   neglected. For example, many semi-volatile alpha-pinene oxidation
   products will contribute to aqueous SOA under the conditions of high
   liquid water content encountered in clouds but would remain vapours in
   wet aerosol. It is conceivable to develop parameterisations of
   `partitioning basis sets' that group compounds with comparable
   partitioning properties, which - when combined with data on the
   abundance of those groups of compounds - could serve in the simulation
   of SOA formation.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple tuned mass dampers (MTMDs) tuned to various frequencies have
   been shown to efficiently control the seismic response of structures
   where multiple modes are dominant. One example is irregular structures
   that are found more vulnerable than their symmetric counterparts. With
   the technology of MTMDs available, design and optimal design
   methodologies are required for application. Such a methodology, in the
   form of an analysis/redesign (A/R) scheme, has been previously presented
   by the authors while limiting responses of interest to allowable values,
   i.e., performance-based design (PBD). In this paper, the A/R procedure
   is modified based on formal optimality criteria, making it more cost
   efficient, as well as more computationally efficient. It is shown that
   by using the methodology presented herein, a desired performance level
   is successfully targeted by adding near-optimal amounts of mass at
   various locations and tuning the TMDs to dampen several of the
   structure's frequencies. This is done using analysis tools only.}},

Title = {{Night-to-night Variability in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Severity:
   Relationship to Overnight Rostral Fluid Shift}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{149-156}},
Abstract = {{Study Objectives: Overnight rostral fluid shift from the legs to the
   neck may narrow the pharynx and contribute to obstructive sleep apnea
   (OSA) pathogenesis. We hypothesized that night-to-night changes in the
   apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) would be associated with changes in overnight
   rostral fluid shift.
   Methods: Twenty-six patients with OSA (AHI >= 10) underwent two
   polysomnograms 14 days apart with measurement of neck and leg fluid
   volumes (LFV), neck circumference and upper-airway cross-sectional area
   before and after sleep.
   Results: Although mean A HI did not differ between polysomnograms, 35\%
   of patients had a difference in AHI > 10, indicating significant
   intra-individual variability. There were direct correlations between
   change in non-rapid-eye movement (NREM), but not REM AHI and change in
   evening LFV between polysomnograms (r = 0.440, p = 0.036 and r = 0.005,
   p = 0.982, respectively) and between change in supine, but not
   non-supine AHI and change in evening LFV (r = 0.483, p = 0.020 and r =
   0.269, p = 0.280, respectively). An increase in evening LFV between
   polysomnograms was associated with a greater overnight decrease in LFV
   (r = 0.560, p = 0.005) and a greater overnight increase in neck fluid
   volume (r = 0.498, p = 0.016). Additionally, a greater overnight
   increase in neck circumference was associated with a greater overnight
   increase in neck fluid volume between polysomnograms (r = 0.453, p =
   0.020) and a greater overnight decrease in upper-airway cross-sectional
   area (r = -0.587, p = 0.005).
   Conclusion: Intra-individual variability in OSA severity may be partly
   explained by day-to-day changes in evening leg fluid volume and
   overnight rostral fluid shift, which may be most important in the
   pathogenesis of OSA during NREM and supine sleep.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrodes modified with mixtures
   of PMo12O403- (PMo12) and PW12O403- (PW12) Keggin ions are investigated
   for electrochemical capacitor (EC) applications. We have discovered that
   when these polyoxometalate (POM) ions are combined in solution, they do
   not just mix physically, but instead react to form the PMo12-xWx mixed
   addenda chemistries. By simply Mixing PMo12 and PW12 in different
   ratios, a variety of mixed addenda ions, each with unique
   electrochemical properties, can be easily synthesized. This control over
   POM redox behavior afforded by the novel mixed addenda synthesis is used
   along with layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition to design molecular coatings
   that demonstrate desired pseudocapacitive characteristics. The best
   performance was achieved with a coating that superimposed a 3:1
   PMo12O403--PW12O403- mixed layer on a 1:1 GeMo12O404--SiMo12O404- mixed
   layer, which resulted in an 11X capacitance enhancement over unmodified
   CNT. This dual layer electrode also demonstrated a close to rectangular
   CV profile due to the overlapping redox features of the POM combination.
   The design of custom POM coatings to engineer the electrode surface
   represents a promising strategy for the development of high performance
   pseudocapacitive electrodes. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS.

   50 wt\% of negatively-charged latex NPs. Composite films were
   characterized by macroscopically close-to-uniform fluorescence,
   birefringence, and circular dichroism properties. In contrast, addition
   of positively charged latex NPs led to gelation of CNC-latex suspensions
   and disruption of the chiral nematic order in the composite films. Large
   latex NPs disrupted the chiral nematic order to a larger extend than
   small NPs. Furthermore, the glass transition of latex NPs had a dramatic
   effect on the structure of CNC-latex films. Latex particles in the
   rubbery state were easily incorporated in the ordered CNC matrix and
   improved the structural integrity of its chiral nematic phase.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the adsorption-desorption cycles of water and of three
   hydrocarbons on MCM-41 and on SBA-15. We show that during the desorption
   portion of a cycle, when the condensate is still at the mouth of the
   pores, in equilibrium, and the pressure, P-W(V), is the minimum value
   reached before pore-emptying begins, the contact angle is zero. This
   value of the contact angle is used with the Kelvin equation to calculate
   the pore radius of each of the mesoporous silicas considered. The
   standard deviations in the values are found to differ by only a few
   percent. We propose a method for predicting the size of
   adsorbed-molecular clusters that must be formed in the pores to initiate
   condensate formation there. Once formed, the condensate grows
   spontaneously to the pore mouth. If the vapour-phase pressure when this
   condition is reached is also P-W(V), the adsorption-desorption cycle is
   reversible. Three of the eight systems considered meet this condition
   and their adsorption-desorption cycles are experimentally reversible.}},

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},

Abstract = {{The development of strategies for isolating rare cells from complex
   matrices like blood is important for a wide variety of applications
   including the analysis of bloodborne cancer cells, infectious pathogens,
   and prenatal testing. Due to their high colloidal stability and
   surface-to-volume ratio, antibody-coated magnetic nanoparticles are
   excellent labels for cellular surface markers. Unfortunately, capture of
   nanoparticle-bound cells at practical flow rates is challenging due to
   the small volume, and thus low magnetic susceptibility, of magnetic
   nanoparticles. We have developed a means to capture nanoparticle-labeled
   cells using microstructures which create pockets of locally low linear
   velocity, termed velocity valleys. Cells that enter a velocity valley
   slow down momentarily, allowing the magnetic force to overcome the
   reduced drag force and trap the cells. Here, we describe a model for
   this mechanism of cell capture and use this model to guide the rational
   design of a device that efficiently captures rare cells and sorts them
   according to surface expression in complex matrices with greater than 10
   000-fold specificity. By analysing the magnetic and drag forces on a
   cell, we calculate a threshold linear velocity for capture and relate
   this to the capture efficiency. We find that the addition of X-shaped
   microstructures enhances capture efficiency 5-fold compared to circular
   posts. By tuning the linear velocity, we capture cells with a 100-fold
   range of surface marker expression with near 100\% efficiency and sort
   these cells into spatially distinct zones. By tuning the flow channel
   geometry, we reduce non-specific cell adhesion by 5-fold.}},

Abstract = {{A pilot-scale study was conducted to evaluate the impact of several
   biofiltration enhancement strategies in terms of organic removal to
   reduce disinfection by-product (DBP) formation potential and mitigate
   ultrafiltration (UF) fouling. Strategies included nutrient addition
   (nitrogen and phosphorus) to optimize metabolic degradation of organics,
   use of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, peroxide) to improve filter run times,
   and the application of in-line aluminum sulphate (alum) for biopolymer
   removal. The impact of media type on performance was also examined
   (anthracite versus granular activated carbon (GAC)). Passive
   biofiltration (without enhancement) reduced dissolved organic carbon
   (similar to 5\%), biopolymers (similar to 20\%), and trihalomethane and
   haloacetic acid precursors (similar to 20\% and similar to 12\%,
   respectively) while mitigating UF irreversible fouling (similar to
   60\%). Nutrient addition was not observed to enhance biological
   performance. Addition of 0.5 mg/L hydrogen peroxide decreased head loss
   by up to 45\% without affecting organic removal; however at a dosage of
   1 mg/L, it negatively impacted both UF fouling and DBP precursor
   removal. In-line alum addition prior to biofiltration (<0.5 mg/L)
   improved UF fouling control by up to 40\%, without sacrificing head
   loss. Overall, GAC provided superior performance when compared to
   anthracite.}},

Abstract = {{During development and in adult tissues separation of phenotypically
   distinct cell populations is necessary to ensure proper organization and
   function of tissues and organs. Various phenomena, such as differential
   adhesion, differential mechanical tension and cell-cell repulsion, are
   proposed to cause boundary formation. Moreover, emerging evidence
   suggests that interplay between multiple such phenomena can underlie
   boundary formation. Boundary-forming mechanisms are commonly studied in
   vivo in complex embryo models or in vitro using simple model systems not
   reflective of in vivo boundary complexity. To better elucidate the
   interplay between multiple boundary formation mechanism, there is
   therefore a need for more relevant in vitro model systems that allow
   quantitative and concomitant studies of the multiple changes in
   cell/tissue behaviour that lead to boundary establishment. Here, we
   develop such a model using patterned co-cultures of two cell
   populations. Using a set of quantitative tools, we demonstrate that our
   approach allows us to study the mechanisms underlying boundary
   formation. We demonstrate that in our specific system differential
   mechanical tension and modulation of migratory behavior of cells
   accompany boundary formation. The design of our in vitro model system
   will allow researchers to obtain quantitative, integrative mechanistic
   data facilitating a faster and more thorough understanding of the
   fundamental principles underlying boundary formation.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Facial nerve injury leads to severe functional and aesthetic
   deficits. The transgenic Thy1-GFP rat is a new model for facial nerve
   injury and reconstruction research that will help improve clinical
   outcomes through translational facial nerve injury research.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether serial in vivo imaging of nerve
   regeneration in the transgenic rat model is possible, facial nerve
   regeneration was imaged under the main paradigms of facial nerve injury
   and reconstruction.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Fifteen male Thy1-GFP rats, which
   express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in their neural structures, were
   divided into 3 groups in the laboratory: crush-injury, direct repair,
   and cross-face nerve grafting (30-mm graft length). The distal nerve
   stump or nerve graft was predegenerated for 2 weeks. The facial nerve of
   the transgenic rats was serially imaged at the time of operation and
   after 2, 4, and 8 weeks of regeneration. The imaging was performed under
   a GFP-MDS-96/BN excitation stand (BLS Ltd).
   INTERVENTION OR EXPOSURE Facial nerve injury.
   MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE Optical fluorescence of regenerating facial
   nerve axons.
   RESULTS Serial in vivo imaging of the regeneration of GFP-positive axons
   in the Thy1-GFP rat model is possible. All animals survived the short
   imaging procedures well, and nerve regeneration was followed over
   clinically relevant distances. The predegeneration of the distal nerve
   stump or the cross-face nerve graft was, however, necessary to image the
   regeneration front at early time points. Crush injury was not suitable
   to sufficiently predegenerate the nerve (and to allow for degradation of
   the GFP through Wallerian degeneration). After direct repair, axons
   regenerated over the coaptation site in between 2 and 4 weeks. The
   GFP-positive nerve fibers reached the distal end of the 30-mm-long
   cross-face nervegrafts after 4 to 8 weeks of regeneration.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The time course of facial nerve regeneration
   was studied by serial in vivo imaging in the transgenic rat model. Nerve
   regeneration was followed over clinically relevant distances in a small
   number of experimental animals, as they were subsequently imaged at
   multiple time points. The Thy1-GFP rat model will help improve clinical
   outcomes of facial reanimation surgery through improving the knowledge
   of facial nerve regeneration after surgical procedures.}},

Title = {{Structural and Molecular Basis for Resistance to Aminoglycoside
   Antibiotics by the Adenylyltransferase ANT(2 `')-Ia}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{The aminoglycosides are highly effective broad-spectrum antimicrobial
   agents. However, their efficacy is diminished due to enzyme-mediated
   covalent modification, which reduces affinity of the drug for the target
   ribosome. One of the most prevalent aminoglycoside resistance enzymes in
   Gram-negative pathogens is the adenylyltransferase ANT(2 `')-Ia, which
   confers resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, and kanamycin. Despite the
   importance of this enzyme in drug resistance, its structure and
   molecular mechanism have been elusive. This study describes the
   structural and mechanistic basis for adenylylation of aminoglycosides by
   the ANT(2 `')-Ia enzyme. ANT(2 `')-Ia confers resistance by
   magnesium-dependent transfer of a nucleoside monophosphate (AMP) to the
   2 `'-hydroxyl of aminoglycoside substrates containing a
   2-deoxystreptamine core. The catalyzed reaction follows a direct AMP
   transfer mechanism from ATP to the substrate antibiotic. Central to
   catalysis is the coordination of two Mg2+ ions, positioning of the
   modifiable substrate ring, and the presence of a catalytic base
   (Asp(86)). Comparative structural analysis revealed that ANT(2 `')-Ia
   has a two-domain structure with an N-terminal active-site architecture
   that is conserved among other antibiotic nucleotidyltransferases,
   including Lnu(A), LinB, ANT(4=)-Ia, ANT(4 `')-Ib, and ANT(6)-Ia. There
   is also similarity between the nucleotidyltransferase fold of ANT(2
   `')-Ia and DNA polymerase beta. This similarity is consistent with
   evolution from a common ancestor, with the nucleotidyltransferase fold
   having adapted for activity against chemically distinct molecules.
   IMPORTANCE To successfully manage the threat associated with
   multidrug-resistant infectious diseases, innovative therapeutic
   strategies need to be developed. One such approach involves the
   enhancement or potentiation of existing antibiotics against resistant
   strains of bacteria. The reduction in clinical usefulness of the
   aminoglycosides is a particular problem among Gram-negative human
   pathogens, since there are very few therapeutic options for infections
   caused by these organisms. In order to successfully circumvent or
   inhibit the activity of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, and to thus
   rejuvenate the activity of the aminoglycoside antibiotics against
   Gram-negative pathogens, structural and mechanistic information is
   crucial. This study reveals the structure of a clinically prevalent
   aminoglycoside resistance enzyme {[}ANT(2 `')-Ia] and depicts the
   molecular basis underlying modification of antibiotic substrates.
   Combined, these findings provide the groundwork for the development of
   broad-spectrum inhibitors against antibiotic nucleotidyltransferases.}},

Abstract = {{Co-registered ultrasound (US) and frequency-domain photoacoustic radar
   (FD-PAR) imaging is reported for the first time in this paper. The
   merits of ultrasound and cross-correlation (radar) frequency-domain
   photoacoustic imaging are leveraged for accurate tumor detection.
   Commercial US imagers possess sophisticated, optimized software for
   rapid image acquisition that could dramatically speed-up PA imaging. The
   PAR image generated from the amplitude of the cross-correlation between
   detected and input signals was filtered by the standard deviation (SD)
   of the phase of the correlation signal, resulting in strong improvement
   of image spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast.
   Application of phase-mediated image improvement is illustrated by
   imaging a cancer cell-injected mouse. A 14-15 dB SNR gain was recorded
   for the phase-filtered image compared to the amplitude and phase
   independently, while similar to 340 mu m spatial resolution was seen for
   the phase PAR image compared to similar to 840 mu m for the amplitude

Title = {{Grey Matter Atrophy in Mild Cognitive Impairment/Early Alzheimer Disease
   Associated with Delusions: A Voxel-Based Morphometry Study}},
Journal = {{CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{165-172}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Grey matter atrophy in the right hemisphere has been shown
   to be more severe in dementia patients with delusions, suggesting a
   neuroanatomical localization that may be pertinent to impending
   neurodegeneration. Delusional symptoms may arise when atrophy in these
   areas reduces the regulatory functions of the right hemisphere, in
   tandem with asymmetric neuropathology in the left hemisphere. We
   hypothesized that delusional patients with either amnestic mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI) or early Alzheimer Disease (AD) would
   experience more pronounced grey matter atrophy in the right frontal lobe
   compared with matched patients without delusions. Methods: We used
   neuroimaging and clinical data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative. A comparison group of twenty-nine nondelusional
   MCI/early AD participants were compared with twenty-nine delusional
   participants using voxel-based morphometry, matched at baseline by age,
   sex, education, and Mini-Mental State Exam score. All included
   participants were diagnosed with amnestic MCI at study baseline.
   Results: Fifteen voxel clusters of decreased grey matter in participants
   with delusions were detected. Prominent grey matter decrease was
   observed in the right precentral gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus,
   right insula, and left middle occipital gyrus, areas that may be
   involved in control of thought and emotions. Conclusion: Greater right
   fronto-temporal grey matter atrophy was observed in MCI or early AD
   participants with delusions compared to matched patients without
   delusions. Consistent with our predictions, asymmetric grey matter
   atrophy in the right hemisphere may contribute to development of
   delusions through loss of executive inhibition.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a monolithic microfluidic device capable of on-chip
   sample preparation for both RBC and WBC measurements from whole blood.
   For the first time, on-chip sample processing (e.g. dilution, lysis, and
   filtration) and downstream single cell measurement were fully integrated
   to enable sample preparation and single cell analysis from whole blood
   on a single device. The device consists of two parallel sub-systems that
   perform sample processing and electrical measurements for measuring RBC
   and WBC parameters. The system provides a modular environment capable of
   handling solutions of various viscosities by adjusting the length of
   channels and precisely controlling mixing ratios, and features a new
   `offset' filter configuration for increased duration of device
   operation. RBC concentration, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), cell
   distribution width, WBC concentration and differential are determined by
   electrical impedance measurement. Experimental characterization of over
   100000 cells from 10 patient blood samples validated the system's
   capability for performing on-chip raw blood processing and measurement.}},

Abstract = {{An effective approach to achieve efficient phase matching for second
   order nonlinearities, in multilayer structures will be discussed. It
   uses dispersion engineering in Bragg reflection waveguides to harness
   parametric processes in conjunction with concomitant dispersion and
   birefringence engineering in active devices. This technology enables
   novel coherent light sources using frequency conversion in a self-pumped
   chip form factor. These sources can also provide continuous coverage of
   spectral regions, which are not accessible by other technologies
   including quantum cascade lasers. This approach has been recently
   demonstrated in multi-layer Silicon-Oxy-Nitride (SiON) waveguides.
   Harnessing chi((2)) in SiON offers a route for integration of broadband
   infrared sources using frequency mixing with opto-fluidics. Different
   approaches for implementing opto-fluidic structures on Si will be
   discussed, where the root cause of enhancing the retrieved Raman and
   infrared signals in these structures will be explained. Recent progress
   in using this approach to study different nanostructures and biological
   molecules will be presented.}},

   composites are generally prepared by melt blending followed by

Abstract = {{Currently, bagasse sugarcane, a waste product of the sugar industry, is
   mainly burned as fuel in sugar mill boilers. The low cost, low density
   and acceptable mechanical properties of bagasse fibre make it an ideal
   candidate to be considered for value-added applications such as
   reinforcement in plastic composites. Bagasse also has commercial
   potential as reinforcement in cement composites. The advantages of
   incorporating natural fibre as reinforcement in cement composites are
   related to their mechanical and thermal properties and reasonable cost.
   Different treatment techniques enhance the adhesion and compatibility
   between fibres and matrix, hence improving the mechanical properties of
   the composite. Several recent works on properties, processing and
   application of bagasse fibres have been reviewed in this chapter.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a microfluidic device (poly-dimethylsiloxane micro
   channels bonded with glass slides) enabling culture of MLO-Y4 osteocyte
   like cells. In this study, on-chip collagen coating, cell seeding and
   culture, as well as staining were demonstrated in a tubing-free manner
   where gravity was used as the driving force for liquid transportation.
   MLO-Y4 cells were cultured in microfluidic channels with and without
   collagen coating where cellular images in a time sequence were taken and
   analyzed, confirming the positive effect of collagen coating on
   phenotype maintaining of MLO-Y4 cells. The proliferating cell nuclear
   antigen based proliferation assay was used to study cellular
   proliferation, revealing a higher proliferation rate of MLO-Y4 cells
   seeded in microfluidic channels without collagen coating compared to the
   substrates coated with collagen. Furthermore, the effects of channel
   dimensions (variations in width and height) on the viability of MLO-Y4
   cells were explored based on the Calcein-AM and propidium iodide based
   live/dead assay and the Hoechst 33258 based apoptosis assay, locating
   the correlation between the decrease in channel width or height and the
   decrease in cell viability. As a platform technology, this microfluidic
   device may function as a new cell culture model enabling studies of
   osteocytes. (c) 2015 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is one of the most
   frequently employed assays for clinical diagnostic testing and
   biological research. However, its time-consuming operation is a major
   drawback. The present work aims to establish a one-step ELISA method
   through the preparation of a primary antibody (Ab)-secondary Ab complex
   (Ab-Ab complex) in hopes of realizing more sensitive and faster
   detection of the trace amount of antigen (Ag). By controlling the mole
   ratio of the primary Ab to the secondary Ab, one-step ELISA can be
   successfully achieved. Compared with the traditional ELISA, the one-step
   ELISA could not only improve the detection sensitivity to 1ngmL(-1), but
   also reduce the operating time by 30\%. Moreover, the signal intensity
   can be controlled by adjusting the ratio of the secondary Ab in the
   complex or by changing the color development time. This technique is
   further optimized to detect trace amounts of proteins adsorbed onto
   poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP)-modified silicon surfaces (Si-PVP), and
   the results are close to the radiolabeling method. It is concluded that
   the simple one-step ELISA can be used for the rapid detection of trace
   amount of protein. The method holds promise for the clinical detection

Abstract = {{A process for the gram scale synthesis of the oxygen bridged dimer of
   boron subphthalocyanine, mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2), has been developed. During
   the development it was found that a wide range of reaction pathways
   under diverse conditions lead to mu oxo-(BsubPc)(2) formation. However,
   obtaining mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2) as the main reaction product in appreciable
   yields and its subsequent isolation were extremely challenging. The best
   balance of purity, yield and conversion was achieved with a time
   controlled reaction of an equimolar reaction of HO-BsubPc with Br-BsubPc
   in the presence of K3PO4. The purification involved sequentially Soxhlet
   extraction, Kauffman column chromatography and train sublimation. We
   have repeated the process and yields ranged from 27 to 30\% of pure,
   doubly-sublimed mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2). This process also enabled the
   synthesis of unsymmetric mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2)s by reaction of HO-BsubPc
   with Br-F(12)BsubPc, Cl-Cl(6)BsubPc and Cl-Cl(12)BsubPc. After synthesis
   the solution-state properties of the unsymmetric mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2)s
   were investigated, and compared to the symmetric mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2) and
   more broadly to other BsubPcs. The electronic properties of
   mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2) were found to differ from its unsymmetric
   counterparts, but were found to be similar to halo-BsubPcs. Furthermore,
   the photophysical properties of mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2), both symmetric and
   unsymmetric, differed greatly from all other known BsubPcs.}},

Abstract = {{Notched semi-circular bend (NSCB) specimen has been successfully used in
   fracture tests of brittle materials. As a suggested method for measuring
   the dynamic fracture toughness of rocks by the International Society for
   Rock Mechanics (ISRM), this method only measures the fracture initiation
   toughness of the sample with given external load and geometrical
   parameters. Using the digital image correlation (DIC) method combined
   with ultra-high speed photography, the objective of this paper is to
   measure more fracture parameters of the NSCB specimen loaded by a split
   Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system. The displacement and strain fields
   during the fracture propagation process were determined using DIC
   method. The location of the crack tip, the fracture initiation toughness
   and the fracture propagation toughness were subsequently calculated
   using the deformation fields. Compared with the traditional NSCB tests,
   the optical method of DIC provides much more information on the fracture
   propagation process.}},

Abstract = {{Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and
   their associated Cas proteins comprise a prokaryotic RNA-guided adaptive
   immune system that interferes with mobile genetic elements, such as
   plasmids and phages. The type I-E CRISPR interference complex Cascade
   from Escherichia coli is composed of five different Cas proteins and a
   61-nt-long guide RNA (crRNA). crRNAs contain a unique 32-nt spacer
   flanked by a repeat-derived 5' handle (8 nt) and a 3' handle (21 nt).
   The spacer part of crRNA directs Cascade to DNA targets. Here, we show
   that the Escherichia coli Cascade can be expressed and purified from
   cells lacking crRNAs and loaded in vitro with synthetic crRNAs, which
   direct it to targets complementary to crRNA spacer. The deletion of even
   one nucleotide from the crRNA 5' handle disrupted its binding to Cascade
   and target DNA recognition. In contrast, crRNA variants with just a
   single nucleotide downstream of the spacer part bound Cascade and the
   resulting ribonucleotide complex containing a 41-nt-long crRNA
   specifically recognized DNA targets. Thus, the Escherichia coli
   Cascade-crRNA system exhibits significant flexibility suggesting that
   this complex can be engineered for applications in genome editing and
   opening the way for incorporation of site-specific labels in crRNA.}},

Title = {{Erosion modeling in abrasive slurry jet micro-machining of brittle
   materials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Pages = {{127-140}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Abrasive slurry jet micro-machining (ASJM) uses a relatively low
   pressure jet of abrasive slurry to machine features such as holes and
   channels. This study investigated the effect of alumina particle kinetic
   energy and jet impact angle on the roughness and erosion rate of
   channels machined in borosilicate glass using ASJM. A computational
   fluid dynamics model was used to calculate the local particle impact
   velocities and angles, and thus the kinetic energies of particles
   striking the surface. Consistent with earlier work on air-driven
   abrasive jets, the roughness and erosion rate of the channels machined
   at perpendicular incidence depended only on the kinetic energy of
   particles above the apparent cracking threshold of the glass target.
   Slurry jets of higher kinetic energy produced rougher channels and
   higher erosion rates since the impacting particles caused larger lateral
   cracks to form, and thus removed larger chips. The measured erosion rate
   at various impact angles, and the observed damage due to individual
   alumina particle impacts, indicated that the dominant mode of material
   removal was brittle erosion. Two similar analytical brittle-erosion
   models derived for air-driven abrasive jet micromachining (AJM), were
   found to predict reasonably well the roughness and the erosion rate of
   ASJM channels, despite the large differences in the fluid media, flow
   patterns, and particle trajectories in AJM and ASJM. A key requirement
   was that the average particle kinetic energy was calculated using the
   CFD model. With only minor modifications, the models predicted the
   channel erosion rate and centreline roughness with average errors of
   12\% and 17\%, respectively. In addition, a numerical simulation,
   previously developed to predict the erosion in AJM of brittle materials,
   was used to predict the centreline average roughness, shape parameters
   and depth of ASJM channels for various machining conditions. (C) 2014

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Fluoro aluminum phthalocyanine (F-AlPc) was synthesized by simply
   heating a DMSO solution of chloro aluminum phthalocyanine (Cl-AlPc) in
   the presence of CsF, KF or NaF for less than an hour. The resulting
   F-AlPc has a significant blue shift in the absorbance of approximate to
   8 nm in solution and approximate to 130 nm in a solid film compared to
   Cl-AlPc. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) identified a
   change in work function and EHOMO of as much as 1 eV between Cl-AlPc and
   F-AlPc. Our observed change in UPS data, solid-state absorbance and
   sublimation temperature for F-AlPc further confirms the stacked fluorine
   bridge solid-state structure for F-AlPc previously described by Kenney
   et al. Preliminary planar heterojunction (PHJ) organic photovoltaic
   (OPV) devices were then fabricated using F-AlPc as an electron donating
   material paired with C-60 and a ternary device including a Cl-AlPc
   interlayer. Additionally, an all AlPc device where F-AlPc functioned as
   the electron donor and Cl-AlPc as the electron acceptor was fabricated.
   The EQE plots of the resulting PHJ OPV devices illustrate that an
   exciton-rectifying layer is present between the Cl-AlPc and F-AlPc
   layers in the ternary devices as well as the all AlPc device. These
   results further exemplify that the seemingly minor change from chloride
   to fluoride in the AlPc structure has significant implications in
   optoelectronic properties and functionality of AlPc in PHJ OPV devices.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of clinical engineering certification in Canada started in
   1980 with the development of a Canadian Board of Examiners, which used
   both written and oral examination methods to determine candidates'
   eligibility for certification. After an initial burst of activity, the
   number of applicants coming to the Board slowed down, to the point where
   the Board effectively ceased to function for an extended period. Renewed
   interest in the first decade of this century led to a fresh initiative
   to re-establish the Board. This time, it was decided to twin the
   activities of the Canadian Board with its United States counterpart, to
   the extent possible, to try to ensure the sustainability of the Canadian
   Board. Thanks to support from US colleagues, the new Canadian Board is
   in place, with a process that is closely aligned with that of the US.
   The main differences are the need to examine Canadian candidates on
   codes, standards and regulations that are Canada-specific, and the
   requirement in each Canadian province or territory for licensure as a
   professional engineer if the title engineer is to be used. The Canadian
   and US Boards are both accountable to the Healthcare Technology
   Certification Commission.}},

Title = {{Characterization of Neuronal Death and Functional Deficits following
   Nerve Injury during the Early Postnatal Developmental Period in Rats}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to adult rat nerve injury models, neonatal sciatic nerve
   crush leads to massive motor and sensory neuron death. Death of these
   neurons results from both the loss of functional contact between the
   nerve terminals and their targets, and the inability of immature Schwann
   cells in the distal stump of the injured nerve to sustain regeneration.
   However, current dogma holds that little to no nnotoneuron death occurs
   in response to nerve crush at postnatal day 5 (P5). The purpose of the
   current study was to fully characterize the extent of motor and sensory
   neuronal death and functional recovery following sciatic nerve crush at
   midthigh level in rats at postnatal days 3-30 (P3-P30), and then compare
   this to adult injured animals. Following nerve crush at P3, motoneuron
   numbers were reduced to 35\% of that of naive uninjured animals. Animals
   in the P5 and P7 group also displayed statistically fewer motoneurons
   than naive animals. Animals that were injured at P30 or earlier
   displayed statistically lower sensory neuron counts in the dorsal root
   ganglion than naive controls. Surprisingly, complete behavioral recovery
   was observed exclusively in the P30 and adult injured groups. Similar
   results were observed in muscle twitch/tetanic force analysis, motor
   unit number estimation and wet muscle weights. Rats in both the P5 and
   P7 injury groups displayed significant neuronal death and impaired
   functional recovery following injury, challenging current dogma and
   suggesting that severe deficits persist following nerve injury during
   this early postnatal developmental period. These findings have important
   implications concerning the timing of neonatal nerve injury in rats. (C)

Abstract = {{With data storage and sharing services in the cloud, users can easily
   modify and share data as a group. To ensure shared data integrity can be
   verified publicly, users in the group need to compute signatures on all
   the blocks in shared data. Different blocks in shared data are generally
   signed by different users due to data modifications performed by
   different users. For security reasons, once a user is revoked from the
   group, the blocks which were previously signed by this revoked user must
   be re-signed by an existing user. The straightforward method, which
   allows an existing user to download the corresponding part of shared
   data and re-sign it during user revocation, is inefficient due to the
   large size of shared data in the cloud. In this paper, we propose a
   novel public auditing mechanism for the integrity of shared data with
   efficient user revocation in mind. By utilizing the idea of proxy
   re-signatures, we allow the cloud to resign blocks on behalf of existing
   users during user revocation, so that existing users do not need to
   download and re-sign blocks by themselves. In addition, a public
   verifier is always able to audit the integrity of shared data without
   retrieving the entire data from the cloud, even if some part of shared
   data has been re-signed by the cloud. Moreover, our mechanism is able to
   support batch auditing by verifying multiple auditing tasks
   simultaneously. Experimental results show that our mechanism can
   significantly improve the efficiency of user revocation.}},

Title = {{Understanding recovery boiler smelt runoff phenomena}},
Journal = {{TAPPI JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{41-50}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{There is considerable interest in the nature and causes of heavy smelt
   runoff from recovery boilers because of the role it has played in
   numerous dissolving tank explosions and for personnel safety around the
   dissolving tank. Most mills have experienced runoff problems, which can
   be caused by cleaning plugged spouts, burning down a large bed, low
   sulfidity smelt, startup with a bed in the unit, and improper firing
   practices. The peak smelt flow during a runoff is often 3 to 5 times
   normal and may be much greater in severe cases. Heavy runoffs are
   self-limiting and typically last less than 30 min. The geometry of the
   lower furnace plays a significant role in runoff events. Sloped floor
   units are more vulnerable to smelt pool buildup and heavy runoff when
   released. Decanting bottom units are inherently more tolerant of smelt
   pool buildup. Low sulfidity results in smelt with a high melting
   temperature, making the smelt easy to freeze and difficult to flow.
   Sulfate-rich slag/deposits falling on the hearth from the upper furnace
   can contribute significantly to runoff problems by causing dams and
   spout plugging, increasing the load of smelt pool to be removed,
   decreasing bed temperatures, and lowering the sulfidity of the smelt
   leaving the furnace.}},

Journal = {{TAPPI JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{51-60}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Sootblowing technology used in recovery boilers originated from that
   used in coal-fired boilers. It started with manual cleaning with hand
   lancing and hand blowing, and evolved slowly into online sootblowing
   using retractable sootblowers. Since 1991, intensive research and
   development has focused on sootblowing jet fundamentals and deposit
   removal in recovery boilers. The results have provided much insight into
   sootblower jet hydrodynamics, how a sootblower jet interacts with tubes
   and deposits, and factors influencing its deposit removal efficiency,
   and have led to two important innovations: fully-expanded sootblower
   nozzles that are used in virtually all recovery boilers today, and the
   low pressure sootblowing technology that has been implemented in several
   new recovery boilers. The availability of powerful computing systems,
   superfast microprocessors and data acquisition systems, and versatile
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling capability in the past two
   decades has also contributed greatly to the advancement of sootblowing
   technology. High quality infrared inspection cameras have enabled mills
   to inspect the deposit buildup conditions in the boiler during
   operation, and helped identify problems with sootblower lance swinging
   and superheater platens and boiler bank tube vibrations. As the recovery
   boiler firing capacity and steam parameters have increased markedly in
   recent years, sootblowers have become larger and longer, and this can
   present a challenge in terms of both sootblower design and operation.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of photodetectors is judged via high responsivity, fast
   speed of response, and low background current. Many previously reported
   photodetectors based on size-tuned colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have
   relied either on photodiodes, which, since they are primary photocarrier
   devices, lack gain; or photoconductors, which provide gain but at the
   expense of slow response (due to delayed charge carrier escape from
   sensitizing centers) and an inherent dark current vs responsivity
   trade-off. Here we report a photojunction field-effect transistor
   (photoJFET), which provides gain while breaking prior photoconductors
   response/speed/dark current trade-off. This is achieved by ensuring
   that, in the dark, the channel is fully depleted due to a rectifying
   junction between a deep-work-function transparent conductive top contact
   (MoO3) and a moderately n-type CQD film (iodine treated PbS CQDs). We
   characterize the rectifying behavior of the junction and the linearity
   of the channel characteristics under illumination, and we observe a 10
   mu s rise time, a record for a gain-providing, low-dark-current CQD
   photodetector. We prove, using an analytical model validated using
   experimental measurements, that for a given response time the device
   provides a two-orders-of-magnitude improvement in
   photocurrent-to-dark-current ratio compared to photoconductors. The
   photoJFET, which relies on a junction gate-effect, enriches the growing
   family of CQD photosensitive transistors.}},

   targeting}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{2756-2767}},
Abstract = {{Nanoparticles are suitable platforms for cancer targeting and diagnostic
   applications. Typically, less than 10\% of all systemically administered
   nanoparticles accumulate in the tumour. Here we explore the interactions
   of blood components with nanoparticles and describe how these
   interactions influence solid tumour targeting. In the blood, serum
   proteins adsorb onto nanoparticles to form a protein corona in a manner
   dependent on nanoparticle physicochemical properties. These serum
   proteins can block nanoparticle tumour targeting ligands from binding to
   tumour cell receptors. Additionally, serum proteins can also encourage
   nanoparticle uptake by macrophages, which decreases nanoparticle
   availability in the blood and limits tumour accumulation. The formation
   of this protein corona will also increase the nanoparticle hydrodynamic
   size or induce aggregation, which makes nanoparticles too large to enter
   into the tumour through pores of the leaky vessels, and prevents their
   deep penetration into tumours for cell targeting. Recent studies have
   focused on developing new chemical strategies to reduce or eliminate
   serum protein adsorption, and rescue the targeting potential of
   nanoparticles to tumour cells. An in-depth and complete understanding of
   nanoparticle-blood interactions is key to designing nanoparticles with
   optimal physicochemical properties with high tumour accumulation. The
   purpose of this review article is to describe how the protein corona
   alters the targeting of nanoparticles to solid tumours and explains
   current solutions to solve this problem.}},

   Metamaterial loading is incorporated in one patch to control the

   via a novel synthesis strategy involving biomass pre-treatment, nitrogen
   pyrolysis, and a high temperature thermal-chemical flash exfoliation.
   The exfoliation strategy resulted in porous carbon nanosheets with BET
   specific surface area of 543.7 m(2) g(-1), far higher than the 7.9 m(2)
   g(-1) of the natural biochar produced without any pre- or post-treatment
   modifications. The exfoliated material also showed increased oxygen
   functionality in the form of electrochemically active quinone and pyrone
   surface groups. This combination of high specific surface area and
   highly active surface functional groups resulted in very promising
   capacitive performance, demonstrating a high capacitance of 221 F g(-1),
   over 100 times greater than the natural biochar. The exfoliated biochar
   electrodes fabricated without any conductive or organic additives showed
   outstanding high rate capability retaining 78\% of their low rate
   capacitance at a fast 40 A g(-1) discharge. This combination of high
   capacitance and fast charge-discharge capability distinguishes this
   material from most other high surface area activated carbons; in fact,
   the electrochemical behaviour more closely resembles that of designer
   nanomaterials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes. The biochar
   electrodes were also extremely durable showing only a 3\% reduction in
   capacitance after 5000 successive potential cycles. The exfoliation
   strategy developed here could provide a novel route for the low cost
   production of high performance energy storage materials from a variety
   of waste biomass feedstocks.}},

Abstract = {{Due to increasing waste production and disposal problems arising from
   synthetic polymer production, there is a critical need to substitute
   materials with biodegradable and renewable resources. Attempts to use
   laccases as a catalyst to enhance the catalytic properties of enzymes
   have shown them to be a promising solution for bark depolymerization. In
   this study, eight different fungal strains were tested for laccase
   enzyme production during submerged fermentation (SF), and the Pleurotus
   species were shown to be the best producers among the competing fungal
   strains. P. pulmonarius mainly produces laccase enzyme in production
   medium (PM) at initial conditions of pH 5.5 and 30 degrees C. Bark
   depolymerization was conducted in SF and we identified
   polyphenols/polyaromatic compounds after four weeks when the PM was
   induced with 50 mg per 100 mL of each bark during the lag-phase. During
   SF where honey was used as a natural mediator substitute (NMS) in the
   PM, laccase activities were about 1.5 times higher than those found in
   comparable cultures without honey in the PM. These samples were analyzed
   by GC-MS/ MS. The laccase enzyme was purified using UNO (R) sphere Q-1
   anion exchange chromatography and the molecular weight was determined to
   be similar to 50 kDa on 10\% SDS-PAGE. The laccase kinetic parameters
   V-max, K-m, and turnover number (K-cat) were found to be 76.9 mu M
   min(-1), 909 mM and 739 min(-1), respectively, from a Lineweaver-Burk
   plot. Furthermore, laccases are suitable for biotechnological
   applications that transform bark biomass into high value bark
   biopolymers/biochemicals. The differences observed among the identified
   aromatic compound MS/MS profiles were due to the utilization of two
   different bark species. Py-GC-MS analysis of bark showed differing
   effects of fungal activity on bark composition. Polyphenolics were
   separated in reverse-phase mode using HPLC with a pinnacle DB Biphenyl,
   C18 column, and UV detector. Two recognition wavelengths of 290 and 340
   nm were selected to improve the separation of each single compound in
   monofloral honey and bark-fermented samples. This study is novel because
   it replaces natural mediators (NM) with monofloral honey in PM and bark
   materials impregnated with honey, and studies the effects of
   fungi-derived laccases on bark biopolymers.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigated the application of several fluorescence
   excitation-emission matrix analysis methods as natural organic matter
   (NOM) indicators for use in predicting the formation of trihalomethanes
   (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). Waters from four different sources
   (two rivers and two lakes) were subjected to jar testing followed by 24
   hr disinfection by-product formation tests using chlorine. NOM was
   quantified using three common measures: dissolved organic carbon,
   ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm, and specific ultraviolet absorbance as
   well as by principal component analysis, peak picking, and parallel
   factor analysis of fluorescence spectra. Based on multi-linear modeling
   of THMs and HAAs, principle component (PC) scores resulted in the lowest
   mean squared prediction error of cross-folded test sets (THMs: 43.7 (mu
   g/L)(2), HAAs: 233.3 (mu g/L)(2)). Inclusion of principle components
   representative of protein-like material significantly decreased
   prediction error for both THMs and HAAs. Parallel factor analysis did
   not identify a protein-like component and resulted in prediction errors
   similar to traditional NOM surrogates as well as fluorescence peak
   picking. These results support the value of fluorescence
   excitation-emission matrix-principal component analysis as a suitable
   NOM indicator in predicting the formation of THMs and HAAs for the water
   sources studied. (C) 2014 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental

Abstract = {{It is well accepted that the breakage of wastewater suspended particles
   (flocs) can lead to better disinfection of effluent, especially when
   utilizing ultraviolet irradiation as the disinfection method. In this
   work, the breakage of wastewater flocs in orifice flow was investigated
   through numerical simulations. The strain rate along particle paths was
   estimated using computational fluid dynamics. Assuming that particle
   breakage occurs if the maximum strain rate experienced by the particle
   exceeds a critical threshold value, breakage of wastewater particles was
   predicted. The effectiveness of the model was supported by simple
   experiments. Based on the numerical simulations, under the same nominal
   orifice strain rate, particle breakage was higher in single-orifice
   systems compared to that of multi-orifice systems. This finding was
   further confirmed through experimentation. Furthermore, simulation
   results revealed that while single-orifice systems were the preferred
   choice for the breakage of strong particles, multi-orifice systems might
   be more effective in breaking `weak' particles.}},

   became polarized and were attracted towards the interior part of the
   structure, forming 3D cellular patterns. Experiments were conducted to
   evaluate the manipulation and the patterning processes with the proposed
   structure. Results show that with the presence of a voltage input, this
   multi-layer structure was capable of manipulating different types of
   biological cells examined through dielectrophoresis, enabling automatic
   cell patterning in the time-scale of minutes. The effects of the voltage
   input on the resultant cellular pattern were examined and discussed.
   Viability test was performed after the patterning operation and the
   results confirmed that majority of the cells remained viable. After 7
   days of culture, 3D cellular patterns were observed through SEM. The
   results suggest that this scaffold and its automated
   dielectrophoresis-based patterning mechanism can be used to construct
   artificial tissues for various tissue engineering applications.}},

   crystals}},
Journal = {{Nature Communications}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Leaky-Wave Antennas (LWAs) enable directive and scannable radiation
   patterns, which are highly desirable attributes at terahertz, infrared
   and optical frequencies. However, a LWA is generally incapable of
   continuous beam scanning through broadside, due to an open stopband in
   its dispersion characteristic. This issue is yet to be addressed at
   frequencies beyond microwaves, mainly as existing microwave solutions
   (for example, transmission line metamaterials) are unavailable at these
   higher frequencies. Here we report leaky-wave radiation from the
   interface of a photonic crystal (PC) with a Dirac-type dispersion and
   air. The resulting Dirac LWA (DLWA) can radiate at broadside, chiefly
   owing to the closed G-point bandgap of the Dirac PC. Thus, the DLWA can
   continuously scan a directive beam over a wide range of angles by
   varying the frequency. These DLWAs can be designed at microwave as well
   as terahertz to optical frequencies, with feasible dimensions and low
   losses.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of the ester moiety on soot formation and species
   concentrations in a laminar coflow diffusion flame of a surrogate for a
   B100 biodiesel are investigated. The surrogate is a mixture of 50\%
   n-decane/50\% methyl-octanoate (molar) to represent methyl-oleate. The
   combustion chemistry and soot formation are solved using a mechanism
   with 288 species and 2073 reactions coupled with a sectional soot model,
   respectively. Soot volume fraction (f(v)) and temperature profiles are
   compared to the experimentally measured values for this biodiesel
   surrogate. In addition, the effects of the ester moiety on soot
   formation and flame chemistry are studied by numerically comparing the
   biodiesel surrogate flame with a pure n-decane flame. The model predicts
   both temperature and f(v) profiles with a good accuracy. Some
   discrepancies for f(v) on the flame centerline are observed between the
   model and the experiments; it is suggested that these discrepancies are
   because the model and the experiment cannot distinguish nascent
   transparent soot from mature soot and because the mechanism
   under-predicts PAH formation rates. Both n-decane and B100 surrogate
   flames have similar f(v) and temperature profiles when both flames have
   the same energy input. This suggests that the ester moiety does not have
   a major impact on soot formation. In addition, early production of CO
   and higher concentrations of some oxygenated species such as
   formaldehyde are observed in the predicted concentration contour plots
   of the B100 surrogate flame when they are compared to the n-decane
   flame. Reaction pathway analysis reveals that the higher peak
   concentrations of formaldehyde and the early production of CO from CH2CO
   and CH3CO2 that come directly from the ester moiety in the B100
   surrogate are much more pronounced than other species in the B100
   surrogate flame and are recognized as the main differentiating
   characteristics of the B100 surrogate flame from the n-decane flame. (C)

Title = {{The importance of reversibility in modeling soot nucleation and
   condensation processes}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1787-1794}},
Abstract = {{Given the upcoming EURO 6 regulations, which include limits on particle
   number density (and hence size) for soot emissions from land vehicles,
   soot models must be capable of accurately predicting soot particle
   sizes. Previous modeling work has demonstrated the importance of the
   relative strengths of nucleation and condensation in predicting soot
   primary particle size; however, fundamental models still rely on tunable
   constants for modeling both processes, which limits predictive
   capability. Recent investigations into nucleation and condensation
   processes suggest that both processes are not thermodynamically favored
   to occur from 5-ringed PAHs, yet 5-ringed PAHs have been experimentally
   observed in abundance within nascent soot particles. This contradiction
   leads to the understanding that nucleation and condensation from
   5-ringed PAHs is plausible, although they are likely highly reversible
   processes.
   A fundamental reversible model for nucleation and condensation is
   developed through the use of statistical mechanics and the results from
   several recent works. The model is highly sensitive to both the binding
   energy and the vibration frequencies created during the nucleation and
   condensation processes, although reasonable values are obtained through
   an extensive literature review. A model for tracking the PAHs on the
   surface of soot particles is developed, which allows for the calculation
   of the reverse rate of nucleation and condensation. The inclusion of
   reversibility in the nucleation and condensation subroutines enables the
   model to accurately reproduce all relevant soot morphological parameters
   determined experimentally for the atmospheric pressure, laminar,
   ethylene-air Santoro flame. This is due to more accurate partitioning of
   PAH mass through the nucleation and condensation processes. The
   developed reversible model represents an advancement in fundamental soot
   formation modeling by replacing tunable constants with fundamental
   physics. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Combustion

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Driving cycles are an important input for state-of-the-art vehicle
   emission models. Development of a driving cycle requires
   second-by-second vehicle speed for a representative set of vehicles.
   Current standard driving cycles cannot reflect or forecast changes in
   traffic conditions. This paper introduces a method to develop
   representative driving cycles using simulated data from a calibrated
   microscopic traffic simulation model of the Toronto Waterfront Area. The
   simulation model is calibrated to reflect road counts, link speeds, and
   accelerations using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The simulation
   is validated by comparing simulated vs. observed passenger freeway
   cycles. The simulation method is applied to develop AM peak hour driving
   cycles for light, medium and heavy duty trucks. The demonstration
   reveals differences in speed, acceleration, and driver aggressiveness
   between driving cycles for different vehicle types. These driving cycles
   are compared against a range of available driving cycles, showing
   different traffic conditions and driving behaviors, and suggesting a
   need for city-specific driving cycles. Emissions from the simulated
   driving cycles are also compared with EPA's Heavy Duty Urban Dynamometer
   Driving Schedule showing higher emission factors for the Toronto
   Waterfront cycles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the distributed spectrum sensing in cognitive
   radio networks. Existing distributed consensus-based fusion algorithms
   only ensure equal gain combining of local measurements, whose
   performance may be incomparable to various centralized soft combining
   schemes. Motivated by this fact, we consider practical channel
   conditions and link failures, and develop new weighted soft measurement
   combining without a centralized fusion center. Following the measurement
   by its energy detector, each secondary user exchanges its own
   measurement statistics with its local one-hop neighbors, and chooses the
   information exchanging rate according to the measurement channel
   condition, e.g., the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We rigorously prove
   the convergence of the new consensus algorithm, and show all secondary
   users hold the same global decision statistics from the weighted soft
   measurement combining throughout the network. We also provide
   distributed optimal weight design under uncorrelated measurement
   channels. The convergence rate of the consensus iteration is given under
   the assumption that each communication link has an independent
   probability to fail, and the upper bound of the iteration number of the
   epsilon-convergence is explicitly given as a function of system
   parameters. Simulation results show significant improvement of the
   sensing performance compared to existing consensus-based approaches, and
   the performance of the distributed weighted design is comparable to the
   centralized weighted combining scheme.}},

Abstract = {{This study is part of an ongoing program to develop a new CF/Flax/Epoxy
   bone fracture plate to be used in orthopedic trauma applications. The
   purpose was to determine this new plate's in-vitro effects on the level
   of bone formation genes, as well as cell viability in comparison with a
   medical grade metal (i.e. stainless steel) commonly employed for
   fabrication of bone plates (positive control). Cytotoxicity and
   osteogenesis induced by wear debris of the material were assessed using
   Methyl Tetrazolium (MTT) assay and reverse transcription polymerase
   chain reaction (RT-PCR) for 3 osteogenesis specific gene markers,
   including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP2), runt-related transcription
   factor 2 (Runx2) and Osterix. Moreover, the Flax/Epoxy and CF/Epoxy
   composites were examined separately for their wettability properties by
   water absorption and contact angle (CA) tests using the sessile drop
   technique. The MIT results for indirect and direct assays indicated that
   the CF/Flax/Epoxy composite material showed comparable cell viability
   with no cytotoxicity at all incubation times to that of the metal group
   (p >= 0.05). Osteogenesis test results showed that the expression level
   of Runx2 marker induced by CF/Flax/Epoxy were significantly higher than
   those induced by metal after 48 h (p = 0.57). Also, the Flax/Epoxy
   composite revealed a hydrophilic character (CA = 68.07 degrees +/- 2.05
   degrees) and absorbed more water up to 17.2\% compared to CF/Epoxy,
   which reached 125\% due to its hydrophobic character (CA = 93.22 degrees
   +/- 1.95 degrees) (p < 0.001). Therefore, the new CF/Flax/Epoxy may be a
   potential candidate for medical applications as a bone fracture plate,
   as it showed similar cell viability with no negative effect on gene
   expression levels responsible for bone formation compared to medical
   grade stainless steel. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Assess the accuracy, precision, and sources of error using a
   preclinical MR-guided focused ultrasound system.
   Methods: A preclinical focused ultrasound system, described previously
   {[}Chopra et al., Med. Phys. 36(5), 1867-1874 (2009)], was tested on a
   benchtop and with 3T GE, 3T Philips, and 7T Bruker MR scanners for
   spatial targeting accuracy and precision. Randomly distributed
   water-filled holes drilled into a polystyrene plate were imaged using
   MRI and targeted using treatment planning software. The ultrasound focus
   of a 72 mm, f-number 0.8, 1.16 MHz transducer was aimed at the target
   locations, and 1-2 s continuous-wave sonications were performed on clear
   polystyrene plates to create localized spots of melted plastic. The
   distance between target and observed locations was measured and
   analyzed. Retrospective analysis of targeting accuracy was performed on
   preclinical data obtained from other experiments at their institution
   using the same system.
   Results: The results suggest that the sources of targeting error under
   MR guidance can be roughly separated into three components-normally
   distributed random error; constant shift from inaccuracy in detection of
   the initial ultrasound focus; and angular misalignment between MR and
   focused ultrasound (FUS) coordinates. The lower bound on the targeting
   error was estimated to be 0.25 +/- 0.13 mm, while the maximum observed
   targeting error did not exceed 2 mm. Measures required to reduce errors
   and improve targeting were developed to reduce the registration and
   misalignment errors such that maximum error was reduced to 0.36 +/- 0.14
   mm. Retrospective in vivo analysis indicated that the error was 1.02 +/-
   0.43 mm, including error extrinsic to the system.
   Conclusions: The FUS system, as described, is capable of precise and
   accurate sonications. The largest source of error-misregistration of the
   coordinate systems of the scanner and ultrasound system-was addressed
   which reduced the error to 0.36 +/- 0.14 mm, sufficient for many
   preclinical applications. (C) 2015 American Association of Physicists in

Title = {{Dynamic Low-Power Reconfiguration of Real-Time Systems With Periodic and
   Probabilistic Tasks}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the dynamic low-power reconfiguration of a
   real-time system. It processes periodic and probabilistic tasks that
   have hard/soft deadlines corresponding to internal/external events. A
   runtime event-based reconfiguration scenario is a dynamic operation
   allowing the addition/removal of the assumed periodic/probabilistic
   tasks. Thereafter, some tasks may miss their hard deadlines and the
   power consumption may increase. In order to reconfigure the system to be
   feasible, i.e., satisfying its real-time constraints with low-power
   consumption, this research presents a software-agent-based architecture.
   An intelligent agent is developed, which provides four solutions to
   reconfigure the system at runtime. For these solutions, in order to
   reconfigure the probabilistic tasks to be feasible, the agent modifies
   their temporal parameters dynamically; moreover, in order to feasibly
   serve the probabilistic tasks and reduce the system's power consumption,
   the agent provides three virtual processors by dynamically extending the
   periods of the periodic tasks. A simulation study verifies the
   effectiveness of the agent.
   Note to Practitioners-This study addresses new challenges in the
   real-time industrial systems by proposing original solutions for their
   low-power reconfiguration. This contribution is significant for future
   generations of low-power technology. A runtime event-based
   reconfiguration scenario is technically defined as any operation that
   works by adding/removing tasks. An agent-based architecture is
   developed, where an intelligent software agent is implemented to check
   the system's runtime evolution. The agent presents useful technical
   solutions to reconfigure the system in order to meet the temporal
   constraints of the tasks and satisfy the system's low-power consumption.
   It can also be deployed in reconfigurable real-time embedded systems
   such as lap-tops, mobile phones, and personal digital assistants.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses a utility-theoretic joint econometric model to
   investigate the factors affecting mode choice and travel distance of
   older people (age 65+) along with the interrelationship between these
   two. The main objective is to investigate the effects of modal
   accessibility on travel distance requirements of older people and
   resulting implications of social exclusions. Empirical models are
   estimated by using a household travel survey conducted in the National
   Capital Region (NCR) of Canada. The empirical model reveals that older
   people living in the NCR often need to travel longer distances for
   engaging in various activities because of poor modal accessibility. It
   is also evident that the effects of accessibility are not the same
   across the region. Older people living far from the central business
   district (CBD) need to travel longer distances compared to the older
   people living close to the CBD. With an increasingly older population in
   the region, an increasing of risk of transportation-related social
   exclusion may be implied because of the need for longer distance travel
   to engage in activities. Most importantly, such implications in the NCR
   is driven more by the region's urban form and land use patterns than the
   performance of the regional transportation system.}},

   demonstrated that the presence of stratified flow enhanced particle
   removal in the tank. A higher air fraction was shown to be needed at

   of commercially available enzymes was carried out using capillary
   suction time to assess biosludge dewaterability. The only enzyme that
   showed dewatering improvements in the screening tests was a lysozyme
   which reduced the capillary suction time by 36\% and increased the cake
   solids content from 5.6 to 8.9 DS\%. Lysozyme aided in the flocculation
   of particles reducing the polymer demand from 11\% to 6\%. Active and
   inactive lysozyme exhibited a similar ability for enhancing sludge
   dewatering, indicating that the conditioning mechanism of lysozyme is
   similar to that of a flocculant. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The rationale for this study lies in the well-known predilection for
   vascular disease of the carotid bifurcation, attributed to an altered
   shear stress distribution at the luminal surface and mitigated by
   helical fluid structures establishing inside the bifurcation. Here we
   investigate the mechanistic role played by the common carotid artery
   (CCA) in promoting complex intravascular flow and in influencing the
   hemodynamics at the distal carotid bifurcation. Fifty-five image-based
   computational hemodynamic models of eleven right carotid geometries were
   reconstructed from its brachiocephalic origin to above the bifurcation
   to assess how five different CCA reconstruction length affects
   intravascular fluid structures entering the bifurcation. A quantitative
   description of helical flow is adopted, in parallel to the description
   of disturbed shear at the bifurcation luminal surface. Our findings
   support the hypothesis that helical flow in CCA might reduce the
   likelihood of flow disturbances at the bifurcation. This confirms the
   physiological role of CCA in transporting and enforcing helical flow
   structures into the bifurcation, giving further contribution to the
   helicity-driven suppression of disturbed shear. A quantitative analysis
   of CCA geometry highlights the beneficial effect of proximal CCA
   curvature on helical flow and shows the complex interlacement among CCA
   geometry, helical flow, and disturbed shear at the bifurcation. Since
   helicity-based descriptors and geometric descriptors relative to the
   bifurcation have been shown to be significant predictors of disturbed
   shear, in principle they may be augmented by factors related to CCA
   geometry and hemodynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) is a flexible, easyto- implement
   technique for measuring blood flow speeds in- vivo. In order to obtain
   reliable quantitative data from LSCI the object must remain in the focal
   plane of the imaging system for the duration of the measurement session.
   However, since LSCI suffers from inherent frame- to- frame noise, it
   often requires a moving average filter to produce quantitative results.
   This frame- to- frame noise also makes the implementation of rapid
   autofocus system challenging. In this work, we demonstrate an autofocus
   method and system based on a novel measure of misfocus which serves as
   an accurate and noise- robust feedback mechanism. This measure of
   misfocus is shown to enable the localization of best focus with sub-
   depth- of- field sensitivity, yielding more accurate estimates of blood
   flow speeds and blood vessel diameters. (C) 2014 Optical Society of

Title = {{Genesis of folia in a non-thermal epigenic cave (Matanzas, Cuba)}},

Abstract = {{Folia are an unusual speleothem type resembling inverted cups or bracket
   fungi. The mechanism of folia formation is not fully understood and is
   the subject of an ongoing debate. This study focuses on an occurrence of
   folia present in Santa Catalina Cave, a non-thermal epigenic cave
   located close to Matanzas (Cuba). The sedimentology, morphology,
   petrology, permeability and geochemistry of these folia have been
   studied to gain new insight on the processes leading to their
   development. It is concluded that folia in Santa Catalina Cave formed at
   the top of a fluctuating water body, through CO2-degassing or
   evaporation, which may have been enhanced by the proximity to cave
   entrances. Two observations strongly support our conclusions. (1) When
   compared to other subaqueous speleothems (e.g. cave clouds) present in
   the same rooms, folia occur exclusively within a limited vertical
   interval that likely represents an ancient water level. Folia occur
   together with calcite rafts and tower cones that developed,
   respectively, on top of and below the water level. This suggests that a
   fluctuating interface is required for folia formation. (2) The measured
   permeability of the folia is too high to trap gas bubbles. Thus, in
   contrast to what has been proposed in other studies, trapped bubbles of
   CO2 cannot be invoked as the key factor determining the genesis and
   morphology of folia in this subaqueous environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The TSI Fast Mobility Particle Sizer (FMPS) and Engine Exhaust Particle
   Sizer (EEPS) provide size distributions for 6-560 nm particles with a
   time resolution suitable for characterizing transient particle sources;
   however, the accuracy of these instruments can be source dependent, due
   to influences of particle morphology. The aim of this study was to
   develop a source-independent correction protocol for the FMPS and EEPS.
   The correction protocol consists of: (1) broadening the >80 nm size
   range of the distribution to account for under-sizing by the FMPS and
   EEPS; (2) applying an existing correction protocol in the 8-93 nm size
   range; and (3) dividing each size bin by the ratio of total
   concentration measured by the FMPS or EEPS and a water-based
   Condensation Particle Counter (CPC) as a surrogate scaling factor to
   account for particle morphology. Efficacy of the correction protocol was
   assessed for three sources: urban ambient air, diluted gasoline direct
   injection engine exhaust, and diluted diesel engine exhaust. Linear
   regression against a reference instrument, the Scanning Mobility
   Particle Sizer (SMPS), before and after applying the correction protocol
   demonstrated that the correction ensured agreement within 20\%. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We consider the secret key generation problem when sources are randomly
   excited by the sender and there is a noiseless public discussion
   channel. Our setting is thus similar to recent works on channels with
   action-dependent states, where the channel state may be influenced by
   some of the parties involved. We derive single-letter expressions for
   the secret key capacity through a type of source emulation analysis. We
   also derive lower bounds on the achievable reliability and secrecy
   exponents, i.e., the exponential rates of decay of the probability of
   decoding error and of the information leakage. These exponents allow us
   to determine a set of strongly achievable secret key rates. For degraded
   eavesdroppers, the maximum strongly achievable rate equals the secret
   key capacity; our exponents can also be specialized to previously known
   results. In deriving our strong achievability results, we introduce a
   coding scheme that combines wiretap coding (to excite the channel) and
   key extraction (to distill keys from residual randomness). The secret
   key capacity is naturally seen to be a combination of both source-and
   channel-type randomness. Through examples, we illustrate a fundamental
   interplay between the portion of the secret key rate due to each type of
   randomness. We also illustrate inherent tradeoffs between the achievable
   reliability and secrecy exponents. Our new scheme also naturally
   accommodates rate limits on the public discussion. We show that under
   rate constraints, we are able to achieve larger rates than those that
   can be attained through a pure source emulation strategy.}},

Title = {{Abrasive waterjet micro-machining of channels in metals: Comparison
   between machining in air and submerged in water}},

Abstract = {{Abrasive water jet technology can be used for micro-milling using
   recently developed miniaturized nozzles. Abrasive water jet (AWJ)
   machining is often used with both the nozzle tip and workpiece submerged
   in water to reduce noise and contain debris. This paper compares the
   performance of submerged and unsubmerged abrasive water jet
   micro-milling of channels in 316L stainless steel and 6061-T6 aluminum
   at various nozzle angles and standoff distances. The effect of
   submergence on the diameter and effective footprint of AWJ erosion
   footprints was measured and compared. It was found that the centerline
   erosion rate decreased with channel depth due to the spreading of the
   jet as the effective standoff distance increased, and because of the
   growing effect of stagnation as the channel became deeper. The erosive
   jet spread over a larger effective footprint in air than in water, since
   particles on the jet periphery were slowed much more quickly in water
   due to increased drag. As a result, the width of a channel machined in
   air was wider than that in water. Moreover, it was observed that the
   instantaneous erosion rate decreased with channel depth, and that this
   decrease was a function only of the channel cross-sectional geometry,
   being independent of the type of metal, the jet angle, the standoff
   distance, and regardless of whether the jet was submerged or in air, in
   either the forward or backward directions. It is shown that submerged
   AWJM results in narrower features than those produced while machining in
   air, without a decrease in centerline etch rate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Comparative study of the impacts of soil wettability during entrapped
   LNAPL removal by surfactant flooding in two different sand media}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{24-31}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) spills may cause soil wettability
   changes. Soils traditionally water-wet may become NAPL-wet or
   fractionally wet. Since soil wettability alterations may impact
   entrapped light NAPL (LNAPL) removal by surfactant flooding, the effects
   of soil wettability and NAPL contact time were investigated for graded
   sand and compared to uniform sand. The graded medium was expected to
   have higher entrapped LNAPL saturations and lower entrapped LNAPL
   removal after surfactant flooding.
   Capillary pressure-saturation (P (c)-S) tests (water-LNAPL) and
   waterflood and surfactant-flood column tests were performed using fine
   graded sand and compared with results previously reported for the
   uniform coarse-grained sand. Heptane and LNAPL collected from
   observation wells at a LNAPL-contaminated oil refinery were used as the
   ideal NAPL and field LNAPL, respectively. Four experimental conditions
   were investigated: (1) clean water-wet sand and heptane, (2) clean
   water-wet sand and field LNAPL, (3) fractionally wet sand and heptane
   and (4) fractionally wet sand and field LNAPL. LNAPL entrapment after
   waterflooding and the enhanced entrapped NAPL removal (surfactant-flood
   minus waterflood saturations) were evaluated after 2 h and 5 days of
   contact time. Two anionic surfactants, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate
   and a field-site surfactant, were applied at the submicellar
   concentration of 0.5 g/L.
   The P (c)-S curves obtained for heptane and the field LNAPL, for a given
   experimental condition, closely resembled each other owing to the
   similar interfacial tension behaviour observed for these LNAPLs. In
   contrast to the results reported previously for the uniform sand, the
   average entrapped saturations after waterflooding were variable for the
   finer graded medium; contact time had a significant effect on LNAPL
   entrapment for the graded clean sand medium with an increase of the
   entrapped LNAPL saturation from 17 to 28 \%. Although the removal for
   the fractionally wet medium was similar for both sand types, with
   average removals as high as 45 \%, the surfactant-flood column tests
   with the clean water-wet graded medium did not result in a consistent
   reduction of the entrapped saturations.
   The P (c)-S relationships demonstrated that heptane and the field LNAPL
   behave similarly during the P (c)-S tests. The column experiments
   revealed differences in entrapped LNAPL saturations among the two sand
   types as a result of contact time and fractional wettability. Pore
   structure heterogeneity impacted LNAPL saturations and entrapped LNAPL
   removal. Overall, soil wettability should be characterized prior to
   surfactant flooding. The use of anionic surfactants at submicellar
   concentrations may be beneficial at sites with fractionally wet media.}},

Abstract = {{Three types of wood pellets samples, including two types of commercial
   pellets and one type of lab-made control pellets were torrefied in a
   fixed bed unit to study the effect of thermal pretreatment on the
   quality of wood pellets. The quality of wood pellets was mainly
   characterized by the pellet density, bulk density, higher heating value,
   Meyer hardness, saturated moisture uptake, volumetric energy density,
   and energy yield. Results showed that torrefaction significantly
   decreased the pellet density, hardness, volumetric energy density, and
   energy yield. The higher heating value increased and the saturated
   moisture content decreased after torrefaction. In view of the lower
   density, lower hardness, lower volumetric energy density, and energy
   yield of torrefied pellets, it is recommended that biomass should be
   torrefied and then compressed to make strong pellets of high
   hydrophobicity and volumetric energy density. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The Opalinus Clay formation is currently being investigated as a
   potential host rock for the deep geological disposal of radioactive
   waste in Switzerland. Recently, a test tunnel was excavated at the Mont
   Terri underground rock laboratory CURL) as part of a long-term research
   project ({''}Full-scale Emplacement (FE) experiment{''}) aimed at
   studying the thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) effects induced by the
   presence of an underground repository. The objective of this paper is
   twofold. Firstly, the results of the rock mass monitoring programme
   carried out during the construction of the 3 m diameter, 50 m long FE
   tunnel are presented, with particular focus on the short-term
   deformation response. The deformation measurements, including geodetic
   monitoring of tunnel wall displacements, radial extensometers and
   longitudinal inclinometers, indicate a strong directionality in the
   excavation response. Secondly, the deformational behaviour observed in
   the field is analyzed using a hybrid finite-discrete element (FDEM)
   analysis to obtain further insights into the formation of the excavation
   damaged zone (EDZ). The FDEM simulation using the Y-Geo code is
   calibrated based on the average short-term response observed in the
   field. Deformation and strength anisotropy are captured using a
   transversely isotropic, linear elastic constitutive law and cohesive
   elements with orientation-dependent strength parameters. Overall, a good
   agreement is obtained between convergences measured in the field and
   numerical results. The simulated EDZ formation process highlights the
   importance of bedding planes in controlling the failure mechanisms
   around the underground opening. Specifically, failure initiates due to
   shearing of bedding planes critically oriented with respect to the
   compressive circumferential stress induced around the tunnel.
   Slippage-induced rock mass deconfinement then promotes extensional
   fracturing in the direction perpendicular to the bedding orientation.
   The simulated fracture pattern is consistent with previous experimental
   evidence from the Mont Terri URL. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Compared to robotic injection of suspended cells (e.g., embryos and
   oocytes), fewer attempts were made to automate the injection of adherent
   cells (e.g., cancer cells and cardiomyocytes) due to their smaller size,
   highly irregular morphology, small thickness (a few micrometers thick),
   and large variations in thickness across cells. This paper presents a
   robotic system for automated microinjection of adherent cells. The
   system is embedded with several new capabilities: automatically locating
   micropipette tips; robustly detecting the contact of micropipette tip
   with cell culturing surface and directly with cell membrane; and
   precisely compensating for accumulative positioning errors. These new
   capabilities make it practical to perform adherent cell microinjection
   truly via computer mouse clicking in front of a computer monitor, on
   hundreds and thousands of cells per experiment (versus a few to tens of
   cells as state of the art). System operation speed, success rate, and
   cell viability rate were quantitatively evaluated based on robotic
   microinjection of over 4000 cells. This paper also reports the use of
   the new robotic system to perform cell-cell communication studies using
   large sample sizes. The gap junction function in a cardiac muscle cell
   line (HL-1 cells), for the first time, was quantified with the system.}},

   more comprehensive view for planning in a smart grid. Moreover, we
   consider implications of our formulation to solution complexity. We
   introduce the concept of matroid theory to model unit commitment as a
   combinatorial problem and propose distributed solutions to facilitate
   optimal and correct generator scheduling. We account for communications

Abstract = {{Generator coherency identification is establishing itself as an
   important task to aid in the resistance of cascading failures within
   wide-area power systems and as a necessary preprocessing stage in
   real-time control for transient stability. Inspired by flocking behavior
   in nature, we propose a novel multiflock-based technique to identify
   generator coherence rapidly within a short observation window. Our
   measurement-based approach transforms generator data from the
   observation space to an information space, whereby the generator
   frequencies and phases characterize the movement and dynamics of boids
   within multiple flocks. Analysis of the boids' trajectories enables the
   discrimination of multiple flocks corresponding to coherent generator
   clusters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique to identify
   generator coherency rapidly while exhibiting robustness to environmental
   noise and cyber attack on the 39-bus New England test system and a
   modified IEEE 118-Bus test system.}},

Abstract = {{Future networks require dynamic physical layer capabilities to enable
   rapid and on-demand reconfiguration, while ensuring stability. This
   paper addresses stability analysis of a ROADM-based quasi-ring optical
   network. A ROADM-based quasi-ring is the simplest configuration in which
   channel power excursions can self-propagate indefinitely and be
   unstable. This network configuration is composed of two reconfigurable
   optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADMs) each equipped with a constant
   gain optical amplifier and a wavelength selective switch. Over the
   amplified spans, two sets of lightpaths (added/dropped by opposite
   ROADMs) are transmitted in mirror image of each other and form an
   overlapping ring.
   Sufficient stability conditions for the quasi-ring as well as an L-2
   bound for the channel power excursions are derived based on Lyapunov
   analysis and the small gain theorem. These conditions are functions of
   the amplifier gain coupling quantified by its Lipschitz constant.
   Numerical results that verify and compare the theoretical results are
   provided. The platform used is Bell Lab's A Transparent Optical Mesh
   (ATOM) simulator, set up for dynamic network loading and input channel

Abstract = {{Land use (LU) information is of significant value for various urban
   studies and is needed for a wide variety of decision-making initiatives
   in the range of global, regional and urban areas. A challenge that
   researchers and practitioners have been facing in urban
   modeling/planning is the lack of detailed information regarding how
   cities are structured and how urban development evolves. This study aims
   to develop a hierarchical rule-based LU extraction framework using
   geographic vector and remotely sensed (RS) data, in order to extract
   detailed subzonal LU information. The LU extraction system, which
   considers both morphological and spatial arrangement analyses at a fine
   spatial level - parcel, is developed to understand
   association/correlation rules between different urban features and their
   corresponding LU structures. In this study, structures and patterns of
   residential and commercial LUs are scrutinized. Residential and
   commercial LUs are first extracted by examining the morphological
   properties of individual parcels using a stepwise binary logistic
   models, which results in an overall accuracy of 97.5\% and 92.4\%
   respectively. A spatial arrangement analysis is then carried out through
   Gabriel Graph to identify structural patterns of residential and
   commercial parcels in order to cluster and separate them from other LUs.
   Extracting residential and commercial clusters helps to correct
   misclassifications arising from morphological analysis. The
   post-correction process results in improving the overall LU extraction
   accuracy by 1.6\% for residential and 4.8\% for commercial LU. The above
   exercises show that the LU classification framework developed can
   classify and then divide large zones with mixed LUs into single-LU
   subzones with a high accuracy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and its related illness
   hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) are major causes of nervous system
   damage and neurological morbidity in children. Hypoxic preconditioning
   (HPC) is known to be neuroprotective in cerebral ischemic brain injury.
   K-ATP channels are involved in ischemic preconditioning in the heart;
   however the involvement of neuronal K-ATP channels in HPC in the brain
   has not been fully investigated. In this study, we investigated the role
   of HPC in hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced brain injury in postnatal
   seven-day-old (P7) CD1 mouse pups. Specifically, TTC
   (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride) staining was used to assess the
   infarct volume, TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated
   dUTP nick end-labeling) to detect apoptotic cells, Western blots to
   evaluate protein level, and patch-clamp recordings to measure K-ATP
   channel current activities. Behavioral tests were performed to assess
   the functional recovery after hypoxic-ischemic insults. We found that
   hypoxic preconditioning reduced infarct volume, decreased the number of
   TUNEL-positive cells, and improved neurobehavioral functional recovery
   in neonatal mice following hypoxic-ischemic insults. Pre-treatment with
   a K-ATP channel blocker, tolbutamide, inhibited hypoxic
   preconditioning-induced neuroprotection and augmented neurodegeneration
   following hypoxic-ischemic injury. Pre-treatment with a K-ATP channel
   opener, diazoxide, reduced infarct volume and mimicked hypoxic
   preconditioning-induced neuroprotection. Hypoxic preconditioning induced
   upregulation of the protein level of the Kir6.2 isoform and enhanced
   current activities of K-ATP channels. Hypoxic preconditioning restored
   the HI-reduced PKC and (p)Akt levels, and reduced caspase-3 level, while
   tolbutamide inhibited the effects of hypoxic preconditioning. We
   conclude that K-ATP channels are involved in hypoxic
   preconditioning-induced neuroprotection in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic
   brain injury. KATp channel openers may therefore have therapeutic
   effects in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objectives: Development of perfusion imaging as a biomarker requires
   more robust methodologies for quantification of tumor physiology that
   allow assessment of volumetric tumor heterogeneity over time. This study
   proposes a parametric method for automatically analyzing perfused tissue
   from volumetric dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) computed tomography (CT)
   scans and assesses whether this 4-dimensional (4D) DCE approach is more
   robust and accurate than conventional, region-of-interest (ROI)-based CT
   methods in quantifying tumor perfusion with preliminary evaluation in
   metastatic brain cancer.
   Methods and Materials: Functional parameter reproducibility and analysis
   of sensitivity to imaging resolution and arterial input function were
   evaluated in image sets acquired from a 320-slice CT with a controlled
   flow phantom and patients with brain metastases, whose treatments were
   planned for stereotactic radiation surgery and who consented to a
   research ethics board-approved prospective imaging biomarker study.
   Avoxel-based temporal dynamic analysis (TDA) methodology was used at
   baseline, at day 7, and at day 20 after treatment. The ability to detect
   changes in kinetic parameter maps in clinical data sets was investigated
   for both 4D TDA and conventional 2D ROI-based analysis methods.
   Results: A total of 7 brain metastases in 3 patients were evaluated over
   the 3 time points. The 4D TDA method showed improved spatial efficacy
   and accuracy of perfusion parameters compared to ROI-based DCE analysis
   (P<.005), with a reproducibility error of less than 2\% when tested with
   DCE phantom data. Clinically, changes in transfer constant from the
   blood plasma into the extracellular extravascular space (K-trans) were
   seen when using TDA, with substantially smaller errors than the 2D
   method on both day 7 post radiation surgery (+/- 13\%; P<.05) and by day
   20 (+/- 12\%; P<.04). Standard methods showed a decrease in Ktrans but
   with large uncertainty (111.6 +/- 150.5) \%.
   Conclusions: Parametric voxel-based analysis of 4D DCE CT data resulted
   in greater accuracy and reliability in measuring changes in perfusion
   CT-based kinetic metrics, which have the potential to be used as
   biomarkers in patients with metastatic brain cancer. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Pages = {{538-555}},
Abstract = {{An experimental study was done to measure the force of adhesion of
   molten wax droplets, 3.1mm in diameter, dropped from heights ranging
   from 20 to 50mm onto porous polyethylene and Teflon surfaces. The Teflon
   surface had 0.25-mm holes drilled in it and the three polyethylene
   surfaces had random pores with mean diameters of 35, 70, and 125 mu m,
   respectively. The force required to remove the solidified ink from the
   surface was measured using a pull test. Wax splats were attached to the
   substrate by both adhesive and cohesive forces. The cohesive force was
   calculated by multiplying the ultimate tensile strength of the wax (2.2
   MPa) by the cross-sectional area of the wax penetrating into surface
   pores. The adhesive force was obtained by multiplying the contact area
   between the wax and substrate by the adhesion strength per unit area,
   estimated to be 0.2 MPa for polyethylene and 0.1 MPa for Teflon
   surfaces. The contact area between splats and the substrate was
   typically about 60-70\% of the splat area. The edges of splats lifted
   up, preventing complete contact.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of fibre length and fibre aspect ratio on the reinforcement
   of soybean-based polyurethane foams was investigated. Micro-crystalline
   cellulose fibres and 260-mu m long glass fibres embedded inside
   polyurethane foams were studied separately. Using X-ray tomography, it
   was determined that short micro-crystalline cellulose fibres were found
   solely embedded within the cell struts of the polyurethane foam. The
   cell struts were reinforced by the micro-crystalline cellulose fibres
   based on composite theory. An attempt was made to predict the
   reinforcement by using existing micro-mechanical models including the
   rule of mixtures and shear-lag theory. The overall foam compressive
   modulus increased based on the reinforcement of the cell struts and
   correlated with the foam mechanics model developed by Gibson and Ashby.
   The intermediate length 260-mu m long glass fibres were found to span
   cells in polyurethane foam and were not embedded within the cell struts.
   These glass fibres did not contact each other. The reinforcement
   performance of the intermediate length glass fibres was found to be
   worse than the short micro-crystalline cellulose fibres. Therefore,
   these intermediate length fibres that span cells should be avoided for
   use in reinforcement of soybean-based polyurethane foams.}},

Abstract = {{Polyol derived from soybean oil was used as a natural source preparation
   to create an environmentally friendly polyurethane foam. In order to
   stiffen these foams, wood fibers were added to provide reinforcement at
   low cost, while preserving the environmental friendly nature of the
   material. Mixing is a crucial step in the manufacture of reinforced
   foams and determines the fiber distribution and cell structure and hence
   the performance of the material. In this study, the effect of stirring
   variables on the mechanical properties of polyurethane foams was
   investigated and foams made using hand mixing were compared to foams
   made with a mechanical stirrer. Cell morphologies of the reinforced
   foams were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray
   computed tomography, and 3D stereo microscopy. The mechanical
   performance of the reinforced foam was essentially independent of
   stirring time and mainly depended on the variation in stirring rate. For
   foams made with high fiber fractions using a mechanical stirrer, the
   fibers were not as effective in increasing the compressive strength and
   modulus as they were in foams prepared by hand stirring. This suggests
   that mechanical stirring causes damage to the fibers, particularly at
   high fiber content.}},

Volume = {{162}},

Pages = {{H40-H46}},
Abstract = {{The in-depth chemistry of a Ti/SnO2-Sb2O5 anode was investigated by
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy combined with ion etching. The coating
   was found to be composed of multiple layers of tin and titanium oxides
   and composition gradients at both the oxide-air and oxide-metal
   interfaces. The existence of such an extensive titanium oxide layer may
   be related to the fabrication of the Ti/SnO2-Sb2O5 anode and subsequent
   inter-diffusion of species. Also, the surface tin oxide layer was found
   to be non-stoichiometric, which, in relation to the extensive titanium
   oxide structure, could be explained by a migration of oxygen toward the
   Ti substrate. Electrochemical tests showed that the film was unstable
   and continued to grow under anodic polarization. Impedance spectroscopy
   displayed a continuum in the dielectric relaxation time constants with
   depth. This variation in relaxation time constants was proposed to be
   caused by the continuous variation of the composition in the film. (C)

Abstract = {{To achieve high speed, flexible planar parallel manipulators (PPM) are
   typically designed with lightweight linkages, but hence suffer from
   unwanted structural vibration, diminishing positioning accuracy. To
   achieve high positioning accuracy, this paper addresses the vibration
   suppression of a PPM with three flexible linkages actuated by linear
   ultrasonic motors (LUSM). Based on the extended Hamilton's principle, a
   rigid-flexible dynamic model of a proposed PPM is developed using the
   substructure approach and the assumed mode method (AMM). The assumed
   mode shapes of the flexible linkages are verified through the
   experimental modal tests. Then, two control algorithms are designed for
   tracking control of the end effector and vibration attenuation of the
   flexible linkages. The first approach is a two-timescale control based
   on singular perturbation principles, implemented as a joint motion
   control without additional actuators. The second approach is a
   dual-stage control method. In this control approach, a variable
   structural control (VSC) method is applied to realize motion tracking of
   the moving platform, while the strain and strain rate feedback control
   (SSRF) is developed to suppress the undesired vibration of the flexible
   linkages, using multiple distributed collocated lead zirconate titanate
   (PZT) transducers. Stability analysis of the two algorithms is
   investigated based on Lyapunov approach. Simulation results of these two
   approaches show that the dual-stage control method provides better
   vibration attenuation, and hence, faster settling time of the PPM is
   achieved.}},

   cord}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{65-72}},
Abstract = {{Spinal cord injury is a debilitating condition that currently lacks
   effective clinical treatment. Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) has been
   demonstrated in experimental animal models to induce axonal regeneration
   and functional improvements, yet its local delivery remains challenging.
   For ultimate clinical translation, a drug delivery system is required
   for localized, sustained, and minimally invasive release. Here, an
   injectable composite drug delivery system (DDS) composed of
   biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles dispersed in a hyaluronan/methyl
   cellulose hydrogel was injected into the intrathecal space to achieve
   acute local delivery to the spinal cord after a thoracic clip
   compression injury. NT-3 was encapsulated in the DDS and released in
   vitro for up to 50 d. With a single injection of the DDS into the
   intrathecal space of the injured spinal cord, NT-3 diffused ventrally
   through the cord and was detectable in the spinal cord for at least 28 d
   therein. Delivery of NT-3 resulted in significant axon growth with no
   effect on the astroglial response to injury in comparison with vehicle
   and injury controls. NT-3 treatment promoted functional improvements at
   21 d according to the Basso Beattie Bresnahan locomotor scale in
   comparison with the DDS alone. The sustained delivery of bioactive NT-3
   to the injured spinal cord achieved in this study demonstrates the
   promise of this DDS for central nervous system repair.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{The interactions of H2O and H2S monomers with Cu(111) in the absence and
   presence of an external electric field are studied using density
   functional theory. It is found that the adsorption is accompanied by a
   rippled pattern of the surface Cu atoms and electron accumulation on the
   surface Cu atoms surrounding the adsorption site. The response of the
   H2O/Cu(111) and H2S/Cu(111) interfaces to the external electric field is
   computed up to the field magnitude of 10(10) V m(-1). The results show
   that H2O rotates and translates much more with an electric field than
   H2S does. The extent of the surface deformation changes considerably
   with the applied electric field, which influences the translation
   pattern of the adsorbates. On the other hand, the rotation of the
   adsorbates is correlated to the dipole moment of the molecules and their
   adsorption energies.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-cycling is a well-known strategy to improve performance in digital
   design, wherein the required time for selected combinational paths is
   lengthened to multiple clock cycles (rather than just one). The approach
   can be applied to paths associated with computations whose results are
   not needed immediately-such paths are allowed multiple clock cycles to
   ``complete{''}, reducing the opportunity for them to form the critical
   path of the circuit. In this paper, we consider multi-cycling in the
   high-level synthesis context (HLS) and use software profiling to guide
   multi-cycling optimizations. Specifically, prior to HLS, we execute the
   program in software with typical datasets to gather data on the number
   of times each code segment executes. During HLS, we then extend the
   schedule for infrequently executed code segments and apply multi-cycling
   to the dilated schedules, which exhibit greater opportunities for
   multi-cycling. In essence, our approach ensures that non-frequently
   executed code segments will not form the critical path of the
   HLS-generated circuit. In an experimental study targeting the Altera
   Stratix IV FPGA, we evaluate the impact on speed performance and area
   for both traditional multi-cycling, as well as the proposed software
   profiling-driven multi-cycling, and show that profiling-driven
   multi-cycling leads to an average speedup of over 10\% across 13
   benchmark circuits, with some circuit speedups in excess of 30\%.
   Circuit area is reduced by 11\%, yielding a mean 20\% improvement in
   area-delay product.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid current-mode and optogenetic miniature neurostimulating system
   is presented. The 16-channel electrical stimulator outputs
   arbitrary-waveform charge-balanced current-mode stimulation pulses with
   the amplitude ranging from 0.05mA to 10mA. To optimize power
   consumption, the supply voltage is automatically adjusted through an
   impedance monitoring feedback loop that gauges the minimum required
   headroom voltage. The 8-channel optogenetic stimulator reuses the
   arbitrary-waveform generation functions of the electrical stimulator.
   Each pulse-generator drives one LED with a maximum of 25mA. The LEDs are
   assembled within a custom-made 4 x 4 ECoG grid electrode array, which
   enables precise optical stimulation of neurons with a 300 mu m spatial
   resolution and simultaneous monitoring of the neural response by the
   ECoG electrode, at different distances of the stimulation site. The
   implantable system is a 3x2.5x1 cm(3) stack of a receiver coil and two
   miniboards. The power is received by a 32-layer flexible inductive coil
   and is regulated by the wireless communication board. The adaptive
   neurostimulator board boosts the regulated voltage up to the level set
   by the feedback loop with a maximum of 24V. The system also receives
   stimulation parameters wirelessly from the amplitude-shift-keyed power
   carrier. Both electrical and optogenetic stimulation results from
   chronic and acute in vivo rodent experiments are presented.}},

Abstract = {{We assess the effects of low-frequency (5Hz) responsive stimulation
   (LFRS) and high-frequency (20Hz) responsive stimulation (HFRS) of the
   rat hippocampus on the spontaneous seizure suppression in two rodent
   models of epilepsy. Acute seizures in 12 rats were induced by
   intra-hippocampal injection of 4-amynopyridine (4-AP) and chronic
   seizures in six rats were induced by intraperitoneal injection of kainic
   acid. Two bipolar electrodes were implanted into the CA1 regions of both
   hippocampi. The electrodes were connected to a custom-built responsive
   neurostimulator that detects the intracerebral electroencephalographic
   (icEEE) seizure onset and triggers a responsive electrical stimulation.
   The rats were randomly divided into two groups: non-stimulation and
   stimulation group. The non-stimulation group did not receive
   stimulation, whereas the stimulation group received LFRS and HFRS. The
   baseline average seizure rate in the non-stimulation group was similar
   to 6.5 seizures per 30-minute in the acute model and similar to 5
   seizures per day in the chronic model. The seizure rate in the
   stimulation group was reduced by 80.8\% during the LFRS, while the HFRS
   reduced seizure frequency only by 26.9\% and in the chronic model,
   91.6\% during the LFRS, while the HFRS reduced seizure frequency only by
   15\%. The seizure formation was effectively aborted using the LFRS by
   means of the neural inhibition mechanism, which is similar to that of
   anti-epileptic drugs. In this responsive stimulation technique, the
   inhibition lasted only for several seconds, as needed for the seizure
   suppression, unlike the continuous inhibition (neural activity
   suppression) in the case of anti-epileptic drugs.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud networks underpin most of todays' socio-economical Information
   Communication Technology (ICT) environments due to their intrinsic
   capabilities such as elasticity and service transparency. Undoubtedly,
   this increased dependence of numerous always-on services with the cloud
   is also subject to a number of security threats. An emerging critical
   aspect is related with the adequate identification and detection of
   malware. In the majority of cases, malware is the first building block
   for larger security threats such as distributed denial of service
   attacks (e.g. DDoS); thus its immediate detection is of crucial
   importance. In this paper we introduce a malware detection technique
   based on Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (E-EMD) which is
   performed on the hypervisor level and jointly considers system and
   network information from every Virtual Machine (VM). Under two pragmatic
   cloud-specific scenarios instrumented in our controlled experimental
   testbed we show that our proposed technique can reach detection accuracy
   rates over 90\% for a range of malware samples. In parallel we
   demonstrate the superiority of the introduced approach after comparison
   with a covariance-based anomaly detection technique that has been
   broadly used in previous studies. Consequently, we argue that our
   presented scheme provides a promising foundation towards the efficient
   detection of malware in modern virtualized cloud environments.}},

Abstract = {{In previous studies, we synthesized the first organic light emitting
   diode (OLED) using boron subphthalocyanines (BsubPcs) based polymers.
   When designing new polymer materials for organic electronic applications
   such as OLEDs or organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices it is important to
   consider not only the contribution of each monomer but also the polymer
   chain ends. In this paper we establish a post-polymerization strategy to
   couple BsubPcs onto either the alpha- or the omega-chain end using
   chemically selective BsubPc derivatives. We outline how the chain ends
   of two representative polymers, poly(styrene) (PS) and
   poly(n-butylacrylate) (BA), synthesized by nitroxide mediated
   polymerization (NMP), using BlocBuilder-MA as the initiating species,
   can be chemically modified by the incorporation of BsubPc chromophores.
   The addition of the BsubPc chromophore was confirmed through the use of
   a photodiode array detector (PDA) connected in-line with a gel
   permeation chromatography (GPC) setup. These findings represent the
   first reported method for the controlled and selective placement of a
   BsubPc chromophores on either end of a polymer produced by NMP. This
   strategy will therefore be utilized to make next generation BsubPc
   polymers for OLEDs and OPV devices. The extremely high molar extinction
   coefficient of BsubPc also make these polymers ideally suited for
   dye-labelling of polymers.}},

Title = {{Mechanical Stress Promotes Cisplatin-Induced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
   Cell Death}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Cisplatin (CisPt) is a commonly used platinum-based chemotherapeutic
   agent. Its efficacy is limited due to drug resistance and multiple side
   effects, thereby warranting a new approach to improving the
   pharmacological effect of CisPt. A newly developed mathematical
   hypothesis suggested that mechanical loading, when coupled with a
   chemotherapeutic drug such as CisPt and immune cells, would boost tumor
   cell death. The current study investigated the aforementioned
   mathematical hypothesis by exposing human hepatocellular liver carcinoma
   (HepG2) cells to CisPt, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and
   mechanical stress individually and in combination. HepG2 cells were also
   treated with a mixture of CisPt and carnosine with and without
   mechanical stress to examine one possible mechanism employed by
   mechanical stress to enhance CisPt effects. Carnosine is a dipeptide
   that reportedly sequesters platinum-based drugs away from their
   pharmacological target-site. Mechanical stress was achieved using an
   orbital shaker that produced 300 rpm with a horizontal circular motion.
   Our results demonstrated that mechanical stress promoted CisPt-induced
   death of HepG2 cells (similar to 35\% more cell death). Moreover,
   results showed that CisPt-induced death was compromised when CisPt was
   left to mix with carnosine 24 hours preceding treatment. Mechanical
   stress, however, ameliorated cell death (20\% more cell death).}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Enhanced biofeedback during rehabilitation therapies has the
   potential to provide a therapeutic environment optimally designed for
   neuroplasticity. This study investigates the impact of audio feedback on
   the achievement of a targeted therapeutic goal, namely, use of
   reciprocal steps. Methods: Stair-climbing therapy sessions conducted
   with and without audio feedback were compared in a randomized AB/BA
   cross-over study design. Seventeen children, aged 4-7 years, with
   various diagnoses participated. Reports from the participants,
   therapists, and a blinded observer were collected to evaluate
   achievement of the therapeutic goal, motivation and enjoyment during the
   therapy sessions. Results: Audio feedback resulted in a 5.7\% increase
   (p=0.007) in reciprocal steps. Levels of participant enjoyment increased
   significantly (p=0.031) and motivation was reported by child
   participants and therapists to be greater when audio feedback was

Title = {{Impact of UV-H2O2 Advanced Oxidation and Aging Processes on GAC Capacity
   for the Removal of Cyanobacterial Taste and Odor Compounds}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INSIGHTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Cyanobacteria and their taste and odor (T\&O) compounds are a growing
   concern in water sources globally. Geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB)
   are the most commonly detected T\&O compounds associated with
   cyanobacterial presence in drinking water sources. The use of
   ultraviolet and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an advanced oxidation
   treatment for T\&O control is an emerging technology. However, residual
   H2O2 (>80\% of the initial dose) has to be removed from water prior
   final disinfection. Recently, granular activated carbon (GAC) is used to
   remove H2O2 residual. The objective of this study is to assess the
   impact of H2O2 quenching and aging processes on GAC capacity for the
   removal of geosmin and MIB. Pilot columns with different types of GAC
   and presence/absence of H2O2 have been used for this study. H2O2 removal
   for the operational period of 6 months has no significant impact on GAC
   capacity to remove the geosmin and MIB from water.}},

Title = {{Voyage inside the cell: Microsystems and nanoengineering for
   intracellular measurement and manipulation}},
Journal = {{MICROSYSTEMS \& NANOENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Properties of organelles and intracellular structures play important
   roles in regulating cellular functions, such as gene expression, cell
   motility and metabolism. The ability to directly interrogate
   intracellular structures inside a single cell for measurement and
   manipulation has significant implications in the understanding of
   subcellular and suborganelle activities, diagnosing diseases, and
   potentially developing new therapeutic approaches. In the past few
   decades, a number of technologies have been developed to study
   single-cell properties. However, methods of measuring intracellular
   properties and manipulating subcellular structures have been largely
   underexplored. Due to the even smaller size of intracellular targets and
   lower signal-to-noise ratio than that in whole-cell studies, the
   development of tools for intracellular measurement and manipulation is
   challenging. This paper reviews emerging microsystems and nanoengineered
   technologies for sensing and quantitative measurement of intracellular
   properties and for manipulating structures inside a single cell. Recent
   progress and limitations of these new technologies as well as new
   discoveries and prospects are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon interposers enable the integration of multiple stacks of
   in-package memory to provide higher bandwidth or lower energy for memory
   accesses. Once the interposer has been paid for, there are new
   opportunities to exploit the interposer. Recent work considers using the
   routing resources of the interposer to improve the network-on-chip's
   (NoC) capabilities. In this work, we exploit the interposer to
   ``disintegrate{''} a multi-core CPU chip into smaller chips that
   individually and collectively cost less to manufacture than a single
   large chip. However, this fragments the overall NoC, which decreases
   performance as core-to-core messages between chips must now route
   through the interposer. We study the performance-cost trade-offs of
   interposer based, multi-chip, multi-core systems and propose new
   interposer NoC organizations to mitigate the performance challenges
   while preserving the cost benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of material properties under combined high strain
   rate and elevated temperature are essential for safe design of
   structures to withstand post-impact fire situations such as collision by
   heavy vehicles followed by fire. Numerous material tests performed in
   recent years do not address the influence of such sequential loading on
   the mechanical properties of mild steel. An inclusive test program is
   carried out in the Civil Engineering Lab at Monash University to
   investigate the post-impact fire properties of Grade 350 structural
   steel and the results are presented here. Specimens have undergone
   interrupting high strain rate tensile loading, controlled locally at
   defined levels of elongation, to account for different deformation
   states. Different damage levels are introduced for each rate of strain
   with respect to the displacement corresponding to the ultimate stress
   (f(u)). Subsequently, the partly damaged specimens are subjected to
   static tensile loading to failure at high temperature conditions.
   Material behaviour of pre-damaged steel is compared to those of each
   individual loading scenario and to design code expressions. The test
   results demonstrate that the combined actions are profoundly different
   from that in which the structure is subjected to either high strain rate
   or thermal loading and notably vary from those predicted in different
   codes. Moreover, it is shown that the strength and ductility of mild
   steel are significantly dependent on the rate of loading, the
   pre-deformation history and the temperature it is subsequently exposed
   to. The experimental results can be used by researchers and structural
   engineers as benchmark data for calibrating current material model
   constants and/or developing new material models which take into account
   the coupled effect of high strain rate and temperature for rational fire
   analysis and design of steel structures.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have shown the vulnerability of buildings to sudden
   changes in lateral stiffness and strength, as in the case of a
   soft-story mechanism, which can cause damage or even collapse during
   strong earthquakes. This paper investigates the possibility of improving
   the seismic performance of soft-story structures by incorporating
   gyro-mass dampers (GMDs) as a novel alternative solution. GMDs are newly
   developed passive control devices. They generate a force that is
   proportional to the relative acceleration applied at their end nodes.
   The introduction of GMD elements increases the lateral capacity of the
   first story and the fundamental period of the entire structure. It also
   reduces the input energy of the earthquake ground motion. To evaluate
   the effectiveness of these devices, different configurations are
   proposed and time history analyses are performed.}},

Abstract = {{Criteria which stipulate the minimum pressure at which water is to be
   delivered to customers from a water distribution system (WDS) differ
   around the world. Thus, interestingly, the pressure delivered to a
   customer might be judged high enough to meet standards in some
   countries, while water delivered under the same pressure in other
   countries is considered unacceptable. This paper provides a description
   of consequences and implications of changes in the minimum pressure
   criterion (MPC) to WDS design. Reducing the MPC may cause a decrease in
   pressure-based demands such as faucet, showers, and lawn watering and
   also improve system performance through reduced energy use, leakage, and
   the frequency of pipe breaks. However, lowering this criterion may make
   the system more susceptible to low pressure failures, either hydraulic
   (e.g., an inability to supply the required flow) or safety related
   (e.g., increasing the risk of an intrusion event associated with
   hydraulic transients). Therefore, there should be a clear understanding
   of the consequences and challenges prior to changes the MPC. Moreover,
   policies to control and avoid low pressure events are seldom fully
   linked to the value of the minimum pressure standard and the issue how
   the MPC is enforced/ensured in WDSs. The inter-related issues associated
   with MPC are raised here as important but neglected issues.}},

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{121-133}},
Abstract = {{Epithelial tissues are a critical component of all tubular organs.
   Engineering artificial epithelium requires an understanding of the
   polarization of epithelia: both apicobasal and in a planar fashion. Air
   liquid interface (ALI) culture is typically used to generate apicobasal
   polarized airway epithelium in vitro; however, this approach does not
   provide any signalling cues to induce morphological planar polarization
   of the generated epithelial layer. Here we describe a microgrooved
   gelatin hydrogel insert that can induce alignment of confluent
   epithelial cell sheets under ALI conditions to induce both apicobasal
   and morphologically planar polarized epithelium. Microgrooves are
   imprinted into the surface of the gelatin insert using elastomeric
   stamps moulded from a diffraction grating film and gels are stabilized
   by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde. We show that microgrooved gelatin
   inserts produce alignment of 3T3 fibroblasts and a number of epithelial
   cell lines (ARPE-19, BEAS2B and IMCD3 cells). Furthermore, we show that
   BEAS2B apicobasally polarize and form a similar density of cilia on both
   gelatin inserts and standard transwell filters used for ALI culture but
   that as apicobasal polarization progresses cell alignment on the grooves
   is lost. Our method provides a simple strategy that can easily be
   adopted by labs without microfabrication expertise for manipulating
   epithelial organization in transwell culture and studying the interplay
   of various polarization forces.}},

Title = {{High strength measurement of monolayer graphene oxide}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{497-504}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the strength of monolayer graphene oxide membranes was
   experimentally characterized. The monolayer GO membranes were found to
   have a high carbon-to-oxygen ratio (similar to 4:1) and an average
   strength of 17.3 N/m (24.7 GPa). This measured strength is orders of
   magnitude higher than previously reported values for graphene oxide
   paper and is approximately 50\% of the 2D intrinsic strength of pristine
   graphene. In order to corroborate strength measurements, experimental
   values were compared to theoretical first-principles calculations. Using
   a supercell constructed from experimental measurements of monolayer
   graphene oxide chemistry and functional structure, density functional
   theory calculations predicted a theoretical strength of 21.9 N/m (31.3
   GPa) under equibiaxial tension, in good agreement with the experimental
   data. Furthermore, computational simulations were used to understand the
   underlying fracture mechanism, in which bond cleavage occurred along a
   path connecting oxygenated carbon atoms in the basal plane. This work
   shows that monolayer graphene oxide possesses near-theoretical strength
   reaching tens of GPa. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   dynamics in vivo}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{104}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Potassiumhomeostasis is fundamental for the physiological functioning of
   the brain. Increased {[}K+] inthe extracellular fluid has amajor impact
   on neuronal physiology and can lead to ictal events. Compromised
   regulation of extracellular {[}K+] is involved in generation of seizures
   in animalmodels and potentially also in humans. For this reason, the
   investigation of K+ spatio-temporal dynamics is of fundamental
   importance for neuroscientists in the field of epilepsy and other
   related pathologies. To date, the majority of studies investigating
   changes in extracellular K+ have been conducted using a micropipette
   filled with a K+ sensitive solution. However, this approach presents a
   major limitation: the area of the measurement is circumscribed to the
   tip of the pipette and it is not possible to know the spatiotemporal
   distribution or origin of the focally measured K+ signal. Here we
   propose a novel approach, based on wide field fluorescence, to measure
   extracellular K+ dynamics in neural tissue. Recording the local field
   potential from the somatosensory cortex of the mouse, we compared
   responses obtained from a K+-sensitive microelectrode to the
   spatiotemporal increases in fluorescence of the fluorophore, Asante
   Potassium Green-2, in physiological conditions and during 4-AP induced
   ictal activity. We conclude that wide field imaging is a valuable and
   versatile tool to measure K+ dynamics over a large area of the cerebral
   cortex and is capable of capturing fast dynamics such as during ictal
   events. Moreover, the present technique is potentially adaptable to
   address questions regarding spatiotemporal dynamics of other ionic
   species. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The cell behaviors that drive tissue morphogenesis, such as division,
   migration, or death, are regulated at the molecular scale. Understanding
   how molecular events determine cell behavior requires simultaneous
   tracking and measurement of molecular and cellular dynamics. To this
   end, we have developed SIESTA, an integrated tool for Scientific ImagE
   SegmenTation and Analysis that enables quantification of cell behavior
   and molecular events from image data. Here we use SIESTA to show how to
   automatically delineate cells in images (segmentation) using the
   watershed algorithm, a region-growing method for boundary detection. For
   images in which automated segmentation is not possible due to low or
   inappropriate contrast, we use a minimal path search algorithm to
   semiautomatically delineate the cells. We use the segmentation results
   to quantify cellular morphology and molecular dynamics in different
   subcellular compartments, and demonstrate the whole process by analyzing
   cell behavior and the dynamics of the motor protein non-muscle myosin II
   during axis elongation in a Drosophila embryo. Finally, we show how
   image analysis can be used to quantify molecular asymmetries that orient
   cell behavior, and demonstrate this point by measuring planar cell
   polarity in Drosophila embryos. We describe all methods in detail to
   allow their implementation and application using other software
   packages. The use of (semi) automated quantitative imaging enables the
   analysis of a large number of samples, thus providing the statistical
   power necessary to detect subtle molecular differences that may result
   in differences in cell behavior.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel bidirectional modular multilevel dc-dc converter
   is proposed. The proposed topology, named the triangular modular
   multilevel dc-dc converter (TMMC), can achieve equal power sharing among
   its modules over a broad range of conversion ratios. The proposed
   control algorithm provides localized control of modules which enhances
   the converter's dynamic performance and design flexibility. A 1.7-kW
   experimental implementation of the converter is shown to achieve an
   efficiency of 95.9\% and 96.2\% in step-up and step-down modes,
   respectively. Significant reductions in the input current and output
   voltage ripples are observed through the interleaved operation of the
   converter. The TMMC also provides multiple fixed voltage nodes which
   makes it suitable as a multiple-input multiple-output converter.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces amodular multilevel dc/dc converter, termed the
   DC-MMC, that can be deployed to interconnect HVDC networks of different
   or similar voltage levels. Its key features include: 1) bidirectional
   power flow; 2) step-up and step-down operation; and 3) bidirectional
   fault blocking similar to a dc circuit breaker. The kernel of the DC-MMC
   is a new class of bidirectional single-stage dc/dc converters utilizing
   interleaved strings of cascaded submodules. The DC-MMC operation is
   analyzed and an open loop voltage control strategy that ensures power
   balance of each submodule capacitor via circulating ac currents is
   proposed. Simulations performed in PLECS validate the DC-MMC's principle
   of operation and the proposed control strategy. Experimental results for
   a 4-kW laboratory prototype illustrate the single-stage dc/dc conversion
   process for both step-down and step-up operating modes.}},

Title = {{Direct and up-close views of plant cell walls show a leading role for
   lignin-modifying enzymes on ensuing xylanases}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{Background: A key barrier that limits the full potential of biological
   processes to create new, sustainable materials and fuels from plant
   fibre is limited enzyme accessibility to polysaccharides and lignin that
   characterize lignocellulose networks. Moreover, the heterogeneity of
   lignocellulosic substrates means that different enzyme combinations
   might be required for efficient transformation of different plant
   resources. Analytical techniques with high chemical sensitivity and
   spatial resolution that permit direct characterization of solid samples
   could help overcome these challenges by allowing direct visualization of
   enzyme action within plant fibre, thereby identify barriers to enzyme
   action.
   Results: In the current study, the high spatial resolution (about 30 nm)
   of scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM), and the detection
   sensitivity (ppm) of time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry
   (ToF-SIMS), were harnessed for the first time to investigate the
   progression of laccase, cellulase and xylanase activities through wood
   samples, and to evaluate complementary action between lignin-modifying
   and polysaccharide-degrading enzymes. In particular, complementary
   insights from the STXM and ToF-SIMS analyses revealed the key role of
   laccase in promoting xylanase activity throughout and between plant cell
   walls.
   Conclusions: The spatial resolution of STXM clearly revealed
   time-dependent progression and spatial distribution of laccase and
   xylanase activities, whereas ToF-SIMS analyses confirmed that laccase
   promoted protein penetration into fibre samples, leading to an overall
   increase in polysaccharide degradation. Spectromicroscopic
   visualizations of plant cell wall chemistry allowed simultaneous
   tracking of changes to lignin and polysaccharide contents, which
   provides new possibilities for investigating the complementary roles of
   lignin-modifying and carbohydrate-active enzymes.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports on an amorphous-crystalline silicon heterojunction
   photovoltaic cell concept wherein the heterojunction regions are
   laterally narrow and distributed amidst a backdrop of well-passivated
   crystalline silicon surface. The localized amorphous-crystalline silicon
   heterojunctions consisting of the laterally thin emitter and
   back-surface field regions are precisely aligned under the metal
   grid-lines and bus-bars while the remaining crystalline silicon surface
   is passivated using the recently proposed facile grown native
   oxide-plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposited silicon nitride
   passivation scheme. The proposed cell concept mitigates parasitic
   optical absorption losses by relegating amorphous silicon to beneath the
   shadowed metallized regions and by using optically transparent
   passivation layer. A photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 13.6\% is
   obtained for an untextured proof-of-concept cell illuminated under AM
   1.5 global spectrum; the specific cell performance parameters are V-OC
   of 666 mV, J(SC) of 29.5 mA-cm(-2), and fill-factor of 69.3\%. Reduced
   parasitic absorption, predominantly in the shorter wavelength range, is
   confirmed with external quantum efficiency measurement. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{Effective removal of oils from water is of global significance for
   environmental protection. In this study, we investigate the
   hydrophobicity and oleophilicity of open-cell polymer foams prepared in
   a continuous and scalable extrusion process. The material used to
   prepare the open-cell foams is a fibrillar blend of polypropylene (PP)
   and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   images of the morphology of the PP/PTFE fibrillar blend reveal that the
   PTFE has a fibrillar morphology in the PP matrix. SEM micrograph of the
   extruded foam shows the formation of an interconnected open-cell
   structure. Using nitrogen pycnometry, the open-cell content is estimated
   to be 97.7\%. A typical bulk density of the open-cell foam is measured
   to be about 0.07 g cm(-3) corresponding to a void fraction of 92\%.
   Thus, a large three-dimensional space is made available for oil storage.
   A drop of water on the cross-section of the extruded open-cell foam
   forms a contact angle of 160 degrees suggesting that the open-cell foam
   exhibits superhydrophobicity. The open-cell foam can selectively absorb
   various petroleum products, such as octane, gasoline, diesel, kerosene,
   light crude oil, and heavy crude oil from water and the uptake
   capacities range from about 5 to 24 g g(-1). The uptake kinetics can be
   enhanced by exposing the open-cell foam to high intensity ultrasound
   which increases the surface porosity of the thin, impervious, foam skin
   layer. The reusability of the foam can be improved by using a matrix
   polymer which demonstrates superior elastic properties and prevents the
   foams from undergoing a large permanent deformation upon compression to
   squeeze out the oil. For example, when the PP homopolymer matrix is
   replaced with a PP random copolymer, the permanent deformation for 10
   compressive cycles is reduced from about 30\% to 10\%. To the best of
   our knowledge, these PP-based open-cell foams outperform PP-based
   absorbents conventionally used for oil-spill cleanup applications such
   as nonwoven PP fibers or melt-blown PP pads.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical capacitors are important energy storage devices that
   have high power density, rapid charging cycles and are highly cyclable.
   In this study, activated fluid coke has demonstrated high surface area,
   improved capacitive properties, and high energy density. Fluid coke is a
   by-product generated from continuous high temperature bitumen upgrading,
   resulting in the formation of nearly spherical particles with concentric
   carbon layers. The residual sulphur impurities in fluid coke may enhance
   its energy storage performance. The activated coke samples have high
   specific surface areas, up to 1960 m(2) g(-1), and show promising
   capacitive performance, in 4 M KOH electrolyte, with high gravimetric
   and specific capacitances of 228-257 F g(-1) and 13-14 mu F cm(-2),
   respectively. These results are comparable to other top performing
   activated carbon materials {[}1-3]. The activated fluid coke maintains
   high performance at fast charging rates, greater than 160 F g(-1) at a
   current density of 7500 mA g(-1). Activated fluid coke's high
   capacitance and promising rate performance are potentially associated
   with its unique layered, and the moderate sulphur content in the
   chemical structure. Activated fluid coke is a unique opportunity to use
   a limited use by-product to generate activated carbon that has a high
   surface area and promising energy storage properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In many industries, production capacity diminishes as machine conditions
   deteriorate. Maintenance operations improve machine conditions, but also
   occupy potential production time, possibly delaying the customer orders.
   Therefore, one challenge is to determine the joint maintenance and
   production schedule to minimize the combined costs of maintenance and
   lost production over the long term. In this paper, we address the
   problem of integrated maintenance and production scheduling in a
   deteriorating multi-machine production system over multiple periods.
   Assuming that at the beginning of each period the demand becomes known
   and machine conditions are observable, we formulate a Markov decision
   process model to determine the maintenance plan and develop sufficient
   conditions guaranteeing its monotonicity in both machine condition and
   demand. We then formulate an integer programming model to find the
   maintenance and the production schedule in each period. Our
   computational results show that exploiting online condition monitoring
   information in maintenance and production decisions leads to 21\% cost
   savings on average compared to a greedy heuristic and that the benefit
   of incorporating long-term information in making short-term decisions is
   highest in industries with medium failure rates.}},

Title = {{Floquet-Bloch analysis of refracting Huygens metasurfaces}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the response of passive lossless Huygens metasurfaces
   (HMS), designed to implement a prescribed refraction, to arbitrary
   plane-wave excitations. Applying a rigorous Floquet-Bloch (FB) analysis
   of the cotangent electric and magnetic surface reactance modulations, we
   discover that the scattered FB modes follow an extraordinary ray-optical
   model. According to this model, the HMS can be replaced by a virtual
   region of constant wave impedance; incident power is incoupled into this
   virtual Fabry-Perot etalon, gradually leaking to successively
   higher-order FB modes. Analytical closed-form expressions are derived
   for the FB coefficients, indicating that the first FB mode in
   transmission is always dominant; this clarifies previous experimental
   findings which implied that the HMS retained its functionality over a
   broad angular range. Furthermore, we point out the implementation
   problems inherent in the cotangent function and offer a simple,
   realizable form of the reactive modulation which does not significantly
   deteriorate the HMS performance. These results provide fundamental
   physical insight into the working mechanism of passive lossless Huygens
   metasurfaces in general, revealing a new degree of freedom which enables
   control of the transmitted field amplitude: the virtual region wave
   impedance. Importantly, the implied broad acceptance angle of the HMS
   may be harnessed for synthesis of low-profile multifunctional devices,
   designed to respond to several excitations with reduced reflections.}},

Abstract = {{Body image distortion (BID) plays an important role in the etiology and
   maintenance of anorexia nervosa (AN). Previous studies of BID in AN
   showed small biases in visual scanning behavior (VSB) towards images of
   body shapes. The aim of this study is to investigate biases in VSB when
   body shape images compete with images with a different theme (social
   interactions) for subjects' attention. When images of thin body shapes
   (TBS) were presented alongside images of social interactions, AN
   patients (n=13) spent significantly more time looking at TBSs rather
   than at social interactions, but controls (n=20) did not. When images of
   fat body shapes (FBS) were presented alongside images of social
   interactions, AN patients spent significantly more time looking at FBSs
   rather than at social interactions, but controls did not. When images of
   TBSs, FBSs and social interactions were presented alongside each other,
   AN patients demonstrated a hierarchy in their attention allocation,
   choosing to spend the most viewing time on TBS images, followed by FBS
   images and then images with social interactions. Under the three
   experimental conditions, AN patients demonstrated large biases in their
   visual scanning behavior (VSB). Biases in VSB may provide
   physiologically objective measures that characterize patients with AN.

Abstract = {{A bench-scale study was performed to optimize backwash frequency and air
   sparging conditions during ultrafiltration (UF) for drinking water
   treatment in order to minimize hydraulically irreversible fouling as
   well as operating and maintenance costs. Surface shear stress
   representing different air sparging conditions (continuous coarse
   bubble, intermittent coarse bubble, and large pulse bubble) was applied
   in combination with various backwash frequencies (0.5, 2, and 6 hours)
   during UF of two natural surface waters. Results indicated that air
   sparging during permeation with intermittent coarse or large pulse
   bubbles significantly reduced the rate of irreversible fouling. This
   allowed for longer permeation times (up to 6 hours) between backwashing,
   when compared to a baseline condition which assumed a 0.5 h-backwash
   frequency with no air sparging during permeation. As a result, operation
   and maintenance cost savings estimated at > \$350,000/year for a 29 MLD
   membrane train could be realized. This study demonstrates that optimized
   air sparging could serve as a cost-effective UF fouling control strategy
   for drinking water production.}},

Abstract = {{Somatic cell reprogramming to a pluripotent state continues to challenge
   many of our assumptions about cellular specification, and despite major
   efforts, we lack a complete molecular characterization of the
   reprograming process. To address this gap in knowledge, we generated
   extensive transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic data sets describing
   the reprogramming routes leading from mouse embryonic fibroblasts to
   induced pluripotency. Through integrative analysis, we reveal that cells
   transition through distinct gene expression and epigenetic signatures
   and bifurcate towards reprogramming transgene-dependent and -
   independent stable pluripotent states. Early transcriptional events,
   driven by high levels of reprogramming transcription factor expression,
   are associated with widespread loss of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3)
   trimethylation, representing a general opening of the chromatin state.
   Maintenance of high transgene levels leads to re-acquisition of H3K27me3
   and a stable pluripotent state that is alternative to the embryonic stem
   cell (ESC)-like fate. Lowering transgene levels at an intermediate
   phase, however, guides the process to the acquisition of ESC-like
   chromatin and DNA methylation signature. Our data provide a
   comprehensive molecular description of the reprogramming routes and is
   accessible through the Project Grandiose portal at
   http://www.stemformatics.org.}},

Abstract = {{A new class of brightly phosphorescent Pt(II) compounds that contain an
   N<\^{}>C-chelate phenyl-1,2,3-triazolyl ligand (ptrz) and an
   N<\^{}>C-chelate pyridyl-1,2,4-triazolyl ligand (pytrz) in the central
   core is achieved. The impact of various substituent groups on
   phosphorescence of this class of molecules is examined. Crystal
   structural analyses revealed that this class of compounds has a great
   tendency to form stacked dimers-one of which is persistent even in the
   gas phase-leading to excimer emission. The introduction of bulky
   substituents, such as diphenyl amino (NPh2) or trityl (CPh3), is found
   to greatly diminish the excimer emission. Using this approach, several
   highly efficient blue and green phosphorescent Pt(II) compounds with. em
   at approximate to 450-460 nm and Phi(p) approximate to 0.70 to 1.00 are
   obtained. These molecules are highly robust with exceptionally high
   thermal stability. Bright bluish-green electrophosphorescent devices
   with external quantum efficiencies as high as 16.7\% are fabricated.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel actuation approach is proposed for linear

   power of the ultrasonic motor can be tangibly increased, without
   increasing its stator volume, thereby leading to improvement in the
   actuator power density. Added normal force is exerted on the moving
   stage by exciting the higher longitudinal resonant modes, the
   frequencies of which coincide with the harmonics of the square-wave

Abstract = {{In this work, the effect of fibre surface morphology on the effective
   thermal conductivity of the gas diffusion layer of a polymer electrolyte
   membrane fuel cell is presented. Atomic force microscopy was used to
   measure the fibre surface roughness and asperity height distributions
   for various fibres for Toray carbon paper. Hertzian contact mechanics
   was used to determine individual micro-contact areas and thermal
   resistances, and results were compared with the smooth cylinder
   approximation. The effective thermal contact resistance between rough
   fibres was determined using resistance network theory. The thermal
   contact resistance and total contact area were determined for various
   angles of fibre orientation and contact forces; results are presented as
   empirical formulations. It was found that the effective thermal contact
   resistance is significantly affected by fibre roughness features when
   compared to the smooth fibre case, which is often used in the
   literature. The analysis conducted provides an alternative to
   computationally expensive surface feature analyses by providing a tool
   which can be used to implement the nano-scale features of gas diffusion
   layer fibres into existing effective thermal conductivity models. (C)

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW X}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Implementation of abrupt phase discontinuities along a surface has been
   the theme of recent research on electromagnetic metasurfaces. Simple
   functionalities such as reflecting, refracting, or focusing plane waves
   have been demonstrated with devices featuring phase discontinuities, but
   optical surfaces allowing independent magnitude and phase control on the
   scattered waves have yet to emerge. In this paper, we propose the first
   true optical Huygens' surface, which explicitly utilizes orthogonal
   electric and magnetic responses to realize total control on an optical
   surface's local reflection coefficients. This extends the functionality
   of metasurfaces to an unprecedented level. We first demonstrate that a
   nanorod gap-surface plasmon resonator can act as a Huygens' source.
   Thereafter, by properly tuning and rotating these resonators, we realize
   arbitrary reflection optical metasurfaces-surfaces for which the local
   reflection coefficients can be independently tailored in both magnitude
   and phase. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach through
   designs of a metasurface that asymmetrically reflects two copolarized
   beams and a Dolph-Tschebyscheff optical reflectarray.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{615}},
Pages = {{47-55}},

Abstract = {{The impact of regular additions of a surfactant (ethylene
   bis-stearamide; EBS) at different time intervals was investigated on the
   powder characteristics of a biomedical Ti-10Nb-3Mo alloy (wt.\%). Ball
   milling was performed for 10 h on the elemental powders in four series
   of experiments at two rotation speeds (200 and 300 rpm). The addition of
   2 wt.\% total EBS at different time intervals during ball milling
   resulted in noticeable changes in particle size and morphology of the
   powders. The surfactant addition at shorter time intervals led to the
   formation of finer particles, a more homogenous powder distribution, a
   higher powder yield, and a lower contamination content in the final
   materials. Thermal analysis of the powders after ball milling suggested
   that differing decomposition rates of the surfactant were responsible
   for the measured powder particle changes and contamination contents. The
   results also indicated that the addition of surfactant during ball
   milling at 200 rpm caused a delay in the alloy formation, whereas ball
   milling at 300 rpm favored the formation of the titanium alloy. Crown

Abstract = {{The electrochemical detection of nucleic acids using an electrocatalytic
   reporter system and nanostructured microelectrodes is a powerful
   approach to ultrasensitive biosensing. In this report we systematically
   study for the first time the behavior of an electrocatalytic reporter
   system at nucleic acid-modified electrodes with varying structures and
   sizes. {[}Ru(NH3)(6)](3+) is used as a primary electron acceptor that is
   electrostatically attracted to nucleic acid-modified electrodes, and
   {[}Fe(CN)(6)](3-) is introduced into the redox system as a secondary
   electron acceptor to regenerate Ru3+ after electrochemical reduction. We
   found that the electrode structure has strong impact on mass transport
   and electron-transfer kinetics, with structures of specific dimensions
   yielding much higher electrochemical signals and catalytic efficiencies.
   The electrocatalytic signals obtained when gold sensors were
   electrodeposited in both circular and linear apertures were studied, and
   the smallest structures plated in linear apertures were found to exhibit
   the best performance with high current densities and turnover rates.
   This study provides important information for optimal assay performance

Abstract = {{This paper examines the internal power flow mechanisms that exist within
   a generalized modular multilevel converter (MMC) and examines
   alternatives for integration of distributed energy resources (DERs)
   within the MMC structure. Each phase leg of the MMC consists of two
   series connected strings of submodules, where each string of submodules
   is referred to as a phase arm. Based on analytically developed inter-arm
   power flow relations, a control methodology is proposed, which provides
   fully independent control of each arm's real power flow, facilitating
   extreme levels of inter-arm power transfer. This eliminates the need for
   uniform integration of DER units across all submodules of the MMC. Among
   others, viable operating configurations are shown to include DERs only
   integrated in the upper (or lower) phase arms and DERs integrated only
   in the upper and lower phase arms of a single phase leg. Power balance
   is maintained internal to the MMC via dc and ac currents circulating
   within the converter without distorting input dc or output ac currents.
   To maximize conversion efficiency, a mechanism for minimizing the
   necessary circulating ac currents under any inter-arm power flow
   condition is also identified. Comprehensive simulation results validate
   both the developed model and controls.}},

Abstract = {{The timestep of the finite-difference time-domain method (FDTD) is
   constrained by the stability limit known as the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy
   (CFL) condition. This limit can make FDTD simulations quite time

   methods have been proposed in the literature to extend the CFL limit,
   including implicit FDTD methods and filtering techniques. In this paper,
   we propose a novel approach, which combines model-order reduction and a
   perturbation algorithm to accelerate FDTD simulations beyond the CFL
   barrier. We compare the proposed algorithm against existing implicit and
   explicit CFL extension techniques, demonstrating increased accuracy and
   performance on a large number of test cases, including resonant
   cavities, a waveguide structure, a focusing metascreen, and a microstrip

Abstract = {{Biometrics is attracting increasing attention in privacy and security
   concerned issues, such as access control and remote financial
   transaction. However, advanced forgery and spoofing techniques are
   threatening the reliability of conventional biometric modalities. This
   has been motivating our investigation of a novel yet promising modality
   transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE), which is an acoustic
   response generated from cochlea after a click stimulus. Unlike
   conventional modalities that are easily accessible or captured, TEOAE is
   naturally immune to replay and falsification attacks as a physiological
   outcome from human auditory system. In this paper, we resort to wavelet
   analysis to derive the time-frequency representation of such
   nonstationary signal, which reveals individual uniqueness and long-term
   reproducibility. A machine learning technique linear discriminant
   analysis is subsequently utilized to reduce intrasubject variability and
   further capture intersubject differentiation features. Considering
   practical application, we also introduce a complete framework of the
   biometric system in both verification and identification modes.
   Comparative experiments on a TEOAE data set of biometric setting show
   the merits of the proposed method. Performance is further improved with
   fusion of information from both ears.}},

Title = {{Evaluating a proposed retrofit measure for a multi-unit residential
   building which uses an air-source heat pump operating in an enclosed
   balcony space}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{107-114}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To improve the energy performance of Toronto's post-war multi-unit
   residential buildings (MURBs), these buildings must be energy
   retrofitted. Here, a novel energy retrofit strategy employing air-source
   heat pumps (ASHPs) operating in enclosed balcony spaces is assessed. The
   enclosed balcony provides a thermal buffer zone (TBZ) which can improve
   the coefficient of performance of the ASHP compared to typical exterior
   operation by accessing captured solar gains. The estimated energy
   savings associated with implementing this retrofit strategy was
   determined using a hybrid modeling approach. A calibrated energy model
   of a 1968 MURB represented the base case energy consumption. Then, a
   supplementary algorithm, developed based on laboratory testing, was used
   to determine the quantity of energy that could be extracted from the TBZ
   and delivered to the north- and south-facing suites as well as to hot
   water storage. The modeling exercise yielded estimated whole-building
   energy and greenhouse gas emissions savings of 39\% and 45\%,
   respectively. Due to utility prices at the time of writing, the energy
   cost savings do not present a compelling financial case. However, the
   qualitative benefits of this retrofit strategy include suite-based
   control for occupants and the ability to sub-meter space heating energy
   use at the suite-level. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{During crushing, rock particles are subjected to complicated loading. It
   is desired to establish the relation between the loading and the
   fragmentation parameters for better understanding rock crushing
   mechanism. In this work, a split Hopkinson pressure bar system in
   combination with high speed cameras is utilized in the dynamic ball
   compression test, in which the spherical rock sample is adopted to avoid
   the shape effect. Using elasticity theory, the loading rate and the
   dynamic indirect tensile strength are first calculated. With the aid of
   the moment-trap technique and high speed cameras, the surface energy is
   determined for each sample. The relations between the loading rate and
   the fragmentation parameters, i. e., the number of fragments and the
   surface energy are established. The application of this method to a
   granitic rock shows that it is flexible and can be applied to the
   crushing study of generic brittle solids. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a user programmable computational/control platform
   developed to conduct real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS). The
   architecture of this platform is based on the integration of a real-time
   controller and a field programmable gate array (FPGA). This not only
   enables the user to apply user-defmed control laws to control the
   experimental substructures, but also provides ample computational
   resources to run the integration algorithm and analytical substructure
   state determination in real-time. In this platform the need for SCRAMNet
   as the communication device between real-time and servo-control
   workstations has been eliminated which was a critical component in
   several former RTHS platforms. The accuracy of the servo-hydraulic
   actuator displacement control, where the control tasks get executed on
   the FPGA was verified using single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) and 2
   degrees-of-freedom (2D0F) experimental substructures. Finally, the
   functionality of the proposed system as a robust and reliable RTHS
   platform for performance evaluation of structural systems was validated
   by conducting real-time hybrid simulation of a three story nonlinear
   structure with SDOF and 2DOF experimental substructures. Also, tracking
   indicators were employed to assess the accuracy of the results.}},

   Ontario water served as a source of natural DOM and colloidal particles.
   PhAC/EDC rejection experiments were conducted using raw Lake Ontario
   water and Lake Ontario water that was pre-treated with either
   ultrafiltration to remove colloidal particles, or fluidized ion exchange
   resins to remove DOM. Additionally, the concentration of cations (Ca2+,
   Mg2+, and Na+) in the raw and pre-treated water matrices was varied.
   While ionic PhACs and EDCs exhibited high rejections from all the water
   matrices examined, neutral compounds were most effectively rejected in
   water containing DOM and no colloids, and least effectively rejected
   from colloid-containing water with increased cations but no DOM. The
   presence of DOM significantly improved compound rejection and the
   increase in cation concentration significantly decreased rejection. The
   presence of colloids had comparatively little effect except to mitigate
   the impact of increased cation concentration, apparently providing some
   cation-buffering capacity. The sequence in which constituents are
   removed from waters during treatment may significantly impact PhAC and
   EDC removal, especially of neutral compounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The pile-soil interaction under wave loads is an extremely complex and
   difficult issue in engineering. In this study, a physical model test is
   designed based on the principle of the gravity similarity to obtain time
   histories of wave forces of unsteady regular waves, and to measure the
   magnitude and the distribution of wave forces acting on the piles. A
   numerical model and relevant numerical methods for the pile-soil contact
   surface are adopted based on the principles of elastic dynamics. For a
   practical project, the time histories of wave forces on the piles are
   obtained through physical model tests. The deformations of the piles in
   the pile-soil interactions and the distribution of the bending moment on
   the piles are studied. It is shown that, with the increase of the period
   of wave pressures, the absolute value of the horizontal displacement of
   the piles increases, the embedment depth of the piles increases, and the
   scope of influence of soils increases. The change of the bending moment
   on the piles is consistent with that of its theoretical results, and the
   proposed numerical method can very well simulate the properties of the
   piles.}},

Abstract = {{Collectively classified as white-rot fungi, certain basidiomycetes
   efficiently degrade the major structural polymers of wood cell walls. A
   small subset of these Agaricomycetes, exemplified by Phlebiopsis
   gigantea, is capable of colonizing freshly exposed conifer sapwood
   despite its high content of extractives, which retards the establishment
   of other fungal species. The mechanism(s) by which P. gigantea tolerates
   and metabolizes resinous compounds have not been explored. Here, we
   report the annotated P. gigantea genome and compare profiles of its
   transcriptome and secretome when cultured on fresh-cut versus
   solvent-extracted loblolly pine wood. The P. gigantea genome contains a
   conventional repertoire of hydrolase genes involved in
   cellulose/hemicellulose degradation, whose patterns of expression were
   relatively unperturbed by the absence of extractives. The expression of
   genes typically ascribed to lignin degradation was also largely
   unaffected. In contrast, genes likely involved in the transformation and
   detoxification of wood extractives were highly induced in its presence.
   Their products included an ABC transporter, lipases, cytochrome P450s,
   glutathione S-transferase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. Other regulated
   genes of unknown function and several constitutively expressed genes are
   also likely involved in P. gigantea's extractives metabolism. These
   results contribute to our fundamental understanding of pioneer
   colonization of conifer wood and provide insight into the diverse
   chemistries employed by fungi in carbon cycling processes.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a four-stage hierarchical resource allocation scheme for the
   downlink of a large-scale small-cell network in the context of
   orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). Since
   interference limits the capabilities of such networks, resource
   allocation and interference management are crucial. However, obtaining
   the globally optimum resource allocation is exponentially complex and
   mathematically intractable. Here, we develop a partially decentralized
   algorithm to obtain an effective solution. The three major advantages of
   our work are as follows: 1) as opposed to a fixed resource allocation,
   we consider load demand at each access point (AP) when allocating
   spectrum; 2) to prevent overloaded APs, our scheme is dynamic in the
   sense that as the users move from one AP to the other, so do the
   allocated resources, if necessary, and such considerations generally
   result in huge computational complexity, which brings us to the third
   advantage: 3) we tackle complexity by introducing a hierarchical scheme
   comprising four phases: user association, load estimation, interference
   management via graph coloring, and scheduling. We provide mathematical
   analysis for the first three steps modeling the user and AP locations as
   Poisson point processes. Finally, we provide the results of numerical
   simulations to illustrate the efficacy of our scheme.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the downlink spectral efficiency of distributed
   antenna system (DAS) where antenna ports are distributed as a Poisson
   point process (PPP), while assuming channel state information is not
   available at the transmitter and each antenna has an individual power
   constraint. We first consider the case with a single user per cell and
   analyze regular DAS with fixed cell boundaries, and study both blanket
   transmission where the user is served by all the antenna ports within
   each cell, and selective transmission where only the closest antenna
   port to the user within each cell is selected. We derive efficiently
   computable spectral efficiency expressions as a function of the user
   location, and show the limitation of blanket transmission by
   establishing that the cell-edge spectral efficiency under blanket
   transmission is upper bounded by a constant. Further, from a network
   perspective, we also model users as a PPP and assume a time-division
   multiple-access (TDMA) scheme, and give analytical expressions for and
   compare the average spectral efficiencies of regular DAS and
   user-centric DAS where no fixed cell boundaries exist. We validate our
   models with simulation, and show that selective transmission outperforms
   blanket transmission for regular DAS, and user-centric DAS with
   selective transmission achieves a higher spectral efficiency averaged
   over the network than regular DAS.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides an empirical basis for the evaluation of policies
   and programs that can increase the usage of bikes for different purposes
   as well as bike ownership. It uses an integrated econometric model of
   latent variable connecting multiple discrete choices. Empirical models
   are estimated by using a bicycle demand survey conducted in the City of
   Toronto in 2009. Empirical investigations reveal that latent perceptions
   of `bikeability' and `safety consciousness' directly influence the
   choice of biking. It is also found that the choice of the level of bike
   ownership (number of bikes) is directly influenced by latent
   `comfortability of biking'. The number of bikes owned moreover has a
   strong influence on the choices of biking for different purposes. It is
   clear that bike users in the City of Toronto are highly safety
   conscious. Increasing on-street and separate bike lanes proved to have
   the maximum effects on attracting more people to biking by increasing
   the perception of bikeability in the city, comfortability of biking in
   the city and increasing bike users' sense of safety. In terms of
   individuals' characteristics, older males are found to be the most
   conformable and younger females are the least comfortable group of
   cyclists in Toronto. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Qualitative Analysis of Precipitate Formation on the Surface and in the

Abstract = {{Introduction: Interaction of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) mixed with
   chlorhexidine (CHX) produces a brown precipitate containing
   para-chloroaniline (PCA). When QMiX is mixed with NaOCl, no precipitate
   forms, but color change occurs. The aim of this study was to
   qualitatively assess the formation of precipitate and PCA on the surface
   and in the tubules of dentin irrigated with NaOCl, followed either by
   EDTA, NaOCl, and CHX or by saline and QMiX by using time-of-flight
   secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). Methods: Dentin blocks were
   obtained from human maxillary molars, embedded in resin, and
   cross-sectioned to expose dentin. Specimens in group 1 were immersed in
   2.5\% NaOCl, followed by 17\% EDTA, 2.5\% NaOCl, and 2\% CI-IX.
   Specimens in group 2 were immersed in 2.5\% NaOCl, followed by saline
   and QMiX. The dentin surfaces were subjected to TOE-SIMS spectra
   analysis. Longitudinal sections of dentin blocks were then exposed and
   subjected to TOF-SIMS analysis. All samples and analysis were performed
   in triplicate for confirmation. Results: TOF-SIMS analysis of group 1
   revealed an irregular precipitate, containing PCA and CHX breakdown
   products, on the dentin surfaces, occluding and extending into the
   tubules. In TOF-SIMS analysis of group 2, no precipitates, including
   PCA, were detected on the dentin surface or in the tubules. Conclusions:
   Within the limitations of this study, precipitate containing PCA was
   formed in the tubules of dentin irrigated with NaOCl followed by CHX. No
   precipitates or PCA were detected in the tubules of dentin irrigated
   with NaOCl followed by saline and QMiX.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling the polarization of the electromagnetic field is a crucial
   aspect of many communication and imaging systems. Building off of
   previous work on Huygens surfaces, which are surfaces used to manipulate
   wavefronts using electric and magnetic surface impedances, the concept
   of a tensor Huygens surface is introduced. A tensor Huygens surface
   consists of electric and magnetic surface impedances which are tensors
   as opposed to scalars. In this paper we show how the polarization can be
   modified from a given initial state to a desired state specifically
   using a tensor Huygens surface. We examine the fields at the surface to
   find the required impedance tensors to manipulate the polarization. We
   also come up with an equivalent circuit model which captures the
   behavior of the surface as well as its equivalent S-parameter
   representation. Furthermore, we examine how chiral functionality can be
   realized using two cascaded Huygens surfaces. We validate these results
   using a TLM solver as well. Finally, we demonstrate a possible
   implementation of a tensor Huygens surface made up of skewed dipoles and
   loops.}},

Abstract = {{Deep ocean injection of carbon dioxide into subsea geologic formations
   carries a risk of carbon dioxide leakage as well as leakage of methane
   from petroleum bearing formations that injection wells may penetrate.
   Therefore, leakage monitoring technology for this application must
   detect carbon dioxide and distinguish it from methane. Here we
   demonstrate an all-optical approach to detect and differentiate between
   liquid carbon dioxide and supercritical methane bubbles in synthetic
   seawater at 9.65 MPa. This method employs fiber tip refractometry, a
   fiber optic measurement technique that is sensitive to the refractive
   index of the surrounding medium. Carbon dioxide and methane bubbles are
   clearly detected as they pass the sensor tip and these species are
   clearly distinguished from each other. Interferometric signals are also
   observed in association with the transition of bubbles onto and off of
   the sensor tip. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid progress in identifying disease biomarkers has increased the
   importance of creating high-performance detection technologies. Over the
   last decade, the design of many detection platforms has focused on
   either the nano or micro length scale. Here, we review recent strategies
   that combine nano- and microscale materials and devices to produce large
   improvements in detection sensitivity, speed and accuracy, allowing
   previously undetectable biomarkers to be identified in clinical samples.
   Microsensors that incorporate nanoscale features can now rapidly detect
   disease-related nucleic acids expressed in patient samples. New
   microdevices that separate large clinical samples into nanocompartments
   allow precise quantitation of analytes, and microfluidic systems that
   utilize nanoscale binding events can detect rare cancer cells in the
   bloodstream more accurately than before. These advances will lead to
   faster and more reliable clinical diagnostic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Harnessing ambient vibration energy using piezoelectric materials is a
   promising alternative solution to batteries to inexhaustibly power
   small-scale mobile devices. This paper presents an innovative energy
   harvester, named high-efficiency compressive-mode piezoelectric energy
   harvester (HC-PEH). It consists of a pair of elastic beams and a
   flex-compressive center where the piezoelectric element bears a dynamic
   compressive load. The compressive mode is preferred than the
   commonly-used bending mode and tensile mode due to the superior
   compressive strength of piezoceramics. To cater to the characteristic of
   piezoceramics: large ultimate stress, but extremely small ultimate
   strain, a multi-stage force amplification mechanism is developed in the
   design. The HC-PEH shows superior capability of high power output and
   favorable nonlinear phenomena at low frequency range. Under an
   acceleration of 0.5 g (g = 9.8 m/s(2)), a maximum power of 19 mW is
   produced at 21 Hz, which is about one order of magnitude higher than the
   power output of energy harvesters previously reported. The capability of
   high power output of the HC-PEH demonstrates the practicability of using
   energy harvesters to power most of wireless sensors. (C) 2014 Elsevier

   robot to continuously learn from its own experiences in an environment

   disaster scenes. A direction-based exploration technique is integrated
   in the controller to expand the search area of the robot via the
   classification of regions and the rubble piles within these regions.
   Both simulations and physical experiments in USAR-like environments

Abstract = {{Power balancing is crucial for the reliability of an electric power
   grid. In this paper, we consider an aggregator coordinating a group of
   distributed storage (DS) units to provide power balancing service to a
   power grid through charging or discharging. We present a real-time,
   distributed algorithm that enables the DS units to determine their own
   charging or discharging amounts. The algorithm accommodates a wide
   spectrum of vital system characteristics, including time-varying power
   imbalance amount and electricity price, finite battery size constraints,
   cost of using external energy sources, and battery degradation. We
   develop a modified Lyapunov optimization framework for real-time power
   balancing and provide a fast iterative method for distributed
   implementation. The two components interact through a novel cost cushion
   parameter that tunes the trade-off between system performance and
   convergence speed. We show analytically that the algorithm converges
   quickly and provides asymptotically optimal performance as the capacity
   of DS units increases. We further study through simulation the algorithm
   performance over a wide range of parameter values and demonstrate that
   it is highly competitive over a greedy alternative.}},

Abstract = {{We present design and measurement details for a 0-3 multi-stage
   noise-shaping (MASH) ADC that achieves a dynamic range of 88 dB over 53
   MHz signal bandwidth. The ADC utilizes a zeroth-order front-end, i.e., a
   17-level flash ADC, to perform a coarse quantization and a third-order
   7-level continuous-time Delta Sigma back-end to digitize the residue
   error of the front-end. The ADC achieves the high thermal noise power
   efficiency of a continuous-time feedforward Delta Sigma modulator and
   the flat signal transfer function of a flash ADC. The test chip,
   implemented in a 28 nm CMOS process, clocks at 3.2 GHz. The average
   noise spectral density with small input signals is - 167 dBFS/Hz and the
   dynamic range is 88 dB. The test chip ADC consumes a total power of 235
   mW from triple power supplies of 0.9/1.8/-1.0 V. The thermal-noise

Abstract = {{The most computationally intensive step of the Guruswami-Sudan list
   decoder for generalized Reed-Solomon codes is the formation of a
   bivariate interpolation polynomial. Complexity can be reduced if this
   polynomial has prefactors, i. e., factors of its univariate constituent
   polynomials that are independent of the received vector, and hence known
   a priori. For example, the well-known re-encoding projection due to
   Koetter et al. leads to one class of prefactors. This paper introduces
   so-called Sierpinski prefactors that result from the property that many
   binomial coefficients, which arise in the multiplicity constraints
   defined in terms of the Hasse derivative, are zero modulo the underlying
   field characteristic. It is shown that re-encoding prefactors and
   Sierpinski prefactors can be combined to achieve a significantly reduced
   Guruswami-Sudan interpolation step. In certain practically relevant
   cases, the introduction of Sierpinski prefactors reduces the number of
   unknown polynomial coefficients by an additional 10\% or more (beyond
   the reduction due to re-encoding prefactors alone), without incurring
   additional computational effort at the decoder.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the need for and provides an improved fitting of
   the line parameters when a wide range of frequencies with emphasis on
   the dc response is the objective. The improved fitting is based on a
   low-order fitting of a function error for each of the line parameters,
   that is, the characteristic admittance and propagation function, in the
   low-frequency range. The function error represents the difference
   between the analytical evaluation of the line parameters, that is,
   obtained from a frequency-dependent distributed parameters line model,
   and their initial rational approximation, for example, given by an
   electromagnetic transients software tool. The approximated function
   error, added to the initial rational approximation of the line
   parameters, provides the enhanced fitted line model. The enhanced
   fitting improves the dc response of the line and ensures numerical
   stability in time-domain simulations. This paper applies the proposed
   fitting approach to the universal line model for time-domain
   simulations. The simulation results by the enhanced fitting are
   validated by comparing the results with those obtained from a
   frequency-domain line model (FDLM). Two case studies are presented to
   illustrate the proposed fitting approach.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetable oils are typically extracted with hexane; however, health and
   environmental concerns over its use have prompted the search for
   alternative solvents. Mustard oil was extracted with isopropyl alcohol
   (IPA) to produce an IPA-oil miscella suitable for industrial
   applications. Single-stage extraction resulted in 87.6 \% oil yield at a
   10:1 (v/w) IPA/flour ratio. Multiple-stage extraction resulted in higher
   extraction efficiency with lower IPA use. Four-stage cross-current
   extraction at an IPA/flour ratio of 2:1 (v/w) per stage resulted in 93.7
   \% oil yield. At 45 A degrees C, a 91.5 \% oil yield was achieved with
   three-stage extraction using a 2:1 (v/w) IPA/flour ratio. Any changes to
   the pH of the mixture resulted in reduced oil yield. Water also reduced
   the extraction efficiency. The azeotropic IPA solution containing 13 \%
   water extracted similar to 40 \% less oil than did dry IPA in both
   single and multiple-stage extractions. Some polar compounds were also
   extracted, including sugars; however, protein extraction was negligible.
   The protein left in the extracted meal was not degraded or lost during
   the extraction. The results suggest that IPA is an excellent solvent for
   mustard oil, but water content exceeding 5 \% in the solvent adversely
   affects the oil extraction and reuse of the IPA.}},

Abstract = {{Our interest in the trabecular alignment within bone stems from the need
   to better understand the manner in which it can affect ultrasound
   propagation, particularly in pedicles. Within long bones it is well
   established that trabecular structures are aligned in an organized
   manner associated with the direction of load distribution; however, for
   smaller bones there are limited alignment studies. To investigate the
   directionality distribution in a quantitative manner we used a micro-CT
   to obtain three-dimensional (3D) structural data and developed
   analytical methods based on the special properties of Gabor filters.
   Implementation of these techniques has been developed and tested on a
   variety of simulated images as well as on 3D structures whose geometry
   is well-defined. To test the use of this technique we compared the
   results obtained on vertebral body trabecular bone with visual
   directionality and previous measurements by others. The method has been
   applied to six human pedicle samples in two orthogonal planes with
   results that provide reasonable proof-of-principle evidence that the
   method is well suited for estimating the directionality distribution
   within pedicle bones.}},

Abstract = {{Since there is currently no optimal treatment for chronic neck or back
   pain that restores full spine functionality and disc height, recent
   research has focused on developing a regenerative medicine approach.
   This requires a better understanding of the phenotype nature of the
   different cell types present in disc tissues. In particular, there is
   very little known about the differentiated states of cells that co-exist
   within the annulus fibrosus (AF), despite the critical importance of
   this tissue in maintaining disc functionality. Maintenance of the
   differentiated states of these AF cells is imperative to the production
   of appropriate extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules and to the
   engineering of functional AF tissues. The objective of this study was to
   determine whether inner annulus fibrosus (IAF) cells when grown on
   polycarbonate urethane (PU) scaffolds in vitro will produce ECM
   molecules characteristic of IAF cells and different from outer annulus
   fibrosus (OAF) cells. OAF and IAF cells isolated from bovine coccygeal
   intervertebral disc were grown on nanofibrous PU for approximately 14
   days. The effect of culture time on ECM gene expression, DNA content,
   and the synthesis and retention of proteoglycans and collagens were
   evaluated for both OAF and IAF cells. The ECM accumulated was also
   characterized by immunostaining and Western blot. The tensile strengths
   of the tissue/scaffolds were evaluated at 14 days. Both OAF and IAF
   cells both attached to PU and had similar DNA contents over time. IAF
   cells maintained relatively higher levels of COL2A1, ACAN and VCAN gene
   expression, and relatively lower levels of COL1A1 gene expression when
   compared with OAF cells, by 10 days of culture. IAF cells synthesized
   and retained similar amounts of total collagen and proteoglycans when
   compared with OAF cells. While both OAF and IAF cells accumulated type I
   collagen, only IAF cells accumulated type II collagen. Both cell types
   accumulated similar amounts of aggrecan but IAF cells accumulated higher
   amounts of versican as determined by immunostaining. In conclusion,
   nanofibrous PU scaffolds enabled the maintenance of most of the
   characteristic features of the IAF cell phenotype, and were different
   from those of OAF cells.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is the leading cause of
   mortality following lung transplantation. We conducted a retrospective
   cohort study including 397 bilateral lung recipients transplanted in
   from 1996 to 2009 to determine the association between ambient air
   pollution, CLAD and mortality. Pollution exposure was assessed using
   satellite-based estimates of nitrogen dioxide, distance to major roadway
   and total length of roadways around a patient's home. Cumulative
   exposures to ozone and particulate matter were estimated from
   concentrations measured at fixed-site stations near patients' homes
   using inverse distance weighted interpolation. Cox proportional hazards
   models were used to estimate the associations of CLAD with air pollution
   exposure, adjusting for various individual and neighborhood
   characteristics. During the follow-up, 185 patients developed CLAD
   (47\%) and 101 patients died (25\%). Fifty-four deaths (53\%) were due
   to CLAD. We observed an association between CLAD development and road
   density within 200m of a patient's home (HR 1.30 {[}95\% CI 1.07-1.58]).
   Although based on a subgroup of 14 patients, living within 100m of a
   highway was associated with a high risk for developing CLAD (HR 4.91
   {[}95\% CI 2.22, 10.87]). These data suggest that exposure to
   traffic-related air pollution is associated with development of CLAD
   among lung transplant recipients.
   This retrospective cohort study demonstrates an association between
   surrogate measures of traffic-related air pollution at recipients' home
   addresses and the development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{Combinations of group A and B streptogramins (i.e., dalfopristin and
   quinupristin) are ``last-resort{''} antibiotics for the treatment of
   infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens, including
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant
   Enterococcus faecium. Resistance to streptogramins has arisen via
   multiple mechanisms, including the deactivation of the group A component
   by the large family of virginiamycin O-acetyltransferase (Vat) enzymes.
   Despite the structural elucidation performed for the VatD
   acetyltransferase, which provided a general molecular framework for
   activity, a detailed characterization of the essential catalytic and
   antibiotic substrate-binding determinants in Vat enzymes is still
   lacking. We have determined the crystal structure of S. aureus VatA in
   apo, virginiamycin M1- and acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-bound forms and
   provide an extensive mutagenesis and functional analysis of the
   structural determinants required for catalysis and streptogramin A
   recognition. Based on an updated genomic survey across the Vat enzyme
   family, we identified key conserved residues critical for VatA activity
   that are not part of the O-acetylation catalytic apparatus. Exploiting
   such constraints of the Vat active site may lead to the development of
   streptogramin A compounds that evade inactivation by Vat enzymes while
   retaining binding to their ribosomal target.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of soot surface reactivity, in terms of the evolution of
   sites on the soot particles' surface available for reaction with gas
   phase species, is investigated via modeling numerous ethylene/air
   flames, using a detailed combustion and sectional soot particle dynamics
   model. A new definition of a particles' age is introduced. A methodology
   has been developed to study soot particle surface reactivity.
   Subsequently, it is investigated if the surface reactivity can be
   correlated with the particle age. An exponential function giving a
   smooth transition of surface activity with particle age is employed to
   model a variety of ethylene/air flames, which differ in fuel stream
   dilution levels, fuel stream premixing, and burner configurations.
   Excellent agreement with measured soot volume fractions of a variety of
   flames, burners, and datasets could be obtained with this approach. The
   newly developed function based on particle age eliminates the need to
   fit soot surface growth parameters to each experimental condition.
   Finally, the applicability and limitation of the new surface reactivity
   function for use in detailed soot formation models is discussed. (C)

Title = {{iAware: Making Live Migration of Virtual Machines Interference-Aware in

Abstract = {{Large-scale datacenters have been widely used to host cloud services,
   which are typically allocated to different virtual machines (VMs)
   through resource multiplexing across shared physical servers. Although
   recent studies have primarily focused on harnessing live migration of
   VMs to achieve load balancing and power saving among different servers,
   there has been little attention on the incurred performance interference
   and cost on both source and destination servers during and after such VM
   migration. To avoid potential violations of service-level-agreement
   (SLA) demanded by cloud applications, this paper proposes iAware, a
   lightweight interference-aware VM live migration strategy. It
   empirically captures the essential relationships between VM performance
   interference and key factors that are practically accessible through
   realistic experiments of benchmark workloads on a Xen virtualized
   cluster platform. iAware jointly estimates and minimizes both migration
   and co-location interference among VMs, by designing a simple
   multi-resource demand-supply model. Extensive experiments and
   complementary large-scale simulations are conducted to validate the
   performance gain and runtime overhead of iAware in terms of I/O and
   network throughput, CPU consumption, and scalability, compared to the
   traditional interference-unaware VM migration approaches. Moreover, we
   demonstrate that iAware is flexible enough to cooperate with existing VM
   scheduling or consolidation policies in a complementary manner, such
   that the load balancing or power saving can still be achieved without
   sacrificing performance.}},

Abstract = {{Chemotherapy outpatient scheduling is a complex, dynamic, uncertain
   problem. Chemotherapy centres are facing increasing demands and they
   need to increase their efficiency; however there are very few studies
   looking at using optimization technology on the chemotherapy scheduling
   problem. We address dynamic uncertainty that arises from requests for
   appointments that arrive in real time and uncertainty due to last minute
   scheduling changes. We propose dynamic template scheduling, a novel
   technique that combines proactive and online optimization and we apply
   it to the chemotherapy outpatient scheduling problem. We create a
   proactive template of an expected day in the chemotherapy centre using a
   deterministic optimization model and a sample of appointments. As
   requests for appointments arrive, we use the template to schedule them.
   When a request arrives that does not fit the template, we update the
   template online using the optimization model and a revised set of
   appointments. To accommodate last minute additions and cancellations to

Abstract = {{Precision-guided projectiles (PGPs) typically deployed in smart
   munitions are operated and guided by highly sophisticated embedded
   electronic systems (EES). These PGPs are subjected to severe shock loads
   resulting from the ignition of the propellant during their launch. These
   shock loads, which are typically characterised by high intensity, short
   duration and wave reflections at varied frequencies, often lead to the
   failure of the EES. It is the objective of this work to conduct a
   comprehensive multiphysics analysis of the launch process of PGPs
   accounting for coupling and interaction effects between the different
   media (propellant, PGP, confined volume and free space). Specifically,
   we investigated the entire launch process that include the ignition of
   the propellant to observe local and global features of the setback, set
   forward pressure and acceleration histories using explicit axisymmetric
   Lagrangian-Eulerian finite element simulations. In this work, we also
   examine the severity and frequency of the reflected waves as well as the
   springback of the PGPs resulting from these local oscillations as they
   exit the muzzle. In addition, the flight state transition due to muzzle
   exit in terms of pressure and flow velocity is also discussed. Our
   results reveal the complex phenomena associated with the dynamic
   response of the PGPs and pressurization process resulting from the
   ignition of propellant during launch that are characterized by high
   oscillatory pressure profiles and projectile springback.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo evaluate a new class of manganese porphyrins with tunable
   pharmacokinetics as potential gadolinium (Gd)-free T-1 agents for
   contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   Materials and MethodsTwo new contrast agents, MnTCP and MnP2, were
   evaluated in four female rats. MRI was performed daily up to 3 days
   postinjection (0.05 mmol/kg) on a 3 T clinical scanner. T-1 relaxation
   times and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI were performed to assess
   contrast enhancement and clearance in blood, heart, liver, kidney, and
   muscle.
   ResultsRelative T-1 decreases were similar for MnTCP and Gd-DTPA in all
   tissues but were significantly larger (P < 0.05) for MnP2 in blood,
   heart, kidney, and liver (2-6-fold larger). Clearance of MnTCP was
   similar to Gd-DTPA, with T-1 returning to baseline by 40 minutes and
   complete elimination in 1 day. MnP2 was cleared from blood after 2 days
   and sustained a lowered T-1 in other tissues for at least 1 hour (P <
   0.05). The maximum enhancement, slope, and time-to-peak were similar
   between contrast agents. Only the parameter AUC(60) differed, with MnP2
   yielding the largest AUC(60) values primarily through longer retention
   in tissue.
   ConclusionMnTCP and MnP2 offer distinct applications as Gd-free T-1
   contrast agents. MnTCP behaves like a Gd-DTPA analog, while MnP2
   provides significantly greater and longer positive signal enhancement.J.

Abstract = {{Medium perfusion has been shown to enhance cell proliferation and matrix
   protein production. In more recent work, under perfusion, a
   degradable/polar/hydrophobic/ionic polyurethane (D-PHI) scaffold was
   shown to enhance growth and production of collagen by human gingival
   fibroblasts (HGFs). However, the nature of the HGFs cultured in the
   perfused D-PHI scaffolds, and the mechanisms by which medium perfusion
   activates these cells to facilitate proliferation and collagen
   production are not defined. The current study sought to investigate HGF
   interaction within the D-PHI scaffolds under perfusion by examining the
   production and the spatial distribution of alpha-smooth muscle actin
   (alpha-SMA) and type I collagen (Col I), the secretion of transforming
   growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) in
   the conditioned medium, with a goal of defining the mechanistic pathways
   affecting the production of these markers in the dynamic culture. It was
   found that the perfused D-PHI scaffold shifted the HGF phenotype from
   myofibroblast-like (upregulation of alpha-SMA) to fibroblast-like
   (downregulation of alpha-SMA) over the course of 28 days. Both TGF-beta
   1 and FGF-2 were significantly greater in the dynamic vs. static culture
   at day 1. Although TGF-beta 1 has been often reported to increase
   alpha-SMA and collagen expression, the D-PHI material and significant
   high level of FGF-2 at day 1 of dynamic culture appear to play a role in
   regulating alpha-SMA production while allowing HGFs to increase Col I
   production. beta 1-integrin production was increased and focal adhesion
   kinase (FAK) were activated 2 h after HGFs were exposed to medium
   perfusion, which may have in part promoted cell growth, alpha-SMA and
   Col l production in the early dynamic culture. Consequently, the D-PHI
   material and medium perfusion has modulated fibroblast phenotype, and
   enhanced cell growth and Col I production through the coordinated
   actions of TGF-beta 1, FGF-2, beta 1-integrin and FAK. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Grooved substrates are commonly used to guide cell alignment and produce
   in vitro tissues that mimic certain aspects of in vivo cellular
   organization. These more sophisticated tissues provide valuable in vitro
   models for testing drugs and for dissecting out molecular mechanisms
   that direct tissue organization. To increase the accessibility of these
   tissue models we describe a simple and yet reproducible strategy to
   produce 1 mu m-spaced grooved well plates suitable for conducting
   automated analysis of cellular responses. We characterize the alignment
   of four human cell types: retinal epithelial cells, umbilical vein
   endothelial cells, foreskin fibroblasts, and human pluripotent
   stem-cell-derived cardiac cells on grooves. We find all cells align
   along the grooves to differing extents at both sparse and confluent
   densities. To increase the sophistication of in vitro tissue
   organization possible, we also created hybrid substrates with controlled
   patterns of microgrooved and flat regions that can be identified in
   real-time using optical microscopy. Using our hybrid patterned surfaces
   we explore: (i) the ability of neighboring cells to provide a template
   to organize surrounding cells that are not directly exposed to grooved
   topographic cues, and (ii) the distance over which this template effect
   can operate in confluent cell sheets. We find that in fibroblast sheets,
   but not epithelial sheets, cells aligned on grooves can direct alignment
   of neighboring cells in flat regions over a limited distance of
   approximately 200 mu m. Our hybrid surface plate provides a novel tool
   for studying the collective response of groups of cells exposed to
   differential topographical cues. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A new class of the multi-element catalysis system, Co-Cr-Pt-O, is used
   for vertically-aligned few-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) forest synthesis
   by a sandwich-growth technology in electron cyclotron resonance chemical
   vapor deposition. The effect of catalyst compositions on the resulting
   particle sizes after pretreatment, and the influence of process
   parameters on the CNT forest heights and diameters are investigated.
   Results show that a plasma pretreatment step reduces the metal oxides
   present in the as-deposited Co-Cr-Pt-O catalyst to their metallic states
   or to mixed metallic/oxidic states, and the co-catalytic synergistic
   effect during the reduction process thus leads to the production of
   uniformly small particles with a size of 3.3-3.9 nm over the substrate.
   Moreover, with CH4 as the carbon source, vertically-aligned CNT forests
   of similar to 12 mu m in height are achieved, and further
   characterizations indicate that the forests consist of dominant
   triple-walled nanotubes with an average inner tube diameter of 3.2-3.7
   nm mostly. Additionally, field emission measurements show that the
   turn-on field of the CNT-forest emitters is below 2.6 V/mu m, and the
   emission current density can reach 110 mA/cm(2) at 4.5 V/mu m. High
   reproducibility of field emission characteristics and Raman signals
   suggests the regularity of the CNT forests in structure and size. (C)

Abstract = {{A series of one donor-two acceptor (D-A(1))-(D-A(2)) random terpolymers
   containing a 2,7-carbazole donor and varying compositions of perylene
   diimide (PDI) and naphthalene diimide (NDI) acceptors was synthesized
   via Suzuki coupling polymerization. The optical properties of the
   terpolymers are weighted sums of the constituent parent copolymers and
   all show strong absorption over the 400 to 700 nm range with optical
   bandgaps ranging from 1.77 to 1.87 eV, depending on acceptor
   composition. The copolymers were tested as acceptor materials in bulk
   heterojunction all-polymer solar cells using
   poly{[}(4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo{[}1,2-b;4,5-b]dithiophene)-2,6-d
   iyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexanoyl)-thieno{[}3,4-b]thiophene)-2,6-diyl]
   (PBDTTT-C) as the donor material. In contrast to the optoelectronic
   properties, the measured device parameters are not composition
   dependent, and rather depend solely on the presence of the NDI unit,
   where the devices containing any amount of NDI perform half as well as
   those using the parent polymer containing only carbazole and PDI.
   Overall this is the first example of a one donor-two acceptor random
   terpolymer system containing perylene diimide (PDI) and naphthalene
   diimide (NDI) acceptor units, and demonstrates a facile method of tuning
   polymer optoelectronic properties while minimizing the need for
   complicated synthetic and purification steps. (c) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{We introduce a new `multi-layered' indicator set for urban metabolism
   (UM) studies in megacities. The indicator set is designed for gathering
   information on the definition (spatial boundaries, constituent cities,
   population, economy), biophysical characteristics (climate, population
   density, building floor area), and metabolic flows (water, waste,
   materials, and all types of energy) of megacities. In addition, it
   addresses the role of utilities in the provision of services and
   regulatory actions that, along with public governance, may influence
   (and/or control) the urban metabolism. In the article, we give
   background context to the growth and development of megacities, their
   overarching socio-economic issues, and the definition of their
   boundaries. Two methodologies to define megacity boundaries are
   compared, showing that the definition of `megacity' is not trivial and
   that further investigation is needed to establish a baseline for
   comparison of urban metabolism data. Use of the standardized indicator
   set will ease inter-city comparisons of urban metabolism, whilst
   enhancing knowledge of megacities and their transformation into
   sustainable systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Forest carbon accounting methods and the consequences of forest
   bioenergy for national greenhouse gas emissions inventories}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{164-173}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{While bioenergy plays a key role in strategies for increasing renewable
   energy deployment, studies assessing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from
   forest bioenergy systems have identified a potential trade-off of the
   system with forest carbon stocks. Of particular importance to national
   GHG inventories is how trade-offs between forest carbon stocks and
   bioenergy production are accounted for within the Agriculture, Forestry
   and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector under current and future international
   climate change mitigation agreements. Through a case study of
   electricity produced using wood pellets from harvested forest stands in
   Ontario, Canada, this study assesses the implications of forest carbon
   accounting approaches on net emissions attributable to pellets produced
   for domestic use or export. Particular emphasis is placed on the forest
   management reference level (FMRL) method, as it will be employed by most
   Annex I nations in the next Kyoto Protocol Commitment Period. While
   bioenergy production is found to reduce forest carbon sequestration,
   under the FMRL approach this trade-off may not be accounted for and thus
   not incur an accountable AFOLU-related emission, provided that total
   forest harvest remains at or below that defined under the FMRL baseline.
   In contrast, accounting for forest carbon trade-offs associated with
   harvest for bioenergy results in an increase in net GHG emissions (AFOLU
   and life cycle emissions) lasting 37 or 90 years (if displacing coal or
   natural gas combined cycle generation, respectively). AFOLU emissions
   calculated using the Gross-Net approach are dominated by legacy effects
   of past management and natural disturbance, indicating near-term net
   forest carbon increase but longer-term reduction in forest carbon
   stocks. Export of wood pellets to EU markets does not greatly affect the
   total life cycle GHG emissions of wood pellets. However, pellet
   exporting countries risk creating a considerable GHG emissions burden,
   as they are responsible for AFOLU and bioenergy production emissions but
   do not receive credit for pellets displacing fossil fuel-related GHG
   emissions. Countries producing bioenergy from forest biomass, whether
   for domestic use or for export, should carefully consider potential
   implications of alternate forest carbon accounting methods to ensure
   that potential bioenergy pathways can contribute to GHG emissions
   reduction targets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a Markov chain approach to forecast the production output of
   a human-machine system, while encompassing the effects of operator
   learning. This approach captures two possible effects of learning:
   increased production rate and reduced downtime due to human error. In
   the proposed Markov chain, three scenarios are possible for the machine
   at each time interval: survival, failure, and repair. To calculate the
   state transition probabilities, we use a proportional hazards model to
   calculate the hazard rate, in terms of operator-related factors and
   machine working age. Given the operator learning curves and their effect
   on reducing human error over time, the proposed approach is considered
   to be a non-homogeneous Markov chain. Its result is the expected machine
   uptime. This quantity, along with production forecasting at various
   operator skill levels, provides us with the expected production output.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of internal architecture on the mechanical properties of
   stochastic honeycombs was investigated by using four polypropylenes with
   varying rheological properties. The polymers were first characterized in
   terms of their thermal and mechanical properties, and then used to
   fabricate a set of stochastic honeycombs over a range of densities. The
   internal architecture was characterized by X-ray tomography, and the
   out-of-plane compressive properties of the stochastic honeycombs were
   determined. Overall, the strengths varied from 1 to 4 MPa over a core
   density range of 7-14 \%. A thin-plate buckling model was developed to
   build a predictive strength model. This model was split into a material
   properties portion (dependent on the polymer stiffness) and an
   architectural portion (dependent on the fraction of bound webs in the
   honeycomb). The model was found to serve as a good first step towards
   predicting the strength of irregular honeycombs.}},

Journal = {{PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{469-484}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, the surge of large-scale peer-to-peer (P2P)
   applications has brought huge amounts of P2P traffic, which has
   significantly changed the Internet traffic pattern and increased the
   traffic-relay cost at the Internet Service Providers (ISPs). To
   alleviate the stress on networks, methods of localized peer selection
   have been proposed that advocate neighbor selection within the same
   network (AS or ISP) to reduce the cross-ISP traffic. Nevertheless,
   localized peer selection may potentially lead to the downgrade of
   download speed at the peers, rendering a non-negligible tradeoff between
   the download performance and traffic localization in the P2P system.
   Aiming at effective peer selection strategies that achieve any desired
   Pareto optimum in face of the tradeoff, our contributions in this paper
   are three-fold: (1) We characterize the performance and locality
   tradeoff as a multi-objective -matching optimization problem. In
   particular, we first present a generic weighted -matching model that
   characterizes the tit-for-tat in BitTorrent-like peer selection. We then
   introduce multiple optimization objectives into the model, which
   effectively characterize the performance and locality tradeoff using
   simultaneous objectives to optimize. (2) We design fully distributed
   peer selection algorithms that can effectively approximate any desired
   Pareto optimum of the global multi-objective optimization problem, which
   represents a desired tradeoff point between performance and locality in
   the entire system. (3) Taking network dynamics into consideration, we
   further propose practical protocols that allow each peer to dynamically
   adjust its peer selection preference on download performance or traffic
   locality, in order to adapt to the current quality of peering
   connections, while guaranteeing that the desired tradeoff is still
   achieved over its entire download process. To support our models and
   protocols, we have conducted rigorous analysis, extensive simulations,
   and prototype experiments under various practical settings extracted
   from real-world traces.}},

Title = {{A novel method for removal of deep brain stimulation artifact from
   electroencephalography}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS}},

Abstract = {{Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has treatment efficacy in
   neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease and
   major depression. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a versatile
   neurophysiological tool that can be used to better understand DBS
   treatment mechanisms. DBS causes artifacts in EEG recordings that
   preclude meaningful neurophysiological activity from being quantified
   during stimulation.
   New method: In this study, we modeled the DBS stimulation artifact and
   illustrated a technique for removing the artifact using matched filters.
   The approach was validated using a synthetically generated DBS artifact
   superimposed on EEG data. Mean squared error (MSE) between the recovered
   signal and the artifact-free signal was used to quantify the
   effectiveness of the approach.
   Results: The DBS artifact was characterized by a series of narrow band
   components at the harmonic frequencies of DBS stimulation. The filtering
   approach successfully removed the DBS artifact with MSE value being less
   than 2\% of base signal power for the typical stimulation and recording
   setups. General guidelines on how to setup DBS EEG studies and configure
   the subsequent artifact removal process are described.
   Comparison with previous method: To avoid stimulus artifacts, a number
   of EEG studies with DBS subjects have resorted to turning the stimulator
   off during recording, while other studies have used low pass filters to
   remove artifacts and look at frequencies well below 50 Hz.
   Conclusions: This study establishes a method through which DBS artifact
   in EEG recordings can be reliably eliminated, thereby preserving a
   meaningful neurophysiological signal through which to better understand
   DBS treatment mechanisms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One of the striking manifestations of neuronal population activity is
   that of rhythmic oscillations in the local field potential. It is
   thought that such oscillatory patterns, including phase-amplitude
   coupling (PAC) and inter-regional synchrony, mayrepresent forms of local
   and long-range cortical computations, respectively. Although it has been
   speculated that these two oscillatory patterns are functionally related,
   and bind disparate cortical assemblies to one another at different
   timescales, there is little direct evidence to support this hypothesis.
   We have demonstrated recently that theta to high-gamma PAC and
   interlaminar phase coherence at theta frequencies can be generated in
   human cortical slices maintained in vitro. Here we show that not only do
   such oscillatory patterns exist within human temporal neocortex, but
   that the strength of one is related to the strength of the other. We
   demonstrate that at theta frequencies, metrics of temporal synchrony
   between superficial and deep cortical laminae (phase-dependent power
   correlations, and phase coherence) are correlated to the magnitude of
   intralaminar PAC between theta and high-gamma. Specifically, our results
   suggest that interlaminar communication within human temporal neocortex
   and local laminar excitability are linked to one another through a
   dependence mediated by theta oscillations. More generally, our results
   provide evidence for the hypothesis that theta oscillations may
   coordinate inter-areal excitability in the human brain.}},

   on the presence of specific surface markers. The electrochemical assay
   allows simultaneous detection of multiple different biomarkers on the

   differentiation among distinct cancer cell types. We showcase the

Abstract = {{This paper investigated the effect of carbon nanotube (CNT)
   agglomeration on the electrical conductivity of CNT-polymer composites
   by experimental characterization and theoretical modeling. The present
   experimental results show that the acid treatment of CNTs has
   significantly alleviated the CNT agglomeration in CNT-polymer composites
   and improved the electrical conductivity of the composites compared with
   CNT-polymer composites made from the same pristine CNTs. The improvement
   by the acid treatment is further studied by a multiscale CNT percolation
   network model that considers the CNT agglomeration based on experimental
   observation. Numerical results are in good agreement with the
   experimental data. The smaller the size of CNT agglomerates is in the
   experiments, the closer the measured electrical conductivity of
   CNT-polymer composites is to its theoretical limit. The current study
   verifies that (i) the CNT agglomeration is the main cause that leads to
   a lower electrical conductivity of CNT-polymer composites than their
   theoretical limit, and (ii) the current multiscale percolation network
   model can quantitatively predict the electrical conductivity of
   CNT-polymer composites with CNT agglomeration. The comprehensiveness of
   the developed modeling approach enables an evaluation of results in
   conjunction with experimental data in future works. (C) 2014 AIP

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Band structure of transition metal oxides plays a critical role in many
   applications such as photo-catalysis, photovoltaics, and
   electroluminescent devices. In this work we report findings that the
   band structure of MoO3 can be significantly altered by a distortion in
   the octahedral coordination structure. We discovered that, in addition
   to epitaxial type of structural strain, chemical force such as hydrogen
   inclusion can also cause extended lattice distortion. The lattice
   distortion in hydrogenated MoO3 led to a significant reduction of the
   energy gap, overshadowing the Moss-Burstein effect of band filling.
   Charge doping simulations revealed that filling of conduction band
   drives the lattice distortion. This suggests that any charge transfer or
   n-type electron doping could lead to lattice distortion and
   consequentially a reduction in energy gap.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of subsurface buoyant flow during thermal remediation was
   investigated using a two dimensional electro-thermal model (ETM). The
   model incorporated electrical current flow associated with electrical
   resistance heating, energy and mass transport, and density dependent
   water flow. The model was used to examine the effects of heating on
   sixteen subsurface scenarios with different applied groundwater fluxes
   and soil permeabilities. The results were analyzed in terms of the ratio
   of Rayleigh to thermal Peclet numbers (the buoyancy ratio). It was found
   that when the buoyancy number was greater than unity and the soil
   permeability greater than 10(-12) m(2), buoyant flow and contaminant
   transport were significant The effects of low permeability layers and
   electrode placement on heat and mass transport were also investigated.
   Heating under a clay layer led to flow stagnation zones resulting in the
   accumulation of contaminant mass and transport into the low permeability
   layer. The results of this study can be used to develop dimensionless
   number-based guidelines for site management during subsurface thermal
   activities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Anaerobic digestion of pulp and paper mill wastewater and sludge}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{321-349}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Pulp and paper mills generate large amounts of waste organic matter that
   may be converted to renewable energy in form of methane. The anaerobic
   treatment of mill wastewater is widely accepted however, usually only
   applied to few selected streams. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal
   rates in full-scale reactors range between 30 and 90\%, and methane
   yields are 0.30-0.40 m(3) kg(-1) COD removed. Highest COD removal rates
   are achieved with condensate streams from chemical pulping (75-90\%) and
   paper mill effluents (60-80\%).
   Numerous laboratory and pilot-scale studies have shown that, contrary to
   common perception, most other mill effluents are also to some extent
   anaerobically treatable. Even for difficult-to-digest streams such as
   bleaching effluents COD removal rates range between 15 and 90\%,
   depending on the extent of dilution prior to anaerobic treatment, and
   the applied experimental setting. Co-digestion of different streams
   containing diverse substrate can level out and diminish toxicity, and
   may lead to a more robust microbial community. Furthermore, the
   microbial population has the ability to become acclimated and adapted to
   adverse conditions. Stress situations such as toxic shock loads or
   temporary organic overloading may be tolerated by an adapted community,
   whereas they could lead to process disturbance with an un-adapted
   community. Therefore, anaerobic treatment of wastewater containing
   elevated levels of inhibitors or toxicants should be initiated by an
   acclimation/adaptation period that can last between a few weeks and
   several months. In order to gain more insight into the underlying
   processes of microbial acclimation/adaptation and co-digestion, future
   research should focus on the relationship between wastewater
   composition, reactor operation and microbial community dynamics. The
   potential for engineering and managing the microbial resource is still
   largely untapped.
   Unlike in wastewater treatment, anaerobic digestion of mill biosludge
   (waste activated sludge) and primary sludge is still in its infancy.
   Current research is mainly focused on developing efficient pretreatment
   methods that enable fast hydrolysis of complex organic matter, shorter
   sludge residence times and as a consequence, smaller sludge digesters.
   Previous experimental studies indicate that the anaerobic digestibility
   of non-pretreated biosludge from pulp and paper mills varies widely,
   with volatile solids (VS) removal rates of 21-55\% and specific methane
   yields ranging between 40 and 200 mL g(-1) VS fed. Pretreatment can
   increase the digestibility to some extent, however in almost all
   reported cases, the specific methane yield of pretreated biosludge did
   not exceed 200 mL g(-1) VS fed. Increases in specific methane yield
   mostly range between 0 and 90\% compared to non-pretreated biosludge,
   whereas larger improvements were usually achieved with more
   difficult-to-digest biosludge. Thermal treatment and microwave treatment
   are two of the more effective methods. The heat required for the
   elevated temperatures applied in both methods may be provided from
   surplus heat that is often available at pulp and paper mills. Given the
   large variability in specific methane yield of non-pretreated biosludge,
   future research should focus on the links between anaerobic
   digestibility and sludge properties. Research should also involve
   mill-derived primary sludge. Although biosludge has been the main target
   in previous studies, primary sludge often constitutes the bulk of
   mill-generated sludge, and co-digestion of a mixture between both types
   of sludge may become practical. The few laboratory studies that have
   included mill primary sludge indicate that, similar to biosludge, the
   digestibility can range widely. Long-term studies should be conducted to
   explore the potential of microbial adaptation to lignocellulosic
   material which can constitute more than half of the organic matter in
   pulp and paper mill sludge. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
