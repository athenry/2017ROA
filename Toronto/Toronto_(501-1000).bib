Abstract = {{Accommodation of DGs (distributed generations) close to loads has led to
   the concept of MG (micro-grid) for better reliability and quality of
   energy supply. MG as a clump of consumers and DGs can operate in
   stand-alone and grid-connected modes, and often needs ESS (energy
   storage system) to handle generation surplus/shortage. Variations of
   renewable sources and consumptions along with economical and
   environmental issues necessitate an efficient OM (operation management)
   of MG for short-term scheduling of energy outputs of DGs, ESS and
   exchange route to upstream macro-grid. This paper presents MOUWCA
   (multi-objective uniform water cycle algorithm) for optimal OM of MG
   considering operation cost and emission as objectives. The problem is
   casted to find 24 POFs (pareto-optimal fronts) corresponding to 24 h of
   the day (unlike previous studies giving one POF per day) to provide more
   flexibility for selecting hourly compromise solutions. Through an
   interactive process, charging/discharging of ESS is balanced over a day
   based on the desired order of hours for discharging ESS. MOUWCA is
   examined on some benchmark problems and compared with NSGA-II
   (non-dominated GA-II), MOPSO (multi-objective particle swarm
   optimization) and NCA (normal constraint algorithm) to verify its
   effectiveness. MOUWCA is then applied to a typical MG where its
   superiority is confirmed in comparison to other previously used
   algorithms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Propagation of high amplitude stress waves through a filled artificial
   joint: An experimental study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the propagation of high amplitude stress waves
   through a filled joint using a modified steel split Hopkinson pressure
   bar (SHPB) system. Quartz sand fillings with various thickness are
   placed in a steel tube and then sandwiched between the incident and
   transmitted bars to simulate the filled rock joints. Using SHPB, the
   incident stress waves with similar frequency spectrum but varying
   amplitude are induced to load the artificial filled joints. The particle
   size distributions of the fillings after tests are analyzed. It is
   discovered that as the amplitude of the incident wave increases, the
   fillings experience three stages of deformation: initial compaction,
   crushing and crushing and compaction. In the initial compaction stage
   and the crushing and compaction stage, the fillings are mainly
   compacted, and thus the transmission coefficient increases with the
   amplitude of the incident wave. However in the crushing stage, the
   transmission coefficient decreases with the increase of the amplitude of
   the incident wave. This is a result of energy consumption due to
   particle crushing. The observed dependence of the transmission
   coefficient on the wave amplitude is consistent with the particle size
   distribution of recovered fillings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In the most general case, all three components-the discrete eigenvalues,
   the discrete spectral amplitudes, and the continuous spectrum-of the
   nonlinear Fourier transform of a signal can be independently modulated.
   This paper examines information transmission using only the discrete
   eigenvalues, and presents heuristic designs for multisoliton signal sets
   with spectral efficiencies greater than 3 b/s/Hz. The first design,
   called multieigenvalue position encoding, is based on an exhaustive
   search followed by pruning of the signal set to remove high pulsewidth
   or high bandwidth outliers. The second design, called trellis encoding,
   achieves comparable efficiencies to the fist method at much lower
   complexity. These multisoliton signals do not undergo any pulse
   broadening, but are significantly limited by bandwidth expansion if the
   system length is not much smaller than the dispersion length parameter.
   This limitation suggests that modulating the eigenvalues alone cannot
   address the problem of nonlinearity in commercial fiber transmission
   systems, and that our proposed methods are only meaningful when
   dispersion is very small and dominated by nonlinearity, e.g., close to
   the zero-dispersion wavelength at 1300 nm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a fully integrated low power class-E power amplifier
   and its integration to remotely powered sensor system. The on-chip 1.2
   GHz power amplifier is implemented in 0.18 A mu m CMOS process with 0.2
   V supply. The implantable system is powered by using an inductively
   coupled remote powering link at 13.56 MHz. A passive full-wave rectifier
   converts the induced AC voltage on the implant coil into a DC voltage. A
   clean and stable 1.8 V supply voltage for the sensor and communication
   blocks is generated by a voltage regulator. On-off keying modulated
   low-power transmitter at 1.2 GHz is used for the transmission of the
   data collected from the sensors. The transmitter is composed of a LC
   tank oscillator and a fully on-chip class-E power amplifier. Compared to
   the conventional class-E power amplifiers, an additional network which
   reduces the on-chip area is used at the output of the power amplifier.
   The measurement results verify the functionality of the remotely powered
   implantable sensor system and the power amplifier. The integrated power
   amplifier provides -10 dBm output power for 50 Omega load with a drain
   efficiency of 31.5 \%. The uplink data communication with a data rate of
   600 kbps is established by using a commercial 50 Omega chip antenna at 1
   m communication distance.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells are solution-processed

   Herein, we demonstrate a new strategy to improve further the passivation
   of CQDs starting from the solution phase. A cosolvent system is employed
   to tune the solvent polarity in order to achieve the solvation of
   methylammonium iodide (MAI) and the dispersion of hydrophobic PbS CQDs
   simultaneously in a homogeneous phase, otherwise not achieved in a
   single solvent. This process enables MAI to access the CQDs to confer
   improved passivation. This, in turn, allows for efficient charge
   extraction from a thicker photoactive layer device, leading to a
   certified solar cell power conversion efficiency of 10.6\%, a new
   certified record in CQD photovoltaics.}},

Abstract = {{A 2-Step sinter/anneal treatment has been reported previously for
   forming porous CPP as biodegradable bone substitutes {[}9]. During the
   2-Step annealing treatment, the heat treatment used strongly affected
   the rate of CPP degradation in vitro. In the present study, x-ray
   diffraction and P-31 solid state nuclear magnetic resonance were used to
   determine the phases that formed using different heat treating
   processes. The effect of in vitro degradation (in PBS at 37 degrees C,
   pH 7.1 or 4.5) was also studied. During CPP preparation, beta-CPP and
   gamma-CPP were identified in powders formed from a calcium monobasic
   monohydrate precursor after an initial calcining treatment (10 h at 500
   degrees C). Melting of this CPP powder (at 1100 degrees C), quenching
   and grinding formed amorphous CPP powders. Annealing powders at 585
   degrees C (Step-1) resulted in rapid sintering to form amorphous porous
   CPP. Continued annealing to 650 degrees C resulted in crystallization to
   form a multi-phase structure of beta-CPP primarily plus lesser amounts
   of alpha-CPP, calcium ultra-phosphates and retained amorphous CPP.
   Annealing above 720 degrees C and up to 950 degrees C transformed this
   to beta-CPP phase. In vitro degradation of the 585 degrees C (Step-1
   only) and 650 degrees C Step-2 annealed multi-phase samples occurred
   significantly faster than the beta-CPP samples formed by Step-2
   annealing at or above 720 degrees C. This faster degradation was
   attributable to preferential degradation of thermodynamically less
   stable phases that formed in samples annealed at 650 degrees C (i.e.
   alpha-phase, ultra-phosphate and amorphous CPP). Degradation in lower pH
   solutions significantly increased degradation rates of the 585 and 650
   degrees C annealed samples but had no significant effect on the beta-CPP
   samples.}},

Abstract = {{Tumoral calcinosis is an uncommon condition characterized by the
   calcification of periarticular soft tissue. In uremic patients the
   disease is secondary to metabolic disturbances in predisposed patients.
   The authors report the case of a 73-year-old woman who presented with a
   new painful cervical mass while undergoing continuous ambulatory
   peritoneal dialysis for long-standing end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A
   CT scan of the neck showed a lobulated, calcified mass in the left
   paraspinal soft tissue at C2-3. This mass affected the facet joint and
   also extended into the neural foramen but did not cause any neurological
   compromise. Due to the patient's significant medical comorbidities,
   resection was deferred and the patient was followed in the clinic.
   Subsequent repeat imaging has shown a significant decrease in the size
   of the mass. In the context of ESRD, a diagnosis of uremic tumoral
   calcinosis (UTC) was made. The authors conducted a search of the PubMed
   and EMBASE databases and identified 7 previously reported cases of UTC
   of the cervical spine. They present a summary of these cases and discuss
   the etiology, diagnosis, and management of the condition.
   Although the metabolic disturbances seen in patients undergoing dialysis
   can lead to tumoral calcinosis, most reported cases involve large joints
   such as the shoulder or the hip; however, the spine can also be affected
   and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with
   uremia as it can mimic aggressive bone-forming neoplasms.}},

Abstract = {{Backscattered electron (BSE) imaging has been widely used to investigate
   the microstructure of cement-based materials, and it has shown specific

Abstract = {{This work investigates the chemical activation of a biochar sample using
   microwaves with KOH and NaOH. The activation of char samples was carried
   out in a microwave oven operating at 2.45GHz with a power input of
   1200W. The specific surface area (SSA), yield (\%), and pore size
   distribution were studied for microwave activation with KOH and NaOH. In
   microwave-assisted activation, the activation yields for NaOH and KOH
   activation were in the ranges of 40-70\% and 60-80\%, respectively. The
   NaOH-activation takes 1.5h in a furnace to fabricate an activated carbon
   with a SSA of 2600m(2)center dot g(-1). However, in microwave
   activation, a 5min activation with a power of 1200W results in activated
   carbon with a SSA of 1900m(2) g(-1). The activation yield and SSA are
   mainly controlled by impregnation ratio in microwave-assisted activation
   because KOH and NaOH were the sources of heat for the activation
   reaction. In this work, the microwave activation increased the reaction
   rate by 15 times compared to the furnace activation. Microwaves have a
   non-thermal effect on the kinetic parameters of chemical activation
   reactions. This effect was more evident in the case of NaOH microwave
   activation, probably because it is a more reactive compound compared to
   KOH.}},

   highlight that the proposed model attains a reasonable percentage of
   improvement in predicting cure data. Adding ESO to the conventional
   system decreases the reaction enthalpy and increases the activation
   energy of the system. The outcome of the study confirms the feasibility
   of the proposed material system for an infusion process. Further,
   tensile property improvement is obtained through using an infusion

Abstract = {{Air pollutants have adverse effects on the Earth's climate system. There
   is an urgent need for cost-effective devices capable of recognizing and
   detecting various ambient pollutants. An FTIR photoacoustic spectroscopy
   (FTIR-PAS) method based on a commercial FTIR spectrometer developed for
   air contamination monitoring will be presented. A resonant T-cell was
   determined to be the most appropriate resonator in view of the
   low-frequency requirement and space limitations in the sample
   compartment. Step-scan FTIR-PAS theory for regular cylinder resonator
   has been described as a reference for prediction of T-cell vibration
   principles. Both simulated amplitude and phase responses of the T-cell
   show good agreement with measurement data Carbon dioxide IR absorption
   spectra were used to demonstrate the capacity of the FTIR-PAS method to
   detect ambient pollutants. The theoretical detection limit for carbon
   dioxide was found to be 4 ppmv. A linear response to carbon dioxide
   concentration was found in the range from 2500 ppmv to 5000 ppmv. The
   results indicate that it is possible to use step-scan FTIR-PAS with a
   T-cell as a quantitative method for analysis of ambient contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents two methods for photoacoustic signal enhancement in
   biological tissues. One such method is based on the fact that
   temperature can affect the signals of the photoacoustic radar.
   Therefore, thermally assisted methods have been used for photoacoustic
   imaging contrast improvement. Another method is based on harmonic
   wavelength modulation which results in a differential PA radar signal to
   strengthen early cancer detection. Two chirped waveforms modulated
   out-of-phase between 680 nm and 800 nm can effectively suppress the
   background noise, greatly enhance the SNR and detect small variations in
   hemoglobin oxygenation levels, thereby distinguishing pre-malignant
   tumors. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the
   frequency-modulated differential measurement with sheep blood at
   different hemoglobin oxygenation (StO(2)) levels.}},

   (HANs), and adsorbable organic halides (AOX) generated by chlorination
   in a model of natural water was investigated and compared with parallel
   samples quenched by sodium sulfite and ammonium sulfate. Positive errors
   of up to 9g/L for THMs, 19g/L for HAAs, 1g/L for HANs, and 22gCl/L for
   AOX were found after adding ammonium and storing for 9 days at 4 degrees
   C, primarily due to the continued formation of chloroform,
   bromodichloromethane, dichloro- and trichloro-acetic acids, and
   dichloroacetonitrile. Hydrogen peroxide and sulfite led to smaller
   errors in the determination of THMs, HAAs, and AOX, while HANs degraded
   in the presence of sulfite. Hydrogen peroxide was the most suitable
   dechlorinating agent of these three for preserving THM, HAA, HAN, and

Abstract = {{Objective: In situ fenestration of endovascular stent grafts has been
   used as a method for branch vessel revascularization in urgent and
   emergent settings. The objective of this manuscript was to review the
   clinical and experimental evidence related to this technique.
   Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases were searched for papers
   published until December 2015 describing in situ fenestration of aortic
   stent grafts. Benchtop, animal, and human studies were included.
   Results: The literature review identified 118 articles, of which 28
   studies were selected for inclusion. These included 16 clinical papers
   (2 case series and 14 case reports) reporting in situ fenestration of 46
   aortic branch vessels in 44 patients. There were 42 retrograde and 4
   antegrade instances of in situ fenestration. The most frequent target
   vessel for in situ fenestration was the left subclavian artery (72\%),
   and the most frequent indication for stent graft implantation was a
   degenerative aortic aneurysm (43\%). Technical success was reported in
   44 of 46 attempted fenestrations (96\%). The combined rate of
   perioperative mortality, stroke, and paralysis was 7\%. In situ
   fenestration was predominantly performed with the Talent (Medtronic,
   Santa Rosa, Calif) stent graft (54\%), followed by the Zenith (Cook
   Medical, Bloomington, Ind) stent graft (37\%) and the TAG (W. L. Gore \&
   Associates, Newark, Del) stent graft (9\%). In vitro benchtop
   evaluations of in situ fenestration showed minimal change in
   fenestration size after 1 year of pulsatile fatigue testing. The use of
   energy-based fenestration techniques (radiofrequency or laser) has been
   associated with less fabric fraying than in needle-based techniques. The
   larger caliber initial fenestration created by these devices also avoids
   the need for cutting balloons, which have also been linked with
   increased fabric tears and fraying of the fibers surrounding the
   fenestration. In addition, the Zenith stent graft was shown in benchtop
   testing to be the strongest in postfenestration mechanical testing, but
   it was also the most resistant to balloon dilation.
   Conclusions: In the short to moderate term, in situ fenestration appears
   to be a reasonable and effective method to extend the proximal landing
   zone for revascularization of the left subclavian artery. However,
   longer follow-up is needed to fully assess the long-term durability of
   this procedure. Based on studies of material properties, an energy-based
   fenestration technique (radiofrequency or laser) is recommended, along
   with the avoidance of cutting balloons for dilation of the fenestration.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) is a testing method which combines
   the response from an experiment (i.e., experimental substructure) with
   that of a computer model (i.e., analytical substructure) in real-time.
   The accuracy and stability of the RTHS are prone to the propagation of
   error in the measured signals. Thus, critical developments in
   servo-hydraulic actuator control are needed to enable a wide application
   of this testing technique. In this study, a new tracking error
   compensation strategy for servo-hydraulic actuator control is developed,
   and numerically and experimentally evaluated. This compensation
   procedure is formulated based on a new set of tracking error indicators,
   namely, frequency domain-based (FDB) error indicators, which uncouple
   phase (lag and lead) and amplitude (overshoot and undershoot) errors and
   quantify them. These indicators are then incorporated into a two
   degree-of-freedom (d.f.) controller to develop closed-form equations to
   design an adaptive servo-hydraulic controller with improved tracking
   performance. The FDB indicators and the new adaptive controller are
   studied through numerical simulations in Simulink and LabVIEW and also
   verified experimentally. The proposed controller is computationally
   efficient, it can be implemented in real-time and it does not require
   any user-defined (i.e., predetermined) coefficients. As a result of its
   two d.f. formulation, this adaptive controller can be introduced to any
   closed-loop servo-controller through a digital or analog interface
   depending on the experimental setup properties. As such, it can be used
   to improve the tracking capability of any single hydraulic actuator
   system, which is essential in RTHS.}},

Abstract = {{Bio-based polymers and multifunctional polymeric composites are
   promising for the development of new environmentally sustainable
   materials and are becoming increasingly popular compared to their oil
   based counterparts. This research aims to develop new multifunctional
   bio-based polymer composites with improved thermal conductivity and
   tailored electrical properties to be used as heat management materials
   in the electronics industry. A series of parametric studies were
   conducted to clarify the science behind the hybrid composites' behavior
   and their structure-to-property relationships. Using bio-based polymers
   {[}e.g., polylactic acid (PLA)] as the matrix, heat transfer networks
   were developed and structured by embedding hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)
   and graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) in a PLA matrix. The effects of random
   uniform thermal hybrid networks of hBN-GNP on improving the effective
   thermal conductivity (k(eff)) of produced composites were studied and
   compared. Composites were characterized with respect to physical,
   thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties for practical application
   in the electronics industry. The use of high thermally conductive hybrid
   filler systems, with optimized filler content, was found to promote the
   composites' effective thermal conductivity to more than 12 times over
   neat PLA. The thermally conductive composite is expected to provide
   unique opportunities to injection mold three-dimensional, net-shape,
   lightweight, and eco-friendly microelectronic enclosures with superior
   heat dissipation performance. POLYM. COMPOS., 37:2196-2205, 2016. (c)

Title = {{Characterization of Transition to Turbulence for Blood in a Straight

Abstract = {{Blood is a complex fluid that, among other things, has been established
   to behave as a shear thinning, non-Newtonian fluid when exposed to low
   shear rates (SR). Many hemodynamic investigations use a Newtonian fluid
   to represent blood when the flow field of study has relatively high SR
   (> 200 s(-1)). Shear thinning fluids have been shown to exhibit
   differences in transition to turbulence (TT) compared to that of
   Newtonian fluids. Incorrect prediction of the transition point in a
   simulation could result in erroneous hemodynamic force predictions. The
   goal of the present study was to compare velocity profiles near TT of
   whole blood and Newtonian blood analogs in a straight rigid pipe with a
   diameter 6.35 mm under steady flow conditions. Rheology was measured for
   six samples of whole porcine blood and three samples of a Newtonian
   fluid, and the results show blood acts as a shear thinning non-Newtonian
   fluid. Measurements also revealed that blood viscosity at SR = 200 s(-1)
   is significantly larger than at SR = 1000 s(-1) (13.8\%, p < 0.001).
   Doppler ultrasound (DUS) was used to measure velocity profiles for blood
   and Newtonian samples at different flow rates to produce Reynolds
   numbers (Re) ranging from 1000 to 3300 (based on viscosity at SR = 1000
   s(-1)). Two mathematically defined methods, based on the velocity
   profile shape change and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), were used to
   detect TT. Results show similar parabolic velocity profiles for both
   blood and the Newtonian fluid for Re < 2200. However, differences were
   observed between blood and Newtonian fluid velocity profiles for larger
   Re. The Newtonian fluid had blunt-like velocity profiles starting at Re
   = 2403 +/- 8 which indicated transition. In contrast, blood did not show
   this velocity profile change until Re = 2871 +/- 104. The Newtonian
   fluid had large velocity fluctuations (root mean square (RMS) > 20\%)
   with a maximum TKE near the pipe center at Re = 2316 +/- 34 which
   indicated transition. In contrast, blood results showed the maximum TKE
   at Re = 2806 +/- 109. Overall, the critical Re was delayed by similar to
   20\% (p < 0.001) for blood compared to the Newtonian fluid. Thus, a
   Newtonian assumption for blood at flow conditions near transition could
   lead to large errors in velocity prediction for steady flow in a
   straight pipe. However, these results are specific to this pipe diameter
   and not generalizable since SR is highly dependent on pipe diameter.
   Further research is necessary to understand this relation in different
   pipe sizes, more complex geometries, and under pulsatile flow
   conditions.}},

   Assessment}},

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge in the assessment of intersegmental spinal column
   angles during trunk motion is the inherent error in recording the
   movement of bony anatomical landmarks caused by soft tissue artifacts
   (STAs). This study aims to perform an uncertainty analysis and estimate
   the typical errors induced by STA into the intersegmental angles of a
   multisegment spinal column model during trunk bending in different
   directions by modeling the relative displacement between skin-mounted
   markers and actual bony landmarks during trunk bending. First, we
   modeled the maximum displacement of markers relative to the bony
   landmarks with a multivariate Gaussian distribution. In order to
   estimate the distribution parameters, we measured these relative
   displacements on five subjects at maximum trunk bending posture. Then,
   in order to model the error depending on trunk bending angle, we assumed
   that the error grows linearly as a function of the bending angle.
   Second, we applied our error model to the trunk motion measurement of 11
   subjects to estimate the corrected trajectories of the bony landmarks
   and investigate the errors induced into the intersegmental angles of a
   multisegment spinal column model. For this purpose, the trunk was
   modeled as a seven-segment rigid-body system described using 23
   reflective markers placed on various bony landmarks of the spinal
   column. Eleven seated subjects performed trunk bending in five
   directions and the three-dimensional (3D) intersegmental angles during
   trunk bending were calculated before and after error correction. While
   STA minimally affected the intersegmental angles in the sagittal plane
   (<16\%), it considerably corrupted the intersegmental angles in the
   coronal (error ranged from 59\% to 551\%) and transverse (up to 161\%)
   planes. Therefore, we recommend using the proposed error suppression
   technique for STA-induced error compensation as a tool to achieve more
   accurate spinal column kinematics measurements. Particularly, for
   intersegmental rotations in the coronal and transverse planes that have
   small range and are highly sensitive to measurement errors, the proposed
   technique makes the measurement more appropriate for use in clinical
   decision-making processes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the pulse-width pulse-frequency modulation based
   trajectory planning for orbital rendezvous and proximity maneuvering
   near a non-cooperative spacecraft in an elliptical orbit. The problem is
   formulated by converting the continuous control input, output from the
   state dependent model predictive control, into a sequence of pulses of
   constant magnitude by controlling firing frequency and duration of
   constant-magnitude thrusters. The state dependent model predictive
   control is derived by minimizing the control error of states and control
   roughness of control input for a safe, smooth and fuel efficient
   approaching trajectory. The resulting nonlinear programming problem is
   converted into a series of quadratic programming problem and solved by
   numerical iteration using the receding horizon strategy. The numerical
   results show that the proposed state dependent model predictive control
   with the pulse width pulse-frequency modulation is able to effectively
   generate optimized trajectories using equivalent control pulses for the
   proximity maneuvering with less energy consumption. (C) 2016 COSPAR.

Abstract = {{In this study, we estimated the transportation-related emissions of
   nitrogen oxides (NOx) at an individual level for a sample of the
   Montreal population. Using linear regression, we quantified the
   associations between NOx emissions and selected individual attributes.
   We then investigated the relationship between individual emissions of
   NOx and exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations derived from a
   land-use regression model. Factor analysis and clustering of land-uses
   were used to test the relationships between emissions and exposures in
   different Montreal areas. We observed that the emissions generated per
   individual are positively associated with vehicle ownership, gender, and
   employment status. We also noted that individuals who live in the
   suburbs or in peripheral areas generate higher emissions of NOx but are
   exposed to lower NO2 concentrations at home and throughout their daily
   activities. Finally, we observed that for most individuals, NO2
   exposures based on daily activity locations were often slightly more
   elevated than NO2 concentrations at the home location. We estimated that
   between 20\% and 45\% of individuals experience a daily exposure that is
   largely different from the concentration at their home location. Our
   findings are relevant to the evaluation of equity in the generation of
   transport emissions and exposure to traffic-related air pollution. We
   also shed light on the effect of accounting for daily activities when
   estimating air pollution exposure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{MSYSTEMS}},

Abstract = {{Many pathogenic bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae use type III
   secretion systems to inject virulence proteins, termed ``effectors,{''}
   into the host cell cytosol. Although host-cellular activities of several
   effectors have been demonstrated, the function and host-targeted
   pathways of most of the effectors identified to date are largely
   undetermined. To gain insight into host proteins targeted by bacterial
   effectors, we performed coaffinity purification of host proteins from
   cell lysates using recombinant effectors from the Enterobacteriaceae
   intracellular pathogens Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and
   Citrobacter rodentium. We identified 54 high-confidence host interactors
   for the Salmonella effectors GogA, GtgA, GtgE, SpvC, SrfH, SseL, SspH1,
   and SssB collectively and 21 interactors for the Citrobacter effectors
   EspT, NleA, NleG1, and NleK. We biochemically validated the interaction
   between the SrfH Salmonella protein and the extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) host protein kinase, which revealed a
   role for this effector in regulating phosphorylation levels of this
   enzyme, which plays a central role in signal transduction.
   IMPORTANCE During infection, pathogenic bacteria face an adverse
   environment of factors driven by both cellular and humoral defense
   mechanisms. To help evade the immune response and ultimately proliferate
   inside the host, many bacteria evolved specialized secretion systems to
   deliver effector proteins directly into host cells. Translocated
   effector proteins function to subvert host defense mechanisms. Numerous
   pathogenic bacteria use a specialized secretion system called type III
   secretion to deliver effectors into the host cell cytosol. Here, we
   identified 75 new host targets of Salmonella and Citrobacter effectors,
   which will help elucidate their mechanisms of action.}},

Title = {{Fracture load prediction of BGA solder joints: Cohesive zone modeling
   and experimental verification}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{30-44}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Ball grid array (BGA) test vehicles, assembled in a standard surface
   mount technology (SMT) line, were used to prepare fracture specimens in
   seven configurations in order to measure solder ball fracture loads at
   two different strain rate regimes for a range of loading mode ratios.
   The measured strengths of the specimens were compared with the
   predictions of a cohesive zone model (CZM). The phase angle of the
   specimens under bending was found to be close to mode I and hence the
   fracture criterion was governed predominantly by mode I parameters. The
   mode I peak stress and fracture energy of the CZM were obtained in two
   separate ways: (i) The fracture energy was obtained from separate
   copper-solder copper double cantilever beam (DCB) tests, while the peak
   stress was obtained from one of the BGA specimen configurations. (ii)
   One BGA specimen configuration was used to obtain the mode I fracture
   energy, and the peak stress was assumed to be given by the yield stress.
   In both cases (i) and (ii), the rising slopes of the modes I and II
   traction-separation laws corresponded to the compliance of the system.
   The accuracy and generality of these CZ models was then assessed by
   using them to predict the fracture loads of the remaining BGA specimens
   that had different geometries and hence fracture strengths. The fracture
   loads predicted using either model were in reasonable agreement with the
   measured forces at a given strain rate. Therefore, once the CZM
   parameters have been defined for a given solder system using one BGA
   specimen, the CZM could predict the fracture of BGA solder joints with
   different geometries and strengths. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The common carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) is widely
   accepted and used as an indicator of atherosclerosis. Recent studies,
   however, have found that the irregularity of the IMT along the carotid
   artery wall has a stronger correlation with atherosclerosis than the IMT
   itself. We set out to validate IMT variability (IMTV), a parameter
   defined to assess IMT irregularities along the wall. In particular, we
   analyzed whether or not manual segmentations of the lumen-intima and
   media-adventitia can be considered reliable in calculation of the IMTV
   parameter. To do this, we used a total of 60 simulated ultrasound images
   with a priori IMT and IMTV values. The images, simulated using the Fast
   And Mechanistic Ultrasound Simulation software, presented five different
   morphologies, four nominal IMT values and three different levels of
   variability along the carotid artery wall (no variability, small
   variability and large variability). Three experts traced the
   lumen-intima (LI) and media-adventitia (MA) profiles, and two automated
   algorithms were employed to obtain the LI and MA profiles. One expert
   also re-traced the LI and MA profiles to test intra-reader variability.
   The average IMTV measurements of the profiles used to simulate the
   longitudinal B-mode images were 0.002 +/- 0.002, 0.149 +/- 0.035 and
   0.286 +/- 0.068 mm for the cases of no variability, small variability
   and large variability, respectively. The IMTV measurements of one of the
   automated algorithms were statistically similar (p > 0.05, Wilcoxon
   signed rank) when considering small and large variability, but
   non-significant when considering no variability (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon
   signed rank). The second automated algorithm resulted in statistically
   similar values in the small variability case. Two readers' manual
   tracings, however, produced IMTV measurements with a statistically
   significant difference considering all three variability levels, whereas
   the third reader found a statistically significant difference in both
   the no variability and large variability cases. Moreover, the error
   range between the reader and automatic IMTV values was approximately
   0.15 mm, which is on the same order of small IMTV values, indicating
   that manual and automatic IMTV readings should be not used
   interchangeably in clinical practice. On the basis of our findings, we
   conclude that expert manual tracings should not be considered reliable
   in IMTV measurement and, therefore, should not be trusted as ground
   truth. On the other hand, our automated algorithm was found to be more
   reliable, indicating how automated techniques could therefore foster
   analysis of the carotid artery intima-media thickness irregularity.

Pages = {{78-85}},

Abstract = {{Acceleration on the carbonation of reactive MgO cement is essential for
   its widespread application. There is currently a dearth of published
   reports on the effect and sensitivity of using pressurized CO2 on the
   properties and performance of reactive MgO cement blends. This study is
   motivated by improving the understanding of the effectiveness of
   accelerating the carbonation process. Pressurized CO2 (up to 1.0 MPa)
   was employed to enhance the carbonation of mortar blends consisting of
   Portland cement, fly ash and reactive MgO. Results revealed that the
   carbonation front and mechanical properties of the mortars were
   developed quickly owing to the effectively accelerated carbonation under
   pressurized CO2. In comparison to the 0.1 MPa pressure, the relatively
   higher pressure (0.55 and 1.0 MPa) were much more effective in achieving
   stronger mechanical properties within 1 day. However, an increasing
   curing duration from 1d to 14d under the lower CO2 pressure of 0.1 MPa
   caused a 1.8-2.9 times increase in compressive strength. This indicates
   that either increases in pressure or curing duration under pressurized
   CO2 enhances the carbonation and mechanical properties of the mortars.

   in the field of engineering in recent years. A lot of research has been
   carried out to investigate the behaviour of CFDST members under a
   variety of loading conditions. This paper presents an experimental
   investigation on ultra-high performance concrete infilled double-skin
   tube columns subjected to close-in blast loading. Two types of CFDST
   columns were investigated in the experiments - one with both inner and
   outer tubes circular and the other one with both square. The main test
   parameters included the explosive charge weight and the magnitude of
   axial load. After the blast tests, there was no visible buckling nor
   ruptures found on the steel tubes and only minor cracks, of no more than
   1mm width, were observed in the core concrete when the outer steel tube
   was removed. Based on the findings of the experiments, it is evident
   that CFDST column has excellent blast resistance. This feature has the
   potential to be used in high-value structures which may be the targets
   of terrorist attacks, such as embassies, government buildings and
   critical infrastructures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A modified continuum model of fluid-conveying nanobeams is presented by
   incorporating the surface elasticity in this paper. The classical beam
   theory is adopted to model the bulk, while Curtin and Murdoch's theory
   of surface elasticity is applied to model the surfaces. Based on the
   Timoshenko beam theory, the equation of motion for transverse vibrations
   of fluid-conveying nanobeams is formulated and the differential
   quadrature method is applied to solve this complex problem. Beams made
   from aluminum (Al) and silicon (Si) are chosen as examples. The surface
   effects on the vibrational characteristics are discussed for simply
   supported and clamped nanobeams. The results show that, due to the
   different surface elastic properties between Al and Si, the surface
   energies will increase the frequency and critical flow velocity of Al
   nanobeams but decrease those of Si beams. In addition, the frequency and
   critical flow velocity of Al and Si nanobeams obtained from the
   Timoshenko beam model are generally smaller than those from the Euler
   Bernoulli beam model due to the effects of shear deformation and rotary
   inertia. However, when the cross-sectional size of the Si nanobeams is
   relatively small, their Timoshenko beam results are found to be close to
   the Euler Bernoulli beam results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) can effectively treat left
   ventricle (LV) driven Heart Failure (HF). However, 30\% of the CRT
   recipients do not experience symptomatic benefit. Recent studies show
   that the CRT response rate can reach 95\% when the LV pacing lead is
   placed at an optimal site at a region of maximal LV dyssynchrony and
   away from myocardial scars. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) can
   identify the optimal site in three dimensions (3D). 3D CMR data can be
   registered to clinical standard x-ray fluoroscopy to achieve an optimal
   pacing of the LV. We have developed a 3D CMR to 2D x-ray image
   registration method for CRT procedures. We have employed the LV pacing
   lead on x-ray images and coronary sinus on MR data as landmarks. The
   registration method makes use of a guidewire simulation algorithm, edge
   based image registration technique and x-ray C-arm tracking to register
   the coronary sinus and pacing lead landmarks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Monzonitic granite is a low -permeability rock. Monzonitic granite
   formations are ideal for underground storage of oil due to their low
   permeability and high mechanical strength. In this study, a series of
   coupled hydromechanical triaxial tests are carried out using monzonitic
   granite specimens. The influence of confining and fluid pressures on
   stress, strain, and permeability is investigated. Failure
   characteristics under different confining and fluid pressures are
   discussed based on the analysis of macro fracture planes and micro
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The test results show that the
   change of permeability with stress and strain reflects the deformation
   stages of compaction, compression, crack propagation, coalesce, and
   failure of cracks. Due to the low porosity, the change of permeability
   is small in the initial phases of compaction and compression, whereas
   there is a significant increase in permeability when new cracks start to
   develop and coalesce. Confining pressures have a significant impact on
   the strength and permeability, particularly the crack damage stress of
   the rock. Compared with confining pressure, the effect of fluid pressure
   on rock strength and crack damage stress is small. For the monzonitic
   granite specimens tested, changing the confining pressure results in
   different failure modes, whereas the fluid pressure has a relatively
   small effect on the failure modes.}},

   Coordination Defects}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 22}},
Abstract = {{Corneal nano-nipple structures consisting of hexagonally arranged
   protrusions with diameters around 200 nm have long been known for their
   antireflection capability and have served as biological blueprint for
   solar cell, optical lens and other surface designs. However, little is
   known about the global arrangement of these nipples on the ommatidial
   surface and their growth during the eye development. This study provides
   new insights based on the analysis of nano-nipple arrangements on the
   mesoscale across entire ommatidia, which has never been done before. The
   most important feature in the nipple structures are topological 5- and
   7-fold coordination defects, which align to form dislocations and
   interconnected networks of grain boundaries that divide the ommatidia
   into crystalline domains in different orientations. Furthermore, the
   domain size distribution might be log-normal, and the domains
   demonstrate no preference in crystal orientation. Both observations
   suggest that the nipple growth process may be similar to the nucleation
   and growth mechanisms during the formation of other crystal structures.
   Our results are also consistent with the most recently proposed
   Turing-type reaction-diffusion process. In fact, we were able to produce
   the key structural characteristics of the nipple arrangements using
   Turing analysis from the nucleation to the final structure development.}},

Abstract = {{Strategic enrichment of microcosms derived from wood foragers can
   facilitate the discovery of key microbes that produce enzymes for the
   bioconversion of plant fiber (i.e., lignocellulose) into valuable
   chemicals and energy. In this study, lignocellulose-degrading
   microorganisms from the digestive systems of Canadian beaver (Castor
   canadensis) and North American moose (Alces arnericanus) were enriched
   under methanogenic conditions for over 3 years using various
   wood-derived substrates, including (i) cellulose (C), (ii) cellulose +
   lignosulphonate (CL), (iii) cellulose + tannic acid (CT), and (iv)
   poplar hydrolysate (PH). Substantial improvement in the conversion of
   amended organic substrates into biogas was observed in both beaver
   dropping and moose rumen enrichment cultures over the enrichment phases
   (up to 0.36-0.68 ml biogas/mg COD added), except for enrichments amended
   with tannic acid where conversion was approximately 0.15 ml biogas/mg
   COD added. Multiplex-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed
   systematic shifts in the population of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes,
   Chiorobi, Spirochaetes, Chlorotlexi, and Elusimicrobia in response to
   the enrichment. These shifts were predominantly substrate driven, not
   inoculum driven, as revealed by both UPGMA clustering pattern and OTU
   distribution. Additionally, the relative abundance of multiple OTUs from
   poorly defined taxonomic lineages increased from less than 1\% to
   25-50\% in microcosms amended with lignocellulosic substrates, including
   OTUs from classes SJA-28, Endomicrobia, orders Bacteroidales, OPB54, and
   family Lachnospiraceae. This study provides the first direct comparison
   of shifts in microbial communities that occurred in different
   environmental samples in response to multiple relevant lignocellulosic
   carbon sources, and demonstrates the potential of enrichment to increase
   the abundance of key lignocellulolytic microorganisms and encoded
   activities.}},

Abstract = {{A scanning electron microscope (SEM) provides real-time imaging with
   nanometer resolution and a large scanning area, which enables the
   development and integration of robotic nanomanipulation systems inside a
   vacuum chamber to realize simultaneous imaging and direct interactions
   with nanoscaled samples. Emerging techniques for nanorobotic
   manipulation during SEM imaging enable the characterization of
   nanomaterials and nanostructures and the prototyping/assembly of
   nanodevices. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent
   advances in nanorobotic manipulation, including the development of
   nanomanipulation platforms, tools, changeable toolboxes, sensing units,
   control strategies, electron beam-induced deposition approaches,
   automation techniques, and nanomanipulation-enabled applications and
   discoveries. The limitations of the existing technologies and prospects

Abstract = {{Monitoring the quality of frying oil is important for the health of
   consumers. This paper reports a microfluidic technique for rapidly
   quantifying the degradation of frying oil. The microfluidic device
   generates monodispersed water-in-oil droplets and exploits viscosity and
   interfacial tension changes of frying oil samples over their
   frying/degradation process. The measured parameters were correlated to
   the total polar material percentage that is widely used in the food
   industry. The results reveal that the steady-state length of droplets
   can be used for unambiguously assessing frying oil quality degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: High-content screening (HCS) technologies have enabled large
   scale imaging experiments for studying cell biology and for drug
   screening. These systems produce hundreds of thousands ofmicroscopy
   images per day and their utility depends on automated image analysis.
   Recently, deep learning approaches that learn feature representations
   directly from pixel intensity values have dominated object recognition
   challenges. These tasks typically have a single centered object per
   image and existing models are not directly applicable to microscopy
   datasets. Herewe develop an approach that combines deep convolutional
   neural networks (CNNs) with multiple instance learning (MIL) in order to
   classify and segment microscopy images using only whole image level
   annotations.
   Results: We introduce a new neural network architecture that uses MIL to
   simultaneously classify and segment microscopy images with populations
   of cells. We base our approach on the similarity between the aggregation
   function used in MIL and pooling layers used in CNNs. To facilitate
   aggregating across large numbers of instances in CNN feature maps we
   present the Noisy-AND pooling function, a new MIL operator that is
   robust to outliers. Combining CNNs with MIL enables training CNNs using
   whole microscopy images with image level labels. We show that training
   end-to-end MIL CNNs outperforms several previous methods on both
   mammalian and yeast datasets without requiring any segmentation steps.}},

Abstract = {{TiO2 has excellent electrochemical properties but limited solar
   photocatalytic performance in light of its large bandgap. One important
   class of visible-wavelength sensitizers of TiO2 is based on ZnFe2O4,
   which has shown fully a doubling in performance relative to pure TiO2.
   Prior efforts on this important front have relied on presynthesized
   nanoparticles of ZnFe2O4 adsorbed on a TiO2 support; however, these have
   not yet achieved the full potential of this system since they do not
   provide a consistently maximized area of the charge-separating
   heterointerface per volume of sensitizing absorber. A novel atomic layer
   deposition (ALD)-enhanced synthesis of sensitizing ZnFe2O4 leaves grown
   on the trunks of TiO2 trees is reported. These new materials exhibit
   fully a threefold enhancement in photoelectrochemical performance in
   water splitting compared to pristine TiO2 under visible illumination.
   The new materials synthesis strategy relies first on the selective
   growth of FeOOH nanosheets, 2D structures that shoot off from the sides
   of the TiO2 trees; these templates are then converted to ZnFe2O4 with
   the aid of a novel ALD step, a strategy that preserves morphology while
   adding the Zn cation to achieve enhanced optical absorption and optimize
   the heterointerface band alignment.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical nanoindentation technique has been widely used to study the
   microstructural mechanical properties of various types of hardened
   cement pastes, which has significantly improved the fundamental
   understanding on the mechanical performances of concrete and other
   cementitious composites. However, it was noted that the contradictory
   results from statistical nanoindentation technique appeared in the
   literatures and the critical aspects in the application of this
   technique to hardened cement pastes were recognized. This work is
   designed to provide an insight into the critical aspects, including the
   influences of material microstructure and statistical analysis method.
   Firstly, the microstructure of hardened cement pastes was investigated
   by SEM-BSE/EDX analysis. Then, the influence of heterogeneous material
   microstructure on the nanoindentation results was investigated through a
   micromechanical method. After that, two general methods of parameter
   estimation were applied to analyze the nanoindentation data and global
   optimal results were sought by multiple runs with the random starting
   values. This work revealed that the indented `Calcium-Silicate-Hydrate'
   microstructure is a fact of the composites and the analysis result
   largely depends on the selected statistical analysis method. The
   influences of material microstructure and statistical analysis method
   may cause unreliable result. In this paper, a method for the
   verification of the result from statistical nanoindentation technique in
   hardened cement pastes was proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{359-368}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper aims to evaluate the influence of Limestone filler (LF)
   content and fineness on the hydration kinetics and strength of steam
   cured cement mortars and pastes. Experimental variables were cement
   fineness, LF content, LF fineness and steam curing duration. Mortar and
   paste specimens were steam cured at 55 degrees C for 12 and 16 h.
   Hydration kinetics were evaluated using heat of hydration and thermal
   analysis. The heat of hydration was measured using Isothermal
   Calorimetry. Calcium hydroxide (Ca (OH)(2)) content, calcium carbonate
   (CaCO3) content and degree of hydration were measured using Thermal
   Gravimetric Analysis and Differential Thermal Analysis. Compressive
   strength of mortars was evaluated at 12 h, 16 h, 3 days, 7 days and 28
   days. The results showed increase in the heat of hydration, Ca(OH)(2)
   content and early age strength (at 12 and 16 h) with the addition of LF.
   The results also revealed that the influence of LF on hydration kinetics
   and strength was influenced by the finenesses of the LF and the cement.
   In general, mix designs containing LF showed improved early age
   hydration and strength in mix designs made with higher cement fineness.
   Increasing LF fineness or cement fineness can reduce the negative impact
   of cement dilution by LF addition on the mechanical properties of
   mortars. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WEAR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{356-357}},
Pages = {{30-39}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents a modification to the existing surface evolution
   models for predicting channel profiles machined using AIM in brittle and
   ductile materials. Considering the variation in both the local nozzle
   standoff distance and the divergence angle of each particle trajectory
   in the jet plume enabled the modified model to address all the
   shortcomings of existing models for the prediction of channel profiles
   machined on inclined and highly-curved surfaces. It was observed that
   the jet footprint differed on the flat and curved surfaces, becoming
   wider as the rod diameter decreased. Computational fluid dynamics
   modeling showed that this was not due solely to the expected conical
   divergence in the jet, but also due to differences in the erosion caused
   by secondary impacts of rebounding particles. The model predictions
   compared well with measured surface profiles machined in flat glass and
   PMMA targets inclined at 30, and with axial grooves made in 3 and 5 mm
   diameter glass rods and a 4.72 mm PMMA rod (maximum error of
   approximately 8\%). With an appropriate characterization of the
   footprint, the model is in theory applicable to virtually any target
   geometry and incident angle. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biomimetic scaffolds are desirable for 3D cell culture, yet optically
   transparent, macroporous, polysaccharide hydrogels have been limited. By
   incorporating soluble mono- and disaccharide additives during
   cryogelation, we synthesized biomimetic scaffolds and gained insight
   into the mechanism of their formation. The mono/disaccharide additives
   affect the size of ice crystal porogens and interact with polysaccharide
   polymers, altering cryogel pore size and mechanical properties.
   Importantly, gel transparency is maintained following removal of
   additives, enabling their use as biomimetic extracellular matrices. We
   demonstrate both optical transparency with 3D spatial control of
   immobilized bioactive growth factors using multiphoton patterning and
   cellular response to immobilized ligands.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate finite element (FE) modeling of complex skeletal anatomy
   requires high resolution in both meshing and the heterogeneous mapping
   of material properties onto the generated mesh. This study introduces
   Node-based elastic Modulus Assignment with Partial-volume correction
   (NMAP) as a new approach for FE material property assignment to thin
   bone structures. The NMAP approach incorporates point spread function
   based deblurring of CT images, partial-volume correction of CT image
   voxel intensities and anisotropic interpolation and mapping of CT
   intensity assignment to FE mesh nodes. The NMAP procedure combined with
   a derived craniomaxillo-facial skeleton (CMFS) specific density
   isotropic elastic modulus relationship was applied to produce
   specimen-specific FE models of 6 cadaveric heads. The NMAP procedure
   successfully generated models of the complex thin bone structures with
   surface elastic moduli reflective of cortical bone material properties.
   The specimen-specific CMFS FE models were able to accurately predict
   experimental strains measured under in vitro temporalis and masseter
   muscle loading (r=0.93, slope = 1.01, n=5). The strength of this
   correlation represents a robust validation for CMFS FE modeling that can
   be used to better understand load transfer in this complex
   musculoskeletal system. The developed methodology offers a systematic
   process-flow able to address the complexity of the CMFS that can be
   further applied to create high-fidelity models of any musculoskeletal
   anatomy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Restoration of Upper Limb Function in an Individual with Cervical
   Spondylotic Myelopathy using Functional Electrical Stimulation Therapy:
   A Case Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{Non-traumatic spinal cord pathology is responsible for 25-52\% of all
   spinal cord lesions. Studies have revealed that spinal stenosis accounts
   for 16-21\% of spinal cord injury (SCI) admissions. Impaired grips as
   well as slow unskilled hand and finger movements are the most common
   complaints in patients with spinal cord disorders, such as myelopathy
   secondary to cervical spondylosis. In the past, our team carried out
   couple of successful clinical trials, including two randomized control
   trials, showing that functional electrical stimulation therapy (FEST)
   can restore voluntary reaching and/or grasping function, in people with
   stroke and traumatic SCI. Motivated by this success, we decided to
   examine changes in the upper limb function following FEST in a patient
   who suffered loss of hand function due to myelopathy secondary to
   cervical spondylosis. The participant was a 61-year-old male who had
   C3-C7 posterior laminectomy and instrumented fusion for cervical
   myelopathy. The participant presented with progressive right hand
   weakness that resulted in his inability to voluntarily open and close
   the hand and to manipulate objects unilaterally with his right hand. The
   participant was enrolled in the study similar to 22 months following
   initial surgical intervention. Participant was assessed using Toronto
   Rehabilitation Institute's Hand Function Test (TRI-HFT), Action Research
   Arm Test (ARAT), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and Spinal Cord
   Independence Measure (SCIM). The pre-post differences in scores on all
   measures clearly demonstrated improvement in voluntary hand function
   following 15 1-h FEST sessions. The changes observed were meaningful and
   have resulted in substantial improvement in performance of activities of
   daily living. These results provide preliminary evidence that FEST has a
   potential to improve upper limb function in patients with non-traumatic
   SCI, such as myelopathy secondary to cervical spondylosis.}},

Volume = {{371}},
Pages = {{344-369}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a fully vibro-acoustic model for sound transmission
   across a multi-pane aircraft window is developed. The proposed model is
   efficiently applied for a set of window models to perform extensive
   theoretical parametric studies. The studied window configurations
   generally simulate the passenger window designs of modern aircraft
   classes which have an exterior multi-Plexiglas pane, an interior single
   acrylic glass pane and a dimmable glass ({''}smart{''} glass), all
   separated by thin air cavities. The sound transmission loss (STL)
   characteristics of three different models, triple-, quadruple- and
   quintuple-paned windows identical in size and surface density, are
   analyzed for improving the acoustic insulation performances. Typical
   results describing the influence of several system parameters, such as
   the thicknesses, number and spacing of the window panes, on the
   transmission loss are then investigated. In addition, a comparison study
   is carried out to evaluate the acoustic reduction capability of each
   window model. The STL results show that the higher frequencies sound
   transmission loss performance can be improved by increasing the number
   of window panels, however, the low frequency performance is decreased,
   particularly at the mass-spring resonances. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Rapid industrialization of organic light-emitting devices for flat-panel
   displays and solid-state lighting makes a deep understanding of device
   physics more desirable than ever. Developing reliable experimental
   techniques to measure fundamental physical properties such as exciton
   diffusion lengths is a vital part of developing device physics. In this
   paper, we present a study of exciton diffusion and long-range energy
   transfer in working organic light-emitting devices, and a study of the
   interplay between these two tangled processes through both experimental
   probes and simulations. With the inclusion of multiple factors including
   long-range energy transfer, exciton boundary conditions, and the finite
   width of the exciton generation zone, we quantify exciton migration
   based on emission characteristics from rubrene sensing layers placed in
   working organic light-emitting devices. This comprehensive analysis is
   found to be essential to accurately measuring exciton diffusion length,
   and in the present case the measured singlet-exciton diffusion length in
   the archetype material 4'-bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl is 4.3 +/- 0.3 nm
   with a corresponding diffusivity of (2.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(-4) cm(2)/s.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade, there has been an increase in the application and
   investigation of in-home monitoring systems to support older adults with
   dementia and their caregivers. The current study focused on a monitoring
   system that included the use of motion sensors and Internet connections
   with one-way communication capabilities. Only a limited number of
   studies have explored and compared older adults' and caregivers'
   perspectives on such monitoring systems. The purpose of the current
   study was to explore older adults' and caregivers' perspectives on
   in-home monitoring systems using photo elicitation techniques. Three
   overarching themes emerged: (a) feeling cared for (which included two
   sub-themes), (b) feeling cared about (which included three sub-themes),
   and (c) suggestions for change (which included four sub-themes). These
   results revealed the duality of care when using in-home monitoring.
   Clinical and other future implications are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: It is expected that 40\% to 60\% of initial alveolar bone
   volume will be lost up to 6months after tooth extraction. OsteoScafTM
   (TRT, Toronto, ON, Canada) (poly (DL-lactide-co-glycololide/calcium
   phosphate {[}PLGA/CaP] scaffold) is a novel bone substitute material and
   represents a promising alternative for maintaining alveolar bone
   integrity in this clinical scenario.
   Purpose: Here it was hypothesized that OsteoScaf would reduce alveolar
   bone lost after tooth extraction in patient, acting as a clot-retention
   device.
   Material and Methods: A total of 10 patients (32 sockets) were included
   in the study, of which 16 sockets were grafted with OsteoScaf and 16
   were used as control (coagulum alone). Cone beam computed tomography
   (CBCT) was performed both immediately following extraction and also at
   120 days postoperatively, at which time biopsy samples were also
   harvested for histological analyses.
   Results: Quantitative analysis of CBCT showed less bone resorption in
   the OsteoScaf groups, being 10.5\% to 14.4\% less bone lost in the
   center of the socket, 15.4\% in the buccal region, and 12.6\% in the
   palatal. Qualitative histological analysis showed new bone tissue in
   direct apposition to the scaffold - demonstrating its osteoconductive
   nature.
   Conclusion: OsteoScaf diminished the expected bone lost during the
   postextraction remodeling of the alveolar bone ridge at 120 days
   postextraction.}},

Abstract = {{Linear programming (LP) decoding for low-density parity-check codes was
   introduced by Feldman et al. and has been shown to have theoretical
   guarantees in several regimes. Furthermore, it has been reported in the
   literature-via simulation and via instanton analysis-that LP decoding
   displays better error rate performance at high signal-to-noise ratios
   (SNR) than does belief propagation (BP) decoding. However, at low SNRs,
   LP decoding is observed to have worse performance than BP. In this
   paper, we seek to improve LP decoding at low SNRs while maintaining LP
   decoding's high SNR performance. Our main contribution is a new class of
   decoders obtained by applying the alternating direction method of
   multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to a set of non-convex optimization
   problems. These non-convex problems are constructed by adding a penalty
   term to the objective of LP decoding. The goal of the penalty is to make
   pseudocodewords, which are non-integer vertices of the LP relaxation,
   more costly. We name this class of decoders-ADMM penalized decoders. For
   low and moderate SNRs, we simulate ADMM penalized decoding with l(1) and
   l(2) penalties. We find that these decoders can outperform both BP and
   LP decoding. For high SNRs, where it is difficult to obtain data via
   simulation, we use an instanton analysis and find that, asymptotically,
   ADMM penalized decoding performs better than BP but not as well as LP.
   Unfortunately, since ADMM penalized decoding is not a convex program, we
   have not been successful in developing theoretical guarantees. However,
   the non-convex program can be approximated using a sequence of linear
   programs; an approach that yields a reweighted LP decoder. We show that
   a two-round reweighted LP decoder has an improved theoretical recovery
   threshold when compared with LP decoding. In addition, we find via
   simulation that reweighted LP decoding significantly attains lower error
   rates than LP decoding at low SNRs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop efficient decoders for non-binary low-density
   parity-check codes using the alternating direction method of multipliers
   (ADMM). We apply ADMM to two decoding problems. The first problem is
   linear programming (LP) decoding. In order to develop an efficient
   algorithm, we focus on non-binary codes in fields of characteristic two.
   This allows us to transform each constraint in F-2m to a set of
   constraints in F-2 that has a factor graph representation. Applying ADMM
   to the LP decoding problem results in two types of non-trivial
   sub-routines. The first type requires us to solve an unconstrained
   quadratic program. We solve this problem efficiently by leveraging new
   results obtained from studying the above factor graphs. The second type
   requires Euclidean projections onto polytopes that are studied in the
   literature. Such projections can be solved efficiently using
   off-the-shelf techniques, which scale linearly in the dimension of the
   vector to project. ADMM LP decoding scales linearly with block length,
   linearly with check degree, and quadratically with field size. The
   second problem we consider is a penalized LP decoding problem. This
   problem is obtained by incorporating a penalty term into the LP decoding
   objective. The purpose of the penalty term is to make non-integer
   solutions (pseudocodewords) more expensive and hence to improve decoding
   performance. The ADMM algorithm for the penalized LP problem requires
   Euclidean projection onto a polytope formed by embedding the constraints
   specified by the non-binary single parity-check code, which can be
   solved by applying the ADMM technique to the resulting quadratic
   program. Empirically, this decoder achieves a much reduced error rate
   than LP decoding at low signal-to-noise ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by error correction coding in multimedia applications, we
   study the problem of broadcasting a single common source to multiple
   receivers over heterogeneous erasure channels. Each receiver is required
   to partially reconstruct the source sequence by decoding a certain
   fraction of the source symbols. We propose a coding scheme that requires
   only off-the-shelf erasure codes and can be easily adapted as users join
   and leave the network. Our scheme involves splitting the source sequence
   into multiple segments and applying a systematic erasure code to each
   such segment. We formulate the problem of minimizing the transmission
   latency at the server as a linear programming problem and explicitly
   characterize an optimal choice for the code rates and segment sizes.
   Through numerical comparisons, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme
   outperforms both separation-based coding schemes and degree-optimized
   rateless codes and performs close to a natural outer (lower) bound in
   certain cases. We further study individual user decoding delays for
   various orderings of segments in our scheme. We provide closed-form
   expressions for each individual user's excess latency when parity checks
   are successively transmitted in both increasing order and decreasing
   order of their segment's coded rate and also qualitatively discuss the
   merits of each order.}},

Abstract = {{The use of cooperative multirobot teams in urban search and rescue
   (USAR) environments is a challenging yet promising research area. For
   multirobot teams working in USAR missions, the objective is to have the
   rescue robots work effectively together to coordinate task allocation
   and task execution between different team members in order to minimize
   the overall exploration time needed to search disaster scenes and to
   find as many victims as possible. This paper presents the development of
   a multirobot cooperative learning approach for a hierarchical
   reinforcement learning (HRL) based semiautonomous control architecture
   in order to enable a robot team to learn cooperatively to explore and
   identify victims in cluttered USAR scenes. The proposed cooperative
   learning approach allows effective task allocation among the multirobot
   team and efficient execution of the allocated tasks in order to improve
   the overall team performance. Human intervention is requested by the
   robots when it is determined that they cannot effectively execute an
   allocated task autonomously. Thus, the robot team is able to make
   cooperative decisions regarding task allocation between different team
   members (robots and human operators) and to share experiences on
   execution of the allocated tasks. Extensive results verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed HRL-based methodology for multi-robot
   cooperative exploration and victim identification in USAR-like scenes.

Abstract = {{This study involved the development of a model for evaluating the
   potential costs and benefits of ozone control by activated carbon
   filtration in single-family homes. The modeling effort included the
   prediction of indoor ozone with and without activated carbon filtration
   in the HVAC system. As one application, the model was used to predict
   benefit-to-cost ratios for single-family homes in 12 American cities in
   five different climate zones. Health benefits were evaluated using
   disability-adjusted life-years and included city-specific age
   demographics for each simulation. Costs of commercially available
   activated carbon filters included capital cost differences when compared
   to conventional HVAC filters of similar particle removal efficiency,
   energy penalties due to additional pressure drop, and regional utility
   rates. The average indoor ozone removal effectiveness ranged from 4 to
   20\% across the 12 target cities and was largely limited by HVAC system
   operation time. For the parameters selected in this study, the mean
   predicted benefit-to-cost ratios for 1-inch filters were >1.0 in 10 of
   the 12 cities. The benefits of residential activated carbon filters were
   greatest in cities with high seasonal ozone and HVAC usage, suggesting
   the importance of targeting such conditions for activated carbon filter
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{After the introduction of a medical device into the body, adhesive
   proteins such as fibronectin (Fn) will adsorb to the surface of the
   biomaterial. Monocytes (MCs) will interact with these adsorbed proteins,
   and adopt either a proinflammatory and/or prowound healing phenotype,
   thereby influencing many blood interaction events including
   thrombogenesis. In this work, Fn adsorption as well as subsequent MC
   response and thrombus formation were investigated on two
   surfaces-modified polyetherurethanes (PEUs) using different surface
   modifiers: an anionic/dihydroxyl oligomeric (ADO) additive, known to
   enable cell adhesion, and a fluorinated polypropylene oxide oligomer
   (PPO), known to reduce platelet adhesion. Results indicated that at 24 h
   of MC culture, PEU-ADO and PEU-PPO promoted an anti-inflammatory
   character relative to the base PEU. Longer clotting times, based on a
   free hemoglobin assay, were also found on the two surface-modified PEUs
   relative to the native one, suggesting their potential for the reduction
   of thrombus formation. In presence of a Fn monolayer, the
   surface-modified PEUs conserved a lower thrombogenic character than the
   base PEU, and was however significantly decreased when compared to prior
   protein adsorption. Furthermore, Fn coatings increased the MC production
   levels of tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-10 at 24 h, while not
   affecting the anti-inflammatory effect of the modifications relative to
   the base PEU. This finding was most prominent on PEU-PPO, suggesting
   that the interaction of the adsorbed Fn with blood cells was different
   for the two additives. Hence, the results highlighted differentiating
   effects of Fn adsorption on specific blood activating processes related
   to inflammatory and thrombotic responses. (C) 2016 American Vacuum

Abstract = {{Chlorhexidine has proved an efficient antibacterial agent and has been
   used successfully to prevent new carious lesions in the teeth of adults
   and children. The substantivity of chlorhexidine has not been identified
   with any precision, but is certainly not of short duration. In this
   work, surface analytical techniques have been applied to study the
   chemical composition, distribution, and penetration of an applied liquid
   coating containing chlorhexidine onto tooth enamel in order to ascertain
   mechanisms by which chlorhexidine keeps its long term substantivity.
   Several hypotheses have been put forward with regard to its
   substantivity, including concepts of chlorhexidine remaining as a
   reservoir upon application either in the epithelial surfaces, the tooth
   surface, or the biofilm. Alternatively, it has been proposed the teeth
   themselves act as the reservoir. To study this, a chlorhexidine
   containing liquid coating was applied to the surface of teeth. These
   were subsequently transversely cross-sectioned. X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry
   (ToF-SIMS) were performed on both surfaces to ascertain chemical
   composition and distribution of the applied coating. It was found that
   it formed a coating layer of about 25 mu m thick. High spatial ToF-SIMS
   images showed little evidence of substantial diffusion of chlorhexidine
   into the enamel, either from the surface or via the enamel lamellae. (C)

Abstract = {{The degradation of composite LSCF-SDC cathodes on porous 430 stainless
   steel supports was investigated. Two degradation mechanisms were
   observed: a multi-layer oxide scale, believed to consist of Cr2O3 and
   SrCrO4, formed at the support-cathode interface, and small amounts of
   chromium were detected within the cathodes. To reduce degradation, La2O3
   and Y2O3 reactive element oxide coatings were deposited on the internal
   pore surfaces of the metal supports. The reactive element oxide coatings
   reduced the amount of volatile chromium that deposited in the cathodes.
   As a result, the degradation rates of the cathodes on coated supports
   were significantly lower than the degradation rates of cathodes madeon
   uncoated metal supports. In cathode symmetrical cells, polarization
   resistance degradation rates as low as 2.56x10(-6)cm(2)h(-1) were
   observed over 100 hours on coated metal supports, compared to an average

Abstract = {{We assess and compare the effects of both closed-loop and open-loop
   neurostimulation of the rat hippocampus by means of a custom low-power
   programmable therapeutic neurostimulation device on the suppression of
   spontaneous seizures in a rodent model of epilepsy. Chronic seizures
   were induced by intraperitoneal kainic acid injection. Two bipolar
   electrodes were implanted into the CA1 regions of both hippocampi. The
   electrodes were connected to the custom-built programmable therapeutic
   neurostimulation device that can trigger an electrical stimulation
   either in a periodic manner or upon detection of the intracerebral
   electroencephalographic (icEEE) seizure onset. This device includes a
   microchip consisting of a 256-channel icEEG recording system and a
   64-channel stimulator, and a programmable seizure detector implemented
   in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The neurostimulator was used
   to evaluate seizure suppression efficacy in ten epileptic rats for a
   total of 240 subject-days (5760 subject-hours). For this purpose, all
   rats were randomly divided into two groups: the no-stimulation group and
   the stimulation group. The no-stimulation group did not receive
   stimulation. The stimulation group received, first, closed-loop
   stimulation and, next, open-loop stimulation. The no-stimulation and
   stimulation groups had a similar seizure frequency baseline, averaging
   five seizures per day. Closed-loop stimulation reduced seizure frequency
   by 90\% and open-loop stimulation reduced seizure frequency by 17\%,

Abstract = {{This study used two recently developed environmentally extended global
   multiregional input-output models (EE GMRIOs)-WIOD and EXIOBASE-to
   assess the global operational footprint of higher education for five
   impact categories: energy, water, material, and land use, and carbon
   dioxide (CO2) emissions. The results of our analysis showed that, in
   2009, the global environmental impacts attributable to education as a
   fraction of total global environmental impacts were not more than 2.5\%
   of energy use and CO2 emissions, and not more than 1.5\% of material,
   water, and land use-the vast majority of impacts generated upstream.
   These fractions have increased moderately since 1995, potentially driven
   by increased tertiary enrollment as a fraction of overall enrollment.
   Analysis of data from the year 2000 showed that, at most, an additional
   0.15\% for each impact category was attributable to research and
   development specifically. Inter-regional and sectoral dynamics were also
   explored. Europe and the Organization for Economic and Cooperative
   Development (OECD) had lower total impacts than the rest of world, but
   their intensities per student were greater. Europe and the OECD also

   from energy and utility sectors contribute most to education-driven
   energy usage and CO2 emissions, whereas purchases from food,
   hospitality, and agriculture sectors contribute most to water and land

Abstract = {{Smoldering combustion, commercially available as the Self-sustaining
   Treatment for Active Remediation (STAR) technology, is an innovative
   technique that has shown promise for the remediation of contaminant
   source zones. Smoldering combustion is an exothermic reaction (net
   energy producing) converting carbon compounds and an oxidant (e.g.,
   oxygen in air) to carbon dioxide, water, and energy. Thus, following
   ignition, the smoldering combustion reaction can continue in a
   self-sustaining manner (i.e., no external energy or added fuel input
   following ignition) as the heat generated by the reacting contaminants
   is used to preheat and initiate combustion of contaminants in adjacent
   areas, propagating a combustion front through the contaminated zone
   provided a sufficient flux of air is supplied. The STAR technology has
   applicability across a wide-range of hydrocarbons in a variety of
   hydrogeologic settings; however, there are limitations to its use.
   Impacted soils must be permeable enough to allow a sufficient flux of
   air to the combustion front and there exists a minimum required
   concentration of contaminants such that the soils contain sufficient
   fuel for the reaction to proceed in a self-sustaining manner. Further
   limitations, as well as lessons learned and methods to mitigate these
   limitations, are presented through a series of case studies. In summary,
   the successful implementation of STAR will result in >99 percent
   reduction in contaminant concentrations in treated areas, limited
   residual contaminant mass, reduced ground-water contaminant mass flux
   which can be addressed through monitored natural attenuation; and an
   enhanced site exit strategy, reduced lifecycle costs, and reduced risk.

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates scheduling decisions associated with different
   types of leisure and social activities. Correlations among decisions and
   self-selection biases are explicitly investigated by using a sample
   selection model with a bivariate probit selection rule. A dataset
   collected in the first wave of a recent activity-travel scheduling panel
   survey carried out in Valencia (Spain) was used for empirical
   investigation. Significant differences are revealed in the empirical
   models for leisure and social activities in planning decisions,
   including different effects of temporal, companionship and demographic
   factors. The findings of the empirical model have important implications
   to travel behavior and activity-travel scheduling model developments.
   These results confirm the existence of different mechanisms underlying
   the activity-travel decision processes when leisure and social
   activities are of concerns. Results provide significant insights into
   enhancing the performances of an activity scheduling model by capturing
   accurate activity-travel scheduling tradeoffs in flexible activity types
   e.g. leisure and social activities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Impact of Resin and Fatty Acids on Full-Scale Anaerobic Treatment of
   Pulp and Paper Mill Effluents}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{394-403}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Wastewater generated during pulp and paper production usually contains
   large amounts of organic matter that may be converted to biogas through
   anaerobic treatment. These effluents can also contain a variety of
   inhibitors such as resin acids and long-chain fatty acids (RFAs) among
   other compounds. A multivariate data analysis was conducted with
   performance and water quality data from an anaerobic reactor at a pulp
   and paper mill, which provides unprecedented evidence for the long-term
   inhibitory effects of RFAs during full-scale operation. Although RFAs in
   the reactor influent did not cause serious process disturbance, they
   significantly contributed to the variability in the percentage removal
   of soluble chemical oxygen demand (percent sCOD removal) (similar to
   45\% to similar to 75\%), as well as the variability in volatile fatty
   acid concentration in the effluent (2 to >20meq/L). Furthermore, a
   linear correlation was found between RFA concentrations in the reactor
   sludge bed and the percent sCOD removal. An effective strategy to remove
   RFAs before anaerobic treatment is upfront removal of particles within
   the primary clarifier. Based on an exploratory model, a graphical method
   is introduced that allows for quick assessment of the extent to which
   resin acids are sorbed to particles, and associated potential for
   upfront settling. When the pH of high-solids wastewater is below 7, the
   majority of resin acids will be associated with particles and a
   considerable fraction of these can therefore be removed by means of
   settling or floatation. Finally, a novel liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry method that rapidly quantifies major RFA constituents was
   developed. In the full-scale reactor, dehydroabietic acid (DHA)
   represented the bulk (similar to 92\%) of the resin acids within the
   granular sludge. DHA in sludge warrants special attention and should be
   monitored closely.}},

Abstract = {{Sandstone is encountered in many hydropower projects in China, and its
   permeability evolution characteristics during the deformation process
   are one of the most important issues in engineering design. In this
   study, microstructure observation and mineral content analysis of a
   sandstone are performed, and triaxial flow experiments under different
   fluid pressures are carried out. The experiment results show that the
   permeability evolution with volumetric strain is associated with
   microcrack development in the process of rock deformation and failure.
   The volumetric strain is closely related to the permeability and fluid
   pressure, and it plays a role of linking the flow field and the stress
   field. A conceptual model is suggested to describe the permeability
   evolution of the rock. Scanning electron microscope analysis results on
   some failed specimen pieces illustrate that the fluid pressure plays a
   role in the development of microcracks. A high fluid pressure can
   accelerate crack propagation and rock failure, decrease the crack damage
   stress, and increase the flow in the sandstone. (C) 2016 American

Abstract = {{Polylactic acid (PLA) is a biodegradable polyester derived from
   renewable resources, which is a leading candidate for the replacement of
   traditional petroleum-based polymers. Since the global production of PLA
   is quickly growing, there is..an urgent need for the development of
   efficient recycling technologies, which will produce lactic acid instead
   of CO2 as the final product. After screening 90 purified microbial
   alpha/beta-hydrolases, we, identified `hydrolytic activity against
   emulsified PLA in two uncharacterized proteins, ABO2449 from Alcanivorax
   borkumnsis and RPA1511 from Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Both enzymes
   were also active against emulsified polycaprolactone and other
   polyesters as well as against soluble alpha-naphthyl and p-nitrophenyl
   monoesters. In addition, both ABO2449 and RPA1511 catalyzed complete or
   extensive hydrolysis of solid PLA with the production of lactic acid
   monomers, dimers, and larger oligomers as products. The crystal
   structure of RPA1511 was determined at 2.2 A resolution and revealed a
   classical alpha/beta-hydrolase fold with a wide-operractive site
   containing a molecule of polyethylene glycol bound near the catalytic
   triad Ser114-His270-Asp242. Site-directed mutagenesis of both proteins
   demonstrated that the catalytic triad residues are important for the
   hydrolysis of both monoester and polyester substrates. We also
   identified several residues in RPA1511 (Gln172, Leu212, Met215, Trp218,
   and Leu220) and AB02449 (Phe38 and Leu152), winch were not essential for
   activity against soluble monoesters but were found to be critical for
   the hydrolysis of PIA. Out results indicate that microbial carboxyl
   esterases can efficiently hydrblyze various polyesters malting them
   attractive biocatalysts for plastics,depolymerization and recycling.}},

Abstract = {{The possible role of shear-generated normal stresses in flows which
   appear to be extensional in nature is rarely considered. But in a recent
   article we showed that, in flows of Boger fluids through arrays of rods,
   the increased flow resistance caused by elasticity was related to the
   property N-1 and not to extensional stresses. In the present paper, that
   flow is examined further and several other complex flows, normally
   associated with extensional stresses, are investigated to assess the
   normal stresses generated by shearing, specifically: flow in a
   converging channel, the tubeless siphon, and flows around a sphere and
   cylinder. From experimental results obtained in these flows and from
   modeling, the normal stresses due to shearing and extension are
   evaluated and compared. The comparisons show that shear-generated
   stresses are at least comparable with those generated by extension. (C)

Abstract = {{Effective chronic disease management is essential to improve positive
   health outcomes, and incentive strategies are useful in promoting
   self-care with longevity. Gamification, applied with mHealth (mobile
   health) applications, has the potential to better facilitate patient
   self-management. This review article addresses a knowledge gap around
   the effective use of gamification design principles, or mechanics, in
   developing mHealth applications. Badges, leaderboards, points and
   levels, challenges and quests, social engagement loops, and onboarding
   are mechanics that comprise gamification. These mechanics are defined
   and explained from a design and development perspective. Health and
   fitness applications with gamification mechanics include: bant which
   uses points, levels, and social engagement, mySugr which uses challenges
   and quests, RunKeeper which uses leaderboards as well as social
   engagement loops and onboarding, Fitocracy which uses badges, and Mango
   Health, which uses points and levels. Specific design considerations are
   explored, an example of the efficacy of a gamified mHealth
   implementation in facilitating improved self-management is provided,
   limitations to this work are discussed, a link between the principles of
   gaming and gamification in health and wellness technologies is provided,
   and suggestions for future work are made. We conclude that gamification
   could be leveraged in developing applications with the potential to
   better facilitate self-management in persons with chronic conditions.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{IEEE Standard 1547 defines grid connection standards for distributed
   resources (DRs). This standard sets requirements for harmonic
   performance, which are particularly relevant when converter-interfaced
   DRs are considered. Specifically, the standard limits the allowable
   harmonic current injected by a DR, assuming grid voltage at the point of
   common coupling (PCC) is harmonic free. In this paper, it is
   demonstrated, both mathematically and experimentally, that the harmonic
   current injection of a converter-interfaced DR depends highly on the
   level of PCC background voltage. This paper presents a mathematical
   formulation that enables the impact of PCC voltage harmonics on the
   harmonic current injection of a converter-interfaced DR to be determined
   via experimental identification of the converters frequency coupling
   matrix. Experimental tests show that an IEEE 1547-compliant solar
   inverter with measured total demand distortion (TDD) of 0.66\% for an
   undistorted PCC can produce TDD levels in excess of 20\% in the presence
   of 3\% voltage distortion. It is concluded that TDD metrics, as employed
   in IEEE Standard 1547, provide little insight into the field performance
   of converter-interfaced DRs when background voltage harmonics are
   present. Improved FCM-based metrics for assessing the harmonic
   performance of converter-interfaced DRs in the presence of voltage
   harmonics are provided.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1060-1067}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has become an attractive option
   for dc/ac conversion in many power system applications, in particular,
   for HVDC transmission. Due to its parallel arrangement of phase legs,
   the MMC is known to be a wye-configured architecture. In this paper, the
   equivalent delta formulation of the conventional wye architecture is
   introduced. The delta-configured MMC, enabled by series-stacking phase
   legs, is an alternative realization to the wye-configured MMC and has
   significantly different operating characteristics. The introduction of
   the delta MMC enables greater flexibility in converter voltage/current
   scaling for a given set of submodules, and may be an appealing option
   for dc/ac applications requiring a power tapoff from a high-voltage dc
   rail. The single-ended and differential delta topologies are derived,
   with the latter seen as the preferred topology due to its reduced
   energy-storage requirements. The principle of operation of the
   differential delta-configured MMC is described in detail. A dynamic
   controller is developed that regulates grid power injections while
   suppressing unwanted circulating ac currents. Comprehensive simulation
   results validate the differential delta MMC operation and the proposed
   control scheme.}},

Abstract = {{The dc cables of the voltage-sourced converter-based HVDC link,
   including the modular multilevel converter (MMC) configuration, must be
   protected by surge arresters against transient overvoltages. The
   selection of the appropriate surge arresters requires a comprehensive
   understanding of the phenomena that cause the overvoltages and accurate
   calculation of energy discharged in the arresters. This paper
   investigates the mechanism that causes transient overvoltages, due to
   dc-side line-to-ground faults, in a cable-connected MMC-HVDC link. This
   paper also evaluates the impacts of various system parameters, for
   example, the prefault power transfer level, the MMC arm inductance, the
   transformer leakage inductance, the fault location, the ac system
   short-circuit capacity, the cable inductance, and the MMC blocking
   delay, on the peak transient overvoltages and the amount of energy
   discharge in the cable surge arresters. The transient overvoltage
   studies are also conducted when the dc cable is replaced by an overhead
   line. The studies are performed in the PSCAD platform. The studies
   conclude that the prefault power transfer level and the MMC blocking
   delay have the most significant impacts on the surge arrester energy
   discharge under dc-side line-to-ground faults in the MMC-HVDC link. The
   study results also provide essential information for the design of the
   MMC-HVDC link components.}},

   multilayer ground model for the recently proposed MoM-SO method,
   suitable to accurately predict ground return effects in such scenarios.
   The proposed technique precisely accounts for skin, proximity, ground,
   and tunnel effects, and is applicable to a variety of cable
   configurations, including underground and submarine cables. Numerical
   results show that the proposed method is more accurate than analytic
   formulas typically employed for transient analyses, and delivers an
   accuracy comparable to the finite-element method (FEM). With respect to
   FEM, however, MoM-SO is over 1000 times faster, and can calculate the
   impedance of a submarine cable inside a three-layer medium in 0.10 s per
   frequency point.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the dynamic interactions of a modular multilevel
   converter (MMC) -based HVDC grid and its host ac system during ac -side
   disturbances. The HVDC grid is composed of five MMC stations that are
   interconnected through a network of cables and overhead lines. The ac
   grid includes ten turbine generators. The studies are conducted in the
   PSCAD platform, including the detailed models of the ac and dc
   subsystems. The reported case studies indicate that without the HVDC
   supplementary control functions and based on the conventional dq-frame
   control structure: 1) each MMC behaves as almost a fixed sink/source of
   power during the ac -side electromechanical transient oscillations; 2)
   the MMC-HVDC grid effectively improves dynamic interactions between ac
   subsystems that are connected only by the HVDC grid; 3) without
   appropriate provisions, the embedded MMC-HVDC grid can aggravate the
   transients of the host ac system, for example, interarea oscillations.
   The observations also contradict the widely accepted notion that even
   without supplementary controllers, the MMC-HVDC grid necessarily
   improves the dynamics of the ac system. The study results provide a
   comprehensive insight into the transient behavior of the MMC-based
   HVDC-AC grid. Such an understanding is essential to design the
   protection and control systems of the future HVDC-AC grids.}},

Abstract = {{Mismatched coded excitation (CE) can be employed to increase the frame
   rate of synthetic aperture ultrasound imaging. The high autocorrelation
   and low cross correlation (CC) of transmitted signals enables the
   identification and separation of signal sources at the receiver. Thus,
   the method provides B-mode imaging with simultaneous transmission from
   several elements and capability of spatial decoding of the transmitted
   signals, which makes the imaging process equivalent to consecutive
   transmissions. Each transmission generates its own image and the
   combination of all the images results in an image with a high lateral
   resolution. In this paper, we introduce two different methods for
   generating multiple mismatched CEs with an identical frequency bandwidth
   and code length. Therefore, the proposed families of mismatched CEs are
   able to generate similar resolutions and signal-to-noise ratios. The
   application of these methods is demonstrated experimentally.
   Furthermore, several techniques are suggested that can be used to reduce
   the CC between the mismatched codes.}},

Abstract = {{Transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanolayers show potential as
   high-performance catalysts in energy conversion and storage devices.
   Synthetic TMDs produced by chemical-vapor deposition (CVD) methods`tend
   to grow parallel to the growth substrate. Here, we show that with the
   right precursors and appropriate tuning of the CVD growth conditions,
   ReS2 nanosheets can be made to orient perpendicular to the growth
   substrate. This accomplishes two important objectives; first, it
   drastically increases the wetted or exposed surface area of the ReS2
   sheets, and second, it exposes the sharp edges and corners of the ReS2
   sheets. We show that these structural features of the vertically grown
   ReS2 sheets can be exploited to significantly improve their performance
   as polysulfide immobilizers and electro-chemical catalysts in
   lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries and in hydrogen evolution reactions
   (HER). After 300 cycles, the specific capacity of the Li-S battery with
   vertical ReS2 catalyst is retained above 750 mA h g(-1), with only
   similar to 0.063\% capacity decay per cycle, much better than the
   baseline battery (without ReS2), which shows similar to 0.184\% capacity
   decay per cycle under the same test conditions. As a HER catalyst, the
   vertical ReS2 provides very small onset overpotential (<100 mV) and an
   exceptional exchange-current density (similar to 67.6 mu A/cm(2)), which
   is vastly superior to the baseline electrode without ReS2.}},

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{47-56}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Brain computer interfaces (BCI) can provide communication opportunities
   for individuals with severe motor disabilities. Transcranial Doppler
   ultrasound (TCD) measures cerebral blood flow velocities and can be used
   to develop a BCI. A previously implemented TCD BCI system used verbal
   and spatial tasks as control signals; however, the spatial task involved
   a visual cue that awkwardly diverted the user's attention away from the
   communication interface. Therefore, vision-independent right-lateralized
   tasks were investigated. Using a bilateral TCD BCI, ten participants
   controlled online, an on-screen keyboard using a left-lateralized task
   (verbal fluency), a right-lateralized task (fist motor imagery or
   3D-shape tracing), and unconstrained rest. 3D-shape tracing was
   generally more discernible from other tasks than was fist motor imagery.
   Verbal fluency, 3D-shape tracing and unconstrained rest were
   distinguished from each other using a linear discriminant classifier,
   achieving a mean agreement of K = 0.43 + 0.17. These rates are
   comparable to the best offline three-class TCD BCI accuracies reported
   thus far. The online communication system achieved a mean information
   transfer rate (ITR) of 1.08+ 0.69 bits/min with values reaching up to
   2.46 bits/min, thereby exceeding the ITR of previous online TCD BCIs.
   These findings demonstrate the potential of a three-class online TCD BCI
   that does not require visual task cues. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Patient self-management has been shown to
   improve health outcomes. We developed a smartphone-based system to boost
   self-care by patients with CKD and integrated its use into usual CKD
   care. We determined its acceptability and examined changes in several
   clinical parameters.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements We recruited patients
   with stage 4 or 5 CKD attending outpatient renal clinics who responded
   to a general information newsletter about this 6-month
   proof-of-principle study. The smartphone application targeted four
   behavioral elements: monitoring BP, medication management, symptom
   assessment, and tracking laboratory results. Prebuilt customizable
   algorithms provided real time personalized patient feedback and alerts
   to providers when predefined treatment thresholds were crossed or
   critical changes occurred. Those who died or started RRT within the
   first 2 months were replaced. Only participants followed for 6 months
   after recruitment were included in assessing changes in clinical
   measures.
   Results In total, 47 patients (26 men; mean age =59 years old; 33\% were
   >= 65 years old) were enrolled; 60\% had never used a smartphone. User
   adherence was high (>80\% performed >= 80\% of recommended assessments)
   and sustained. The mean reductions in home BP readings between baseline
   and exit were statistically significant (systolic BP, -3.4 mmHg; 95\%
   confidence interval, -5.0 to -1.8 and diastolic BP, -2.1 mmHg; 95\%
   confidence interval, -2.9 to -1.2); 27\% with normal clinic BP readings
   had newly identified masked hypertension. One hundred twenty-seven
   medication discrepancies were identified; 59\% were medication errors
   that required an intervention to prevent harm. In exit interviews,
   patients indicated feeling more confident and in control of their
   condition; clinicians perceived patients to be better informed and more
   engaged.
   Conclusions Integrating a smartphone based self management system into
   usual care of patients with advanced CKD proved feasible and acceptable,
   and it appeared to be clinically useful. The results provide a strong
   rationale for a randomized, controlled trial.}},

Abstract = {{Acanthamoeba is an opportunistic protozoan pathogen that plays a pivotal
   role in the ecosystem. It may cause blinding keratitis and fatal
   encephalitis involving the central nervous system. Here we synthesized
   pure and Zn doped TiO2 nanoparticles (similar to 10-30 nm) via sol-gel
   and sol-hydrothermal methods and demonstrated its impact on the
   biological characteristics of pathogenic Acanthamoeba castellanii. Our
   results revealed that pure and Zn doped TiO2 nanoparticles synthesized
   by sol-hydrothermal methods (ranging 5, 10, 25 and 50 pg/ml) exhibited
   amoebicidal effects i.e., >60\% of trophozoites executed under normal
   light at maximum dose (50 mu g/ml) within 1 h incubation. In contrast
   pure/doped TiO2 obtained via sol gel method showed similar to 40\%
   amoeba damage. Furthermore, amoebae growth assay demonstrated that Zn
   doped TiO2 also inhibited Acanthamoeba numbers up to 7 days in dose
   dependent manner. It was interesting to note that all the tested TiO2
   nanoparticles have shown maximum amoebicidal effects at pH 7 which is
   quite relevant to amoebic growth favorable conditions. Our results
   confirmed that TiO2 has inhibitory effects on Acanthamoeba growth and
   viability. Overall, we reported the amoebicidal and amoebic growth
   inhibition potential of pure and Zn doped TiO2 nanoparticles against
   Acanthamoeba due to attached OW groups, reduced size and decreased band
   gap of sol hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have attracted significant interest for
   applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices such as
   photodetectors, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells. However, a poor
   understanding of charge transport in these nanocrystalline films hinders
   their practical applications. The photocarrier radiometry (PCR)
   technique, a frequency-domain photoluminescence method spectrally gated
   for monitoring radiative recombination photon emissions while excluding
   thermal infrared photons due to non-radiative recombination, has been
   applied to PbS CQD thin films for the analysis of charge transport
   properties. Linear excitation intensity responses of PCR signals were
   found in the reported experimental conditions. The type and influence of
   trap states in the coupled PbS CQD thin film were analyzed with PCR
   temperature-and time-dependent results.}},

Abstract = {{We report the fabrication of a scaffold (hereafter referred to as
   AngioChip) that supports the assembly of parenchymal cells on a
   mechanically tunable matrix surrounding a perfusable, branched,
   three-dimensional microchannel network coated with endothelial cells.
   The design of AngioChip decouples the material choices for the
   engineered vessel network and for cell seeding in the parenchyma,
   enabling extensive remodelling while maintaining an open-vessel lumen.
   The incorporation of nanopores and micro-holes in the vessel walls
   enhances permeability, and permits intercellular crosstalk and
   extravasation of monocytes and endothelial cells on biomolecular
   stimulation. We also show that vascularized hepatic tissues and cardiac
   tissues engineered by using AngioChips process clinically relevant drugs
   delivered through the vasculature, and that millimetre-thick cardiac
   tissues can be engineered in a scalable manner. Moreover, we demonstrate
   that AngioChip cardiac tissues implanted with direct surgical
   anastomosis to the femoral vessels of rat hindlimbs establish immediate
   blood perfusion.}},

Abstract = {{Algal biofilm systems offer potential advantages over planktonic systems
   for growing, harvesting and processing algal biomass. To determine how
   feasible these systems can be, however, researchers must determine
   optimal biomass and lipid productivities. In this paper the effect of
   photon flux density (PFD) on algal biofilm biomass productivities,
   internal fatty acid concentrations, and overall fatty acid productivity
   was studied. It was determined that as PFD increased, algal biofilm
   biomass productivities significantly increased until they peaked i.e. at
   about 300 mu mol/m(2)/s, presumably due to light saturation. Increasing
   PFDs from 50 to 150 mu mol/m(2)/s produced statistically significant
   increases in fatty acid concentrations from 5\% to 8\%; however,
   increasing PFDs beyond that range did not enhance lipid accumulation.
   Because of significant increases in biomass productivity with increased
   PFD, there was also a significant increase in fatty acid productivity
   with increased PFD. Lastly, increasing PFD resulted in diminishing
   returns of biomass productivity, suggesting that photons are not being
   effectively utilized at higher light intensities. This finding has
   implications for photobioreactor design and operation with artificial
   lighting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The application of fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor natural organic
   matter (NOM) reduction as a function of biofiltration performance was
   investigated. This study was conducted at pilot-scale where a
   conventional media filter was compared to six biofilters employing
   varying enhancement strategies. Overall reductions of NOM were
   identified by measuring dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and UV
   absorbance at 254 nm, as well as characterization of organic
   sub-fractions by liquid chromatography -organic carbon detection
   (LC-OCD) and parallel factors analysis (PARAFAC) of fluorescence
   excitation-emission matrices (FEEM). The biofilter using granular
   activated carbon media, with exhausted absorptive capacity, was found to
   provide the highest removal of all identified PARAFAC components. A
   microbial or processed humic-like component was found to be most
   amenable to biodegradation by biofilters and removal by conventional
   treatment. One refractory humic-like component, detectable only by
   FEEM-PARAFAC, was not well removed by biofiltration or conventional
   treatment. All biofilters removed protein-like material to a high degree
   relative to conventional treatment. The formation potential of two
   halogenated furanones, 3-chloro-4(dichloromethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (MX)
   and mucochloric acid (MCA), as well as overall treated water
   genotoxicity are also reported. Using the organic characterization
   results possible halogenated furanone and genotoxicity precursors are
   identified. Comparison of FEEM-PARAFAC and LC-OCD results revealed
   polysaccharides as potential MX/MCA precursors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{moviEEG: An animation toolbox for visualization of intracranial

Volume = {{127}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We introduce and describe the functions of moviEEG (Multiple
   Overlay Visualizations for Intracranial ElectroEncephaloGraphy), a novel
   MATLAB-based toolbox for spatiotemporal mapping of network
   synchronization dynamics in intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG)
   data.
   Methods: The toolbox integrates visualizations of inter-electrode
   phase-locking relationships in peri-ictal epileptogenic networks with
   signal spectral properties and graph-theoretical network measures
   overlaid upon operating room images of the electrode grid. Functional
   connectivity between every electrode pair is evaluated over a sliding
   window indexed by phase synchrony.
   Results: Two case studies are presented to provide preliminary evidence
   for the application of the toolbox to guide network-based mapping of
   epileptogenic cortex and to distinguish these regions from eloquent
   brain networks. In both cases, epileptogenic cortex was visually
   distinct.
   Conclusion: We introduce moviEEG, a novel toolbox for animation of
   oscillatory network dynamics in iEEG data, and provide two case studies
   showing preliminary evidence for utility of the toolbox in delineating
   the epileptogenic zone.
   Significance: Despite evidence that atypical network synchronization has
   shown to be altered in epileptogenic brain regions, network based
   techniques have yet to be incorporated into clinical pre-surgical
   mapping. moviEEG provides a set of functions to enable easy
   visualization with network based techniques. (C) 2016 International

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel strategy for the deployment of a
   static-sensor network based on the use of a target-motion probability
   model. The focus is on the real-time dynamic and optimal deployment of
   the network for detecting untrackable targets. The dynamic nature of the
   deployment refers to the on-line reconfigurability of the network as
   real-time information about the target becomes available. The optimal
   locations of the network nodes, in turn, are determined based on
   maximizing the probability of finding the target through the use of
   iso-cumulative-probability curves. The proposed strategy is adaptable to
   unstructured environments with natural terrain variation and the
   presence of obstacles. Extensive simulations, some of which are included
   in this paper, verified the advantage of our deployment strategy over
   other existing methods. Namely, the proposed strategy can tangibly
   increase the success rate of target detection, while reducing the mean
   detection time, when compared with uniform-coverage-based approaches
   that do not consider probabilistic target-motion modeling. A
   comprehensive example is also included, herein, to illustrate the
   successful application of our proposed deployment strategy to a
   wilderness search and rescue scenario, where both static and mobile
   sensors are employed within a hybrid sensor-deployment strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Typical feature selection methods choose an optimal global feature
   subset that is applied over all regions of the sample space. In
   contrast, in this paper we propose a novel localized feature selection
   (LFS) approach whereby each region of the sample space is associated
   with its own distinct optimized feature set, which may vary both in
   membership and size across the sample space. This allows the feature set
   to optimally adapt to local variations in the sample space. An
   associated method for measuring the similarities of a query datum to
   each of the respective classes is also proposed. The proposed method
   makes no assumptions about the underlying structure of the samples;
   hence the method is insensitive to the distribution of the data over the
   sample space. The method is efficiently formulated as a linear
   programming optimization problem. Furthermore, we demonstrate the method
   is robust against the over-fitting problem. Experimental results on
   eleven synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the viability of
   the formulation and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. In
   addition we show several examples where localized feature selection
   produces better results than a global feature selection method.}},

   rock by fitting the non-linear Hoek-Brown empirical strength criterion
   to published datasets of triaxial rock strength. It is shown that the
   form of results obtained from a quantile regression model (i.e. a
   `characteristic criterion') may be more useful to practising engineers
   than those produced by a non-linear regression model. For an extensive
   dataset, the methods give similar results. However, with small datasets
   of a size generally encountered in geotechnical engineering, both
   methods may be unreliable. This suggests that objective techniques that
   augment the limited test data should be developed.}},

Title = {{Supporting anticipation in driving through attentional and

Abstract = {{Objective: This paper evaluates two different types of in-vehicle
   interfaces to support anticipation in driving: one aids attention
   allocation and the other aids interpretation of traffic in addition to
   attention allocation.
   Background: Anticipation is a competency that has been shown to
   facilitate safety and eco-driving through the efficient positioning of a
   vehicle for probable, upcoming changes in traffic. This competency has
   been shown to improve with driving experience. In an earlier simulator
   study, we showed that compared to novice drivers, experienced drivers
   exhibited a greater number of timely actions to avoid upcoming traffic
   conflicts. In this study, we seek to facilitate anticipation in general
   and for novice drivers in particular, who appear to lack the competency.
   We hypothesize that anticipation depends on two major steps and that it
   can be supported by aiding each: (1) conscious perception of relevant
   cues, and (2) effective processing of these cues to create a situational
   assessment as a basis for anticipation of future developments.
   Method: We conducted a simulator experiment with 24 experienced and 24
   novice drivers to evaluate two interfaces that were designed to aid the
   two hypothesized steps of anticipation. The attentional interface was
   designed to direct attention toward the most relevant cue. The
   interpretational interface represented several cues, and in addition to
   directing attention also aimed to aid sense-making of these cues.
   Results: The results confirmed our hypothesis that novice drivers'
   anticipation performance, as measured through timely actions to avoid
   upcoming traffic conflicts, would be improved with either interface
   type. However, results contradicted our expectation that novice drivers
   would obtain larger improvements with the interpretational interface.
   Experienced drivers performed better than novice drivers to begin with
   and did not show any statistically significant improvements with either
   interface.
   Conclusion: Both interfaces improved anticipation performance for novice
   drivers. Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of these
   interfaces in a wider variety of driving conditions, such as when the
   driver is multitasking. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{What drives technology-based distractions? A structural equation model
   on social-psychological factors of technology-based driver distraction
   engagement}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{166-174}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: With the proliferation of new mobile and in-vehicle
   technologies, understanding the motivations behind a driver's voluntary
   engagement with such technologies is crucial from a safety perspective,
   yet is complex. Previous literature either surveyed a large number of
   distractions that may be diverse, or too focuses on one particular
   activity, such as cell phone use. Further, earlier studies about social
   psychological factors underlying driver distraction tend to focus on one
   or two factors in-depth, and those that examine a more comprehensive set
   of factors are often limited in their analyses methods.
   Objective: The present work considers a wide array of
   social-psychological factors within a structural equation model to
   predict their influence on a focused set of technology-based
   distractions. A better understanding of these facilitators can enhance
   the design of distraction mitigation strategies.
   Method: We analysed survey responses about three technology-based driver
   distractions: holding phone conversations, manually interacting with
   cell phones, and adjusting the settings of in-vehicle technology, as
   well as responses on five social-psychological factors: attitude,
   descriptive norm, injunctive norm, technology inclination, and a
   risk/sensation seeking personality. Using data collected from 525
   drivers (ages: 18-80), a structural equation model was built to analyse
   these social-psychological factors as latent variables influencing
   self-reported engagement in these three technology-based distractions.
   Results: Self-reported engagement in technology-based distractions was
   found to be largely influenced by attitudes about the distractions.
   Personality and social norms also played a significant role, but
   technology inclination did not. A closer look at two age groups (18-30
   and 30+)showed that the effect of social norms, especially of injunctive
   norm (i.e., perceived approvals), was less prominent in the 30+ age
   group, while personality remained a significant predictor for the 30+
   age group but marginally significant for the younger group.
   Conclusion: Findings from this work provide insights into the
   social-psychological factors behind intentional engagement in
   technology-based distractions and in particular suggesting that these
   factors may be sensitive to demographic differences. (C) 2016 Published

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of power allocation for the single-cell
   multi-user (MU) multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink with
   quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. The base station acquires an
   estimate of the channels and, for a given beam-forming structure,
   designs the power allocation so as to minimize the total transmission
   power required to ensure that target signal-to-interference-and-noise
   ratios at the receivers are met, subject to a specified outage
   probability. We consider scenarios in which the errors in the base
   station's channel estimates can be modelled as being zero-mean and
   Gaussian. Such a model is particularly suitable for time division duplex
   (TDD) systems with quasi-static channels, in which the base station
   estimates the channel during the uplink phase. Under that model, we
   employ a precise deterministic characterization of the outage
   probability to transform the chance-constrained formulation to a
   deterministic one. Although that deterministic formulation is not
   convex, we develop a coordinate descent algorithm that can be shown to
   converge to a globally optimal solution when the starting point is
   feasible. Insight into the structure of the deterministic formulation
   yields approximations that result in coordinate update algorithms with
   good performance and significantly lower computational cost. The
   proposed algorithms provide better performance than existing robust
   power loading algorithms that are based on tractable conservative
   approximations and can even provide better performance than robust
   precoding algorithms based on such approximations.}},

   decoupled. Using novel 3-D printing techniques, this study analyzes
   microtrusses built bottom-up from photopolymerizable polymer where the
   complex structure can be constructed of unit cells a few millimeters in
   length. While the predicted failure mechanisms matched the experimental
   observations, deterministic energetic size effects were needed to
   account for the critical loads. For strut radii <5 x the 3-D printer
   layer thickness, stochastic size effects became important.}},

Abstract = {{Thin-films of Zinc Tin Oxide (ZTO) with an extremely high charge carrier
   mobility and superior optical transmittance are synthesized using a
   simple solution method. These ZTO films have been systematically studied

   effects measurements show that the charge mobility of the ZTO
   semiconductor is over 16.5 cm(2).V-1.S-1, which is the highest mobility
   value ever reported for oxide buffer made by using solution process. By
   applying the ZTO buffer layer in the inverted PSCs of P3HT:PC61BM, the
   power conversion efficiency of the device is 30\% higher than that of
   the devices made with other common buffer layers such as ZnO and TiO2.
   Light intensity-dependent JV studies and PL measurements also indicate
   that ZTO buffer layer reduces surface recombination. This work
   demonstrates that the solution-synthesized ZTO is a promising new buffer
   layer with superior electron extraction capability for the solar cells.

Abstract = {{This paper identifies a property of delay-robustness in distributed
   supervisory control of discrete-event systems (DES) with communication
   delays. In previous work a distributed supervisory control problem has
   been investigated on the assumption that inter-agent communications take
   place with negligible delay. From an applications viewpoint it is
   desirable to relax this constraint and identify communicating
   distributed controllers which are delay-robust, namely logically
   equivalent to their delay-free counterparts. For this we introduce
   inter-agent channels modeled as 2-state automata, compute the overall
   system behavior, and present an effective computational test for
   delay-robustness. From the test it typically results that the given
   delay-free distributed control is delay-robust with respect to certain
   communicated events, but not for all, thus distinguishing events which
   are not delay-critical from those that are. The approach is illustrated
   by a workcell model with three communicating agents.}},

   nanoparticles not only decreased the wear rate and coefficient of
   friction of the composites, but also facilitated the formation of a
   stable graphite layer at longer sliding distances and high sliding
   velocities by forming a durable graphite/TiC composite on the
   tribo-surface. Therefore, the stability of graphite layer can be
   considered as a possible cause for decrease in wear rate of the

   direct observation of bubble nucleation and growth/collapse in foam
   injection molding. A reflective prism was incorporated into the
   stationary part of the injection mold with which the nucleation and
   growth behaviors of bubbles were successfully observed. The mechanisms
   of bubble nucleation in low-and high-pressure foam injection molding,
   with and without the application of gas-counter pressure, was
   investigated. We identified how the inherently non-uniform cell
   structure is developed in low-pressure foam injection molding with

Journal = {{PATTERN RECOGNITION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{83-93}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Sparse representation of images using orthogonal two-dimensional
   Krawtchouk moments (2D KCMs) for face recognition is motivated by their
   ability to capture region-based higher-order hidden nonlinear structures
   from discrete coordinates of finitely supported images and the
   invariance of affine transformations of these moments to common
   geometric distortions. This paper presents the effectiveness of
   selecting the discriminatory set of KCMs as the global and local face
   features as opposed to traditional features obtained from heuristic
   choice of fixed-order moments or projection of the moments for
   recognizing an identity. The selection of significantly sparse 2D
   KCM-based features according to the proposed approach results in highly
   efficient face recognition method as compared to the other methods that
   use orthogonal moments such as the 2D Zernike, 2D Tchebichef or 2D
   Gaussian-Hermite. Experiments on challenging databases (viz., FRGC and
   CK-AUC) and comparisons with the well established projection, texture,
   and moment-based methods indicate superior recognition performance in
   terms of mean accuracy and robustness of the proposed holistic- or
   hybrid-type discriminative KCM-based method, especially when sample
   sizes are small and the intraclass faces have significant variations due
   to expressions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Energy storage (ES) integration into the grid is typically achieved
   using a two-or three-level dc/ac converter with ES interfaced directly
   to the inverter's dc link or through a dc/dc converter. In both cases,
   long-series connected strings of batteries are required to efficiently
   maintain the necessary dc-link voltage. Such configurations are
   susceptible to reliability issues, as shutdown of a battery string due
   to individual battery failure, overheating, or overcharging/discharging
   results in loss of a large fraction of ES capacity. To increase the
   reliability of an ES system, shorter strings of batteries are
   preferable. In this study, the ES is subdivided into many banks of
   short-series strings, which are integrated into the submodules of a
   modular multilevel converter (MMC). To further enhance the reliability,
   the MMC should also be unaffected by an ES bank shutdown. This paper
   investigates the robustness of the MMC to ES bank failure by assessing
   the power balance between submodules when a subset of ES banks is not
   operational. The analysis concludes that as many as 33\% of ES banks may
   be shutdown without affecting MMC power exchange with the grid, and is
   supported with both simulation and experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, advanced forgery and spoofing techniques are threatening the
   reliability of conventional biometric modalities. This has been
   motivating the recent investigation of a novel yet promising modality
   transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE), which is an acoustic
   response generated from cochlea after a click stimulus. Unlike
   conventional modalities that are easily accessible or captured, TEOAE is
   naturally immune to replay and falsification attacks as a physiological
   outcome from the human auditory system. The corresponding biometric
   system where sensitive template data are stored consequently becomes the
   main intrusion target. To secure the template data, BioHashing based on
   random projection for TEOAE is proposed in this paper. In particular,
   feature sets are projected onto random subspaces according to randomly
   generated pseudomatrices, which ensure nonlinkability of hash templates
   across various systems; binary quantization after projection prevents
   recovery of original biometric data from the distorted templates.
   Quantitative analysis and experimental results verify that the proposed
   method fulfills robustness criteria, irreversibility, and diversity, and
   meanwhile guarantees decent recognition performance.}},

Abstract = {{Gene expression-based signatures help identify pathways relevant to
   diseases and treatments, but are challenging to construct when there is
   a diversity of disease mechanisms and treatments in patients with
   complex diseases. To overcome this challenge, we present a new
   application of an in silico gene expression deconvolution method,
   ISOpure-S1, and apply it to identify a common gene expression signature
   corresponding to response to treatment in 33 juvenile idiopathic
   arthritis (JIA) patients. Using pre-and post-treatment gene expression
   profiles only, we found a gene expression signature that significantly
   correlated with a reduction in the number of joints with active
   arthritis, a measure of clinical outcome (Spearman rho = 0.44, p =
   0.040, Bonferroni correction). This signature may be associated with a
   decrease in T-cells, monocytes, neutrophils and platelets. The products
   of most differentially expressed genes include known biomarkers for JIA
   such as major histocompatibility complexes and interleukins, as well as
   novel biomarkers including a-defensins. This method is readily
   applicable to expression datasets of other complex diseases to uncover
   shared mechanistic patterns in heterogeneous samples.}},

Abstract = {{Fabrication of anisotropic hydrogels exhibiting direction-dependent
   structure and properties has attracted great interest in biomimicking,
   tissue engineering, and bioseparation. Herein, we report a
   freeze-casting-based fabrication of structurally and mechanically
   anisotropic aerogels and hydrogels composed of hydrazone cross-linked
   poly(oligoethylene glycol methacrylate) (POEGMA) and cellulose
   nanocrystals (CNCs). We show that, by controlling the composition of the
   CNC/POEGMA dispersion and the freeze-casting temperature, aerogels with
   fibrillar, columnar, or lamellar morphologies can be produced.
   Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments show that the anisotropy of the
   structure originates from the alignment of the mesostructures, rather
   than the CNC building blocks. The composite hydrogels show high
   structural and mechanical integrity and a strong variation in Young's
   moduli in orthogonal directions. The controllable morphology and
   hydrogel anisotropy, coupled with hydrazone cross-linking and
   biocompatibility of CNCs and POEGMA, provide a versatile platform for
   the preparation of anisotropic hydrogels.}},

Title = {{Predominance of sperm motion in corners}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 23}},
Abstract = {{Sperm migration through the female tract is crucial to fertilization,
   but the role of the complex and confined structure of the fallopian tube
   in sperm guidance remains unknown. Here, by confocal imaging
   microchannels head-on, we distinguish corner- vs. wall- vs.
   bulk-swimming bull sperm in confined geometries. Corner-swimming
   dominates with local areal concentrations as high as 200-fold that of
   the bulk. The relative degree of corner-swimming is strongest in small
   channels, decreases with increasing channel size, and plateaus for
   channels above 200 mu m. Corner-swimming remains predominant across the
   physiologically-relevant range of viscosity and pH. Together,
   boundary-following sperm account for over 95\% of the sperm distribution
   in small rectangular channels, which is similar to the percentage of
   wall swimmers in circular channels of similar size. We also demonstrate
   that wall-swimming sperm travel closer to walls in smaller channels
   (similar to 100 mu m), where the opposite wall is within the
   hydrodynamic interaction length-scale. The corner accumulation effect is
   more than the superposition of the influence of two walls, and over
   5-fold stronger than that of a single wall. These findings suggest that
   folds and corners are dominant in sperm migration in the narrow (sub-mm)
   lumen of the fallopian tube and microchannel-based sperm selection
   devices.}},

Title = {{A Subject-Specific Acoustic Model of the Upper Airway for Snoring Sounds
   Generation}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 23}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring variations in the upper airway narrowing during sleep is
   invasive and expensive. Since snoring sounds are generated by air
   turbulence and vibrations of the upper airway due to its narrowing;
   snoring sounds may be used as a non-invasive technique to assess upper
   airway narrowing. Our goal was to develop a subject-specific acoustic
   model of the upper airway to investigate the impacts of upper airway
   anatomy, e.g. length, wall thickness and cross-sectional area, on
   snoring sounds features. To have a subject-specific model for snoring
   generation, we used measurements of the upper airway length,
   cross-sectional area and wall thickness from every individual to develop
   the model. To validate the proposed model, in 20 male individuals,
   intensity and resonant frequencies of modeled snoring sounds were
   compared with those measured from recorded snoring sounds during sleep.
   Based on both modeled and measured results, we found the only factor
   that may positively and significantly contribute to snoring intensity
   was narrowing in the upper airway. Furthermore, measured resonant
   frequencies of snoring were inversely correlated with the upper airway
   length, which is a risk factor for upper airway collapsibility. These
   results encourage the use of snoring sounds analysis to assess the upper
   airway anatomy during sleep.}},

Journal = {{ELIFE}},

Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) are key cellular transporter that control
   nucleocytoplasmic transport in eukaryotic cells, but its transport
   mechanism is still not understood. The centerpiece of NPC transport is
   the assembly of intrinsically disordered polypeptides, known as FG
   nucleoporins, lining its passageway. Their conformations and collective
   dynamics during transport are difficult to assess in vivo. In vitro
   investigations provide partially conflicting results, lending support to
   different models of transport, which invoke various conformational
   transitions of the FG nucleoporins induced by the cargo-carrying
   transport proteins. We show that the spatial organization of FG
   nucleoporin assemblies with the transport proteins can be understood
   within a first principles biophysical model with a minimal number of key
   physical variables, such as the average protein interaction strengths
   and spatial densities. These results address some of the outstanding
   controversies and suggest how molecularly divergent NPCs in different
   species can perform essentially the same function.}},

   capable and multifunctional chelators. However, they remain elusive as
   building blocks for nanoparticles because of the difficulty associated
   with synthesis of texaphyrin constructs capable of self-assembly. A
   novel manganese (Mn)-texaphyrin-phospholipid building block is
   described, along with its one-pot synthesis and self-assembly into a
   Mn-nanotexaphyrin. This nanoparticle possesses strong resilience to
   manganese dissociation, structural stability, in vivo bio-safety, and
   structure-dependent T-1 and T-2 relaxivities. Magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) contrast enhanced visualization of lymphatic drainage is
   demonstrated with respect to proximal lymph nodes on the head and neck
   VX-2 tumors of a rabbit. Synthesis of 17 additional metallotexaphyrin
   building blocks suggests that this novel one-pot synthetic procedure for
   nanotexaphyrins may lead to a wide range of applications in the field of
   nanomedicines.}},

   (average diameter similar to 1.5 nm) protected by carboxyl and amine
   ligands, which correspond to previously reported experimental

   ligand packing densities, capping every single dangling bond of the
   inorganic core, strong dependence of the Z-type metal carboxylate
   binding on the amount of excess amine, and potential for improved
   photoluminescence upon replacing phenyl ligands with alkanes. The
   computed absorption spectra of the Cd35Se20 cluster agree well with
   experiments, resolving the 0.2 eV splitting of the first exciton peak
   due to spin orbit coupling. We discuss the origin of the significant
   broadening of the optical spectra as due to phonons and structural
   variations in the ligand configurations and inorganic core apexes.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Month = {{MAY 12}},
Abstract = {{Paint films with uniform thickness were applied on stainless steel and
   glass substrates using a model paint consisting of a resin dissolved in
   butanol. Tests were also done using glycerin-butanol solutions that were
   as viscous as paint but did not harden after drying. Small air bubbles
   were introduced into the liquid and test samples cured in a natural
   convection oven at temperatures varying from of 100-140 degrees C.
   Relatively thick (1 mm) paint layers were used in experiments to allow
   large bubbles to grow that were easy to observe. Photographs of the
   liquid film surfaces were taken during drying and weight loss was
   measured. Cellular structures appeared in drying paint films, induced by
   surface tension gradients. Small bubbles were transported from the
   centers to the edges of the cells formed in the liquid layer. Bubbles
   grew larger as the evaporating solvent diffused into them and were drawn
   towards each other, forming clusters. Analytical solutions of the
   mass-diffusion equation were used to model solvent evaporation from the
   paint film surface, calculate the magnitude of concentration gradients,
   and estimate bubble growth rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Misalignment of the Desired and Measured Center of Pressure Describes
   Falls Caused by Slip during Turning}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 11}},
Abstract = {{In this study, desired center of pressure (dCOP) was introduced to
   evaluate dynamic postural stability. The dCOP is defined as a virtual
   point on the ground, where the moment around the body center of mass
   (COM) becomes zero when dCOP and the measured COP (mCOP) coincide. We
   hypothesized that, when the misalignment of the dCOP and mCOP
   (dCOP-mCOP) increases up to a certain value due to a large perturbation
   during walking, it becomes difficult to make a compensatory step and to
   recover balance of COM and to continue gait. Here we tested this
   hypothesis in slipping during turning. The study involved twelve healthy
   young adult males with an average age of 21.5 +/- 1.9 yrs. The subjects
   were asked to (1) walk straight and turn 60 degrees to the right with
   the right foot (spin turn) on a dry floor surface, and (2) walk straight
   and 60 degrees spin turn to the right on a slippery lubricated surface.
   The dCOP-mCOP during turning in the slip trial with fall were
   significantly larger, particularly in x-direction (i.e., the
   medial-lateral direction during straight walk), than that in no-slip
   trial and slip trial without fall. The receiver operating characteristic
   (ROC) analysis indicated that the dCOP-mCOP in x-direction is good
   indicator of falling (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.93) and the
   threshold in the dCOP-mCOP in x-direction to distinguish for fall or
   no-fall was 0.55 m. These results support our hypothesis in slipping
   during turning.}},

Abstract = {{Fundamental studies and practical use of metal nanoparticles (NPs)
   frequently depend on the ability to reproducibly synthesize large
   quantities of shape-specific NPs. For this reason, facile synthetic
   procedures are desired that will lead to large quantities of uniformly
   sized metal NPs exhibiting specific shapes. Here, we report a general
   approach to the large-scale synthesis of noble metal nanocrystals having
   well-defined shapes and a narrow size distribution. This method utilizes
   seed-mediated NP growth in aqueous suspensions of cationic surfactants
   and metal salts. It leads to a similar to 60-fold increase in NP
   volumetric production capacity, compared to the most widely used
   solution-based synthetic methods. In addition, it uses up 100 times to
   less cationic surfactant than conventional solution-based methods. The
   applicability of the method is demonstrated in the synthesis of Pd
   nanocubes, rhombic dodecahedra, and polyhedrons with low index facets;
   branched Pd nanocrystals; alloy Pt/Pd nanocubes; Ag nanocubes. The
   advantages and limitations of the approach are discussed, including
   accessible shapes, growth kinetics, and the capability to scale up the
   synthetic procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) exist in heterogeneous
   micro-environments with multiple subpopulations, convoluting
   fate-regulation analysis. We patterned hPSCs into engineered
   micro-environments and screened responses to 400 small-molecule kinase
   inhibitors, measuring yield and purity outputs of undifferentiated,
   neuroectoderm, mesendoderm, and extra-embryonic populations. Enrichment
   analysis revealed mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition as a
   strong inducer of mesendoderm. Dose responses of mTOR inhibitors such as
   rapamycin synergized with Bone Morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and
   activin A to enhance the yield and purity of BRACHYURY-expressing cells.
   Mechanistically, small interfering RNA knockdown of RAPTOR, a component
   of mTOR complex 1, phenocopied the mesendoderm-enhancing effects of
   rapamycin. Functional analysis during mesoderm and endoderm
   differentiation revealed that mTOR inhibition increased the output of
   hemogenic endothelial cells 3-fold, witha concomitant enhancement of
   blood colony-forming cells. These data demonstrate the power of our
   multi-lineage screening approach and identify mTOR signaling as a node
   in hPSC differentiation to mesendoderm and its derivatives.}},

   fundamental mechanism in cardiovascular development as well as disease.
   Understanding its particular role in heart formation has helped to

   have been used to generate heart tissue for pharmaceutical testing, and
   to study physiological and disease states. Such protocols in combination
   with induced pluripotent stem cell technology have yielded
   patient-derived cardiomyocytes that exhibit some of the hallmarks of
   cardiovascular disease and are therefore being used to model disease
   states. While FDA approval of new treatments typically requires animal
   experiments, the burgeoning field of tissue engineering could act as a
   replacement. This would necessitate the generation of reproducible
   three-dimensional cardiac tissues in a well-controlled environment,
   which exhibit native heart properties, such as cellular density,
   composition, extracellular matrix composition, and structure-function.
   Such tissues could also enable the further study of Wnt signaling.
   Furthermore, as Wnt signaling has been found to have a mechanistic role
   in cardiac pathophysiology, e.g. heart attack, hypertrophy,
   atherosclerosis, and aortic stenosis, its strategic manipulation could
   provide a means of generating reproducible and specific, physiological
   and pathological cardiac models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{While different design codes provide similar guidance for the flexural
   design of prestressed thin-webbed continuous girders, the shear design
   provisions differ greatly. This paper investigates these discrepancies
   with the help of 11 experiments and a number of analytical studies.
   Together, these provide the basis for recommendations for engineers
   conducting the shear design for new girders or evaluating the shear
   capacity of existing girders. It is shown that the traditional ACI
   approach of taking V-c as the smaller of V-ci (flexural-shear cracking
   load) and V-cw (web-shear cracking load) can significantly overestimate
   the shear strength of such girders, particularly if they are highly
   prestressed and contain relatively small quantities of shear
   reinforcement. The other codes evaluated provided more conservative
   predictions. It is shown that the ACI predictions can be improved
   significantly by taking into account the effect of flexural stresses on
   web shear cracking. While the ACI Code uses different shear-strength
   equations for members subjected to external axial loads versus members
   subjected to internal prestressing forces, the studies summarized in
   this paper support the idea that unification of these ACI shear
   provisions is possible.}},

Abstract = {{A computational modeling procedure has been developed for better

   of reinforced concrete members. The effect of the models selected for
   the various temperature-dependent properties of concrete and steel
   reinforcement on the overall response of reinforced concrete members
   with various loading and fire scenarios was studied. For concrete
   materials, the temperature-dependent properties investigated and
   included the density, thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity,
   thermal expansion strain, peak compressive stress and the corresponding
   strain, initial modulus of elasticity, tensile strength, and the shape
   of the stress-strain curve. For steel reinforcing bars, they included
   the thermal expansion strain, yield stress, ultimate stress, and Young's
   modulus. In addition to the heat development phase, the cooling phase
   was also considered as a fire scenario, where the residual capacity of
   concrete columns subjected to fire was investigated.}},

Journal = {{ACI STRUCTURAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{491-501}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{To better understand the shear behavior of large footings under indirect
   loading, where the support reaction does not apply a concentrated
   compressive force to the top or bottom surface of the member, five
   indirectly loaded large footing specimens are tested under the combined
   action of uniform loads that simulate the soil pressure and indirectly
   applied point loads. Comparison of these test results to previously
   tested companion specimens, which were directly loaded, showed that the
   shear response of indirectly loaded specimens to test variables is
   similar to the response of their directly loaded companions; however,
   indirectly loaded footings consistently failed at lower shear stresses.
   For short footings, this difference in shear capacity is observed to be
   less than what is suggested by current codes. Experimental results have
   shown that there is a distinct strut action also under indirect loading,
   which provides adequate shear strength even for thick, indirectly loaded
   footings. A strut-and-tie model is suggested and shown to give
   reasonable shear-strength predictions of indirectly loaded short
   footings. However, analytical studies have shown that as the shear
   slenderness of indirect footings increase, shear-strength predictions of
   long indirectly loaded specimens may become unsafe because ACI design
   procedures do not account for the size effect in shear. It is suggested
   that ACI minimum shear reinforcement exemption for footings be limited
   to indirectly loaded footings with shear slenderness ratios less than
   2.5.}},

Abstract = {{MapReduce has become a popular model for large-scale data processing in
   recent years. Many works on MapReduce scheduling (e.g., load balancing
   and deadline-aware scheduling) have emphasized the importance of
   predicting workload received by individual reducers. However, because
   the input characteristics and user-specified map function of a given job
   are unknown to the MapReduce framework before the job starts, accurately
   predicting workload of reducers can be a difficult challenge. To address
   this challenge, we present ROUTE, a run-time robust reducer workload
   estimation technique for MapReduce. ROUTE progressively samples the
   partition size of the early completed mappers, allowing ROUTE to perform
   estimation at run time yet fulfilling the accuracy requirement specified
   by users. Moreover, by using robust estimation and bootstrapping
   resampling techniques, ROUTE can achieve high applicability to a wide
   variety of applications. Through experiments using both real and
   synthetic data on an 11-node Hadoop cluster, we show ROUTE can achieve
   high accuracy with error rate no more than 10.92\% and an improvement of
   40.6\% in terms of error rate while compared with the state-of-the-art
   solution. Besides, through simulations using synthetic data, we show
   that ROUTE is robust to a variety of skewed distributions. Finally, we
   apply ROUTE to existing load balancing and deadline-aware scheduling
   frameworks and show ROUTE significantly improves the performance of
   these frameworks. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Cell microencapsulation and subsequent transplantation of the
   microencapsulated cells require multidisciplinary approaches. Physical,
   chemical, biological, engineering, and medical expertise has to be
   combined. Several natural and synthetic polymeric materials and
   different technologies have been reported for the preparation of
   hydrogels, which are suitable to protect cells by microencapsulation.
   However, owing to the frequent lack of adequate characterization of the
   hydrogels and their components as well as incomplete description of the
   technology, many results of in vitro and in vivo studies appear
   contradictory or cannot reliably be reproduced. This review addresses
   the state of the art in cell microencapsulation with special focus on
   microencapsulated cells intended for xenotransplantation cell therapies.
   The choice of materials, the design and fabrication of the microspheres,
   as well as the conditions to be met during the cell microencapsulation
   process, are summarized and discussed prior to presenting research
   results of in vitro and in vivo studies. Overall, this review will serve
   to sensitize medically educated specialists for materials and
   technological aspects of cell microencapsulation.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon sequestration in deep underground saline aquifers holds
   significant promise for reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions
   (CO2). However, challenges remain in predicting the long term migration
   of injected CO2. Addressing these challenges requires an understanding
   of pore-scale transport of CO2 within existing brine-filled geological
   reservoirs. Studies on the transport of fluids through geological porous
   media have predominantly focused on oil-bearing formations such as
   sandstone. However, few studies have considered pore-scale transport
   within limestone and other carbonate formations, which are found in
   potential storage sites. In this work, high-resolution micro-Computed
   Tomography (microCT) was used to obtain pore-scale structural
   information of two model carbonates: Indiana Limestone and Pink
   Dolomite. A modified watershed algorithm was applied to extract pore
   network from the reconstructed microCT volumetric images of rock samples
   and compile a list of pore-scale characteristics from the extracted
   networks. These include statistical distributions of pore size and
   radius, pore-pore separation, throat radius, and network coordination.
   Finally, invasion percolation algorithms were applied to determine
   saturation-pressure curves for the rock samples. The statistical
   distributions were comparable to literature values for the Indiana
   Limestone. This served as validation for the network extraction approach
   for Pink Dolomite, which has not been considered previously. Based on
   the connectivity and the pore-pore separation, formations such as Pink
   Dolomite may present suitable storage sites for carbon storage. The pore
   structural distributions and saturation curves obtained in this study
   can be used to inform core-and reservoir-scale modeling and experimental
   studies of sequestration feasibility.}},

   eliminates the need for protein encapsulation in PLGA nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Encapsulation of therapeutic molecules within polymer particles is a
   well-established method for achieving controlled release, yet challenges
   such as low loading, poor encapsulation efficiency, and loss of protein
   activity limit clinical translation. Despite this, the paradigm for the
   use of polymer particles in drug delivery has remained essentially
   unchanged for several decades. By taking advantage of the adsorption of
   protein therapeutics to poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)
   nanoparticles, we demonstrate controlled release without encapsulation.
   In fact, we obtain identical, burst-free, extended-release profiles for
   three different protein therapeutics with and without encapsulation in
   PLGA nanoparticles embedded within a hydrogel. Using both positively and
   negatively charged proteins, we show that short-range electrostatic
   interactions between the proteins and the PLGA nanoparticles are the
   underlying mechanism for controlled release. Moreover, we demonstrate
   tunable release by modifying nanoparticle concentration, nanoparticle
   size, or environmental pH. These new insights obviate the need for
   encapsulation and offer promising, translatable strategies for a more
   effective delivery of therapeutic biomolecules.}},

Abstract = {{Protective footwear is necessary for preventing injurious slips and

   resistance on winter surfaces are needed in order to evaluate footwear
   and outsole designs. The purpose of this study was to utilise a method
   of testing winter footwear that was ecologically valid in terms of
   involving actual human testers walking on realistic winter surfaces to
   produce objective measures of slip resistance. During the experiment,
   eight participants tested six styles of footwear on wet ice, on dry ice,
   and on dry ice after walking over soft snow. Slip resistance was
   measured by determining the maximum incline angles participants were
   able to walk up and down in each footwear surface combination. The
   results indicated that testing on a variety of surfaces is necessary for
   establishing winter footwear performance and that standard mechanical
   bench tests for footwear slip resistance do not adequately reflect
   actual performance.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the optimal relay beamforming problem for multi-user
   peer-to-peer communication with amplify-and-forward relaying in a
   multi-channel system. Assuming each source-destination (S-D) pair is
   assigned an orthogonal channel, we formulate the problem as a min-max
   per-relay power minimization problem with minimum signal-to-noise (SNR)
   guarantees. After showing that strong Lagrange duality holds for this
   nonconvex problem, we transform its Lagrange dual problem to a
   semi-definite programming problem and obtain the optimal relay
   beamforming vectors. We identify that the optimal solution can be
   obtained in three cases, depending on the values of the optimal dual
   variables. These cases correspond to whether the minimum SNR requirement
   at each S-D pair is met with equality, and whether the power consumption
   at a relay is the maximum among relays at optimality. We obtain a
   semi-closed form solution structure of relay beam vectors, and propose
   an iterative approach to determine relay beam vector for each S-D pair.
   We further show that the reverse problem of maximizing the minimum SNR
   with per-relay power budgets can be solved using our proposed algorithm
   with an iterative bisection search. Through simulation, we analyze the
   effect of various system parameters on the performance of the optimal
   solution. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of imperfect channel
   side information of the second hop on the performance and quantify the
   performance loss due to either channel estimation error or limited
   feedback.}},

Title = {{Knowledge synthesis research: a bibliometric analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{50-57}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this article is to describe the volume and
   attributes of original research available in PubMed on emerging
   knowledge synthesis methods (excluding traditional systematic reviews)
   published by researchers.
   Study Design and Setting: Bibliometric analysis.
   Results: Six-hundred eight studies related to the topic of knowledge
   synthesis methods were analyzed. Although there has been a steady
   increase in publications on knowledge synthesis methods since 2003,
   studies are dispersed among a large number of journals. Similarly, a
   large number of authors are publishing on these methods but in limited
   numbers for any individual. Relevant Medical Subject Headings that were
   applied most often to these studies included qualitative research,
   research design, meta-analysis as topic, and review literature as topic.
   Conclusion: There is no prevailing journal or author that is a leader in
   reporting on knowledge synthesis methods. Relevant Medical Subject
   Headings were either not applied to most records or not available for
   the synthesis method being examined. This may lend itself to
   inconsistencies and variations in methods making it challenging for
   researchers and research users to locate and appraise these articles.

Title = {{Performance of an Underground Stormwater Detention Chamber and
   Comparison with Stormwater Management Ponds}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The transportation of pollutants from impervious surfaces during runoff
   events to receiving water bodies is a serious environmental problem.
   Summer runoff is also heated by impervious surfaces, causing thermal
   enrichment in receiving water body systems and degradation of coldwater
   aquatic ecosystems. End-of-pipe stormwater management facilities that
   are open to the environment can result in further elevated temperatures
   due to exposure to solar radiation. Receiving water systems that provide
   coldwater habitat require cool water temperatures to sustain healthy
   conditions for cold water flora and fauna (e.g., trout, dace).
   Underground Stormwater Detention Chambers (USDC) are a technology for
   the detention and treatment of stormwater runoff that can potentially
   solve the thermal issues associated with sun-exposed detention
   facilities while still providing an equivalent level of treatment
   services for stormwater pollutants. A field study of an USDC located in
   Southern Ontario was undertaken to characterize its treatment
   performance and effect on water temperature. The results were: the USDC
   was found to provide similar levels of stormwater treatment as wet
   detention ponds. On average, outlet maximum temperatures were 5 degrees
   C cooler than inlet maximum temperatures, and outlet water temperatures
   remained within the thermal regime for coldwater fish habitat throughout
   the evaluation period. There was little to no stratification of
   temperature, nor dissolved solids, but stratification of dissolved
   oxygen was observed mid-winter and into the spring.}},

Abstract = {{The rise of the cloud and distributed data-intensive (big data)
   applications puts pressure on data center networks due to the movement
   of massive volumes of data. Reducing the volume of communication is
   pivotal for embracing greener data exchange by efficient utilization of
   network resources. This paper proposes the use of mixing technique,
   spate coding, working in tandem with software-defined network control as
   a means of dynamically-controlled reduction in volume of communication.
   We introduce motivating real-world use-cases, and present a novel spate
   coding algorithm for the data center networks. We also analyze the
   computational complexity of the general problem of minimizing the volume
   of communication in a distributed data center application without
   degrading the rate of information exchange, and provide theoretical
   limits of such schemes. Moreover, we proceed to bridge the gap between
   theory and practice by performing a proof-of-concept implementation of
   the proposed system in a real world data center. We use Hadoop
   MapReduce, the most widely used big data processing framework, as our
   target. The experimental results employing two of industry standard
   benchmarks show the advantage of our proposed system compared to a
   vanilla Hadoop implementation, an in-network combiner, and
   Combine-N-Code. The proposed coding-based scheme shows performance
   improvement in terms of volume of communication (up to 62\%), goodput
   (up to 76\%), disk utilization (up to 38\%), and the number of bits that
   can be transmitted per Joule of energy (up to 200\%).}},

Title = {{Two touching spherical drops in a uniaxial compressional flow: The
   effect of interfacial slip}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This study presents a semi-analytical solution for the problem of two
   touching drops with slipping interfaces pushed against each other in a
   uniaxial compressional flow at low capillary and Reynolds numbers. The
   jump in the tangential velocity at the liquid-liquid interface is
   modeled using the Navier slip condition. Analytical solutions of the
   contact force, the drop-scale stresses, and the drop-scale pressure are
   provided as functions of the slip coefficient (alpha), the viscosity
   ratio (kappa), and the drop size ratio (k). Since unequal drop sizes are
   considered, two problems are solved in the tangent sphere co-ordinate
   system to determine the steady state position: a pair of touching drops
   with its contact point at the origin of an axisymmetric straining flow,
   and two touching drops placed in a uniform flow parallel to the axis of
   symmetry of the drops. A general observation is that the effect of slip
   is manifested most strongly for drops whose viscosity is much greater
   than the suspending fluid (kappa >> 1). For highly viscous drops, the
   flow and stress fields transition from those corresponding to solid
   particles for alpha kappa << 1, to those for inviscid drops in the limit
   alpha kappa >> 1. The analytical expressions provided here for the
   contact force and the stress distributions will serve to provide the
   restrictions that complete the definition of the lubrication flow
   problem in the thin film between the two colliding drops. While the
   contact force that drains fluid out of the thin film is relatively
   unaffected by slip, the tangential stress and pressure in the
   near-contact region are mitigated significantly for alpha kappa >> 1.
   The latter is expected to assist coalescence at high capillary numbers.

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the gapped-inclined brace system (GIB) has been developed as
   an effective retrofitting solution for soft-story buildings. This paper
   presents a cost-benefit study of a building retrofitted using the GIB
   system. A six-story, reinforced concrete (RC) frame with an open story
   at the ground level and masonry infills on all other floors is studied.
   To investigate the effectiveness of alternate retrofit configurations,
   different scenarios of GIB systems are numerically analyzed, expected
   repair costs for various levels of seismic intensity are computed, and
   cost benefit values are compared to each other and to those obtained
   when the building is strengthened and stiffened at the ground floor
   using conventional methods. Results show that GIB retrofit solutions are
   likely to represent significant cost benefits compared to traditional
   retrofit solutions. The results also indicate that GIBs do not need to
   be positioned at all column locations of the soft story, which could be
   beneficial in reducing the overall retrofit cost and improving
   architectural functionality of the retrofitted structure.}},

Journal = {{NATURE REVIEWS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Targeting nanoparticles to malignant tissues for improved diagnosis and
   therapy is a popular concept. However, after surveying the literature
   from the past 10 years, only 0.7\% (median) of the administered
   nanoparticle dose is found to be delivered to a solid tumour. This has
   negative consequences on the translation of nanotechnology for human use
   with respect to manufacturing, cost, toxicity, and imaging and
   therapeutic efficacy. In this article, we conduct a multivariate
   analysis on the compiled data to reveal the contributions of
   nanoparticle physicochemical parameters, tumour models and cancer types
   on the low delivery efficiency. We explore the potential causes of the
   poor delivery efficiency from the perspectives of tumour biology
   (intercellular versus transcellular transport, enhanced permeability and
   retention effect, and physicochemical-dependent nanoparticle transport
   through the tumour stroma) as well as competing organs (mononuclear
   phagocytic and renal systems) and present a 30-year research strategy to
   overcome this fundamental limitation. Solving the nanoparticle delivery
   problem will accelerate the clinical translation of nanomedicine.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue and functional repair after spinal cord injury (SCI) continue to
   elude researchers. Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and anti-NogoA have been shown
   to promote axonal regeneration in animal models of SCI; however,
   localized and sustained delivery to the central nervous system (CNS)
   remains a critical challenge for these and other macromolecular
   therapeutics. An injectable drug delivery system (DDS) has previously
   been developed, which can provide safe local delivery to the spinal
   cord. This DDS, composed of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)
   nanoparticles (nps) dispersed in a hyaluronan methylcellulose hydrogel,
   was adapted for the tunable bioactive delivery of NT-3 and anti-NogoA.
   Furthermore, the combined delivery of NT-3 and anti-NogoA from the DDS
   in an impact/compression model of SCI increases axon density and
   improves locomotor function. The benefits of this np/hydrogel DDS
   observed for NT-3 and anti-NogoA demonstrate the utility of the DDS as a
   local delivery strategy for protein therapeutics to the CNS.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the variability in near-road concentrations of
   ultra-fine particles (UFP). Our results are based on a mobile data
   collection campaign conducted in 2012 in Montreal, Canada using
   instrumented bicycles and covering approximately 475 km of unique
   roadways. The spatial extent of the data collected included a diverse
   array of roads and land use patterns. Average concentrations of UFP per
   roadway segment varied greatly across the study area (1411-192,340
   particles/cm(3)) as well as across the different visits to the same
   segment. Mixed effects linear regression models were estimated for UFP
   (R-2 = 43.80\%), incorporating a wide range of predictors including
   land-use, built environment, road characteristics, and meteorology.
   Temperature and wind speed had a large negative effect on near-road
   concentrations of UFP. Both the day of the week and time of day had a
   significant effect with Tuesdays and afternoon periods positively
   associated with UFP. Since UFP are largely associated with traffic
   emissions and considering the wide spatial extent of our data collection
   campaign, it was impossible to collect traffic volume data. For this
   purpose, we used simulated data for traffic volumes and speeds across
   the region and observed a positive effect for volumes and negative
   effect for speed. Finally, proximity to truck routes was also associated
   with higher UFP concentrations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A 0.13 mu m CMOS system on a chip (SoC) for 64 channel neuroelectrical
   monitoring and responsive neurostimulation is presented. The
   direct-coupled chopper-stabilized neural recording front end rejects up
   to similar to 50 mV input dc offset using an in-channel digitally
   assisted feedback loop. It yields a compact 0.018 mm(2) integration area
   and 4.2 mu Vrms integrated inputreferred noise over 1 Hz to 1 kHz
   frequency range. A multiplying specific absorption rate (SAR) ADC in
   each channel calibrates channel-to-channel gain mismatch. A multicore
   low-power DSP performs synchrony-based neurological event detection and
   triggers a subset of 64 programmable current-mode stimulators for
   subsequent neuromodulation. Triple-band FSK/ultra-wideband (UWB)
   wireless transmitters communicate to receivers located at 10 cm to 10 m
   distance from the SoC with data rates from 1.2 to 45 Mbps. An inductive
   link that operates at 1.5 MHz, provides power and is also used to
   communicate commands to an on-chip ASK receiver. The chip occupies 16
   mm2 while consuming 2.17 and 5.8 mW with UWB and FSK transmitters,
   respectively. Efficacy of the SoC is assessed using a rat model of
   temporal lobe epilepsy characterized by spontaneous seizures. It
   exhibits an average seizure detection sensitivity and specificity of
   87\% and 95\%, respectively, with over 78\% of all seizures aborted.}},

Abstract = {{The role of tissue architecture in mediating nanoparticle transport,
   targeting, and biological effects is unknown due to the lack of tools
   for imaging nanomaterials in whole organs. Here, we developed a rapid
   optical mapping technique to image nanomaterials in intact organs ex
   vivo and in three-dimensions (3D). We engineered a high-throughput
   electrophoretic flow device to simultaneously transform up to 48 tissues
   into optically transparent structures, allowing sub cellular imaging of
   nanomaterials more than 1 nun deep into tissues which is 25-fold greater
   than current techniques. A key finding is that nanomaterials can be
   retained in the processed tissue by chemical cross-linking of surface
   adsorbed serum proteins to the tissue matrix, which enables
   nanomaterials to be imaged with respect to cells, blood vessels, and
   other structures. We developed a computational algorithm to analyze and
   quantitatively map nanomaterial distribution. This method can be
   universally applied to visualize the distribution and interactions of
   materials in whole tissues and animals including such applications as
   the imaging of nanomaterials, tissue engineered constructs, and
   biosensors within their intact biological environment.}},

Title = {{Spatial Separation of Charge Carriers in In2O3-x(OH)(y) Nanocrystal
   Superstructures for Enhanced Gas-Phase Photocatalytic Activity}},

Abstract = {{The development of strategies for increasing the lifetime of
   photoexcited charge carriers in nanostructured metal oxide
   semiconductors is important for enhancing their photocatalytic activity.
   Intensive efforts have been made in tailoring the properties of the
   nanostructured photo catalysts through different ways, mainly including
   band-structure engineering, doping, catalyst support interaction, and
   loading cocatalysts. In liquid-phase photo catalytic dye degradation and
   water splitting, it was recently found that nanocrystal superstructure
   based semiconductors exhibited improved spatial separation of photo
   excited charge carriers and enhanced photocatalytic performance.
   Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether this strategy is applicable in
   gas-phase photocatalysis. Using porous indium oxide nanorods in
   catalyzing the reverse water gas shift reaction as a model system, we
   demonstrate here that assembling semiconductor nanocrystals into
   superstructures can also promote gas-phase photocatalytic processes.
   Transient absorption studies prove that the improved activity is a
   result of prolonged photoexcited charge carrier lifetimes due to the
   charge transfer within the nanocrystal network comprising the nanorods.
   Our study reveals that the spatial charge separation within the
   nanocrystal networks could also benefit gas-phase photocatalysis and
   sheds light on the design principles of efficient nanocrystal
   superstructure based photocatalysts.}},

Abstract = {{A novel high-pressure (water pump pressure up to 250 MPa) abrasive
   slurry micro-machining (HASJM) system was introduced. By feeding a
   premixed slurry into the mixing chamber of a water jet machine with a
   micro-nozzle (mixing tube diameter of 254 mu m), premature erosion of
   system components was avoided. An optimum erosion rate of 2.7 mg/g was
   reached when machining Al6061-T6 with a slurry of 25 mu m aluminum oxide
   particles under conditions (slurry flow rate=200 g/min and water pump
   pressure=235 MPa) near to those which theoretically maximized momentum
   transfer between the inlet slurry and the water jet entering the mixing
   chamber from the orifice. It was found that when the standoff distance
   increased tenfold, the erosion rate almost doubled in glass, but
   decreased by 50\% in Al6061-T6, due to differences in the erosion at the
   jet periphery for the two materials. For aspect ratios greater than 0.9,
   high-quality symmetric channels with a centerline waviness below 6.9 mu
   m and a centerline roughness below 1.1 mu m could be produced using a
   single pass at a low traverse velocity of 40 mm/min. The use of multiple
   machining passes at a relatively high traverse speed (similar to 1000
   mm/min) was found to produce asymmetric channels when the aspect ratio
   was greater than 0.9, owing to jet deflection from steps formed on the
   cutting front. Channels produced by micro-milling Al6061-T6 and glass
   had a 50\% lower centerline waviness and 16 \% lower centerline
   roughness than those made with the conventional abrasive water jet in
   which air and abrasive entered the mixing chamber.}},

Title = {{A lateral signalling pathway coordinates shape volatility during cell
   migration}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Cell migration is fundamental for both physiological and pathological
   processes. Migrating cells usually display high dynamics in morphology,
   which is orchestrated by an integrative array of signalling pathways.
   Here we identify a novel pathway, we term lateral signalling, comprised
   of the planar cell polarity (PCP) protein Pk1 and the RhoGAPs,
   Arhgap21/23. We show that the Pk1-Arhgap21/23 complex inhibits RhoA, is
   localized on the non-protrusive lateral membrane cortex and its
   disruption leads to the disorganization of the actomyosin network and
   altered focal adhesion dynamics. Pk1-mediated lateral signalling
   confines protrusive activity and is regulated by Smurf2, an E3 ubiquitin
   ligase in the PCP pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dynamic
   interplay between lateral and protrusive signalling generates cyclical
   fluctuations in cell shape that we quantify here as shape volatility,
   which strongly correlates with migration speed. These studies uncover a
   previously unrecognized lateral signalling pathway that coordinates
   shape volatility during productive cell migration.}},

   anti-cancer properties. The radiosensitization effects of PEG-stabilized
   AuNPs (PEG-AuNPs) in combination with pentamidine were evaluated in two
   human TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436). Our results showed
   that PEG-AuNPs alone sensitized both cell lines to radiation, achieving
   dose enhancement factors of 1.26 and 1.15 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436,
   respectively. In combination with pentamidine, the greatest dose
   enhancement was achieved in MDA-MB-231 after 24 h of treatment with 500
   mu M PEG-AuNPs and 20 mu M pentamidine (dose enhancement factor of
   1.55). Based on the in vitro data, it is projected that this combination
   would result in a 10 log increase in cell kill compared to radiation
   alone in a clinical setting, where 50 Gy is administered to breast
   cancer patients in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. Studies to elucidate the
   underlying mechanism of radiosensitization revealed that the adsorption
   of pentamidine onto the PEG-AuNP surface increased the cellular uptake
   of gold compared to PEG-AuNPs alone. In addition, the combination
   resulted in a significantly greater number of residual DNA double-strand
   breaks compared to that of either agent alone after a 2 Gy dose. Taken
   together, the dual action of pentamidine on the physical and biological
   pathways of radiosensitization by PEG-AuNPs results in superior
   radiotherapeutic effects of the combined treatment group in MDA-MB-231.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an investigation into the preference structure of
   commuting mode choice in dense urban areas. The paper aims to
   investigate the phenomenon of myopic choice and extends the phenomenon
   to the concept of modal culture. Using a household travel diary survey
   from the greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, an empirical discrete choice
   model was estimated. This model was used to provide general comments on
   the commuting and dependent behaviour of the sample, with a particular
   focus on the factors that influence bicycling captivation and culture.
   The model was then used for a hypothetical policy scenario analysis,
   which found that an investment in biking infrastructure had the capacity
   to increase bicycling mode share by nearly 50\%. Based on this result,
   this paper recommends further investigation into both data collection
   for more comprehensive empirical model development and investigation
   into the policy applicability of the proposed model structure.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel reconfigurable digital optical metasurface to
   dynamically control the wavefront of reflected near-infrared (NIR) light
   at a subwavelength scale. Whereas reconfigurable metasurfaces have been
   previously demonstrated with complex active elements in the microwave
   regime (such as biased diodes or transistors), we hereby utilize
   vanadium dioxide to attain reconfigurability in the optical regime. In
   contrast to traditional passive metasurfaces, in which local reflection
   phases are required to cover the full range of 360 degrees to
   arbitrarily engineer the wavefronts, our tunable digital metasurface
   utilizes either 0 degrees or 180 degrees. We design a unit cell with
   vanadium dioxide such that its normalized local reflection coefficient
   switches from -1 to +1 upon change in the state of the vanadium dioxide.
   Hence, we realize a surface for which various digital patterns of either
   -1 or +1 can be arbitrarily programmed. Based on the theory of binary
   holography, we numerically demonstrate the dynamic control of a NIR
   wavefront by programming the proposed digital optical metasurface as a
   reconfigurable beam splitter and as a scannable optical reflectarray.

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the hydroxyl radical scavenging characteristics of
   wastewater from five membrane bioreactor (MBR) and five activated sludge
   (AS) systems. The average values of the characteristics of both
   wastewater types was found to be significantly different at a 90\%
   confidence interval in terms UV absorbance at 254 nm, alkalinity, and
   biopolymer concentration. Effluent organic matter (EfOM), with an
   average k(OH,EfOM) of (2.75 +/- 1.04) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1), was identified
   as the primary hydroxyl scavenger contributing to >70\% of the
   background scavenging in all cases, except when nitrite exceeded 0.3 mg
   NO2--N/L. The average scavenging capacity, EfOM scavenging capacity, and
   the EfOM reaction rate constant of the AS wastewaters exceeded that of
   the MBR. However, due to the small sample size (n = 5) and considerable
   variability in scavenging characteristics among the MBR wastewaters, the
   difference in EfOM reactivity between the two wastewaters was not
   statistically significant at a 90\% confidence interval. Nevertheless,
   these preliminary findings suggest the possibility that MBR wastewaters
   may be more amenable to treatment by advanced oxidation. A plausible
   explanation is that MBRs were observed to reject biopolymers, and a
   strong correlation was observed between EfOM scavenging capacity and
   biopolymer concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Polyester biomaterials are used in tissue engineering as scaffolds for
   implantation of tissues developed in vitro. An ideal biodegradable
   elastomer for cardiac tissue engineering exhibits a relatively low
   Young's modulus, with high elongation and tensile strength. Here we
   describe a novel polyester biomaterial that exhibits improved elastic
   properties for cardiac tissue engineering applications. We synthesized
   poly(octamethylene maleate (anhydride) 1,2,4-butanetricarboxylate) (124
   polymer) prepolymer gel in a one-step polycondensation reaction. The
   prepolymer was then molded as desired and exposed to ultraviolet (UV)
   light to produce a cross-linked elastomer. 124 polymer exhibited highly
   elastic properties under aqueous conditions that were tunable according
   to the UV light exposure, monomer composition, and porosity of the cured
   elastomer. Its elastomeric properties fell within the range of adult
   heart myocardium, but they could also be optimized for higher elasticity
   for weaker immature constructs. The polymer showed relatively stable
   degradation characteristics, both hydrolytically and in a cellular
   environment, suggesting maintenance of material properties as a scaffold
   support for potential tissue implants. When assessed for cell
   interaction, this polymer supported rat cardiac cell attachment in vitro
   as well as comparable acute in vivo host response when compared to
   poly(L-lactic acid) control. This suggests the potential applicability
   of this material as an elastomer for cardiac tissue engineered

Title = {{RGD and BMP-2 mimetic peptide crosstalk enhances osteogenic commitment
   of human bone marrow stem cells}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{132-142}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) commitment and
   differentiation are dictated by bioactive molecules sequestered within
   their Extra Cellular Matrix (ECM). One common approach to mimic the
   physiological environment is to functionalize biomaterial surfaces with
   ECM-derived peptides able to recruit stem cells and trigger their
   linage-specific differentiation. The objective of this work was to
   investigate the effect of RGD and BMP-2 ligands crosstalk and density on
   the extent of hBMSCs osteogenic commitment, without recourse to
   differentiation medium. RGD peptide promotes cell adhesion via cell
   transmembrane integrin receptors, while BMP-2 peptide, corresponding to
   residues 73-92 of Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2, was shown to induce
   hBMSCs osteoblast differentiation. The immobilization of peptides on
   aminated glass was ascertained by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
   (XPS), the density of grafted peptides was quantified by fluorescence
   microscopy and the surface roughness was evaluated using Atomic Force
   Microscopy (AFM). The osteogenic commitment of hBMSCs cultured on RGD
   and/or BMP-2 surfaces was characterized by immunohistochemistry using
   STRO-1 as specific stem cells marker and Runx-2 as an earlier osteogenic
   marker. Biological results showed that the osteogenic commitment of
   hBMSCs was enhanced on bifunctionalized surfaces as compared to surfaces
   containing BMP-2, while on RGD surfaces cells mainly preserved their
   sternness character. These results demonstrated that RGD and BMP-2
   mimetic peptides act synergistically to enhance hBMSCs osteogenesis
   without supplementing the media with osteogenic factors. These findings
   contribute to the development of biomimetic materials, allowing a deeper
   understanding of signaling pathways that govern the transition of stem
   cells towards the osteoblastic lineage.
   Statement of Significance
   For a long time, scientists thought that the differentiation of
   Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) into bone cells was dictated by growth
   factors. This manuscript shed light on other ligands that play a crucial
   role in regulating MSCs fate. In concrete terms, it was demonstrated
   that the osteoinductive effect of BMP-2 peptide is 2 folds improved in
   the presence of adhesive RGD peptide. Compared to previous works
   highlighting this synergistic cooperation between RGD and BMP-2
   peptides, the main strength of this work lies to the use of primitive
   human cells (hMSCs) and well-defined biomimetic material surfaces
   (controlled surface roughness and peptide densities). This work provides
   valuable insights to develop custom-designed in vitro cell culture
   models, capable of targeting the desired cell response. (C) 2016 Acta

   600}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{55-68}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Internal oxidation in Alloy 600 (Ni-16Cr-9Fe) involves the inward
   diffusion of O, which preferentially reacts with solute elements (e.g.
   Cr, Fe) forming internal oxide precipitates. In this work, the internal
   oxidation process and its resultant metal-oxide heterostructures are
   systematically analyzed in 3D at the finest length scales, using atom
   probe tomography (APT). Internal oxidation is induced by exposure of
   Alloy 600 to 480 degrees C hydrogenated steam, with an oxygen partial
   pressure below the dissociation pressure of the solvent metal oxide,
   NiO. Following exposure, nodules of metallic Ni are observed on the
   sample surface, originating from material that is expelled to relieve
   compressive stresses generated by internal oxidation. Probing the
   material immediately below the surface reveals these nodules to be
   directly connected to their parent grains via Ni-rich metal channels.
   The matrix metal is intertwined with a continuous network of oxides,
   which are primarily FeCr2O4. The continuous interface between oxides and
   matrix provides the short-circuit diffusion pathways necessary for Ni
   expulsion. Deeper below the surface, oxides are observed as particles,
   rather than a continuous network, and are often aligned on matrix
   planes. The small oxide particles are Cr2O3, which is also found to be
   the composition at the centres of many larger FeCr2O4 oxides. This
   indicates that oxides first precipitate as Cr2O3, then later grow as
   FeCr2O4 when local depletion of Cr changes which phase is most
   energetically-favourable. Initial comparisons indicate that some
   fundamental findings in this work are applicable to known internal
   oxidation systems at lower and higher temperatures. (C) 2016 Acta

Title = {{An examination of population exposure to traffic related air pollution:
   Comparing spatially and temporally resolved estimates against long-term

Abstract = {{Air pollution in metropolitan areas is mainly caused by traffic
   emissions. This study presents the development of a model chain
   consisting of a transportation model, an emissions model, and
   atmospheric dispersion model, applied to dynamically evaluate
   individuals' exposure to air pollution by intersecting daily
   trajectories of individuals and hourly spatial variations of air
   pollution across the study domain. This dynamic approach is implemented
   in Montreal, Canada to highlight the advantages of the method for
   exposure analysis. The results for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a marker of
   traffic related air pollution, reveal significant differences when
   relying on spatially and temporally resolved concentrations combined
   with individuals' daily trajectories compared to a long-term average NO2
   concentration at the home location. We observe that NO2 exposures based
   on trips and activity locations visited throughout the day were often
   more elevated than daily NO2 concentrations at the home location. The
   percentage of all individuals with a lower 24-hour daily average at home
   compared to their 24-hour mobility exposure is 89.6\%, of which 31\% of
   individuals increase their exposure by more than 10\% by leaving the
   home. On average, individuals increased their exposure by 23-44\% while
   commuting and conducting activities out of home (compared to the daily
   concentration at home), regardless of air quality at their home
   location. We conclude that our proposed dynamic modelling approach
   significantly improves the results of traditional methods that rely on a
   long-term average concentration at the home location and we shed light
   on the importance of using individual daily trajectories to understand
   exposure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, various techniques have been applied to modeling
   radio-wave propagation in railway networks, each one presenting its own
   advantages and limitations. This paper presents a hybrid channel
   modeling technique, which combines two of these methods, the ray-tracing

   of realistic railway scenarios including stations and long guideways
   within a unified simulation framework. The general-purpose RT method is
   applied to analyze propagation in complex areas, whereas the VPE method
   is reserved for long and uniform tunnel as well as open-air sections. By
   using the advantages of VPE to compensate for the limitations of RT and
   vice versa, this hybrid model ensures improved accuracy and
   computational savings. Numerical results are validated with experimental
   measurements in various railway scenarios, including an actual
   deployment site of communication-based train control (CBTC) systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses contemporary design procedures for fillet welds to
   hollow structural sections (HSS) in several prominent design codes. The
   structural reliability associated with the directional
   strength-enhancement factor contained in North American Specifications
   is examined, based on a set of laboratory tests on fillet-welded
   connections between HSS and rigid end-plates. A total of 33 connections,
   in which the welds had been designed to be the critical elements, were
   tested to failure by axial tension loading applied to the HSS members.
   The experimentally obtained weld strengths were compared to the
   predicted nominal strengths. The directional strength-enhancement factor
   was found to lead to unsafe strength predictions, particularly for large
   weld sizes. Hence, a restriction on the use of this factor for fillet
   welds to HSS members, in North American steel design specifications,
   needs to be considered. The analysis also shows that Eurocode 3 fillet
   weld design provisions give conservative strength predictions. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Predicting the rate at which dislocations overcome obstacles is key to
   understanding the microscopic features that govern the plastic flow of
   modern alloys. In this spirit, the current manuscript examines the rate
   at which an edge dislocation overcomes an obstacle in aluminum.
   Predictions were made using different popular variants of Harmonic
   Transition State Theory (HTST) and compared to those of direct Molecular
   Dynamics (MD) simulations. The HTST predictions were found to be grossly
   inaccurate due to the large entropy barrier associated with the
   dislocation-obstacle interaction. Considering the importance of finite
   temperature effects, the utility of the Finite Temperature String (FTS)
   method was then explored. While this approach was found capable of
   identifying a prominent reaction tube, it was not capable of computing
   the free energy profile along the tube. Lastly, the utility of the
   Transition Interface Sampling (TIS) approach was explored, which does
   not need a free energy profile and is known to be less reliant on the
   choice of reaction coordinate. The TIS approach was found capable of
   accurately predicting the rate, relative to direct MD simulations. This
   finding was utilized to examine the temperature and load dependence of
   the dislocation-obstacle interaction in a simple periodic cell
   configuration. An attractive rate prediction approach combining TST and
   simple continuum models is identified, and the strain rate sensitivity
   of individual dislocation obstacle interactions is predicted. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Modular tissue engineering is a strategy to create scalable,
   self-assembling, three-dimensional (3D) tissue constructs. This strategy
   was used to deliver endothelial-like cells derived from bone marrow
   mesenchymal stromal cells (EL-MSCs) to locally induce vascularization.
   First, tissue engineered modules were formed, comprising EL-MSCs and
   collagen-based cylinders. Seven days of module culture in a microfluidic
   chamber under continuous flow resulted in the formation of interstices,
   formed by random packing of the modules, which served as channels and
   were lined by the EL-MSCs. We observed maintenance of the endothelial
   phenotype of the EL-MSCs, as demonstrated by CD31 staining, and the
   cells proliferated well. Next, collagen modules covered with EL-MSCs,
   with or without embedded MSCs, were implanted subcutaneously in
   immune-compromised SCID/Bg mice. After 7 days, CD31-positive vessels
   were observed in the samples. These data demonstrate the feasibility of
   EL-MSCs coated collagen module as a strategy to locally stimulate
   angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{A new model for condensation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
   on the surface of soot particles is developed based on the reversibility
   of the process. Statistical mechanics has been integrated with a novel
   PAH condensation concept to estimate the PAH evaporation rate. This
   estimation has been used to develop a condensation efficiency model
   which is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and relies on
   physical parameters which can be evaluated. The new condensation model,
   combined with a reversible nucleation model (Eaves et al., 2015), is
   validated for predicting soot formation in both premixed and nonpremixed
   flames. The validations are followed by an extensive sensitivity
   analysis to evaluate the role of dominant soot processes as well as PAH
   chemistry on soot formation and particle size distribution (PSD).
   Simulations include a set of burner stabilized stagnation premixed
   flames and a coflow ethylene/air diffusion flame. This work is the first
   study which successfully utilizes a single soot model to quantitatively
   predict soot formation in both flame configurations. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{A facile method to combine Keggin polyoxometalates (POMs) e.g.
   PMo12O403- (PMo12) and PW12O403- (PW12) in aqueous solutions has led to
   a unique electrochemical phenomenon, in which the POM mixtures
   demonstrate their own tunable redox activity, far different from the
   pure components. Through electrochemical and NMR analyses we have
   confirmed that this interesting behaviour arises from the spontaneous
   hydrolysis and recombination of PMo12 and PW12 ions forming complex
   blends of PMo12-xWx mixed addenda chemistries. While this process occurs
   spontaneously for the PMo12-PW12 system due to the ready hydrolysis, it
   can be induced in other POM mixtures such as SiMo12-SiW12 by adjusting
   the pH to stimulate hydrolysis. The highly tunable redox properties of
   the mixtures can be leveraged to design molecular coatings for a variety
   of applications. When deposited on nanocarbon, the overlapping redox
   features of the POM mixtures result in cyclic voltammograms with
   substantial pseudocapacitive currents which maintain relatively smooth
   charge/discharge profiles, ideal for supercapacitor electrodes. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Many video streaming applications operate their geo-distributed services
   in the cloud, taking advantage of superior connectivities between
   datacenters to push content closer to users or to relay live video
   traffic between end users at a higher throughput. In the meantime,
   inter-datacenter networks also carry high volumes of other types of
   traffic, including service replication and data backups, e.g., for
   storage and email services. It is an important research topic to
   optimally engineer and schedule inter-datacenter traffic, taking into
   account the stringent latency requirements of video flows when
   transmitted along inter-datacenter links shared with other types of
   traffic. Since inter-datacenter networks are usually overprovisioned,
   unlike prior work that mainly aims to maximize link utilization, we
   propose a delay-optimized traffic routing scheme to explicitly
   differentiate path selection for different sessions according to their
   delay sensitivities, leading to a software-defined inter-datacenter
   networking overlay implemented at the application layer. We show that
   our solution can yield sparse path selection by only solving linear
   programs, and thus, in contrast to prior traffic engineering solutions,
   does not lead to overly fine-grained traffic splitting, further reducing
   packet resequencing overhead and the number of forwarding rules to be
   installed in each forwarding unit. Real-world experiments based on a
   deployment on six globally distributed Amazon EC2 datacenters have shown
   that our system can effectively prioritize and improve the delay
   performance of inter-datacenter video flows at a low cost.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by application of complex-valued signal processing techniques
   in statistical pattern recognition, classification, and Gaussian mixture
   (GM) modeling, this paper derives analytical expressions for computing
   the Bhattacharyya coefficient/distance (BC/BD) between two improper
   complex-valued Gaussian distributions. The BC/BD is one of the most
   widely used statistical measures for evaluating class separability in
   classification problems, feature extraction in pattern recognition, and
   for GM reduction (GMR) purposes. The BC provides an upper bound on the
   Bayes error, which is commonly known as the best criterion to evaluate
   feature sets. Although the computation of the BC/BD between real-valued
   signals is a well-known result, it has not yet been extended to the case
   of improper complex-valued Gaussian densities. This paper addresses this
   gap. We analyze the role of the pseudocovariance matrix, which
   characterizes the noncircularity of the signal, and show that it carries
   critical second-order statistical information for computing the BC/BD.
   We derive upper and lower bounds on the BD in terms of the eigenvalues
   of the covariance and pseudocovariance matrices of the underlying
   densities. The theoretical bounds are then used to introduce the concept
   of beta-dominance in the context of statistical distance measures. The
   BC is pseudometric, since it fails to satisfy the triangle inequality.
   Using the Matusita distance (a full-metric variant of the BC), we
   propose an intuitively pleasing indirect distance measure for comparing
   two general GMs. Finally, we investigate the application of the proposed
   BC/BD measures for GMR purposes and develop two BC-based GMR algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method to dynamically determine coherent
   generators and electrical areas of an interconnected power system. The
   proposed method is based on dynamic frequency deviations of both
   generator and non-generator buses, with respect to the system nominal
   frequency. The proposed method 1) largely overcomes the limitations of
   the existing model-based and measurement-based coherency identification
   methods, 2) enables dynamic tracking of the coherency time-evolution,
   and 3) provides noise immunity which is imperative in practical
   implementation. The method also promises the potential for real-time
   coherency calculation. The proposed method is applied to the
   16-machine/68-bus NPCC system based on time-domain simulation studies in
   the PSS/E platform and the results are compared with those of the
   classical slow-coherency (model-based) method and a measurement-based

Abstract = {{Large field-programmable gate array (FPGA) systems with multiple dice
   connected by a silicon interposer are now commercially available.
   However, many questions remain concerning their key architecture
   parameters and efficiency, as the signal count between dice is reduced
   and the delay between the dice is increased compared with a monolithic
   FPGA. We modify the versatile place and route (VPR) to target
   interposer-based FPGAs and investigate placement and routing changes and
   incorporating partitioning into the flow to improve results. Our best
   computer-aided design (CAD) flow reduces the routing demand for
   interposer FPGAs with realistic connectivity between dice by 47\% and
   improves the circuit speed by 13\% on average. Architecture
   modifications to add routing flexibility when crossing the interposer
   are very beneficial and improve routability by a further 11\%. With
   these CAD and architecture enhancements, we find that if an interposer
   supplies (between dice) 20\% of the routing capacity that the normal
   (within-die) FPGA routing channels supply, there is only a modest impact
   on circuit routability. Smaller interposer-routing capacities do impact
   routability; however, minimum channel width increases by 70\% when an
   interposer supplies only 10\% of the within-die routing. The interposer
   also impacts delay, increasing circuit delay by 11\% on average for a
   1-ns interposer signal delay and a two-die system.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis and prediction of the rock mass disturbance around
   underground excavations are critical components of the performance and
   safety assessment of deep geological repositories for nuclear waste. In
   the short term, an excavation damaged zone (EDZ) tends to develop due to
   the redistribution of stresses around the underground openings. The EDZ
   is associated with an increase in hydraulic conductivity of several
   orders of magnitude. In argillaceous rocks, sealing mechanisms
   ultimately lead to a partial reduction in the effective hydraulic
   conductivity of the EDZ with time. The goal of this study is to
   strengthen the understanding of the phenomena involved in the EDZ
   formation and sealing in Opalinus Clay, an indurated claystone currently
   being assessed as a host rock for a geological repository in
   Switzerland. To achieve this goal, hybrid finite-discrete element method
   (FDEM) simulations are performed. With its explicit consideration of
   fracturing processes, FDEM modeling is applied to the HG-A experiment,
   an in situ test carried out at the Mont Terri underground rock
   laboratory to investigate the hydro-mechanical response of a backfilled
   and sealed microtunnel. A quantitative simulation of the EDZ formation
   process around the microtunnel is first carried out, and the numerical
   results are compared with field observations. Then, the re-compression
   of the EDZ under the effect of a purely mechanical loading, capturing
   the increase of swelling pressure from the backfill onto the rock, is
   considered. The simulation results highlight distinctive rock failure
   kinematics due to the bedded structure of the rock mass. Also, fracture
   termination is simulated at the intersection with a pre-existing
   discontinuity, representing a fault plane oblique to the bedding
   orientation. Simulation of the EDZ re-compression indicates an overall
   reduction of the total fracture area as a function of the applied
   pressure, with locations of ineffective sealing associated with
   self-propping of fractures. These results are consistent with hydraulic
   testing data revealing a negative correlation between pressure values
   and an increase in the EDZ transmissivity.}},

Abstract = {{Age-related osteoporosis is driven by defects in the tissue-resident
   mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), a heterogeneous population of
   musculoskeletal progenitors that includes skeletal stem cells. MSC
   decline leads to reduced bone formation, causing loss of bone volume and
   the breakdown of bony microarchitecture crucial to trabecular strength.
   Furthermore, the low-turnover state precipitated by MSC loss leads to
   low-quality bone that is unable to perform remodeling-mediated
   maintenance replacing old damaged bone with new healthy tissue. Using
   minimally expanded exogenous MSCs injected systemically into a mouse
   model of human age-related osteoporosis, we show long-term engraftment
   and markedly increased bone formation. This led to improved bone quality
   and turnover and, importantly, sustained microarchitectural competence.
   These data establish proof of concept that MSC transplantation may be
   used to prevent or treat human age-related osteoporosis.}},

Abstract = {{Paint films with uniform thicknesses ranging from 150 to 820 mu m were
   applied on stainless steel substrates using a model paint consisting of
   a resin dissolved in butanol and the test samples were cured in a
   natural convection oven at a temperature of 140 degrees C. Photographs
   of the paint surface were taken during drying, and the weight loss was
   measured. Cellular structures appeared on the paint surface, induced by
   surface tension-driven flows due to solvent concentration variations.
   For thin films (< 500 mu m), the patterns disappeared in a few minutes
   and the dried paint surface was smooth, while for thicker paint films,
   wave-like structures remained on the hardened paint layer, creating an
   uneven surface. An analytical solution of the mass-diffusion equation
   was used to model solvent evaporation from the paint film and to
   calculate the concentration gradient and surface tension variations in
   the paint films. In thin films, all the solvent was depleted, and
   surface tension gradients disappeared before curing was complete,
   allowing the surface to become smooth. In thicker films, concentration
   gradients that drove cellular flows persisted until the paint dried,
   leaving orange peel on the surface.}},

Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Different ventilation strategies can have an enormous impact on both
   exposures to contaminants of concern (COCs) and energy use in retail
   buildings. We applied a multi-contaminant model of an area normalized
   retail store, and developed estimates for distributions of model inputs.
   We then used these distributions in a Monte Carlo simulation for six
   cities to compare the impacts of the ASHRAE 62.1-2013 ventilation rate
   procedure (VRP), demand controlled ventilation (DCV), and indoor air
   quality procedure (IAQP), with or without using a high particulate
   efficiency filter. Results showed that for cities where outdoor PM2.5
   concentration is low, adopting the IAQP with low efficiency PM2.5 filter
   in grocery stores and the VRP with high PM2.5 efficiency in non-grocery
   stores yielded the greatest exposure benefits. For cities with high
   outdoor PM2.5 concentration, adopting the VRP with high PM2.5 efficiency
   for all store types yielded the greatest exposure benefits. However,
   these exposure benefits also caused an increase in energy consumption,
   and the magnitude depends on the city's climate, outdoor PM2.5
   concentration and the retail store type. We propose a new pollutant
   exposure control ventilation (PECV) strategy, where ventilation rates
   are weighed against exposure to different COCs, and the ventilation rate
   that is most climatically advantageous is chosen. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{54-72}},

Abstract = {{One key role of urban informatics is to understand demands, challenges,
   and opportunities for major infrastructure projects in a bottom-up
   format. In this respect, engaging citizens through communication tools
   available in Social Web, and distilling micro-knowledge distributed
   among them appear to be reliable and promising streams. Chaotic nature
   and large size of unstructured big-data gathered in this way, and
   semantic barriers for understanding and classifying the content are
   among other difficulties which challenge efficiency and effectiveness of
   Such methods. This paper suggests a specific form of collective
   intelligence, which can be described as `collective classification', as
   a strategy and employs crowdsourcing as a tool to overcome such
   difficulties. We explain crowdsourcing in form of a Game With A Purpose,
   designed and run by University of Toronto between June and August of
   2013. The game aimed to classify the content of online feeds in the
   context of sustainability of infrastructure projects, and to form a
   folksonomy for decoding the future communication. Players of the game
   were provided with `sustainability' (at a holistic view covering its
   three main pillars: economy, environment, and society) as the context, a
   set of relevant tweets as items to be annotated, and a set of indicators
   developed in the domain literature as a template to follow. On top of
   the predefined indicators, the participants were allowed to suggest and
   create their own classes. Players' inputs were used in scoring other
   players' performance and this refined the results by drawing on the
   `Wisdom of the Crowd'. The core contribution of the research is to use
   human computation in a bottom-up approach to solve a transdisciplinary
   problem which traditionally has been tackled via top-down solutions. As
   an example, taxonomies created by domain professionals are normally
   biased towards professionals; such traditional solutions normally lack
   context-sensitivity in nature, constructivism in approach, and pluralism
   in perspective. The method and the platform presented by this paper can
   be directly applied in similar studies to benchmark, classify, and
   fine-tune public perspective/knowledge in urban infrastructure related
   technical or semi-technical issues. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Despite continuous improvement in neonatology there is no clinically
   effective treatment for perinatal hypoxia ischemia (HI). Therefore,
   development of a new therapeutic intervention to minimize the resulting
   neurological consequences is urgently needed. The immature brain is
   highly responsive to environmental stimuli, such as environmental
   enrichment but a more effective paradigm is enriched rehabilitation
   (ER), which combines environmental enrichment with daily reach training.
   Another neurorestorative strategy to promote tissue repair and
   functional recovery is cyclosporine A (CsA). However, potential benefits
   of CsA after neonatal HI have yet to be investigated. The aim of this
   study was to investigate the effects of a combinational therapy of CsA
   and ER in attempts to promote cognitive and motor recovery in a rat
   model of perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury. Seven-day old rats were
   submitted to the HI procedure and divided into 4 groups: CsA +
   Rehabilitation; CsA + NoRehabilitation; Vehicle + Rehabilitation;
   Vehicle + NoRehabilitation. Behavioural parameters were evaluated pre
   (experiment 1) and post 4 weeks of combinational therapy (experiment 2).
   Results of experiment 1 demonstrated reduced open field activity of HI
   animals and increased foot faults relative to shams in the ladder rung
   walking test. In experiment 2, we showed that ER facilitated acquisition
   of a staircase skilled-reaching task, increased number of zone crosses
   in open-field exploration and enhanced coordinated limb use during
   locomotion on the ladder rung task. There were no evident deficits in
   novel object recognition testing. Delayed administration of CsA, had no
   effect on functional recovery after neonatal HI. There was a significant
   reduction of cortical and hemispherical volume and hippocampal area,
   ipsilateral to arterial occlusion in HI animals; combinational therapy
   had no effect on these morphological measurements. In conclusion, the
   present study demonstrated that ER, but not CsA was the main contributor
   to enhanced recovery of motor ability after neonatal HI. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The extreme hardness of sintered ceramics makes it difficult to machine
   them economically. Abrasive slurry-jet micro-machining (ASJM), in which
   a target is eroded by the impingement of a micro-jet of water containing
   fine abrasive particles, is a low-cost alternative for micro machining
   of sintered ceramic materials without tool wear and thermal damage, and
   without the use of patterned masks. Existing profile prediction models
   could not account for changes in the flow field observed in the ASJM of
   sintered ceramics as channel depth increased. These changes in the flow
   of abrasive particles fundamentally altered the channel profiles so that
   the specific erosion rate (mass of material removed per mass of erodent)
   of the channel centerline decreased with increasing depth and, when
   machined at 90 degrees incidence, the profiles changed shape.
   Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling was used to derive a
   generalized relation between channel geometry and erosive flow (the
   nonlinearity function), which was used in an existing
   numerical-empirical model to predict the depths, widths, and shapes of
   ASJM micro channels in sintered ceramics; i.e. aluminum nitride (AIN),
   alumina (Al2O3), and zirconium tin titanate (Zn-Sn-TiO2). The specific
   erosion rate particle impact angle and specific erosion rate-particle
   impact velocity relations, measured for 1 wt\%, 10 mu m-diameter alumina
   slurry jet, were used in a CFD model of a first-pass channel to obtain
   the erosive pattern (erosive efficacy distribution) of the slurry jet
   within a shallow ceramic channel. This shallow, first-pass erosion
   pattern was then generalized and used with the nonlinearity function to
   predict the shapes of deeper channels. The predicted depths in each of
   the three ceramics at any point on the cross-section were within 6\% of
   those of measured channels up to a depth/width aspect ratio of about 0.5
   for nozzle angles of both 90 degrees and 45 degrees in both the forward
   or backward channel-machining configurations. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and

Title = {{Multiscale modeling of the effect of waviness and agglomeration of CNTs
   on the elastic properties of nanocomposites}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{195-204}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a multiscale model, based on molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations and micromechanics modeling technique, was developed to
   determine the effect of waviness and agglomeration of CNTs on the bulk
   elastic properties of nanoreinforced epoxy composites. The predictions
   of most existing multiscale models overestimated the elastic properties
   of nanocomposites. We believe this difference is attributed to the
   unrealistic assumption that CNTs are straight reinforcements, which is
   contrary to the experimental findings. We overcame this limitation by
   using more realistic wavy CNTs. Representative volume elements (RVEs)
   reinforced with single and bundles of wavy CNTs were developed to study
   the effect of waviness, agglomeration, and orientation of CNTs on the
   bulk properties of the nanocomposite considered. CNTs with different
   curvatures ranging from straight to severely curved were modeled. Our
   results reveal that waviness and agglomeration of CNTs limit their
   reinforcement effects. The predictions of the proposed multiscale model
   are in very good agreement with existing experimental findings,
   verifying its validity and reliability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This study has investigated the possibility of using fluorescent
   dendronized magnetic nanoparticles (FDMNPs) for potential applications
   in drug delivery and imaging. FDMNPs were first synthesized,
   characterized and then the effect of Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer
   functionalization and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugation on
   biocompatibility of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs)
   was evaluated. The nanostructures' cytotoxicity tests were performed at
   different concentrations from 10 to 500 mu g/mL using MCF-7 and L929
   cell lines. IC50 in mu assay were 139.22 and 201.88 mu g/mL for DMNP
   incubated L929 and MCF-7 cell lines respectively, whereas the cell
   viability for FDMNPs did not decrease to 50\%. The results showed that
   FITC conjugation diminishes the toxicity of dendronized magnetic
   nanopartides (DMNP5) mainly due to the reduction of surface charge. DMNP
   appears to be cytotoxic at the concentration levels being used for both
   cell lines. On the contrary, FDMNP5 showed more biocompatibility and
   cell viability of MCF-7 and L929 cell lines at all concentrations. The
   fluorescence microscopy of FDMNP5 incubated with MCF-7 cells showed a
   successful localization of cells indicating their ability for
   applications such as a magnetic fluorescent probe in cell studies and
   imaging purposes. T2 relaxivity measurements demonstrated the
   applicability of the synthesized nano structures as the contrast agents
   in tissue differential assessment by altering their relaxation times. In
   our case, the r2 relaxivity of FDMNPs was measured as 103.67 mM(-1) S-1.

Abstract = {{In this paper, it is shown that the phase of the frequency-domain
   photoacoustic (PA) signal can be used to measure the absorption
   coefficient (mu(a)) of the chromophore. This method can be referred to
   as a calibration-free approach in the sense that it is not affected by
   the attenuation of fluence in the tissue. This helps to enhance the
   accuracy of quantitative PA functional imaging. However, the premise for
   employing the aforementioned method is that chromophore geometry should
   be known a priori. As a proof of applicability of the theory, the method
   was applied to a simplified geometry and the extension of the method to
   more complicated geometries is discussed. One of the key subjects of
   functional imaging in medicine is blood. Parameters such as total
   hemoglobin concentration and hemoglobin oxygen saturation are valuable
   for diagnostics as well as for treatment of many diseases. The developed
   method was employed for in vitro monitoring of blood oxygenation on

Abstract = {{A physics-based multi-scale progressive damage model was developed for
   predicting the durability of wind turbine blade structures.
   Computational micromechanics was coupled within a continuum damage
   mechanics (CDM) framework, and implemented through a user-defined
   subroutine within commercial finite element software, for evaluating
   sub-critical damage evolution and stiffness degradation of the blade
   structure. The study is the first step in developing an accurate
   prediction model for composite wind turbines that accounts for the
   multi-scale nature of damage in rotor blades. The quasi-static and
   fatigue simulation results demonstrate the ability of the model to
   predict the evolution of damage in the critical regions of the blade
   structure, which is an important contribution and essential for
   increasing the accuracy of damage tolerance analyses and for
   certification of composite structures. A parametric study of blade
   geometric parameters also revealed a correlation with damage evolution,
   providing valuable insight for optimization of blade designs. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The finiteness of fossil fuels implies that future electric power
   systems may predominantly source energy from fuel-free renewable
   resources like wind and solar. Evidently, these power systems without
   fuel will be environmentally benign, sustainable, and subject to milder
   failure scenarios. Many of these advantages were projected decades ago
   with the definition of the soft energy path, which describes a future
   where all energy is provided by numerous small, simple, and diverse
   renewable sources. Here we provide a thorough investigation of power
   systems without any fuel-based generation from technical and economic
   standpoints. The paper is organized by timescale and covers issues like
   the irrelevance of unit commitment in networks without large, fuel-based
   generators, the dubiousness of nodal pricing without fuel costs, and the
   need for new system-level models and control methods for
   semiconductor-based energy-conversion interfaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We propose and fully analyze a compact structure for DAC-free pure
   optical QAM modulation. The proposed structure is the first ring
   resonator-based DAC-free QAM modulator reported in the literature, to
   the best of our knowledge. The device consists of two segmented add-drop
   Mach Zehnder interferometer-assisted ring modulators (MZIARM) in an IQ
   configuration. The proposed architecture is investigated based on the
   parameters from SOI technology where various key design considerations
   are discussed. We have included the loss in the MZI arms in our analysis
   of phase and amplitude modulation using MZIARM for the first time and
   show that the imbalanced loss results in a phase error. The output level
   linearity is also studied for both QAM-16 and QAM-64 not only based on
   optimizing RF segment lengths but also by optimizing the number of
   segments. In QAM-16, linearity among levels is achievable with two
   segments while in QAM-64 an additional segment may be required. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We introduce a method to couple solid-phase microextraction (SPME) with
   HPLC-MS using digital microfluidics (DMF). In the new system, SPME
   fibers are used to extract analytes from complex sample solutions, after
   which the analytes are desorbed into solvent droplets in a DMF device.
   The open geometry of DMF allows straightforward insertion of SPME fibers
   without requiring a complicated interface, and automated droplet
   manipulation enables multiplexed processing of the fibers. In contrast
   to other multiplexed SPME elution interfaces, the low volumes inherent
   to DMF allow for pre-concentration of analytes prior to analysis. The
   new SPME-DMF-HPLC-MS method was applied to the quantification of
   pg/mL-level free steroid hormones in urine. We propose that this new
   method will be useful for a wide range of applications requiring cleanup
   and pre-concentration with convenient coupling to high-performance
   analytical techniques. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a novel coating technique to manufacture ceramic
   superhydrophobic coatings rapidly and economically. A rare earth oxide
   (REO) was selected as the coating material due to its hydrophobic
   nature, chemical inertness, high temperature stability, and good
   mechanical properties, and deposited on stainless steel substrates by
   solution precursor plasma spray (SPPS). The effects of various spraying
   conditions including standoff distance, torch power, number of torch
   passes, types of solvent and plasma velocity were investigated. The
   as-sprayed coating demonstrated a hierarchically structured surface
   topography, which closely resembles superhydrophobic surfaces found in
   nature. The water contact angle on the SPPS superhydrophobic coating was
   up to 65\% higher than on smooth REO surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{This work explores the dynamic mechanical, morphological and thermal
   characteristics of melt blended and injection moulded PLA carbon
   nanofibre (CNF) composites. Composites of neat PLA with 1, 3, 5, 10, and

   reveal significant fibre pullout. Damping properties were evaluated by
   isothermal frequency sweeps at different displacement amplitudes
   performed on the composites in the DMA. At any displacement amplitude,
   the damping of the composites rises with increase in CNF content with
   the highest damping seen in PLA with 10 wt\% CNF. Higher displacement
   amplitudes significantly increase the damping of neat PLA. The tensile
   modulus shows a rise of almost 50\% at 15 wt\% CNF content. MDSC reveals
   that the glass transition is not significantly affected the presence of
   CNF. Crystallization is seen to be favoured with the presence of CNF and

Abstract = {{Earth-abundant first-row (3d) transition metal-based catalysts have been
   developed for the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER); however, they operate
   at overpotentials substantially above thermodynamic requirements.
   Density functional theory suggested that non-3d high-valency metals such
   as tungsten can modulate 3d metal oxides, providing nearoptimal
   adsorption energies for OER intermediates. We developed a
   room-temperature synthesis to produce gelled oxyhydroxides materials
   with an atomically homogeneous metal distribution. These gelled FeCoW
   oxyhydroxides exhibit the lowest overpotential (191 millivolts) reported
   at 10 milliamperes per square centimeter in alkaline electrolyte. The
   catalyst shows no evidence of degradation after more than 500 hours of
   operation. X-ray absorption and computational studies reveal a
   synergistic interplay between tungsten, iron, and cobalt in producing a
   favorable local coordination environment and electronic structure that
   enhance the energetics for OER.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a disinfection by-product (DBP) with
   many known precursors such as amine-containing pharmaceuticals that can
   enter the environment via treated wastewater. Reverse osmosis and tight
   nanofiltration membranes (MW cutoff < 200 Da) are treatment technologies
   that demonstrate high removal of many compounds, but at relatively high
   energy costs. Looser membranes (>200 Da) may provide sufficient removal
   of a wide range of contaminants with lower energy costs. This study
   examined the rejection of pharmaceuticals that are known NDMA precursors
   (similar to 300 Da) using nanofiltration (MW cutoff 350 Da). MQ water
   was compared to two raw water sources, and results illustrated that NDMA
   precursors (as estimated by formation potential testing) were
   effectively rejected in all water matrices (>84\%). Mixtures of
   pharmaceuticals vs. single-spiked compounds were found to have no impact
   on rejection from the membranes used. The use of MQ water vs. surface
   waters illustrated that natural organic matter, colloids, and inorganic
   ions present did not significantly impact the rejection of the
   amine-containing pharmaceuticals. This study illustrates that NDMA
   formation potential testing can be effectively used for assessing NDMA
   precursor rejection from more complex samples with multiple and/or
   unknown NDMA precursors present, such as wastewater matrices. (C) 2016

Title = {{Diffusion related isotopic fractionation effects with one-dimensional
   advective-dispersive transport}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{550}},
Pages = {{200-208}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Aqueous phase diffusion-related isotope fractionation (DRIF) for carbon
   isotopes was investigated for common groundwater contaminants in systems
   in which transport could be considered to be one-dimensional. This paper
   focuses not only on theoretically observable DRIF effects in these
   systems but introduces the important concept of constraining
   ``observable{''} DRIF based on constraints imposed by the scale of
   measurements in the field, and on standard limits of detection and
   analytical uncertainty. Specifically, constraints for the detection of
   DRIF were determined in terms of the diffusive fractionation factor, the
   initial concentration of contaminants (C-o), the method detection limit
   (MDL) for isotopic analysis, the transport time, and the ratio of the
   longitudinal mechanical dispersion coefficient to effective molecular
   diffusion coefficient (D-mech/D-eff). The results allow a determination
   of field conditions under which DRIF may be an important factor in the
   use of stable carbon isotope measurements for evaluation of contaminant
   transport and transformation for one-dimensional advective-dispersive
   transport. This study demonstrates that for diffusion-dominated
   transport of BTEX, MTBE, and chlorinated ethenes, DRIF effects are only
   detectable for the smaller molar mass compounds such as vinyl chloride
   for C-o/MDL ratios of 50 or higher. Much larger Co/MDL ratios,
   corresponding to higher source concentrations or lower detection limits,
   are necessary for DRIF to be detectable for the higher molar mass
   compounds. The distance over which DRIF is observable for VC is small
   (less than 1 m) for a relatively young diffusive plume (<.100 years),
   and DRIF will not easily be detected by using the conventional sampling
   approach with ``typical{''} well spacing (at least several meters). With
   contaminant transport by advection, mechanical dispersion, and molecular
   diffusion this study suggests that in field sites where D-mech/D-eff is
   larger than 10, DRIF effects will likely not be observable for common
   groundwater contaminants. Importantly, under most field conditions,
   D-mech/D-eff >= 10 is usually satisfied in the longitudinal direction,
   suggesting that DR1E is not likely to be observable in most groundwater
   systems in which contaminant transport is predominantly one-dimensional.
   Given the importance in the MDL it is recommended that MDL should always
   be explicitly reported in both modeling and field studies. (C) 2016 Else

Title = {{Assessing the potential of group 13 and 14 metal/metalloid
   phthalocyanines as hole transport layers in organic light emitting
   diodes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},

Month = {{APR 14}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we have assessed the potential application of group 13
   and 14 metal and metalloid phthalocyanines ((X)(n)-MPcs) and their
   axially substituted derivatives as hole-transporting layers in organic
   light emitting diodes (OLEDs). OLEDs studied herein have the generic
   structure of
   glass/ITO/(N,N'-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N'-diphenyl-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diamin
   e (NPB) or (X)(n)-MPc)(50 nm)/Alq(3) (60 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (80 nm),
   where X is an axial substituent group. OLEDs using chloro aluminum
   phthalocyanine (Cl-AlPc) showed good peak luminance values of 2620 +/-
   113 cd/m(2) at 11 V. To our knowledge, Cl-AlPc has not previously been
   shown to work as a hole transport material (HTL) in OLEDs. Conversely,
   the di-chlorides of silicon, germanium, and tin phthalocyanine
   (Cl-2-SiPc, Cl-2-GePc, and Cl-2-SnPc, respectively) showed poor
   performance compared to Cl-AlPc, having peak luminances of only 3864
   cd/m(2) (12 V), 2361 cd/m(2) (8.5 V), and 5965 cd/m(2) (13.5 V),
   respectively. However, by performing a simple axial substitution of the
   chloride groups of Cl-2-SiPc with pentafluorophenoxy groups, the
   resulting bis(pentafluorophenoxy) silicon phthalocyanine (F-10-SiPc)
   containing OLED had a peak luminance of 5141 +/- 941 cd/m(2) (10 V), a
   two order of magnitude increase over its chlorinated precursor. This
   material showed OLED characteristics approaching those of a baseline
   OLED based on the well-studied triarylamine NPB. Attempts to attach the
   pentafluorophenoxy axial group to both SnPc and GePc were hindered by
   synthetic difficulties and low thermal stability, respectively. In light
   of the performance improvements observed by simple axial substitution of
   SiPc in OLEDs, the use of axially substituted MPcs in organic electronic
   devices remains of continuing interest to us and potentially the field
   in general. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{DNA assembly of nanoparticles is a powerful approach to control their
   properties and prototype new materials. However, the structure and
   properties of DNA-assembled nanoparticles are labile and sensitive to
   interactions with counterions, which vary with processing and
   application environment. Here we show that substituting polyamines in
   place of elemental counterions significantly enhanced the structural
   rigidity and plasmonic properties of DNA-assembled metal nanoparticles.
   These effects arose from the ability of polyamines to condense DNA and
   cross-link DNA-coated nanoparticles. We further used polyamine wrapped
   DNA nanostructures as structural templates to seed the growth of polymer
   multilayers via layer-by-layer assembly, and controlled the degree of
   DNA condensation, plasmon coupling efficiency, and material
   responsiveness to environmental stimuli by varying polyelectrolyte
   composition. These results highlight counterion engineering as a
   versatile strategy to tailor the properties of DNA-nanoparticle be
   applicable to other classes of DNA nanostructures.}},

Title = {{Experimental measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution
   with imperfect sources}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},

Month = {{APR 6}},
Abstract = {{Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), which
   is immune to all detector side-channel attacks, is the most promising
   solution to the security issues in practical quantum key distribution
   systems. Although several experimental demonstrations of MDI-QKD have
   been reported, they all make one crucial but not yet verified
   assumption, that is, there are no flaws in state preparation. Such an
   assumption is unrealistic and security loopholes remain in the source.
   Here we present a MDI-QKD experiment with the modulation error taken
   into consideration. By applying the loss-tolerant security proof by
   Tamaki et al. {[}Phys. Rev. A 90, 052314 (2014)], we distribute secure
   keys over fiber links up to 40 km with imperfect sources, which would
   not have been possible under previous security proofs. By simultaneously
   closing loopholes at the detectors and a critical loophole-modulation
   error in the source, our work shows the feasibility of secure QKD with
   practical imperfect devices.}},

Title = {{Enhancement in Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation in the Presence of

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{3572-3579}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric models of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) typically assume
   organic species form a well-mixed phase. As a result, partitioning of
   semivolatile oxidation products into the particle phase to form SOA is
   thought to be enhanced by preexisting organic particles. In this work,
   the physicochemical properties that govern such enhancement in SOA yield
   were examined. SOA yields from alpha-pinene ozonolysis were measured in
   the presence of a variety of organic seeds which were chosen based on
   polarity and phase state at room temperature. Yield enhancement was only
   observed with seeds of medium polarities (tetraethylene glycol and
   citric acid). Solid hexadecanol seed was observed to enhance SOA yields
   only in chamber experiments with longer mixing time scales, suggesting
   that the mixing process for SOA and hexadecanol may be kinetically
   limited at shorter time scales. Our observations indicate that, in
   addition to kinetic limitations, intermolecular interactions also play a
   significant role in determining SOA yields. Here we propose for the
   first time to use the Hansen solubility framework to determine aerosol
   miscibility and predict SOA yield enhancement. These results highlight
   that current models may overestimate SOA formation, and parametrization
   of intermolecular forces is needed for accurate predictions of SOA
   formation.}},

Abstract = {{We present a closed-form expression for the small-signal response of a
   depletion-mode ring modulator and verify it by measurement results. Both
   electrical and optical behavior of micro-ring modulator as well as the
   loss variation due to the index modulation is considered in the
   derivation. This expression suggests that a ring modulator is a
   third-order system with one real pole, one zero and a pair of
   complex-conjugate poles. The exact positions of the poles/zero are given
   and shown to be dependent upon parameters such as electrical bandwidth,
   coupling condition, optical loss, and sign/value of laser detunings. We
   show that the location of zero is different for positive and negative
   detuning, and therefore, the ring modulator frequency response is
   asymmetric. We use the gain-bandwidth product as a figure of merit and
   calculate it for various pole/zero locations. We show that
   gain-bandwidth for the over-coupled ring modulator is superior compared
   to other coupling conditions. Also, we show that the gain-bandwidth
   product can be increased to a limit by increasing the electrical
   bandwidth. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{Conclusion With age, in a mouse model, degenerative changes to the
   capillaries of the stria vascularis are observed. These range from a
   narrowing of vessel lumen to complete degeneration of strial vessels.
   Other vascular beds in the cochlea are relatively unchanged with age.
   Strial capillaries at the cochlear base are significantly more affected
   than those in mid-apical turns.
   Objectives Previous work suggests that age-related hearing loss is
   associated with degenerative changes to cochlear vasculature; the term
   strial presbyacusis is often cited. This study reports on vascular
   changes observed in a murine model of presbyacusis, analyzed using
   corrosion cast techniques.
   Methods A novel corrosion cast technique was developed to compare
   cochlear vasculature in control mice (non-presbycusic, CD1) and old (> 6
   months) C57BL/6 animals. ABR measures indicated a significant
   age-related threshold elevation in the C57BL/6 mice. Cochlear vascular
   casts were imaged using scanning electron microscopy, and vessel
   degeneration was quantified by measuring capillary diameters.
   Results Corrosion casts of cochlear vasculature in 6-12 month old
   C57BL/6 mice reveal significant degeneration of stria vascularis. Other
   capillary beds (spiral ligament and the spiral limbus) appear unchanged.
   Comparison of strial capillary diameters reveals significantly more
   damage in basal/lower-turn regions compared with the cochlear mid-turn.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Background: Elevated blood pressure is one of the main risk factors for
   death globally. Behavioral neurocardiac training (BNT) is a
   complementary approach to blood pressure and stress management that is
   intended to exercise the autonomic reflexes, improve stress recovery,
   and lower blood pressure. BNT involves cognitive-behavioral therapy with
   a paced breathing technique and heart rate variability biofeedback. BNT
   is limited to in-clinic delivery and faces an accessibility barrier
   because of the need for clinical oversight and the use of complex
   monitoring tools.
   Objective: The objective of this project was to design, develop, and
   evaluate a wearable electrocardiographic (ECG) sensor system for the
   delivery of BNT in a home setting.
   Methods: The wearable sensor system, Beat, consists of an ECG sensor and
   a mobile app. It was developed iteratively using the principles of
   test-driven Agile development and user-centered design. A usability
   study was conducted at Toronto General Hospital to evaluate feasibility
   and user experience and identify areas of improvement.
   Results: The Beat sensor was designed as a modular patch to be worn on
   the user's chest and uses standard ECG electrodes. It streams a
   single-lead ECG wirelessly to a mobile phone using Bluetooth Low Energy.
   The use of small, low-power electronics, a low device profile, and a
   tapered enclosure allowed for a device that can be unobtrusively worn
   under clothing. The sensor was designed to operate with a mobile app
   that guides users through the BNT exercises to train them to a
   slow-paced breathing technique for stress recovery. The BNT app uses the
   ECG captured by the sensor to provide heart rate variability biofeedback
   in the form of a real-time heart rate waveform to complement and
   reinforce the impact of the training. Usability testing (n=6) indicated
   that the overall response to the design and user experience of the
   system was perceived positively. All participants indicated that the
   system had a positive effect on stress management and that they would
   use it at home. Areas of improvement were identified, which focused
   primarily on the delivery of training and education on BNT through the
   app.
   Conclusions: The outcome of this project was a wearable sensor system to
   deliver BNT at home. The system has the potential to offer a
   complementary approach to blood pressure and stress management at home
   and reduce current accessibility barriers.}},

Title = {{Energy Efficiency of Downlink Transmission Strategies for Cloud Radio

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies the energy efficiency of the cloud radio access
   network (C-RAN), specifically focusing on two fundamental and different
   downlink transmission strategies, namely the data-sharing strategy and
   the compression strategy. In the data-sharing strategy, the backhaul
   links connecting the central processor (CP) and the base-stations (BSs)
   are used to carry user messages-each user's messages are sent to
   multiple BSs; the BSs locally form the beamforming vectors then
   cooperatively transmit the messages to the user. In the compression
   strategy, the user messages are precoded centrally at the CP, which
   forwards a compressed version of the analog beamformed signals to the
   BSs for cooperative transmission. This paper compares the energy
   efficiencies of the two strategies by formulating an optimization
   problem of minimizing the total network power consumption subject to
   user target rate constraints, where the total network power includes the
   BS transmission power, BS activation power, and load-dependent backhaul
   power. To tackle the discrete and nonconvex nature of the optimization
   problems, we utilize the techniques of reweighted l(1) minimization and
   successive convex approximation to devise provably convergent
   algorithms. Our main finding is that both the optimized data-sharing and
   compression strategies in C-RAN achieve much higher energy efficiency as
   compared to the nonoptimized coordinated multipoint transmission, but
   their comparative effectiveness in energy saving depends on the user
   target rate. At low user target rate, data-sharing consumes less total
   power than compression; however, as the user target rate increases, the
   backhaul power consumption for data-sharing increases significantly
   leading to better energy efficiency of compression at the high user rate
   regime.}},

Abstract = {{Big data analytics, the process of organizing and analyzing data to get
   useful information, is one of the primary uses of cloud services today.
   Traditionally, collections of data are stored and processed in a single
   datacenter. As the volume of data grows at a tremendous rate, it is less
   efficient for only one datacenter to handle such large volumes of data
   from a performance point of view. Large cloud service providers are
   deploying datacenters geographically around the world for better
   performance and availability. A widely used approach for analytics of
   geo-distributed data is the centralized approach, which aggregates all
   the raw data from local datacenters to a central datacenter. However, it
   has been observed that this approach consumes a significant amount of
   bandwidth, leading to worse performance. A number of mechanisms have
   been proposed to achieve optimal performance when data analytics are
   performed over geo-distributed datacenters. In this paper, we present a
   survey on the representative mechanisms proposed in the literature for
   wide area analytics. We discuss basic ideas, present proposed
   architectures and mechanisms, and discuss several examples to illustrate
   existing work. We point out the limitations of these mechanisms, give
   comparisons, and conclude with our thoughts on future research
   directions.}},

Title = {{An Emulator-Based Prediction of Dynamic Stiffness for Redundant Parallel
   Kinematic Mechanisms}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANISMS AND ROBOTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The accuracy of a parallel kinematic mechanism (PKM) is directly related
   to its dynamic stiffness, which in turn is configuration dependent. For
   PKMs with kinematic redundancy, configurations with higher stiffness can
   be chosen during motion-trajectory planning for optimal performance.
   Herein, dynamic stiffness refers to the deformation of the mechanism
   structure, subject to dynamic loads of changing frequency. The
   stiffnessoptimization problem has two computational constraints: (i)
   calculation of the dynamic stiffness of any considered PKM
   configuration, at a given task-space location, and (ii) searching for
   the PKM configuration with the highest stiffness at this location. Due
   to the lack of available analytical models, herein, the former
   subproblem is addressed via a novel effective emulator to provide a
   computationally efficient approximation of the high-dimensional
   dynamic-stiffness function suitable for optimization. The proposed
   method for emulator development identifies the mechanism's structural
   modes in order to breakdown the high-dimensional stiffness function into
   multiple functions of lower dimension. Despite their computational
   efficiency, however, emulators approximating highdimensional functions
   are often difficult to develop and implement due to the large amount of
   data required to train the emulator. Reducing the dimensionality of the
   approximation function would, thus, result in a smaller training data
   set. In turn, the smaller training data set can be obtained accurately
   via finite-element analysis (FEA). Moving least-squares (MLS)
   approximation is proposed herein to compute the low-dimensional
   functions for stiffness approximation. Via extensive simulations, some
   of which are described herein, it is demonstrated that the proposed
   emulator can predict the dynamic stiffness of a PKM at any given
   configuration with high accuracy and low computational expense, making
   it quite suitable for most high-precision applications. For example, our
   results show that the proposed methodology can choose configurations
   along given trajectories within a few percentage points of the optimal
   ones.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of finite-time vibration control of earthquake excited
   buildings structure with actuator faults and parameter uncertainties is
   concerned in this paper. The objective of designing controllers is to
   guarantee the finite-time stability of closed-loop systems with a
   prescribed level of disturbance attenuation First, based on matrix
   transformation, the structural system is described as a state-space
   model, which contains actuator faults and parameter uncertainties.
   Second, based on finite-time stability analysis method, some sufficient
   conditions for the existence of finite-time vibration-attenuation
   controllers are obtained. By solving these conditions, the desired
   controllers, which consider the actuator faults and parameters
   uncertainties, can be obtained for the closed-loop system to be
   finite-time stable with the performance parallel to z parallel to(2) <
   gamma parallel to omega parallel to(2). In the end, simulation results
   are given to show that the finite-time stabilization controller can
   obtain better state responses, especially, while the system is under
   non-zero initial states.}},

Abstract = {{Small molecule aggregates are considered nuisance compounds in drug
   discovery, but their unusual properties as colloids could be exploited
   to form stable vehicles to preserve protein activity. We investigated
   the coaggregation of seven molecules chosen because they had been
   previously intensely studied as colloidal aggregators, coformulating
   them with bis-azo dyes. The coformulation reduced colloid sizes to <100
   nm and improved uniformity of the particle size distribution. The new
   colloid formulations are more stable than previous aggregator particles.
   Specifically, coaggregation of Congo Red with sorafenib,
   tetraiodophenolphthalein (TIPT), or vemurafenib produced particles that
   are stable in solutions of high ionic strength and high protein
   concentrations. Like traditional, single compound colloidal aggregates,
   the stabilized colloids adsorbed and inhibited enzymes like
   beta-lactamase, malate dehydrogenase, and trypsin. Unlike traditional
   aggregates, the coformulated colloid-protein particles could be
   centrifuged and resuspended multiple times, and from resuspended
   particles, active trypsin could be released up to 72 h after adsorption.
   Unexpectedly, the stable colloidal formulations can sequester,
   stabilize, and isolate enzymes by spin down, resuspension, and release.}},

Abstract = {{Anxiety is one of the most concerning comorbidities in autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD) due to its high prevalence, negative impact on physical
   and psychological well-being, and interaction with core deficits of ASD.
   Current assessment and treatment of anxiety, which rely on the
   observation of behavior and self-reports, are often ineffective as ASD
   is associated with deficits in communication and diminished
   introspective ability. In this light, autonomic nervous system (ANS)
   activity has been suggested as a marker of physiological arousal
   associated with anxiety. However, physiological arousal measured by ANS
   indices also occurs with other cognitive and emotional processes, and it
   is unclear whether anxiety-related arousal can be differentiated from
   that related to other cognitive processes. To address this gap, we
   investigated the use of linear and nonlinear classification techniques
   for differentiating anxiety-related arousal from arousal due to three
   cognitive processes (attention, inhibitory control, and social
   cognition) and physical activity based on electrocardiography signal
   features. Our results indicate that over 80\% classification accuracy
   can be achieved, suggesting that ANS response can be used as a specific
   marker of anxiety-related arousal in a subgroup of children with ASD who
   demonstrate an increase in heart rate in response to anxiogenic stimuli.

Abstract = {{Mammalian P2X receptors (P2XRs), a family of seven ionotropic purinergic
   receptors, function as ion channels modulating diverse cellular
   processes such as secretion, apoptosis and proliferation in response to
   extracellular ATP. Previously, it was shown that upon ATP stimulus, the
   P2X7 receptor (a member of P2XR family) triggers plasma membrane (PM)
   blebbing in HEK293 cells. In this study, we demonstrate that this
   phenomenon extends to another member of the P2XR family-P2X2 receptor
   (P2X2R). Similar to P2X7 receptor, P2X2R blebbing is dependent on
   Ca2+-calmodulin and ROCK-I. To elucidate the spatiotemporal relationship
   between Ca2+ signaling and blebbing, protein biosensors and switches
   were used to image and generate Ca2+ signals, respectively, while
   observing PM blebbing in cells. Blebbing cannot be initiated by Ca2+
   influx from the endoplasmic reticulum or by Ca2+ transport across the PM
   by other Ca2+ channels. To trigger blebbing, it is necessary for Ca2+ to
   enter specifically through the P2X2R. Lastly, a local Ca2+ signal near a
   fragment that encodes the intracellular P2X2RC-terminus tail is
   sufficient to trigger blebbing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Impact of non-petroleum vehicle fuel economy on GHG mitigation potential}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The fuel economy of gasoline vehicles will increase to meet 2025
   corporate average fuel economy standards (CAFE). However, dedicated
   compressed natural gas (CNG) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) already
   exceed future CAFE fuel economy targets because only 15\% of
   non-petroleum energy use is accounted for when determining compliance.
   This study aims to inform stakeholders about the potential impact of
   CAFE on life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, should non-petroleum
   fuel vehicles displace increasingly fuel efficient petroleum vehicles.
   The well-to-wheel GH Gemissions of a set of hypothetical model year 2025
   light-duty vehicles are estimated. A reference gasoline vehicle is
   designed to meet the 2025 fuel economy target within CAFE, and is
   compared to a set of dedicated CNG vehicles and BEVs with different fuel
   economy ratings, but all vehicles meet or exceed the fuel economy target
   due to the policy's dedicated non-petroleum fuel vehicle incentives.
   Ownership costs and BEV driving ranges are estimated to provide context,
   as these can influence automaker and consumer decisions. The results
   show that CNG vehicles that have lower ownership costs than gasoline
   vehicles and BEVs with long distance driving ranges can exceed the 2025
   CAFE fuel economy target. However, this could lead to lower efficiency
   CNG vehicles and heavier BEVs that have higher well-to-wheel GHG
   emissions than gasoline vehicles on a per km basis, even if the
   non-petroleum energy source is less carbon intensive on an energy
   equivalent basis. These changes could influence the effectiveness of low
   carbon fuel standards and are not precluded by the light-duty vehicle
   GHG emissions standards, which regulate tailpipe but not fuel production
   emissions.}},

Title = {{Attenuation of elastic waves in bentonite and monitoring of radioactive

Abstract = {{Deep geological repositories, isolated from the geosphere by an
   engineered bentonite barrier, are currently considered the safest
   solution for high-level radioactive waste (HLRW) disposal. As the
   physical conditions and properties of the bentonite barrier are
   anticipated to change with time, seismic tomography was suggested as a
   viable technique to monitor the physical state and integrity of the
   barrier and to timely detect any unforeseen failure. To do so, the
   seismic monitoring system needs to be optimized, and this can be
   achieved by conducting numerical simulations of wave propagation in the
   repository geometry. Previous studies treated bentonite as an elastic
   medium, whereas recent experimental investigations indicate its
   pronounced viscoelastic behaviour. The aims of this contribution are (i)
   to numerically estimate the effective attenuation of bentonite as a
   function of temperature T and water content W-c, so that synthetic data
   can accurately reproduce experimental traces and (ii) assess the
   feasibility and limitation of the HLRW repository monitoring by
   simulating the propagation of sonic waves in a realistic repository
   geometry. A finite difference method was utilized to simulate the wave
   propagation in experimental and repository setups. First, the input of
   the viscoelastic model was varied to achieve a match between
   experimental and numerical traces. The routine was repeated for several
   values of Wc and T, so that quality factors Qp(Wc, T) and Qs(Wc, T) were
   obtained. Then, the full-scale monitoring procedure was simulated for
   six scenarios, representing the evolution of bentonite's physical state.
   The estimated Qp and Qs exhibited a minimum at Wc = 20 per cent and
   higher sensitivity to Wc, rather than T, suggesting that pronounced
   inelasticity of the clay has to be taken into account in geophysical
   modelling and analysis. The repository-model traces confirm that active
   seismic monitoring is, in principle, capable of depicting physical
   changes in the bentonite barrier. However, the locations of sources and
   receivers relative to the tunnel need to be optimized to achieve best
   sensitivity to the changes. It was also observed that first arrivals do
   not necessarily represent the most informative part of the signal; thus
   the time windows of the analysis need to be selected, accounting for the
   geometry of the acquisition system. This contribution should be
   considered as a next step towards the development of a numerical
   approach to aid in the design and optimization of a non-intrusive
   monitoring system in HLRW repositories.}},

Abstract = {{Research and biomedical applications in cell surgery require
   transportation and rotation of biological cells. In these cell
   manipulation tasks, the cell of interest must be translated and oriented
   properly such that the desired component, such as the polar body or
   other organelles, can be imaged with optical microscopy. This paper
   presents a holographic optical tweezers (HOT) based system to carry out
   automated translational control in the plane, and rotational control
   about one rotational axes of a suspended cell. Based on the proposed
   general equations of motion of the cell, held in an optical trap, two
   controllers, one for cell translational and one for rotational control,
   are developed to translate and orient the cells to the desired position
   and orientation in a sequential manner. Experiments are performed to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
   Note to Practitioners-Cell reorientation is a key step to many cell
   surgery tasks. Cell rotational control carried out under conventional
   manual operation by skilled professionals is based on a trial and error
   approach. There exists a significant demand for high accurate, high
   throughput rotational control of biological cells in multiple degrees of
   freedom. This highlights the need to develop an automated approach to
   translating and rotating biological cells and organism to a predefined
   position and orientation for subsequent processing steps. This paper
   reports a solution to this challenging problem via the use of a
   robot-aided cell manipulation system equipped with optical tweezers,
   based on general dynamic equation of the trapped cell.}},

   timing optimization: target confidence is superior to error-related
   potential score as an uncertain label}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Error-related potentials (ErrPs) have the potential to guide
   classifier adaptation in BCI spellers, for addressing non-stationary
   performance as well as for online optimization of system parameters, by
   providing imperfect or partial labels. However, the usefulness of
   ErrP-based labels for BCI adaptation has not been established in
   comparison to other partially supervised methods. Our objective is to
   make this comparison by retraining a two-step P300 speller on a subset
   of confident online trials using naive labels taken from speller output,
   where confidence is determined either by (i) ErrP scores, (ii) posterior
   target scores derived from the P300 potential, or (iii) a hybrid of
   these scores. We further wish to evaluate the ability of partially
   supervised adaptation and retraining methods to adjust to a new
   stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA), a necessary step towards online SOA
   optimization. Approach. Eleven consenting able-bodied adults attended
   three online spelling sessions on separate days with feedback in which
   SOAs were set at 160 ms (sessions 1 and 2) and 80 ms (session 3). A post
   hoc offline analysis and a simulated online analysis were performed on
   sessions two and three to compare multiple adaptation methods. Area
   under the curve (AUC) and symbols spelled per minute (SPM) were the
   primary outcome measures. Main results. Retraining using supervised
   labels confirmed improvements of 0.9 percentage points (session 2, p <
   0.01) and 1.9 percentage points (session 3, p < 0.05) in AUC using
   same-day training data over using data from a previous day, which
   supports classifier adaptation in general. Significance. Using posterior
   target score alone as a confidence measure resulted in the highest SPM
   of the partially supervised methods, indicating that ErrPs are not
   necessary to boost the performance of partially supervised adaptive
   classification. Partial supervision significantly improved SPM at a
   novel SOA, showing promise for eventual online SOA optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Rifampin (RIF) phosphotransferase (RPH) confers antibiotic resistance by
   conversion of RIF and ATP, to inactive phospho/RIF, AMP and Pi. Here we
   present the crystal structure of RPH from Listeria monocytogenes
   (RPH-Lm), which reveals that the enzyme is comprised of three domains:
   two substrate-binding domains (ATP-grasp and RIF-binding domains); and a
   smaller phosphate-carrying His swivel domain. Using solution small-angle
   X-ray scattering and mutagenesis, we reveal a mechanism where the swivel
   domain transits between the spatially distinct substrate-binding sites
   during catalysis. RPHs are previously uncharacterized dikinases that are
   widespread in environmental and pathogenic bacteria. These enzymes are
   members of a large unexplored group of bacterial enzymes with substrate
   affinities that have yet to be fully explored. Such an enzymatically
   complex mechanism of antibiotic resistance augments the spectrum of
   strategies used by bacteria to evade antimicrobial compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorosomes are vesicular light-harvesting organelles found in
   photosynthetic green sulfur bacteria. These organisms thrive in low
   photon flux environments due to the most efficient light-to-chemical
   energy conversion, promoted by a protein-less assembly of chlorin
   pigments. These assemblies possess collective absorption properties and
   can be adapted for contrast-enhanced bioimaging applications, where
   maximized light absorption in the near-infrared optical window is
   desired. Here, we report a strategy for tuning light absorption toward
   the near-infrared region by engineering a chlorosome-inspired assembly
   of synthetic metallochlorins in a biocompatible lipid scaffold. In a
   series of synthesized chlorin analogues, we discovered that lipid
   conjugation, central coordination of a zinc metal into the chlorin ring,
   and a 31-methoxy substitution were critical for the formation of dye
   assemblies in lipid nanovesicles. The substitutions result in a specific
   optical shift, characterized by a bathochromically shifted (72 nm) Q,
   absorption band, along with an increase in absorbance and circular
   dichroism as the ratio of dye-conjugated lipid was increased. These
   alterations in optical spectra are indicative of the formation of
   delocalized excitons states across each molecular assembly. This
   strategy of tuning absorption by mimicking the structures found in
   photosynthetic organisms may spur new opportunities in the development
   of biophotonic contrast agents for medical applications.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{There has been a major focus on the clinical translation of emerging
   technologies for diagnosing patients with infectious diseases, cancer,
   heart disease, and diabetes. However, most developments still remain at
   the academic stage where researchers use spiked target molecules to
   demonstrate the utility of a technology and assess the analytical
   performance. This approach does not account for the biological
   complexities and variabilities of human patient samples. As a technology
   matures and potentially becomes clinically-viable, one important
   intermediate step in the translation process is to conduct a full
   clinical validation of the technology using a large number of patient
   samples. Here, we present a full detailed clinical validation of Quantum
   Dot (QD) barcode technology for diagnosing patients infected with
   Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). We further demonstrate that the detection of
   multiple regions of the viral genome using multiplexed QD barcodes
   improved clinical sensitivity from 54.9-66.7\% to 80.4-90.5\%, and
   describe how to use QD barcodes for optimal clinical diagnosis of
   patients. The use of QDs in biology and medicine was first introduced in
   1998 but has not reached clinical care. This study describes our
   long-term systematic development strategy to advance QD technology to a
   clinically feasible product for diagnosing patients. Our ``blueprint{''}
   for translating the QD barcode research concept could be adapted for
   other nanotechnologies, to efficiently advance diagnostic techniques
   discovered in the academic laboratory to patient care.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular microenvironments present cells with multiple stimuli,
   including not only soluble biochemical and insoluble matrix cues but
   also mechanical factors. Biomaterial array platforms have been used to
   combinatorially and efficiently probe and define two-dimensional (2D)
   and 3D microenvironmental cues to guide cell functions for tissue
   engineering applications. However, there are few examples of array
   platforms that include dynamic mechanical forces, particularly to enable
   stretching of 3D cell-seeded biomaterials, which is relevant to
   engineering connective and cardiovascular tissues. Here we present a
   deformable membrane platform that enables 3D dynamic mechanical stretch
   of arrayed biomaterial constructs. Cell-seeded polyethylene glycol
   norbornene (PEG-NB) hydrogels were bound to miniaturized deformable
   membranes via a thiol-ene reaction with off-stoichiometry thiol-ene
   based polydimethylsiloxane (OSTE-PDMS) as the membrane material. Bonding
   to OSTE-PDMS enabled the 3D hydrogel microconstructs to be cyclically
   deformed and stretched by the membrane. As a first demonstration, human
   mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) embedded in PEG-NB were stretched for
   several days. They were found to be viable, spread in the 3D hydrogels,
   and exhibited a contractile myofibroblast phenotype when exposed to
   dynamic 3D mechanical deformation. This platform, which is readily
   scalable to larger arrays, enables systematic interrogation of the
   relationships between combinations of 3D mechanobiological cues and
   cellular responses, and thus has the potential to identify strategies to
   predictably control the construction of functional engineered tissues.
   Statement of significance
   Current high-throughput biomaterial screening approaches fail to
   consider the effects of dynamic mechanical stimulation, despite its
   importance in a wide variety of regenerative medicine applications. To
   meet this need, we developed a deformable membrane platform that enables
   3D dynamic stretch of arrayed biomaterial constructs. Our approach
   combines microtechnologies fabricated with offstoichiometry thiol-ene
   based polydimethylsiloxane membranes that can covalently bond
   cell-seeded polyethylene glycol norbornene 3D hydrogels, a model
   biomaterial with tunable adhesive, elastic and degradation
   characteristics. As a first demonstration, we show that human
   mesenchymal stromal cells embedded in hydrogels and subjected to dynamic
   mechanical stimulation undergo myofibroblast differentiation. This
   system is readily scaled up to larger arrays, and will enable systematic
   and efficient screening of combinations of 3D mechanobiological and
   biomaterial cues on cell fate and function. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia

   on literature and a case study of corn stover ethanol. Challenges
   include the complexity of feedstock/ecosystems and market-mediated
   aspects and the short history of commercial lignocellulosic ethanol
   facilities, which collectively have led to uncertainty in GHG emissions

Title = {{A Methodology for Constructing Marginal Abatement Cost Curves for
   Climate Action in Cities}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{As drivers of climate action, cities are taking measures to reduce
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which if left unabated pose a challenge
   to meeting long-term climate targets. The economics of climate action
   needs to be at the forefront of climate dialogue to prioritize
   investments among competing mitigation measures. A marginal abatement
   cost (MAC) curve is an effective visualization of climate action that
   initiates a technical and economic discussion of the cost-effectiveness
   and abatement potential of such actions among local leaders, policy
   makers, and climate experts. More commonly demonstrated for countries,
   MAC curves need to be developed for cities because of their
   heterogeneity, which vary in their urban activities, energy supply,
   infrastructure stock, and commuting patterns. The methodology for
   constructing bottom-up MAC curves for cities is presented for
   technologies that offer fuel switching and/or energy efficiencies, while
   considering technology lifetimes, city-specific electricity and fuel
   prices, and emission intensities. Resulting MAC curves are unique to
   every city, and chart the pathway towards low-carbon growth by
   prioritizing measures based on cost-effectiveness. A case study of
   Toronto's climate targets demonstrates the prioritization of select
   technologies. Leveraging MAC curves to support climate programs enables
   cities to strategically invest in financing climate action and designing
   incentives.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of using of millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency for future
   wireless cellular communication systems has motivated the study of
   large-scale antenna arrays for achieving highly directional beamforming.
   However, the conventional fully digital beamforming methods which
   require one radio frequency (RF) chain per antenna element is not viable
   for large-scale antenna arrays due to the high cost and high power
   consumption of RF chain components in high frequencies. To address the
   challenge of this hardware limitation, this paper considers a hybrid
   beamforming architecture in which the overall beamformer consists of a
   low-dimensional digital beamformer followed by an RF beamformer
   implemented using analog phase shifters. Our aim is to show that such an
   architecture can approach the performance of a fully digital scheme with
   much fewer number of RF chains. Specifically, this paper establishes
   that if the number of RF chains is twice the total number of data
   streams, the hybrid beamforming structure can realize any fully digital
   beamformer exactly, regardless of the number of antenna elements. For
   cases with fewer number of RF chains, this paper further considers the
   hybrid beamforming design problem for both the transmission scenario of
   a point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system and a
   downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) system. For
   each scenario, we propose a heuristic hybrid beamforming design that
   achieves a performance close to the performance of the fully digital
   beamforming baseline. Finally, the proposed algorithms are modified for
   the more practical setting in which only finite resolution phase
   shifters are available. Numerical simulations show that the proposed
   schemes are effective even when phase shifters with very low resolution
   are used.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Compute-and-forward (C\&F) is a promising new approach to interference
   management, enjoying several advantages over other information-theoretic
   schemes. C\&F usually requires channel state information (CSI) at the
   receivers so that an ``optimal{''} scaling factor can be computed for
   the purposes of decoding. In this paper, a blind C\&F scheme-i.e., one
   not requiring CSI-is developed. Rather than attempting to compute the
   optimal scaling factor, this new scheme seeks one or more ``good{''}
   scalars, i.e., scalars that allow correct decoding despite possibly
   being suboptimal. The region of all such good scalars is characterized.
   To find a good scalar, a computationally efficient scheme is proposed
   which involves error-detection, a hierarchically organized list, as well
   as a use of the smoothing lemma from lattice theory. Simulation results
   show that our blind C\&F scheme achieves-for a class of nested lattice
   codes-the same throughput as its CSI-enabled counterpart at the expense
   of, approximately, a two-fold increase in computational complexity in
   the high-throughput region. Moreover, our blind C\&F scheme can be
   applied to multisource multirelay networks with a good
   performance/complexity tradeoff.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider joint realtime (RT) and nonrealtime (NRT)
   flows packet scheduling and resource block (RB) allocation in orthogonal
   frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) wireless networks. Radio RBs
   in the OFDMA plane are to be distributed among RT and NRT flows. In the
   conventional approach, RT and NRT flows are served sequentially. This
   sequential approach is inefficient because an RT flow may presumably
   have enough time until its delay deadline while its channel is in deep
   fade. In this situation, the transmission of NRT flows with higher level
   of efficiency can be performed. Intuitively speaking, the conventional
   sequential approach is too conservative, which can be reengineered. We
   propose a novel joint RT and NRT flows disutility-based packet
   scheduling and RB allocation in a common pool of RBs. The proposed joint
   approach enlarges the effective capacity of the associated wireless
   system when compared with the separated pool of RBs. The joint approach
   is particularly relevant for improving voice over LTE (VoLTE). We use
   mean bit-rate, mean queue-length, and instantaneous queuing delay
   information, in addition to channel information, to match the demand and
   supply. Furthermore, we develop a novel model for input-output bit-rate
   behavior of the mixture of RT and NRT flows. This model sheds light on
   the identification of different load regions and understanding of the
   system in an intuitive manner. Our approach and methodology can be
   extended for broader quality-of-service (QoS) requirements and for the
   utility of future applications. Simulation results show that the
   proposed framework is able to unify the serving mechanism of the RT and
   NRT flows and is able to achieve higher admissible bit-rate when
   handling mixed RT and NRT flows, compared with various baselines.}},

Abstract = {{Wave propagation in an infinite medium can be numerically simulated by
   surrounding a finite region by a perfectly matched layer (PML). When the
   medium is heterogeneous consisting of both solids and liquids, careful
   consideration is needed in specifying the properties of the PML
   especially because parts of it lie at the solid-fluid interface. While
   such a situation could arise in many important fields including marine
   seismology, where water is in contact with earth, and in biomedical
   ultrasound, where soft tissue is in contact with bone, no PML
   formulation exists to appropriately model such coupled problems. Here, a
   second-order time-domain PML formulation for fluid-solid heterogeneous
   media in two dimensions that satisfies the interface coupling boundary
   condition throughout the computational domain is presented. Numerical
   results are given to establish the applicability and accuracy of such a
   PML formulation in discrete settings without causing stability issues,
   spurious reflections, or any other problems. In particular, the
   effectiveness of the PML in absorbing all kinds of bulk waves, as well
   as surface and evanescent waves, is studied. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society

Abstract = {{Coke reaction behavior in the blast furnace hearth has yet to be fully
   understood due to limited access to the high temperature zone. The
   graphitization of coke and its interaction with slag in the hearth of
   blast furnace were investigated with samples obtained from the center of
   the deadman of a blast furnace during its overhaul period. All hearth
   coke samples from fines to lumps were confirmed to be highly
   graphitized, and the graphitization of coke in the high temperature zone
   was convinced to start from the coke surface and lead to the formation
   of coke fines. It will be essential to perform further comprehensive
   investigations on graphite formation and its evolution in a coke as well
   as its multi-effect on blast furnace performance. The porous hearth
   cokes were found to be filled up with final slag. Further research is
   required about the capability of coke to fill final slag and the attack
   of final slag on the hearth bottom refractories since this might be a
   new degradation mechanism of refractories located in the hearth bottom.

Abstract = {{This study introduces a novel noninvasive differential photoacoustic
   method, Wavelength Modulated Differential Photoacoustic Spectroscopy
   (WM-DPAS), for noninvasive early cancer detection and continuous hypoxia
   monitoring through ultrasensitive measurements of hemoglobin oxygenation
   levels (StO(2)). Unlike conventional photoacoustic spectroscopy, WM-DPAS
   measures simultaneously two signals induced from square-wave modulated
   laser beams at two different wavelengths where the absorption difference
   between maximum deoxy-and oxyhemoglobin is 680 nm, and minimum (zero)
   808 nm (the isosbestic point). The two-wavelength measurement
   efficiently suppresses background, greatly enhances the signal to noise
   ratio and thus enables WM-DPAS to detect very small changes in total
   hemoglobin concentration (CHb) and oxygenation levels, thereby
   identifying pre-malignant tumors before they are anatomically apparent.
   The non-invasive nature also makes WM-DPAS the best candidate for ICU
   bedside hypoxia monitoring in stroke patients. Sensitivity tunability is
   another special feature of the technology: WM-DPAS can be tuned for
   different applications such as quick cancer screening and accurate
   StO(2) quantification by selecting a pair of parameters, signal
   amplitude ratio and phase shift. The WM-DPAS theory has been validated
   with sheep blood phantom measurements.

Abstract = {{Tortuosity is an important parameter for characterizing transport
   properties within porous materials and is of interest in a broad range
   of fields, such as energy storage and conversion materials. One of the
   parameters that impacts the tortuosity value is the geometry of the
   solid phase which, in this study, is considered as stochastically-placed
   rectangular particles. Through lattice Boltzmann modelling (LBM), we
   determined the impact of particle aspect ratio on the intrinsic
   tortuosity-porosity relationships of two-dimensional porous media
   composed of rectangular particles. These relationships were isolated for
   materials with grain (particle) aspect ratios of is an element of \{1,
   2, 3\} and porosities from {[}0.55 - 0.95]. We determined that a minimum
   of 6, 8 and 10 stochastic simulations, respectively, were required to
   calculate these average tortuosity values in laminar flow (Re << 1).
   This novel application of the LBM to study the effects of porosity and
   aspect ratio of rectangular grains on tortuosity can be used in the
   tailoring of materials for clean energy.}},

Abstract = {{It is desirable to replace noble metals used as electrode materials for
   piezoelectric thin film with base metals. A nickel-based layer is
   proposed as a bottom electrode for potassium (K) sodium (Na) niobate
   (NbO3) (KNN) piezoelectric thin film. Pure nickel is used as a bottom
   electrode under the KNN layer, and nickel silicide is used as an
   uncovered bottom electrode to gain access to the electrode placed under
   the KNN. The obtained results do not indicate the oxidation of the
   nickel-based bottom electrode after the deposition of KNN at 600 degrees
   C for 10 h in the presence of oxygen and/or after annealing the sample
   at 400 degrees C for an hour in air. The dielectric constant was
   determined to be 280 at 1 kHz. The remnant polarization was estimated to
   be 12.5 mu C/cm(2). The effective piezoelectric coefficient d(33) was
   estimated to be 37 pm/V at 100 kV/cm. The effective coefficient d(31)
   was evaluated by measuring the tip deflection of KNN unimorph
   cantilevers to be 17.2 pm/V. The relatively lower values of the
   piezoelectric properties of the fabricated KNN/Ni/Ti/SiO2/Si can be
   attributed to the crystal orientation of the KNN layer, which was
   preferentially oriented in the (110) direction. {[}2015-0222]}},

Abstract = {{The crystal structure of boron subphthalocyanine chloride {[}systematic

   construction and operation of the train sublimation system, which has
   been designed to reproducibly yield single crystals suitable for
   diffraction experiments in a manner which approximates the vacuum
   deposition conditions commonly used to fabricate organic electronic
   devices. Diffraction experiments were conducted using two crystal
   samples and four temperatures (90, 123, 147 and 295 K), enabling a
   discussion of changes in the unit cell and intermolecular interactions
   with respect to temperature and in comparison to two previously

Abstract = {{Recent technological advancements in optical spectroscopy allow for the
   construction of hyperspectral (broadband) portable tissue oximeters. In
   a series of our recent papers we have shown that hyperspectral NIRS
   (hNIRS) has similar or better capabilities in the absolute tissue
   oximetry as frequency-domain NIRS, and that hNIRS is also very efficient
   in measuring temporal changes in tissue hemoglobin concentration and
   oxygenation. In this paper, we extend the application of hNIRS to the
   measurement of event-related hemodynamic and metabolic functional
   cerebral responses during simulated driving. In order to check if hNIRS
   can detect event-related changes in the brain, we measured the
   concentration changes of oxygenated (HbO(2)) and deoxygenated (HHb)
   hemoglobin and of the oxidized state of cytochrome c oxidase, on the
   right and left prefrontal cortices (PFC) simultaneously during simulated
   driving on sixteen healthy right-handed participants (aged between
   22-32). We used our in-house hNIRS system based on a portable
   spectrometer with cooled CCD detector and a driving simulator with a
   fully functional steering wheel and foot pedals. Each participant
   performed different driving tasks and participants were distracted
   during some driving conditions by asking general knowledge true/false
   questions. Our findings suggest that more complex driving tasks
   (non-distracted) deactivate PFC while distractions during driving
   significantly activate PFC, which is in agreement with previous fMRI
   results. Also, we found the changes in the redox state of the cytochrome
   C oxidase to be very consistent with those in the concentrations of
   HbO(2) and HHb. Overall our findings suggest that in addition to the
   suitability of absolute tissue oximetry, hyperspectral NIRS may also
   offer advantages in functional brain imaging. In particular, it can be
   used to measure the metabolic functional brain activity during actual
   driving. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{L-Hydroxyproline and D-Proline Catabolism in Sinorhizobium meliloti}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{198}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1171-1181}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Sinorhizobium meliloti forms N-2-fixing root nodules on alfalfa, and as
   a free-living bacterium, it can grow on a very broad range of
   substrates, including L-proline and several related compounds, such as
   proline betaine, trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline (trans-4-L-Hyp), and
   cis-4-hydroxy-D-proline (cis-4-D-Hyp). Fourteen hyp genes are induced
   upon growth of S. meliloti on trans-4-L-Hyp, and of those, hypMNPQ
   encodes an ABC-type trans-4-L-Hyp transporter and hypRE encodes an
   epimerase that converts trans-4-L-Hyp to cis-4-D-Hyp in the bacterial
   cytoplasm. Here, we present evidence that the HypO, HypD, and HypH
   proteins catalyze the remaining steps in which cis-4-D-Hyp is converted
   to alpha-ketoglutarate. The HypO protein functions as a D-amino acid
   dehydrogenase, converting cis-4-D-Hyp to
   Delta(1)-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate, which is deaminated by HypD
   to alpha-ketoglutarate semialdehyde and then converted to
   alpha-ketoglutarate by HypH. The crystal structure of HypD revealed it
   to be a member of the N-acetylneuraminate lyase subfamily of the
   (alpha/beta)(8) protein family and is consistent with the known
   enzymatic mechanism for other members of the group. It was also shown
   that S. meliloti can catabolize D-proline as both a carbon and a
   nitrogen source, that D-proline can complement L-proline auxotrophy, and
   that the catabolism of D-proline is dependent on the hyp cluster.
   Transport of D-proline involves the HypMNPQ transporter, following which
   D-proline is converted to Delta(1)-pyrroline-2-carboxylate (P2C) largely
   via HypO. The P2C is converted to L-proline through the NADPH-dependent
   reduction of P2C by the previously uncharacterized HypS protein. Thus,
   overall, we have now completed detailed genetic and/or biochemical
   characterization of 9 of the 14 hyp genes.
   IMPORTANCE
   Hydroxyproline is abundant in proteins in animal and plant tissues and
   serves as a carbon and a nitrogen source for bacteria in diverse
   environments, including the rhizosphere, compost, and the mammalian gut.
   While the main biochemical features of bacterial hydroxyproline
   catabolism were elucidated in the 1960s, the genetic and molecular
   details have only recently been determined. Elucidating the genetics of
   hydroxyproline catabolism will aid in the annotation of these genes in
   other genomes and metagenomic libraries. This will facilitate an
   improved understanding of the importance of this pathway and may assist
   in determining the prevalence of hydroxyproline in a particular
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{NADPH-dependent antioxidant pathways have a critical role in scavenging
   hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced by oxidative phosphorylation.
   Inadequate scavenging results in H2O2 accumulation and can cause
   disease. To measure NADPH/NADP(+) redox states, we explored genetically
   encoded sensors based on steady-state fluorescence anisotropy due to
   FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) between homologous
   fluorescent proteins (homoFRET); we refer to these sensors as Apollo
   sensors. We created an Apollo sensor for NADP(+) (Apollo-NADP(+)) that
   exploits NADP(+)-dependent homodimerization of enzymatically inactive
   glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). This sensor is reversible,
   responsive to glucose stimulated metabolism and spectrally tunable for
   compatibility with many other sensors. We used Apollo-NADP(+) to study
   beta cells responding to oxidative stress and demonstrated that NADPH is
   significantly depleted before H2O2 accumulation by imaging a Cerulean
   -tagged version of Apollo-NADP(+) with the H2O2 sensor HyPer.}},

Abstract = {{A pilot-scale study was performed to evaluate a coagulant dose which had
   been optimized for biopolymer (i.e., foulant) removal on subsequent
   ultrafiltration (UF) fouling, as well as disinfection by-product (DBP)
   precursor removal. Polyaluminum chloride (PACl) dosages were selected
   based on a point of diminishing returns for biopolymer removal (0.5
   mg/L) and directly compared to that applied at full-scale (6 mg/L).
   Membrane fouling (reversible and irreversible) was measured as
   resistance increase over a 48 hour filtration period. DBP formation
   potential (total trihalomethanes (TTHMs), haloacetic acids (HAA(9)) and
   total adsorbable organic halides (AOX)) were measured in both raw and
   treated waters. Results of the study indicate that application of a PACl
   dose optimized for biopolymer reduction (0.5 mg/L) resulted in 65\% less
   irreversible UF fouling when compared to 6 mg/L. The addition of PACl
   prior to the membrane resulted in up to a 14\% reduction in DBP
   precursors relative to the UF membrane alone. A similar level of DBP
   precursor reduction was achieved for both 0.5 and 6 mg/L dosages. The
   results have implications for cost savings, which may be realized due to
   decreased chemical use, as well as increased membrane life associated
   with lower irreversible fouling rates.}},

Abstract = {{Neuromodulation approaches to treating lower urinary tract dysfunction
   could be substantially improved by a sensor able to detect when the
   bladder is full. A number of approaches to this problem have been
   proposed, but none has been found entirely satisfactory. Electrical
   plethysmography approaches attempt to relate the electrical impedance of
   the bladder to its volume, but have previously focused only on the
   amplitudes of the measured signals. We investigated whether the phase
   relationships between sinusoidal currents applied through a pair of
   stimulating electrodes and measured through a pair of recording
   electrodes could provide information about bladder volume. Acute
   experiments in a rabbit model were used to investigate how
   phase-to-volume or amplitude-to-volume regression models could be used
   to predict bladder volumes in future recordings, with and without
   changes to the saline conductivity. Volume prediction errors were found
   to be 6.63 +/- A 1.12 mL using the phase information and 8.32 +/- A 3.88
   mL using the amplitude information (p = 0.44 when comparing the phase
   and amplitude results, n = 6), where the volume of the filled bladder
   was about 25 mL. When a full/empty binary decision rule was applied
   based on the regression model, the difference between the actual
   threshold that would result from this rule and the desired threshold was
   found to be 4.24 +/- A 0.65 mL using the phase information and 106.92
   +/- A 189.82 mL using the amplitude information (p = 0.03, n = 6). Our
   results suggest that phase information can form the basis for more
   effective and robust electrical plethysmography approaches to bladder

Title = {{Indicators for Remission of Suicidal Ideation Following Magnetic Seizure

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a novel therapeutic option
   for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Suicidal ideation is often
   associated with TRD and contributes to the increased mortality and
   morbidity of the disorder.
   OBJECTIVE To identify a biomarker that may serve as an indicator of
   remission of suicidal ideation following a course of MST by using
   cortical inhibition measures from interleaved transcranial magnetic
   stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG).
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Thirty-three patients with TRD were
   part of an open-label clinical trial of MST treatment. Data from 27
   patients (82\%) were available for analysis in this study. Baseline
   TMS-EEG measures were assessed within 1 week before the initiation of
   MST treatment using the TMS-EEG measures of cortical inhibition (ie,
   N100 and long-interval cortical inhibition {[}LICI]) from the left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the left motor cortex, with the
   latter acting as a control site.
   INTERVENTIONS The MST treatments were administered under general
   anesthesia, and a stimulator coil consisting of 2 individual cone-shaped
   coils was used.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicidal ideation was evaluated before
   initiation and after completion of MST using the Scale for Suicide
   Ideation (SSI). Measures of cortical inhibition (ie, N100 and LICI) from
   the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were selected. N100 was
   quantified as the amplitude of the negative peak around 100 milliseconds
   in the TMS-evoked potential (TEP) after a single TMS pulse. LICI was
   quantified as the amount of suppression in the double-pulse TEP relative
   to the single-pulse TEP.
   RESULTS Of the 27 patients included in the analyses, 15 (56\%) were
   women; mean (SD) age of the sample was 46.0 (15.3) years. At baseline,
   patients had a mean SSI score of 9.0 (6.8), with 8 of 27 patients (30\%)
   having a score of 0. After completion of MST, patients had a mean SSI
   score of 4.2 (6.3) (pre-post treatment mean difference, 4.8 {[}6.7];
   paired t(26) = 3.72; P =.001), and 18 of 27 individuals (67\%) had a
   score of 0 for a remission rate of 53\%. The N100 and LICI in the
   frontal cortex-but not in the motor cortex-were indicators of remission
   of suicidal ideation with 89\% accuracy, 90\% sensitivity, and 89\%

   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest that cortical inhibition
   may be used to identify patients with TRD who are most likely to
   experience remission of suicidal ideation following a course of MST.
   Stronger inhibitory neurotransmission at baseline may reflect the
   integrity of transsynaptic networks that are targeted by MST for optimal
   therapeutic response.}},

Abstract = {{Modern regression verification often exposes myriads of failures at the
   pre-silicon stage. Typically, these failures need to be properly grouped
   into bins, which then have to be distributed to engineers for detailed
   analysis. The above process is coined as failure triage, and is nowadays
   increasing in complexity, as the size of both design logic and
   verification environment continues to grow. However, it remains a
   predominantly manual process that can prolong the debug cycle and
   jeopardize time-sensitive design milestones. In this paper, we propose
   an exemplar-based data-mining formulation of failure triage that
   efficiently automates both failure grouping and bin distribution. The
   proposed framework maps failures as data points, applies an
   affinity-propagation (AP) clustering algorithm, and operates in both
   metric and non-metric spaces, offering complete flexibility and
   significant user control over the process. Experimental results show
   that the proposed approach groups related failures together with 87 \%
   accuracy on the average, and improves bin distribution accuracy by 21 \%
   over existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Transplantation of live cells as therapeutic agents is poised to offer
   new treatment options for a wide range of acute and chronic diseases.
   However, the biological complexity of cells has hampered the translation
   of laboratory-scale experiments into industrial processes for reliable,
   cost-effective manufacturing of cell-based therapies. We argue here that
   a solution to this challenge is to design cell manufacturing processes
   according to quality-by-design (QbD) principles. QbD integrates
   scientific knowledge and risk analysis into manufacturing process
   development and is already being adopted by the biopharmaceutical
   industry. Many opportunities to incorporate QbD into cell therapy
   manufacturing exist, although further technology development is required
   for full implementation. Linking measurable molecular and cellular
   characteristics of a cell population to final product quality through
   QbD is a crucial step in realizing the potential for cell therapies to
   transform healthcare.}},

Abstract = {{We study the Reach Control Problem (RCP) to make the solutions of an

   prescribed facet of the polytope in finite time without first leaving
   the polytope. So-called invariance conditions are used to prevent
   solutions from leaving the polytope through facets which are not
   designated as the exit facet. These conditions are known to be necessary
   for solvability of the RCP on polytopes by continuous state feedback. We
   study whether the invariance conditions are also necessary for
   solvability of the RCP on polytopes by open-loop controls. We show by
   way of a counterexample that surprisingly the answer is negative. We
   identify a suitable class of polytopes for which the invariance
   conditions remain necessary conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Self-reported engagement in driver distraction: An application of the
   Theory of Planned Behaviour}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{Driver distraction is a significant concern for roadway safety. As
   drivers often engage willingly in secondary tasks, it is crucial to
   understand the social-psychological factors underlying these behaviours.
   A useful framework for understanding these factors is the Theory of
   Planned Behaviour (TPB). This paper investigates the efficacy of TPB in
   predicting self-reported engagement behaviour in a number of distraction
   tasks through the assessment of attitudes, perceived behavioural
   control, descriptive norms, and injunctive norms. This work also
   investigates the relation of self-reported distraction engagement with
   personality traits and other unsafe driving behaviours. Data collection
   utilised the Susceptibility to Driver Distraction Questionnaire (SDDQ),
   which was built with TPB as the framework, as well as the Manchester
   Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) and various personality
   questionnaires. A total of 578 drivers, both genders, ages 18+, were
   surveyed. Self-reported distraction engagement was associated with
   impulsive, venturesome, and sensation seeking personalities, and with
   reportedly higher level of unsafe driving behaviours. Further,
   attitudes, perceived behavioural control, and descriptive norms were
   found to be significant predictors of self-reported engagement after
   controlling for age group and gender. Injunctive norms, which describe
   the perceived expectations of what the driver ought to do, were not
   significant. Gender was not significant in predicting engagement, but
   older drivers (60+) reported a marginally lower level of engagement than
   drivers between the ages of 26 and 39. Our findings demonstrate the
   usefulness of TPB for analysing self-reported distraction engagement,
   and suggest that drivers may be more heavily influenced by what other
   drivers do on the road, rather than what they perceive they ought to do,
   when it comes to engaging in distractions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This technical note considers a network of stochastic evidence
   accumulators, each represented by a drift-diffusion model accruing
   evidence towards a decision in continuous time by observing a noisy
   signal and by exchanging information with other units according to a
   fixed communication graph. These network dynamics model distributed
   sequential hypothesis testing as well as collective decision making. We
   prove the relationship between the location of each unit in the graph
   and its certainty as measured by the inverse of the variance of its
   state. Under mild connectivity assumptions, we show that only in
   balanced directed graphs do the node variances remain within a bounded
   constant from the minimum possible variance. We then prove that, for
   these digraphs, node ranking based on certainty is governed by
   information centrality, which depends on the notion of effective
   resistance suitably generalized to directed graphs. Our results, which
   describe the certainty of each unit as a function of the structural
   properties of the graph, can guide the selection of leaders in problems
   that involve the observation of noisy external signals by a cooperative
   multi-agent network.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a new way of constructing and decoding
   multipermutation codes. Multipermutations are the permutations of a
   multiset that generally consist of duplicate entries. We first introduce
   a class of binary matrices called multipermutation matrices, each of
   which corresponds to a unique and distinct multipermutation. By
   enforcing a set of linear constraints on these matrices, we define a new
   class of codes that we term linear program (LP)-decodable
   multipermutation codes. In order to decode these codes using an LP,
   thereby enabling soft decoding, we characterize the convex hull of
   multipermutation matrices. This characterization allows us to relax the
   coding constraints to a polytope and to derive two LP decoding problems.
   These two problems are, respectively, formulated by relaxing the maximum
   likelihood decoding problem and the minimum Chebyshev distance decoding
   problem. Because these codes are non-linear, we also study efficient
   encoding and decoding algorithms. We first describe an algorithm that
   maps consecutive integers, one by one, to an ordered list of
   multipermutations. Based on this algorithm, we develop an encoding
   algorithm for a code proposed by Shieh and Tsai, a code that falls into
   our class of LP-decodable multipermutation codes. Regarding decoding
   algorithms, we propose an efficient distributed decoding algorithm based
   on the alternating direction method of multipliers. Finally, we observe
   from the simulation results that the soft decoding techniques we
   introduce can significantly outperform hard decoding techniques that are

Abstract = {{Hybrid configurable logic block architectures for field-programmable
   gate arrays that contain a mixture of lookup tables and hardened
   multiplexers are evaluated toward the goal of higher logic density and
   area reduction. Multiple hybrid configurable logic block architectures,
   both nonfracturable and fracturable with varying MUX: LUT logic element
   ratios are evaluated across two benchmark suites (VTR and CHStone) using
   a custom tool flow consisting of LegUp-HLS, Odin-II front-end synthesis,
   ABC logic synthesis and technology mapping, and VPR for packing,
   placement, routing, and architecture exploration. Technology mapping
   optimizations that target the proposed architectures are also
   implemented within ABC. Experimentally, we show that for nonfracturable
   architectures, without any mapper optimizations, we naturally save up to
   similar to 8\% area postplace and route; both accounting for complex
   logic block and routing area while maintaining mapping depth. With
   architecture-aware technology mapper optimizations in ABC, additional
   area is saved, post-place-and-route. For fracturable architectures,
   experiments show that only marginal gains are seen after place-and-route
   up to similar to 2\%. For both nonfracturable and fracturable
   architectures, we see minimal impact on timing performance for the
   architectures with best area-efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the economic design of a multivariate Bayesian control
   chart with two sampling intervals for monitoring the process mean is
   developed. The economic design of traditional control charts such as
   T-2, SPRT, EWMA, and CUSUM charts with variable sampling interval (VSI)
   has been developed in recent years to control the industrial processes
   by minimizing the average cost of the process, however, it has been
   proved that these traditional, non-Bayesian process control charts are
   not optimal. There has been some limited development of the economic
   design of Bayesian control charts with a single sampling interval (SSI),
   but no results regarding the economic design of the Bayesian control
   chart with two sampling intervals have been reported in the literature.
   The objective is to find the optimal control chart parameters, namely
   the sample size, sampling intervals and the control limits, minimizing
   the total long run expected average cost per unit time. The proposed
   problem is formulated and solved in the semi-Markov decision process
   (SMDP) framework. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the
   whole procedure. The effectiveness of the newly proposed control chart
   is demonstrated through a comparison with the multivariate Bayesian
   control chart with a single sampling interval as well as with a recently
   developed MEWMA control chart. The results indicate that the proposed
   control chart has a considerably better performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are emerging as promising materials for
   constructing infrared sources in view of their tunable luminescence,
   high quantum efficiency and compatibility with solution processing(1).
   However, CQD films available today suffer from a compromise between
   luminescence efficiency and charge transport, and this leads to
   unacceptably high power consumption. Here, we overcome this issue by
   embedding CQDs in a high-mobility hybrid perovskite matrix. The new
   composite enhances radiative recombination in the dots by preventing
   transport-assisted trapping losses; yet does so without increasing the
   turn-on voltage. Through compositional engineering of the mixed halide
   matrix, we achieve a record electroluminescence power conversion
   efficiency of 4.9\%. This surpasses the performance of previously
   reported CQD near-infrared devices two-fold, indicating great potential
   for this hybrid QD-in-perovskite approach.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{100-117}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We employ detailed numerical simulations to understand the physical
   mechanism underlying the surface breakup of a non-turbulent liquid jet
   injected transversely into a high pressure gaseous crossflow under
   isothermal conditions. The numerical observations reveal the existence
   of shear instability on the jet periphery as the primary destabilization
   mechanism. The temporal growth of such azimuthal instabilities leads to
   the formation of interface corrugations, which are eventually sheared
   off of the jet surface as sheet-like structures. The sheets next undergo
   disintegration into ligaments and drops during the surface breakup
   process. The proposed instability mechanism is inherently an inviscid
   mechanism, contrary to the previously suggested mechanism of surface
   breakup (known as ``boundary layer stripping{''}), which is relied on a
   viscous interpretation. The numerically obtained length and time scales
   of the shear instabilities on the jet laterals are compared with the
   results of Behzad et al. (2015) on temporal linear stability analyses of
   a jet in crossflow at near the nozzle. The stability characteristics of
   the most amplified modes (i.e., the wavenumber and the corresponding
   growth rate) obtained from the numerical simulations and the stability
   analyses are in good agreement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) combines experimental testing with
   numerical simulation. It provides an alternative method to evaluate the
   performance of structures subjected to dynamic loading such as
   earthquake or wind. During RTHS, a numerical integration algorithm is
   employed to directly solve the equation of motion and generate command
   displacements for the experimental test structure online. This paper
   presents an improved explicit numerical integration method for RTHS
   based on discrete state space formulation. The improved integration
   method utilizes an extrapolation-based prediction procedure for command
   displacement by applying a zero-order hold. The predicted command
   displacement is then used to compute the final command displacement by
   applying a first-order hold. Both the stability and the accuracy of the
   proposed integration method are investigated using control theory and
   numerical and experimental simulations. The proposed method demonstrates
   improved performance compared with other integration methods. The
   robustness and feasibility of the proposed method were verified through
   experimental RTHS on two different computational platforms including a
   National Instruments system and a dSPACE embedded controller. The
   proposed method may also be implemented on other platforms containing an
   xPC target and MATLAB environment. By placing the algorithm on the
   dSPACE system, any dynamically rated actuator with a controller that can
   receive analog signal may be used for RTHS. Copyright (c) 2015 John

Abstract = {{Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) or
   black spruce medium density fiberboard (MDF) fibers were melt compounded
   using a co-rotating twin screw extruder and subsequently microcellular
   injection molded. Poly(ethlylene glycol) (PEG) was used as a lubricant.
   The micro cellular structure, thermal properties, and crystallization
   behaviors were characterized using scanning electron microscopy,
   thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and wide
   angle X-ray diffraction. Results show that cellulosic fibers, acting as
   crystal nucleating agents, increased the crystallization temperature and
   the crystallinity and decreased the crystallization half time. The
   dissolved N-2, the shear stress, and biaxial stretching during foaming
   also enhanced the crystallinity of PLA. Compared to PLA/PEG, a finer and
   more uniform cell structure was achieved in the cellulosic fiber
   composite foams. The improved foam morphology was attributed to the cell
   nucleating effects of the fibers and the increased melt strength by the
   addition of cellulosic fibers and by the gas- and fiber-induced
   crystallization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In Human-Robot Interactions (HRI), robots should be socially
   intelligent. They should be able to respond appropriately to human
   affective and social cues in order to effectively engage in
   bi-directional communications. Social intelligence would allow a robot

   in real-world human-centered environments. This survey paper presents an
   encompassing review of existing automated affect recognition and
   classification systems for social robots engaged in various HRI
   settings. Human-affect detection from facial expressions, body language,
   voice, and physiological signals are investigated, as well as from a
   combination of the aforementioned modes. The automated systems are
   described by their corresponding robotic and HRI applications, the
   sensors they employ, and the feature detection techniques and affect
   classification strategies utilized. This paper also discusses pertinent
   future research directions for promoting the development of socially
   intelligent robots capable of recognizing, classifying and responding to

Abstract = {{In low-pressure abrasive slurry jet micro-machining (ASJM), an aqueous
   slurry of abrasive particles is used to erode features with relatively
   high resolution in a variety of brittle and ductile materials. The
   effects of ASJM operating parameters on the minimum size of
   micro-channels machined in borosilicate glass and polymethylmethacrylate
   (PMMA) were investigated experimentally and with CFD models. The
   operating parameters were found to have very different effects in these
   two materials due to fundamental differences in the erosion mechanisms.
   It was also found that, although the ASJM operating parameters could be
   adjusted to control the trajectory of particles and thereby reduce the
   size of the erosive jet footprint, this did not necessarily result in
   narrower channels, because of the oblique secondary impact of abrasive
   particles on the channel sidewalls adjacent to the immediate footprint.
   For both glass and PMMA, the channel width increased with depth, but the
   channel widening by secondary oblique impacts was more substantial in
   PMMA due to its ductile erosive behavior. Increasing the particle
   kinetic energy widened the channels machined in both glass and PMMA for
   a given depth. Narrower channels could be machined for a given depth by:
   (i) increasing the slurry temperature, (ii) reducing the jet impingement
   angle in both glass and PMMA, (iii) machining at a slower scan speeds in
   PMMA, but not in glass, (iv) using smaller orifices and particles, and
   (v) coating the target with a sacrificial surface layer. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) is a technology which can reduce the cost for
   power distribution network operators by storing electricity in the
   batteries of electric-drive vehicles and retrieving it when energy
   demands increase during the course of a day. Participants of V2G are
   reimbursed for offering their vehicles which can lead to changes in trip
   schedules when V2G payments are high and travelers are sensitive to the
   payments. However, prior studies have ignored the effects of V2G on
   travelers' schedules. This research gap is addressed with a bi-level V2G
   market equilibrium model where the lower level model determines the
   equilibrium activity patterns as a result of upper level pricing and
   linear approximated AC flow distribution decisions. An algorithm is
   proposed for the model and illustrated on a simple telecommuting example
   where travelers can work from home and offer their vehicle charge
   capacity to the power provider. The model is then applied to the same
   case study from Lam and Yin (2001) to first replicate the lower level
   equilibrium problem as a special case when no V2G is present, and then
   to show the potential effects of the V2G policy to decrease locational
   marginal prices for a distribution network operator. The proposed
   algorithm for the V2G policy resulted in a substantial 20\% increase in
   social welfare over the benchmark equilibrium without V2G. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This article is concerned with the investigation of active constrained
   layer damping (ACLD) of smart laminated fuzzy fiber reinforced composite
   (FFRC) plates. The distinctive feature of the construction of this novel
   FFRC is that the uniformly spaced short carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are
   radially grown on the circumferential surfaces of carbon fibers. The
   effect of CNT waviness on the damping characteristics of the laminated
   FFRC plates is investigated when wavy CNTs are coplanar with either of
   the two mutually orthogonal planes. The constraining layer of the ACLD
   treatment is made of vertically/obliquely reinforced 1-3 piezoelectric
   composite material. A finite element model is developed for the
   laminated FFRC plates integrated with the patches of ACLD treatment. The
   effects of different boundary conditions of the FFRC plates and
   orientation angle of piezoelectric fibers on the damping characteristics
   of the laminated FFRC plates have also been investigated. Results reveal
   that if the plane of radially grown wavy CNTs on the circumferential
   surface of carbon fiber is coplanar with the plane of carbon fiber axis
   then the attenuation of amplitude of vibrations and the natural
   frequencies of the laminated FFRC plates are significantly improved over
   those of the FFRC containing straight CNTs or wavy CNTs being coplanar
   with the transverse plane of carbon fiber.}},

Title = {{A land use regression model for ambient ultrafine particles in Montreal,
   Canada: A comparison of linear regression and a machine learning
   approach}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{65-72}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Existing evidence suggests that ambient ultrafine particles (UFPs) (
   <0.1 mu m) may contribute to acute cardiorespiratory morbidity. However,
   few studies have examined the long-term health effects of these
   pollutants owing in part to a need for exposure surfaces that can be
   applied in large population-based studies. To address this need, we
   developed a land use regression model for UFPs in Montreal, Canada using
   mobile monitoring data collected from 414 road segments during the
   summer and winter months between 2011 and 2012. Two different approaches
   were examined for model development including standard multivariable
   linear regression and a machine learning approach (kernel-based
   regularized least squares (KRLS)) that learns the functional form of
   covariate impacts on ambient UFP concentrations from the data. The final
   models included parameters for population density, ambient temperature
   and wind speed, land use parameters (park space and open space), length
   of local roads and rail, and estimated annual average NOx emissions from
   traffic. The final multivariable linear regression model explained 62\%
   of the spatial variation in ambient UFP concentrations whereas the KRLS
   model explained 79\% of the variance. The KRLS model performed slightly
   better than the linear regression model when evaluated using an external
   dataset (R-2=0.58 vs. 0.55) or a cross-validation procedure (R-2=0.67
   vs. 0.60). In general, our findings suggest that the KRLS approach may
   offer modest improvements in predictive performance compared to standard
   multivariable linear regression models used to estimate spatial
   variations in ambient UFPs. However, differences in predictive
   performance were not statistically significant when evaluated using the
   cross-validation procedure. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{Agglomeration of bed materials at high temperature is one of the most
   important and challenging problems for fluidized-bed biomass boilers for
   thermal/power generation. Inorganic alkali components from the fuel can
   be problematic as they form low-melting alkali compounds. In the present
   study, the critical amount of liquid (molten ash in real biomass boiler
   operations) that would result in severe bed agglomeration and
   defluidization was studied in a small pilot-scale bubbling fluidized bed
   (BFB) rig, operated at elevated temperatures (415-420 degrees C) using
   low melting-point salt (KOH) to simulate molten ash. In the BFB
   fluidization system tested, the critical liquid amount of simulate
   molten ash that could cause the bed materials start to form
   agglomeration/channeling, and form severe agglomeration/channeling (poor
   fluidization) is approx. 0.5 wt.\% and 0.8 wt.\% at a lower fluidizing
   gas velocity (3.9 U-mf) and a higher fluidizing gas velocity (5.9 U-mf),
   respectively. With more low melting -point compound (KOH) present in the
   BFB, more agglomerates of bed material are formed. Increasing the amount
   of liquid could change the fluidization behavior of group B (bubbling)
   particles towards group A (Aerated) and even C (Cohesive) depending on
   the amount of the low-melting-point compound in the bed material. (C)

Title = {{The core-shell internal nanostructure of soot - A criterion to model
   soot maturity}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{508-536}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A novel model called Surface Shell Formation (SSF) is developed which
   predicts soot maturity based on the equilibrium nanostructure of poly
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) inside soot primary particles. The
   characteristic isotropic core-graphitic shell internal nanostructure of
   soot primary particles is used to distinguish nascent from mature soot
   primary particles. A new sectional soot model is developed to track
   particle Hydrogen to Carbon (H/C) ratio and the growth in the molecular
   weight of PAHs inside soot primary particles. An independent Arrhenius
   term describes particle dehydrogenation/carbonization. It is shown that
   soot maturity depends on both particle size and H/C ratio. Graphitic
   shell formation in mature soot particles is related to the surface PAHs
   that change configuration from edge on surface for nascent soot to face
   on surface for mature soot particles. The new model is validated against
   experimental data for laminar premixed, partially premixed and diffusion
   flames. The SSF model addresses the two major limitations of the current
   soot modeling approaches. First, it predicts H/C ratio of soot particles
   by considering soot carbonization. Second, it distinguishes nascent soot
   from mature soot primary particles based on the internal nanostructure
   of soot primary particles and the presence of the graphitic shell. (C)

   This study extends the analysis to vertical pipe geometries due to their

   formulated and nondimensionalized. Laplace transforms and various forms
   of the expansion theorem are then used to solve the problems, resulting

   cases are then analyzed and the solutions are shown to simplify to
   various expressions in the literature. A graphical analysis is also

Title = {{Hybrid erosive jet micro-milling of sintered ceramic wafers with and
   without copper-filled through-holes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{230}},
Pages = {{198-210}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Abrasive slurry jet micro-machining (ASJM) in combination with abrasive
   air jet micro-machining (AJM) was used to mill micro-pockets in three
   different ceramic wafers: sintered alumina, aluminum nitride, and
   zirconium tin titanate. A composite substrate of aluminum nitride with
   an array of copper-filled through holes was also machined using a hybrid
   process of AJM and ASJM that capitalized on the significant differences
   in the erosive characteristics of each method. The objective was to
   investigate an alternative to laser micro-milling. The sintered ceramics
   were found to erode in a brittle manner by the dislodgment of grains
   upon abrasive particle impact. The eroded profiles produced by ASJM and
   AJM were modeled analytically.
   ASJM could make 100 mu m deep flat pockets, 500 mu m wide with 60
   degrees sidewall angles in the sintered ceramics using overlapping
   parallel channels. The shapes of the pockets could be predicted
   accurately as long as the depth of each machined pass was less than 50
   mu m. Pockets of the same size and roughness (R-a =0.4 mu m) could also
   be machined and modeled accurately using masked AJM. The surface
   roughness of the sintered ceramics was found to be insensitive to
   particle size, being controlled by the size of the sintered grains.
   Similar pockets could be machined in the aluminum nitride containing 180
   mu m diameter copper through-holes using ASJM provided that the maximum
   depth was about 25 mu m. Beyond that, the secondary slurry flow away
   from the jet footprint created unwanted etching of the copper-filled
   through holes leading to a lack of flatness. Deeper pockets in these
   substrates were machined using a hybrid AJM-ASJM methodology, in which
   AJM was used to selectively erode the brittle sintered ceramic without
   etching the ductile copper, followed by the leveling of the protruding
   copper pillars to the depth of the ceramic using ASJM. Computational
   fluid dynamics models were used to explain the results in terms of the
   large differences in the local particle impact angles and velocities in
   ASJM and AJM. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{3318-3328}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Stochastic honeycombs are a random, open cell honeycomb produced through
   a novel melt-stretching operation. While they have been shown to have
   excellent mechanical properties under out-of-plane compression, the
   energy absorption capacity of this cellular material has not yet been
   examined. The energy absorbed was determined over several of the
   integration intervals proposed in the literature as a function of
   density. For two intervals, the relationship between energy and density
   was linear, and for the other two, the rate of change in volumetric
   energy absorption capacity with density began to decrease at higher
   densities. This change happened at a core relative density of 11 \%.
   Additionally, the post-peak collapse mechanisms of four sample sets of
   varying density were compressed and scanned sequentially through X-ray
   tomography after preloading to various characteristic strain values.
   Webs were classified on the basis of their connectivity (bound on both
   sides or bound on one and free on the other). Unlike conventional
   honeycombs where all webs undergo the same failure mechanism, the range
   in geometry of the webs within a given sample led to a range of collapse
   mechanisms: elastic buckling, plastic buckling, and plastic buckling
   with fracture. At lower density, all three failure modes could be
   present in the same sample. At higher density, plastic buckling
   accompanied by web fracture was the main mode of failure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a multiple-input multiple-output modular
   multilevel dc-dc converter (MIMO-MMC) and its associated control scheme.
   The proposed topology has a bidirectional structure and may be utilized
   in both low- and high-power applications ranging from approximately
   100W-10MW. The modular structure of the MIMO-MMC enables efficient
   component utilization through module voltage and current sharing
   capabilities. The topology can supply or extract regulated power from an
   arbitrary number of controllable voltage nodes without requiring source
   or load multiplexing, resulting in minimized filtering requirements. The
   MIMO-MMC's structure is described, and the steady-state operation of the
   converter is theoretically analyzed. The dynamic models of the converter
   for both step-down and step-up configuration are derived and employed to
   devise an effective control algorithm for closed-loop operation. A
   general method is provided for stability analysis of the proposed
   closed-loop system followed by a case study verifying stability of the
   system at different operating points. The steady-state operation and
   dynamic response of the converter under both configurations is
   investigated through simulation and experiment.}},

Abstract = {{The hair follicle (HF) is a complex miniorgan that serves as an ideal
   model system to study stem cell (SC) interactions with the niche during
   growth and regeneration. Dermal papilla (DP) cells are required for SC
   activation during the adult hair cycle, but signal exchange between
   niche and SC precursors/transit-amplifying cell (TAC) progenitors that
   regulates HF morphogenetic growth is largely unknown. Here we use six
   transgenic reporters to isolate 14 major skin and HF cell populations.
   With next-generation RNA sequencing, we characterize their
   transcriptomes and define unique molecular signatures. SC precursors,
   TACs, and the DP niche express a plethora of ligands and receptors.
   Signaling interaction network analysis reveals a bird's-eye view of
   pathways implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Using a
   systematic tissue-wide approach, this work provides a comprehensive
   platform, linked to an interactive online database, to identify and
   further explore the SC/TAC/niche crosstalk regulating HF growth.}},

Title = {{Human sperm rheotaxis: a passive physical process}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 23}},
Abstract = {{A long-standing question in natural reproduction is how mammalian sperm
   navigate inside female reproductive tract and finally reach the egg
   cell, or oocyte. Recently, fluid flow was proposed as a long-range
   guidance cue for sperm navigation. Coitus induces fluid flow from
   oviduct to uterus, and sperm align themselves against the flow direction
   and swim upstream, a phenomenon termed rheotaxis. Whether sperm
   rheotaxis is a passive process dominated by fluid mechanics, or sperm
   actively sense and adapt to fluid flow remains controversial. Here we
   report the first quantitative study of sperm flagellar motion during
   human sperm rheotaxis and provide direct evidence indicating that sperm
   rheotaxis is a passive process. Experimental results show that there is
   no significant difference in flagellar beating amplitude and asymmetry
   between rheotaxis-turning sperm and those sperm swimming freely in the
   absence of fluid flow. Additionally, fluorescence image tracking shows
   no Ca2+ influx during sperm rheotaxis turning, further suggesting there
   is no active signal transduction during human sperm rheotaxis.}},

Abstract = {{The culture of isolated photoreceptors in vitro has remained elusive in
   neuroscience. By using defined hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels,
   photoreceptor survival and maturation in vitro is dramatically
   increased, as evidenced by upregulation of outer segment markers at the
   RNA and protein levels. While substrate stiffness is known to be a key
   factor influencing cell survival in vitro, it is shown that isolated
   photoreceptors do not respond to modifications in hydrogel stiffness
   modifications but depend, instead, on HA for survival. While the
   molecular pathways that are induced by HA on photoreceptors are unknown,
   mTOR activation is identified as the molecular mechanism underlying the
   pro-survival effect, and it is demonstrated that the canonical Wnt and
   RhoA pathways are intermediaries. This work establishes a valuable
   method for isolated photoreceptor culture in vitro, which will be useful
   in translational and basic retinal research. The pathways identified
   herein may be useful targets in retinal degeneration.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{Promoting coherent transport of phonons at material interfaces is a
   promising strategy for controlling thermal transport in nanostructures
   and an alternative to traditional methods based on structural defects.
   Coherent transport is particularly relevant in short-period
   heterostructures with smooth interfaces and long-wavelength
   heat-carrying phonons, such as two-dimensional superlattices of graphene
   and boron nitride. In this work, we predict phonon properties and
   thermal conductivities in these superlattices using a normal mode
   decomposition approach. We study the variation of the frequency
   dependence of these properties with the periodicity and interface
   configuration (zigzag and armchair) for superlattices with period
   lengths within the coherent regime. Our results showed that the thermal
   conductivity decreases significantly from the first period length (0.44
   nm) to the second period length (0.87 nm), 13\% across the interfaces
   and 16\% along the interfaces. For greater periods, the conductivity
   across the interfaces continues decreasing at a smaller rate of 11 W/mK
   per period length increase (0.43 nm), driven by changes in the phonon
   group velocities (coherent effects). In contrast, the conductivity along
   the interfaces slightly recovers at a rate of 2 W/mK per period, driven
   by changes in the phonon relaxation times (diffusive effects). By
   changing the interface configuration from armchair to zigzag, the
   conductivities for all period lengths increase by approximately 7\%
   across the interfaces and 19\% along the interfaces.}},

Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{Integrated optics has brought unprecedented levels of stability and
   performance to quantum photonic circuits. However, integrated devices
   are not merely micron-scale equivalents of their bulk-optics
   counterparts. By exploiting the inherently dispersive characteristics of
   the integrated setting, such devices can play a remarkably more
   versatile role in quantum circuit architectures. We show this by
   examining the implications of linear dispersion in an ordinary
   directional coupler. Dispersion unlocks several novel capabilities for
   this device, including in situ control over photon spectral and
   polarization entanglement, tunable photon time ordering, and
   entanglement-sensitive two-photon coincidence generation. Also revealed
   is an ability to maintain perfect two-photon anti-coalescence while
   tuning the interference visibility, which has no equivalent in bulk
   optics. The outcome of this work adds to a suite of state engineering
   and characterization tools that benefit from the advantages of
   integration. It also paves the way for reevaluating the possibilities
   offered by dispersion in other on-chip devices. (C) 2016 Optical Society

Abstract = {{Exploiting binding affinities between molecules is an established

   the diffusive release of the protein from a vehicle. This process, in
   contrast to degradation-controlled sustained-release formulations such
   as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres, is controlled through the
   strength of the binding interaction, the binding kinetics, and the
   concentration of binding partners. In the context of affinity-controlled
   release-and specifically the discovery or design of binding partners-we
   review advances in in vitro selection and directed evolution of

Title = {{Feature clustering for robust frequency-domain classification of EEG
   activity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{262}},
Pages = {{77-84}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: The analysis of electroencephalograms is often performed in
   the frequency-domain. These analyses typically involve the computation
   of spectral power either over pre-defined frequency bands (e.g. theta,
   delta, alpha, and beta bands) or over a large number of narrow frequency
   ranges. However, the former technique ignores variability in these
   frequency bands over time and between participants while the latter
   ignores the significant redundancy between these powers.
   New method: This paper details an unsupervised feature extraction method
   for EEG data that uses a clustering of features to agglomerate
   narrow-band spectral powers based on their similarities. This method
   computes a set of analogues to the traditional frequency bands that are
   data-driven and participant specific. A fast correlation-based filter
   was used to identify which of these agglomerated features were most
   useful for each investigated classification problem.
   Results: The new feature clustering algorithm was used to detect changes
   in three mental states and to detect the performance of three mental
   tasks. Balanced classification accuracies approaching or exceeding 70\%
   were attained for all classification problems.
   Comparison to existing methods: Classification accuracies attained by
   this algorithm were compared to those attained by two frequency-domain
   algorithms that did not employ clustering - a wide-band algorithm based
   on the spectral power within the theta, delta, alpha, and beta bands and
   a narrow-band algorithm based on the spectral power within 1-Hz ranges.
   Overall, the feature clustering algorithm was statistically superior to
   both alternative algorithms.
   Conclusions: The new feature clustering algorithm provides a promising
   alternative to conventional frequency-domain EEG analysis. (C) 2016

   rate requirements for more basic slags in order to prevent their
   crystallization. Both crystallization temperature and slag basicity
   affected the size and growth of the crystals. For slags with NBO/T >=
   1.6, crystallization kinetics is faster, the crystalline phases are
   opaque, and the size of crystals is highly dependent on the temperature.
   On the other hand, for slags of low basicity, the crystalline phases are

Abstract = {{We report experiments on superconducting flux qubits in a circuit

   and controlled, are coupled to a coplanar waveguide resonator.
   Dispersive qubit state readout reaches a maximum contrast of 72\%. We
   measure energy relaxation times at the symmetry point of 5 and 10 mu s,
   corresponding to 7 and 20 mu s when relaxation through the resonator due
   to Purcell effect is subtracted out, and levels of flux noise of 2.6 and
   2.7 mu Phi(0)/root Hz at 1 Hz for the two qubits. We discuss the origin
   of decoherence in the measured devices. The strong coupling between the
   qubits and the cavity leads to a large, cavity-mediated, qubit-qubit
   coupling. This coupling, which is characterized spectroscopically,
   reaches 38 MHz. These results demonstrate the potential of cQED as a
   platform for fundamental investigations of decoherence and quantum
   dynamics of flux qubits.}},

Title = {{Integrated Free Energy Model (IFEM) for microemulsions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{466}},
Pages = {{400-412}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{The Integrated Free Energy Model (IFEM) is a platform used to predict
   the solubilization of nonpolar oils in nonionic alkyl-polyethylene oxide
   (CXEOY) micelles starting from a free energy balance of costs and gains
   when surfactants from empty micelles and oil from a continuous oil phase
   assemble to form an oil-swollen micelle. IFEM considers lipophilic
   interactions between surfactant tails and oil solubilized in the core of
   micelles, and the interaction between surfactant tails and the oil
   solubilized in the surfactant tail domain, as well as oil-oil and
   surfactant-surfactant tail interactions. Expressions to calculate these
   lipophilic interactions from van der Waals (VDW) interaction potential
   were introduced in a previous publication. In this article, two new
   surfactant-water interactions are considered, surfactant head group
   dehydration during solubilization, and surfactant tail group
   dehydration. These six interaction terms, in addition to two entropy of
   mixing contributions (in the lipophilic and in the hydrophilic domains)
   make up the eight terms of the IFEM platform. Of these terms, only the
   headgroup dehydration requires a calibrated parameter. After calibrating
   this parameter, the model is capable of predicting experimental
   solubilization data, and the experimental trends reflected by a
   semi-empirical model, the Hydrophilic-Lipophilic-Difference +
   Net-Average-Curvature (HLD-NAC). Although there are numerous approaches
   to predict the surfactant-oil-water (SOW) phase behavior, the IFEM
   platform is the only one, to the knowledge of the authors that produces
   an explicit connection between molecular interactions and experimental
   data for real SOW systems. The IFEM platform can be programmed in a
   personal computer using relatively inexpensive software and its explicit
   nature opens the possibility to introduce additional interaction terms
   for more complex SOW systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a sensitive analytical technique with
   great promise for biological applications, especially when combined with
   microfluidics. Here, we report the first integration of ECL with digital
   microfluidics (DMF). ECL detectors were fabricated into the ITO-coated
   top plates of DMF devices, allowing for the generation of light from
   electrically excited luminophores in sample droplets. The new system was
   characterized by making electrochemical and ECL measurements of soluble
   mixtures of tris(phenanthroline)ruthenium(II) and tripropylamine (TPA)
   solutions. The system was then validated by application to an
   oligonucleotide hybridization assay, using magnetic particles bearing
   21-mer, deoxyribose analogues of the complement to microRNA-143
   (miRNA-143). The system detects single nucleotide mismatches with high
   specificity, and has a limit of detection of 1.5 femtomoles. The system
   is capable of detecting miRNA-143 in cancer cell lysates, allowing for
   the discrimination between the MCF-7 (less aggressive) and MDA-MB-231
   (more aggressive) cell lines. We propose that DMF-ECL represents a
   valuable new tool in the microfluidics toolbox for a wide variety of

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel ensemble classifier framework for improved
   classification of mammographic lesions in Computer-aided Detection
   (CADe) and Diagnosis (CADx) systems. Compared to previously developed
   classification techniques in mammography, the main novelty of proposed
   method is twofold: (1) the ``combined use{''} of different feature
   representations (of the same instance) and data resampling to generate
   more diverse and accurate base classifiers as ensemble members and (2)
   the incorporation of a novel ``ensemble selection{''} mechanism to
   further maximize the overall classification performance. In addition, as
   opposed to conventional ensemble learning, our proposed ensemble
   framework has the advantage of working well with both weak and strong
   classifiers, extensively used in mammography CADe and/or CADx systems.
   Extensive experiments have been performed using benchmark mammogram
   dataset to test the proposed method on two classification applications:
   (1) false-positive (FP) reduction using classification between masses
   and normal tissues, and (2) diagnosis using classification between
   malignant and benign masses. Results showed promising results that the
   proposed method (area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.932 and 0.878, each
   obtained for the aforementioned two classification applications,
   respectively) impressively outperforms (by an order of magnitude) the
   most commonly used single neural network (AUC = 0.819 and AUC = 0.754)
   and support vector machine (AUC = 0.849 and AUC = 0.773) based
   classification approaches. In addition, the feasibility of our method
   has been successfully demonstrated by comparing other state-of-the-art
   ensemble classification techniques such as Gentle AdaBoost and Random
   Forest learning algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are crucial nutrients for fish and
   have been identified as globally limited nutrients that are needed for
   ecosystem and human health. Greater understanding is needed into the
   processes influencing observed PUFA levels in fish because human demand
   for PUFA is increasing due to their nutritional benefits and because
   anthropogenic stresses threaten to reduce PUFA production. We present a
   general, process-based mass balance model for freshwater fish that
   estimates concentrations of n-3 (alpha-linolenic acid: ALA,
   eicosapentaenoic acid: EPA and docosahexaenoic acid: DHA) and n-6
   (linoleic acid: LIN and arachidonic acid: ARA) PUFA from prey food
   items. Our model considers the processes of dietary uptake, absorption
   efficiency, egestion, transformation (elongation and/or desaturation)
   and beta-oxidation. The model relies on rate constants derived from
   multiple regression analysis for egestion, transformation and
   beta-oxidation based on ecological and physiological variables (i.e.
   body weight, diet, PUFA interactions). All regression equations had
   adjusted R-2 >= 0.47 and p values <0.001. Application of the model to
   Yellow Perch (Percaflavescens) from the Upper Bay of Quinte, Canada
   provided estimates of ALA, EPA, DHA, LIN and ARA contents that were
   within a standard deviation of measured values without model
   calibration. The model showed that diet was the main source of ALA, EPA,
   LIN and ARA. Transformation of EPA to DHA was the dominant source of
   DHA. We hypothesize that within-fish transformation of precursor and the
   resultant product PUFA can compensate, to some extent, for dietary
   deficiencies in long chain PUFA in the diet of this freshwater fish. (C)

Abstract = {{Recent decades have witnessed steady improvements in our ability to
   harness the information-carrying capability of optical fibres. Will this
   process continue, or will progress eventually stall? Information theory
   predicts that all channels have a limited capacity depending on the
   available transmission resources, and thus it is inevitable that the
   pace of improvements will slow. However, information theory also
   provides insights into how transmission resources should, in principle,
   best be exploited, and thus may serve as a guide for where to look for
   better ways to squeeze more out of a precious resource. This tutorial
   paper reviews the basic concepts of information theory and their
   application in fibre-optic communications.}},

Abstract = {{High Content Screening (HCS) technologies that combine automated
   fluorescence microscopy with high throughput biotechnology have become
   powerful systems for studying cell biology and drug screening. These
   systems can produce more than 100 000 images per day, making their
   success dependent on automated image analysis. In this review, we
   describe the steps involved in quantifying microscopy images and
   different approaches for each step. Typically, individual cells are
   segmented from the background using a segmentation algorithm. Each cell
   is then quantified by extracting numerical features, such as area and
   intensity measurements. As these feature representations are typically
   high dimensional (>500), modern machine learning algorithms are used to
   classify, cluster and visualize cells in HCS experiments. Machine
   learning algorithms that learn feature representations, in addition to
   the classification or clustering task, have recently advanced the state
   of the art on several benchmarking tasks in the computer vision
   community. These techniques have also recently been applied to HCS image
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the flexible robotic manipulator is modelled as a
   distributed parameter system, represented by a group of partial
   differential equations and ordinary differential equations. Control is
   designed at the boundary of the robotic manipulator based on
   integral-barrier Lyapunov function to suppress the vibration of the
   elastic deflection and track the desired angular position. With the
   proposed boundary control, the manipulator can be driven to the desired
   set-point with angular position and elastic deflection stay under the
   former setting constraint. Uniformed boundedness of the closed-loop
   system under the unknown time-varying disturbance is achieved. Stability
   analysis of the closed-loop system is given by employing the Lyapunov
   stability theory. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed boundary controller for ensuring output constraint and
   suppressing vibrations.}},

Abstract = {{A novel one-step compression molding was proposed and successfully
   employed for preparation of closed-cell foams based on natural rubber
   (NR)/carbon black (CB) composite. The uniqueness of this new method was
   that both the foam density and expansion ratio became independent of the
   CB content. The rheometrical findings indicated that the increase in the
   CB content from 0 to 20 phr yielded a 0.91 and 3.51 N m increase in the
   initial and the final torque, respectively. The SEM results demonstrated
   that the prepared foam had three different layers including the skin,
   transition, and core layers. Almost 14-fold enhancement of the cell
   density (from 8 to 117 cells/cm(3)) was obtained by increasing the CB
   content in a constant foam density. Although, curing properties, cell
   morphology, and mechanical properties of the foam improved by increasing
   the CB content, the gradual deterioration was observed for sound
   absorption properties.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer cells, and in particular those found circulating in blood, can
   have widely varying phenotypes and molecular profiles despite a common
   origin. New methods are needed that can deconvolute the heterogeneity of
   cancer cells and sort small numbers of cells to aid in the
   characterization of cancer cell subpopulations: Here, we describe a new
   molecular approach to capturing cancer cells that isolates
   subpopulations using two-dimensional sorting. Using aptamer-mediated
   capture and antisense-triggered release, the new strategy sorts cells
   according to levels of two different markers and thereby sepatates them
   into their corresponding sub populations. Using a phenotypic assay) we
   demonstrate that the subpopulations isolated have markedly different
   properties. This system provides an important new tool for identifying

Abstract = {{Metal halide perovskites have rapidly advanced thin-film photovoltaic
   performance; as a result, the materials observed instabilities urgently
   require a solution. Using density functional theory (DFT), we show that
   a low energy of formation, exacerbated in the presence of humidity,
   explains the propensity of perovskites to decompose back into their
   precursors. We find, also using DFT, that intercalation of
   phenylethylammonium between perovskite layers introduces quantitatively
   appreciable van der Waals interactions. These drive an increased
   formation energy and should therefore improve material stability. Here
   we report reduced-dimensionality (quasi-2D) perovskite films that
   exhibit improved stability while retaining the high performance of
   conventional three-dimensional perovskites. Continuous tuning of the
   dimensionality, as assessed using photophysical studies, is achieved by
   the choice of stoichiometry in materials synthesis. We achieve the first
   certified hysteresis-free solar power conversion in a planar perovskite
   solar cell, obtaining a 15.3\% certified PCE, and observe greatly
   improved performance longevity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a rational analysis procedure is presented for modeling
   the shear behavior of steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) elements.
   In the development of the analysis procedure, the Disturbed Stress Field
   Model (DSFM), based on the Modified Compression Field Theory (MCFT), is
   modified by implementing constitutive models for SFRC, which are derived
   from the Diverse Embedment Model (DEM). For the contribution of steel
   fibers, a local stiffness matrix for fibers has been developed
   separately from those for concrete matrix and conventional
   reinforcement. The composite element stiffness matrix for an SFRC
   element with conventional reinforcement is then derived by superposing
   the three local stiffness matrixes. In the element stiffness matrix, the
   effect of shear slip at a crack is also taken into account by
   considering the resistance due to steel fibers against shear stress on
   crack surface. Through comparisons with the test results of SFRC panels
   previously reported in the literature, it is shown that the actual shear
   behavior of SFRC panels are accurately predicted by the proposed
   analysis procedure, not only for the shear strength but also for the
   shear strain at the failure. Through implementation into finite element
   analysis programs, the analysis procedure developed in this paper can be
   useful in the modeling of SFRC members and structures also containing
   conventional reinforcement.}},

Abstract = {{Wood ash may be an effective soil amendment in North America to restore
   acidified and low-nutrient forest soils, but little research exists
   beyond its effects on soil and plants. Eastern Red-backed Salamander
   (Plethodon cinereus (Green, 1818)) abundance was assessed in a northern
   hardwood forest 1 year following an ash-addition field trial. Plots were
   established with fly ash and bottom ash treatments of 0, 1, 4, and 8
   Mg.ha(-1) (n = 4), and cover boards were positioned both with and
   without ash beneath. One year following ash additions, salamander
   abundance had increased under boards with fly ash beneath, and bottom
   ash had no effect. Soil pH and electrical conductivity increased under
   cover boards with ash beneath them and for uncovered soil, and the
   effects were strongest under cover boards with ash beneath. The effects
   of ash were generally stronger at higher dosages, and fly ash was
   stronger than bottom ash. The moisture holding capacity of fly ash was
   60\% higher than the soil and was 63\% lower than the soil for bottom
   ash, but they had little effect on moisture of the forest floor. These
   results suggest that ash altered salamander abundance via soil pH and
   moisture and would not inhibit salamander movement over the forest
   floor.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of unresolved complex mixtures (UCMs) remains an
   ongoing challenge towards developing detailed and accurate inputs for
   modeling secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. Traditional
   techniques based on gas chromatography/electron impact-mass spectrometry
   induce excessive fragmentation, making it difficult to speciate and
   quantify isomers precisely. The goal of this study is to identify
   individual organic isomers by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with
   supersonic molecular beam (SMB-GC/MS, also known as GC/MS with Cold EI)
   and to incorporate speciated isomers into an SOA model that accounts for
   the specific structures elucidated. Two samples containing
   atmospherically relevant UCMs are analyzed. The relative isomer
   distributions exhibit remarkably consistent trends across a wide range
   of carbon numbers. Constitutional isomers of different alkanes are
   speciated and individually quantified as linear, branched for the first
   time by position of branching multiply branched, or unsaturated by
   degree of ring substitution and number of rings. Relative amounts of
   exact molecular structures are used as input parameters in an SOA box
   model to study the effects of molecular structures on SOA yields and
   volatility evolution. Highly substituted cyclic, mono substituted
   cyclic, and linear species have the highest SOA yields while branched
   alkanes formed the least SOA. The rate of functionalization of a
   representative UCM is found to be in agreement with current volatility
   basis set (VBS) parametetizations based on detailed knowledge of
   composition and known oxidation mechanisms, confirming the validity of
   VBS parameters currently used in air quality models. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This work introduces a simplified methodology for measuring the
   characteristic curvature (Cc) of commercial alkyl ethoxylate nonionic
   surfactants using carefully selected reference surfactants and oils that
   produce rapid and well defined separations in salinity scans. The Cc of
   the commercial reference surfactants was calculated using optimal
   salinities (S{*}) obtained from solubilization parameter curves, from
   interfacial tensions (for a selected system), and from emulsion
   stability tests. The latter provided a fast detection of S{*}, in a
   matter of minutes. The calibrated Cc of the reference surfactants was
   subsequently used to measure the Cc of various commercial alkyl
   ethoxylate surfactants. The combination of mixtures of test and
   reference surfactants and emulsion stability tests produced reproducible
   Cc values that could be obtained with simple bottle tests and in a
   timely manner. The values obtained using this methodology were
   cross-checked, and proved to be consistent, when using different
   combinations of reference surfactants and oils, and when conducted by
   different individuals. The standard deviation of Cc from these
   measurements was typically +/-0.2 Cc units, but it could be as large as
   25 \% of the Cc value for highly hydrophilic surfactants. After
   comparing the values of Cc obtained experimentally with values
   calculated from nominal structures (via a group contribution model) it
   became clear that there are differences between these values, likely
   because of the polydispersity of alkyl ethoxylate surfactants.}},

   scalable process to produce non-wetting metal surfaces. There are three
   main categories of superhydrophobic surfaces made by electrodeposition:
   (i) electrodeposits that are inherently non-wetting due to hierarchical
   roughness generated from the process; (ii) electrodeposits with plated
   surface roughness that are further modified with low surface energy
   material; (iii) composite electrodeposits with co-deposited inert and
   hydrophobic particles. A recently developed strategy to improve the
   durability during the application of superhydrophobic electrodeposits by
   controlling the microstructure of the metal matrix and the co-deposition
   of hydrophobic ceramic particles will also be addressed.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Validation of MRI-guided tumor boundary delineation for
   targeted prostate cancer therapy is achieved via correlation with
   gold-standard histopathology of radical prostatectomy specimens.
   Challenges to accurate correlation include matching the pathology
   sectioning plane with the in vivo imaging slice plane and correction for
   the deformation that occurs between in vivo imaging and histology. A
   methodology is presented for matching of the histological sectioning
   angle and position to the in vivo imaging slices.
   Methods: Patients (n = 4) with biochemical failure following external
   beam radiotherapy underwent diagnostic MRI to confirm localized
   recurrence of prostate cancer, followed by salvage radical
   prostatectomy. High-resolution 3-D MRI of the ex vivo specimens was
   acquired to determine the pathology sectioning angle that best matched
   the in vivo imaging slice plane, using matching anatomical features and
   implanted fiducials. A novel sectioning device was developed to guide
   sectioning at the correct angle, and to assist the insertion of
   reference dye marks to aid in histopathology reconstruction.
   Results: The percentage difference in the positioning of the urethra in
   the ex vivo pathology sections compared to the positioning in in vivo
   images was reduced from 34\% to 7\% through slicing at the best match
   angle. Reference dye marks were generated, which were visible in ex vivo
   imaging, in the tissue sections before and after processing, and in
   histology sections.
   Conclusions: The method achieved an almost fivefold reduction in the
   slice-matching error and is readily implementable in combination with
   standard MRI technology. The technique will be employed to generate
   datasets for correlation of whole-specimen prostate histopathology with
   in vivo diagnostic MRI using 3-D deformable registration, allowing
   assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of MRI parameters for
   prostate cancer. Although developed specifically for prostate, the
   method is readily adaptable to other types of whole tissue specimen,
   such as mastectomy or liver resection. (C) 2016 American Association of

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine how training set size affects the accuracy of
   knowledge-based treatment planning (KBP) models.
   Methods: The authors selected four models from three classes of KBP
   approaches, corresponding to three distinct quantities that KBP models
   may predict: dose-volume histogram (DVH) points, DVH curves, and
   objective function weights. DVH point prediction is done using the best
   plan from a database of similar clinical plans; DVH curve prediction
   employs principal component analysis and multiple linear regression; and
   objective function weights uses either logistic regression or K-nearest
   neighbors. The authors trained each KBP model using training sets of
   sizes n = 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200. The authors set aside
   100 randomly selected patients from their cohort of 315 prostate cancer
   patients from Princess Margaret Cancer Center to serve as a validation
   set for all experiments. For each value of n, the authors randomly
   selected 100 different training sets with replacement from the remaining
   215 patients. Each of the 100 training sets was used to train a model
   for each value of n and for each KBT approach. To evaluate the models,
   the authors predicted the KBP endpoints for each of the 100 patients in
   the validation set. To estimate the minimum required sample size, the
   authors used statistical testing to determine if the median error for
   each sample size from 10 to 150 is equal to the median error for the
   maximum sample size of 200.
   Results: The minimum required sample size was different for each model.
   The DVH point prediction method predicts two dose metrics for the
   bladder and two for the rectum. The authors found that more than 200
   samples were required to achieve consistent model predictions for all
   four metrics. For DVH curve prediction, the authors found that at least
   75 samples were needed to accurately predict the bladder DVH, while only
   20 samples were needed to predict the rectum DVH. Finally, for objective
   function weight prediction, at least 10 samples were needed to train the
   logistic regression model, while at least 150 samples were required to
   train the K-nearest neighbor methodology.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, the minimum required sample size needed to
   accurately train KBP models for prostate cancer depends on the specific
   model and endpoint to be predicted. The authors' results may provide a
   lower bound for more complicated tumor sites. (C) 2016 American

Abstract = {{Fireside deposits in recovery boilers are typically white, red, pink,
   grey, black, or occasionally yellow, depending on where they are in the
   boiler, the mechanisms by which they are formed, and the environment to
   which they are exposed. Although rare, blue deposits have been reported,
   and some were ``bluer{''} than others. This study systematically
   examines the cause of the blue coloration of deposits in recovery
   boilers. The results show that for a deposit to become blue, it must a)
   contain sodium carbonate, b) contain a small amount of manganese, c) be
   molten or partially molten, and d) have exposure to an oxidizing
   atmosphere. Because deposits always contain sodium carbonate and
   manganese, these requirements suggest that blue deposits can form only
   in the superheater region of the recovery boiler when oxidizing
   conditions prevail. Blue coloration is thus more likely to be observed
   in boilers operating at a reduced firing load with a high excess oxygen
   target.}},

Title = {{Study of the bubble nucleation and growth mechanisms in high-pressure
   foam injection molding through in-situ visualization}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{2-13}},

Abstract = {{Although major efforts have been made to uncover the complex mechanisms
   of bubble nucleation and dynamics in foam injection molding, most
   theories and interpretations still require additional experimental
   verification. An innovative visualization mold was employed with which
   the mechanisms of bubble nucleation and growth in high-pressure foam
   injection molding were investigated. For the first time, the development
   of the cell structure in high-pressure foam injection molding was
   comprehensively explored and experimentally verified via in-situ
   visualization using polystyrene and super-critical carbon dioxide
   system. Two bubble-nucleation mechanisms were observed, namely, the
   nucleation due to a pressure drop at the gate during filling, and the
   nucleation due to melt shrinkage in the cavity after filling. It was the
   cavity pressure that determined which bubble-nucleation mechanism was
   dominated between these two in high-pressure foam injection molding. The
   final cellular structure and morphology of the foamed parts were, in
   turn, determined by the governing bubble-nucleation mechanism. It was
   concluded that a melt packing pressure is required to re-dissolve the
   bubbles nucleated at the gate back into the melt, and that a larger
   packing pressure was needed with a higher cell density by increasing the
   injection speed, the gate resistance, or the blowing-agent content.
   Because of the high resistance in the narrow cavity, the bubbles within
   the cavity were not pressurized uniformly, when the packing pressure was
   applied. A higher cell density increased the compressibility of the
   two-phase gas-melt mixture, aggravating the non-uniformity of the
   pressure in the cavity. Consequently, the bubbles far from the gate
   could not be pressurized immediately, and thereby could not dissolve
   into the polymer melt quickly. Additionally, the lower temperature of
   the melt far from the gate further delayed the permeation of gas into
   the polymer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio networks can facilitate seamless mobility to users
   considering their effective use of the dynamic spectrum access. This is
   performed by proactive/reactive adaptation of transmission operations in
   response to the wireless environment changes. One of these operations
   includes handoff between various wireless domains. The handoff here is
   not just a registration with a new base station, but it is also a
   negotiation to get access to the available channels locally in
   coexistence with the primary users. This dynamic adaptation between
   channels, known as spectrum handoff (SH), significantly impacts the time
   of handoff reconnection, which raises many questions about the
   functioning of the cognitive radio solution in the next generation of
   network systems. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new method for
   roaming mobile users, particularly networks that employ small cells such
   as femtocells in order to reduce the unnecessary channel adaptations.
   This paper proposes a new entity, namely, channel assigning agent for
   managing SH, operator database, and channel access authentication. The
   goal of this mechanism is to retain the same channel used by a mobile
   user whenever possible to improve network performance by reducing the
   unnecessary SHs. The modeling and efficiency of the proposed scheme are
   validated through simulation results. The proposed solution improves the
   accessibility of resources and stability of mobile radio connections
   that benefits mobile users as well as operators.}},

Abstract = {{Phasor measurement units (PMUs) are being increasingly deployed to
   improve monitoring and control of the power grid due to their improved
   data synchronization and reporting rates in comparison with legacy
   metering devices. However, one drawback of their higher data rates is
   the associated increase in bandwidth (for transmission) and storage
   requirements (for data archives). Fortunately, typical grid behavior can
   lead to significant compression opportunities for phasor angle
   measurements. For example, operation of the grid at nearnominal
   frequency results in small changes in phase angles between frames, and
   the similarity in frequencies throughout the system results in a high
   level of correlation between phasor angles of different PMUs. This paper
   presents several methods for preprocessing of phasor angles that take
   advantage of these system characteristics, including a new
   method-frequency compensated difference encoding-that is able to
   significantly reduce angle data entropy. After the preprocessor stage,
   the signal is input to an entropy encoder, based on Golomb-Rice codes,
   that is ideal for high-throughput signal compression. The ability of the
   proposed methods to compress phase angles is demonstrated using a large
   corpus of data-over 1 billion phasor angles from 25 data sets-captured
   during typical and atypical grid conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A piezoelectric fuel injector that directly controls the injection
   process using a piezoelectric actuator is presented. In the design
   pursued, energizing the actuator initiates the displacement of the
   injection needle and allows the fuel spray to form. The direct-acting
   concept is implemented by developing a motion inverter that reverses the
   direction of the input force and displacement and amplifies the output
   displacement. A fuel injector prototype was built, consisting of an
   actuator module that housed the preloaded piezoelectric actuator, a
   motion inverter module, and a dispensingmodule consisting of the
   injection nozzle and needle. Experiments with input voltage signals
   corresponding to those used in diesel engines verified the performance
   of the fuel injector prototype. The prototype was successfully tested
   for 250-, 400-, 600-, and 800-mu s holding times and only showed a
   response delay due to hysteresis, which can be reduced using closed-loop
   control with the integration of the electronic control unit (ECU). Since
   the prototype takes advantage of direct control of the injection needle,
   it allows for more precise control of the timing of the injections. The
   design also has the potential to control the quantity of injected fuel

Abstract = {{We investigate the problem of secure broadcasting over fast fading
   channels with imperfect main channel state information (CSI) at the
   transmitter. In particular, we analyze the effect of the noisy
   estimation of the main CSI on the throughput of a broadcast channel
   where the transmission is intended for multiple legitimate receivers in
   the presence of an eavesdropper. Besides, we consider the realistic case
   where the transmitter is only aware of the statistics of the
   eavesdropper's CSI and not of its channel's realizations. First, we
   discuss the common message transmission case where the source broadcasts
   the same information to all the receivers, and we provide an upper and a
   lower bound on the ergodic secrecy capacity. For this case, we show that
   the secrecy rate is limited by the legitimate receiver having, on
   average, the worst main channel link and we prove that a nonzero secrecy
   rate can still be achieved even when the CSI at the transmitter is
   noisy. Then, we look at the independent messages case where the
   transmitter broadcasts multiple messages to the receivers, and each
   intended user is interested in an independent message. For this case, we
   present an expression for the achievable secrecy sum-rate and an upper
   bound on the secrecy sum-capacity and we show that, in the limit of
   large number of legitimate receivers K, our achievable secrecy sum-rate
   follows the scaling law log ((1-alpha)log(K)), where a is the estimation
   error variance of the main CSI. The special cases of high SNR, perfect
   and no-main CSI are also analyzed. Analytical derivations and numerical
   results are presented to illustrate the obtained expressions for the
   case of independent and identically distributed Rayleigh fading
   channels.}},

Abstract = {{Entangled photon pairs must often be spatially separated for their
   subsequent manipulation in integrated quantum circuits. Separation that
   is both deterministic and universal can in principle be achieved through
   anti-coalescent two-photon quantum interference. However, such
   interference-facilitated pair separation (IFPS) has not been extensively
   studied in the integrated setting, which has important implications on
   performance. This work provides a detailed review of IFPS and examines
   how integrated device dependencies such as dispersion impact separation
   fidelity and interference visibility. The analysis applies equally to
   both on-chip and in-fiber implementations. When coupler dispersion is
   present, the separation performance can depend on photon bandwidth,
   spectral entanglement and the dispersion. By design, reduction in the
   separation fidelity due to loss of non-classical interference can be
   perfectly compensated for by classical wavelength demultiplexing
   effects. This work informs the design of devices for universal photon
   pair separation of states with tunable arbitrary properties.}},

Abstract = {{The contact of blood with artificial materials generally leads to
   immediate protein adsorption (fouling), which mediates subsequent
   biological processes such as platelet adhesion and activation leading to
   thrombosis. Recent progress in the preparation of surfaces able to
   prevent protein fouling offers a potential avenue to mitigate this
   undesirable effect. In the present contribution, we have prepared
   several types of state-of-the-art antifouling polymer brushes on
   polycarbonate plastic substrate, and investigated their ability to
   prevent platelet adhesion and thrombus formation under dynamic flow
   conditions using human blood. Moreover, we compared the ability of such
   brushes-grafted on quartz via an adlayer analogous to that used on
   polycarbonate-to prevent protein adsorption from human blood plasma,
   assessed for the first time by means of an ultrahigh frequency acoustic
   wave sensor. Results show that the prevention of such a phenomenon
   constitutes one promising route toward enhanced resistance to thrombus
   formation, and suggest that antifouling polymer brushes could be of
   service in biomedical applications requiring extensive blood-material
   surface contact.}},

Abstract = {{Pyrolysis liquid biofuel (also called bio-oil or pyrolysis oil) is a
   promising renewable fuel for stationary heat and power generation;
   however, the fuel properties, combustion performance, and combustion
   emissions degrade with fuel aging. The aging effects of softwood bark
   pyrolysis liquid biofuel on fuel properties and combustion performance
   are studied. To investigate the aging effects on fuel properties, the
   solid content, viscosity, estimated Sauter mean diameter (SMD), and
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) residue of pure pyrolysis liquid are
   considered. Furthermore, the CO emission, unburned hydrocarbon (UHC),
   and organic fraction of particulate matter (PM) emissions {[}also called
   carbonaceous residue (CR)] from combustion of the aged pyrolysis liquid
   biofuel/ethanol blend are measured to investigate the effect of aging on
   the combustion performance in a swirl spray burner. All measurements are
   employed for two batches of pyrolysis liquid biofuel with two levels of
   solid content. Results show that fuel properties, combustion emissions,
   and combustion performance of pyrolysis liquid become degraded as it is
   stored for longer periods of time. The results also support the
   accelerated aging correlation from the literature, which is based on
   viscosity and can accurately predict the effect of natural aging on the
   fuel properties, combustion emissions, and combustion performance.}},

Title = {{Optimum pMOS-to-nMOS Width Ratio for Efficient Subthreshold CMOS

Abstract = {{The subthreshold region of operation in digital CMOS circuits provides a
   suitable low-power solution for many applications that need tremendously
   low-energy operation. However, this advantage comes at the cost of
   speed, so enhancing the speed of subthreshold circuits can expand their
   application spectrum. This paper presents the optimum pMOS-to-nMOS width
   ratio that leads to the maximum frequency of operation in the
   subthreshold region with no extra energy cost. The optimum pMOS-to-nMOS
   width ratio is obtained and compared through three approaches: 1)
   finding the maximum current-over-capacitance ratio of a biased
   transistor; 2) deriving an analytical expression by minimizing the delay
   of an inverter; and 3) simulating different CMOS logic gates in the
   subthreshold region. Simulation results illustrate that in the
   subthreshold region, the frequency attains its maximum at the optimum
   pMOS-to-nMOS width ratio independent of the supply voltage. Using this
   optimum value in designing a carry-look-ahead adder improves the
   propagation delay, energy consumption, and energy-delay product by up to
   33\%, 36\%, and 57\%, receptively, compared with when the conventional
   pMOS-to-nMOS width ratio (in the superthreshold region) is used. We
   verified our analytical model by performing circuit simulations in four
   CMOS technologies (TSMC 180 nm, IBM 130 nm, TSMC 90 nm, and ST 65 nm).}},

Abstract = {{A novel design of piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer is introduced,
   suitable for operation at temperatures of up to 700 degrees C- 800
   degrees C. Lithium niobate single crystal is chosen as the piezoelectric
   element primarily due to the high Curie temperature of 1200 degrees C. A
   backing element based on a porous ceramic is designed for which the pore
   volume fraction and average pore diameter in the ceramic matrix can be
   controlled in the manufacturing process; this enables the acoustic
   impedance and attenuation to be selected to match their optimal values
   as predicted by a one- dimensional transducer model of the entire
   transducer. Porous zirconia is selected as the ceramic matrix material
   of the backing element to obtain an ultrasonic signal with center
   frequency of 2.7-3 MHz, and 3-dB bandwidth of 90\%-95\% at the targeted
   operating temperature. Acoustic coupling of the piezocrystal to the
   backing element and matching layer is investigated using commercially
   available high-temperature adhesives and brazing alloys. The performance
   of the transducer as a function of temperature is studied. Stable
   bonding and clear signals were obtained using an aluminum brazing alloy

   In this article, the development of a dc (direct current)-based
   thermocouple driver is discussed. The new setup allows higher frequency
   (480 Hz) of heating pulses applied to the thermocouple. The higher
   switching frequency improves the thermocouple temperature reading
   accuracy and decreases the time interval between the measurements by a
   factor of eight, compared to existing HTT devices. The development of a
   dc power HTT apparatus, its calibration, and examples of its use in the
   studies of the crystallization of oxide mixtures are presented in this
   article.}},

Title = {{The biomechanical effect of anteversion and modular neck offset on
   stress shielding for short-stem versus conventional long-stem hip
   implants}},

Abstract = {{Short-stem hip implants are increasingly common since they preserve host
   bone stock and presumably reduce stress shielding by improving load
   distribution in the proximal femur. Stress shielding may lead to
   decreased bone density, implant loosening, and fracture. However, few
   biomechanical studies have examined short-stem hip implants. The purpose
   of this study was to compare short-stem vs. standard length stemmed
   implants for stress shielding effects due to anteversion-retroversion,
   anterior-posterior position, and modular neck offset.
   Twelve artificial femurs were implanted with either a short-stem
   modular-neck implant or a conventional length monolithic implant in 0
   degrees or 15 degrees of anteversion. Three modular neck options were
   tested in the short-stem implants. Three control femurs remained intact.
   Femurs were mounted in adduction and subjected to axial loading. Strain
   gauge values were collected to validate a Finite Element (FE) model,
   which was used to simulate the full range of physiologically possible
   anteversion and anterior-posterior combinations (n = 25 combinations per
   implant). Calcar stress was compared between implants and across each
   implant's range of anteversion using one and two-way ANOVA. Stress
   shielding was defined as the overall change in stress compared to an
   intact femur.
   The FE model compared well with experimental strains (intact: slope =
   0.898, R = 0.943; short-stem: slope = 0.731, R = 0.948; standard-stem:
   slope = 0.743, R = 0.859); correction factors were used to adjust slopes
   to unity. No implant anteversion showed significant reduction in stress
   shielding (alpha = 0.05, p > 0.05). Stress shielding was significantly
   higher in the standard-stem implant (63\% change from intact femur, p <
   0.001) than in short-stem implants (29-39\% change, p < 0.001).
   Short-stem implants reduce stress shielding compared to standard length
   stemmed implants, while implant anteversion and anterior-posterior
   position had no effect. Therefore, short-stem implants have a greater
   likelihood of maintaining calcar bone strength in the long term. (C)

Abstract = {{We investigate the electro-optic properties of black phosphorus (BP)
   thin films for optical modulation in the mid-infrared frequencies. Our
   calculation indicates that an applied out-of-plane electric field may
   lead to red-, blue-, or bidirectional shift in BP's absorption edge.
   This is due to the interplay between the field-induced quantum-confined
   Franz-Keldysh effect and the Pauli-blocked Burstein-Moss shift. The
   relative contribution of the two electro-absorption mechanisms depends
   on doping range, operating wavelength, and BP film thickness. For
   proof-of concept, simple modulator configuration with BP overlaid over a
   silicon nanowire is studied. Simulation results show that operating BP
   in the quantum-confined Franz-Keldysh regime can improve the maximal
   attainable absorption as well as power efficiency compared to its

Abstract = {{Bark was liquefied in polyhydric alcohols of various functionality,
   equivalent weight, and hydroxyl type, and organic solvents of varying
   polarity to determine how these features impact liquefaction behavior
   and polyol characteristics. It was found that the liquefaction yield was
   highly tunable with the use of polyhydric alcohols with primary hydroxyl
   groups, with low equivalent weight alcohols providing the highest
   liquefaction yield (59.3\%). This showed that the highly polar hydroxyls
   (primary) and short chains created a highly protic solvent that improved
   conversion and protected the biopolymers from degradation. This was
   corroborated by H-1 NMR analysis that indicated a greater amount of
   sugar degradation products were observed when polyhydric alcohols with
   secondary hydroxyl groups were used. Regarding organic solvents, ketonic
   solvents showed the greatest increase in the liquefaction yield. The
   composition and carbon content analysis of the suggested that the highly
   polar carbonyl group of ketonic solvents like acetyl acetone and
   cyclohexanone may have hindered condensation side reactions. These
   results have shown that selection of polyhydric alcohols and organic
   cosolvents can be quite impactful on the liquefaction yield and the

Abstract = {{This study outlines the influence of a series of reaction conditions on
   the yield and reactivity of the glycidyl etherification reaction of the
   bark extractive-based bioepoxy monomer (E-epoxy). To maximize the yield
   and epoxy content, the glycidylation reaction was examined with various
   substrates, solvents, catalysts, time periods, reaction temperatures,
   and sodium hydroxide/hydroxyl (NaOH/OHV) ratios. Spray-dried bark
   extractives were used as substrates due to their higher hydroxyl group
   content and lower molecular weight compared to the oven-dried bark
   extractives. A dioxane/water combination was selected from among four
   solvents based on the yield and epoxy equivalent weights of the final
   product, and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide was chosen as a ring-opening
   catalyst due to its effect of suppressing hydrolysis. Furthermore, a
   response surface methodology was applied to find the optimal reaction
   time, reaction temperature, and NaOH/OHV ratio of the E-epoxy monomer.
   The maximum extent of conversion with minimum epoxy equivalent weight
   was achieved after 4.5 h with an NaOH/OHV ratio of 3.4 at 80 degrees C.
   This work identifies the effects of reaction parameters on the yield and
   reactivity of E-epoxy and sheds new light on the glycidylation reaction
   between epichlorohydrin and renewable biomass.}},

Abstract = {{We used a high-pressure differential scanning calorimeter (HP-DSC) to
   study polymer plasticization by compressed gases at pressures of up to
   30 MPa for polylactide (PLA), polycarbonate (PC), isotactic
   polypropylene (iPP), and polystyrene (PS). The pressure reached values
   twice as high as the previously published data. We found that the
   polymer/carbon dioxide (CO2) system's heating curves have an
   unidentified endothermic peak above 5 MPa, which turns out to be from
   CO2's phase transition. The HP-DSC could accurately determine the
   depression of the glass transition temperature (T-g), crystallization
   temperature (T-c), and melting temperature (T-m) of various polymers at
   low pressures by simply starting at a higher temperature to avoid CO2's
   phase transition; however, the increased plasticization effect of the
   dissolved CO2 lowered the T-g to the level of overlapping with CO2's
   phase transition phenomena at elevated pressures, and therefore, the
   depressed T-g could not be measured above 6 MPa for PLA, PC, or PS. On
   the other hand, the T-c of iPP decreased with an increase in pressure,
   whereas T-m values of PLA and iPP decreased slightly with an increase in
   pressure and then remained almost unchanged above a certain pressure,
   which may indicate an increased hydrostatic pressure effect at elevated
   pressures.}},

   high-pressure pulse was simulated by taking into account the resulting
   elasto-plastic deformation, the solid-fluid interaction and the
   adiabatic temperature rise. The dynamics of the transient stresses below
   the loaded surface was captured by our model. Three aspects of the
   explosive shock load were accordingly examined: (i) the explosive
   thickness and (ii) the explosive overhang length and thickness upon the
   resulting deformation pattern. Upon the complete dissipation of the
   shock, we were able to determine the distribution of the residual stress
   in the principal directions. Compressive residual stresses were observed
   in the region at and below the surface of the loaded end. The above
   predictions were experimentally validated using explosively loaded
   aluminum blocks. The experimental findings revealed general agreement
   with the finite element predictions of both the deformation pattern and
   the residual stresses.}},

Abstract = {{Transplantation of pluripotent stem cells and their differentiated
   progeny has the potential to preserve or regenerate functional pathways
   and improve function after central nervous system injury. However, their
   utility has been hampered by poor survival and the potential to form
   tumors. Peptide-modified biomaterials influence cell adhesion, survival
   and differentiation in vitro, but their effectiveness in vivo remains
   uncertain. We synthesized a peptide-modified, minimally invasive,
   injectable hydrogel comprised of hyaluronan and methylcellulose to
   enhance the survival and differentiation of human induced pluripotent
   stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Cells were
   transplanted sub acutely after a moderate clip compression rat spinal
   cord injury. The hydrogel, modified with the RGD peptide and
   platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-A), promoted early survival and
   integration of grafted cells. However, prolific teratoma formation was
   evident when cells were transplanted in media at longer survival times,
   indicating that either this cell line or the way in which it was
   cultured is unsuitable for human use. Interestingly, teratoma formation
   was attenuated when cells were transplanted in the hydrogel, where most
   cells differentiated to a glial phenotype. Thus, this hydrogel promoted
   cell survival and integration, and attenuated teratoma formation by
   promoting cell differentiation. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by

Title = {{Optimal lot-sizing and maintenance policy for a partially observable

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{88-98}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a joint optimization of economic manufacturing
   quantity (EMQ) and maintenance policy for a production facility subject
   to deterioration and condition monitoring (CM) at the times the
   production runs are completed. The production facility deterioration is
   described by a hidden continuous-time Markov process. CM provides
   partial information about the hidden state of the production facility.
   The objective is to develop a jointly optimal lot sizing and maintenance
   policy using multivariate Bayesian control approach. The posterior
   probability statistic is updated at each sampling epoch using Bayes'
   rule. When the posterior probability crosses a control limit, the
   production system is stopped and full inspection is initiated, followed
   possibly by preventive maintenance (PM). Production will resume when all
   available inventory is depleted or when PM action is completed,
   whichever occurs later. We also assume that the production and demand
   rates are constant over time. The problem is formulated and solved in
   the semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) framework. The objective is to
   minimize the long-run expected average cost per unit time. The shortage
   and set-up costs are considered in the model along with the maintenance,
   inventory holding, and lost production costs. A numerical example is
   provided and a sensitivity analysis is performed. A comparison with the
   age-based maintenance policy shows an outstanding performance of the new
   model and the control policy proposed in this paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This critical review analyzes and compares the efficiency of select
   technologies that harness solar energy for point-of-use water
   disinfection, including photocatalysts, photosensitizing chromophores,

   The volume rate of water that each material can treat to achieve 99\%
   inactivation of model microorganisms, given the same sunlight exposure,
   was estimated on the basis of literature data and theoretical
   predictions, in the context of both currently reported efficiencies and
   theoretical thermodynamic maximum efficiencies. Each material is further
   critiqued in terms of the spectral match with sunlight, quantum
   efficiency, and the relative strength of the resulting disinfecting
   agent such as hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen, and UVC radiation. This
   review emphasizes critical needs for disinfection strategies that can
   efficiently inactivate more than one type of microorganism. In addition,
   the approach described herein can guide future research in efforts to
   identify more efficient materials and technologies for capturing

   and Suppression}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the source of the spurious numerical
   oscillations often observed in simulations using the well-known
   Preissmann slot method and proposes a nonoscillatory numerical fix that
   can efficiently suppress the numerical oscillations. The root of these
   oscillations is identified by comparing the orbits calculated by a
   first-order Godunov type model with an ideal numerical orbit in the
   phase plane. It is found that in the very thin layer in the vicinity of
   the conduit roof the numerical model has insufficient numerical
   viscosity to avoid the often-observed oscillations. In order to remove
   these spurious oscillations, an approximate Riemann solution is proposed
   that automatically enhances the numerical viscosity whenever the water
   level is in the vicinity of the conduit roof and the pressurization of
   the conduit is proximate. A comparison of results from the proposed
   model with both experimental data and analytical solutions show that it
   can provide nonoscillatory solutions over a wide range of the wave
   velocities ranging from 10 to 1,000m/s. Furthermore, the proposed model
   effectively controls data smearing.}},

Abstract = {{The multi-closed-loop deployable mechanism generates distortion which is
   caused by the deviation of each rod after being assembled as a result of
   manufacturing error, which leads to the degradation of the antenna
   performance or excess of the given envelope. The multi-closed-loop
   deployable mechanisms consist of many closed loops and have complicated
   topology structure and loop constraints coupling. The positioning
   accuracy analysis of such mechanism is more difficult than the
   open-chain mechanisms or the single-loop mechanisms. In order to solve
   this problem, first, based on the minimum of elastic deformation energy,
   the distortion analysis model is constructed. Second, the sensitivity of
   the mechanism distortion to the individual rod deviation is investigated
   by examining the Lagrange multipliers. By means of this model, the
   allowable tolerance of multi-closed-loop deployable mechanism is
   discussed and calculated. Last but not least, the above method and model
   are applied to the four-closed-loop deployable mechanism to solve the
   problems of its distortion, sensitivity, and tolerance in both fully
   deployed and folded configurations. It is demonstrated in this paper
   that the model and method proposed are well accommodated to the accuracy
   analysis of such mechanisms. The achievement of the research will help
   reduce the difficulties of the assembling and manufacturing of the
   multi-closed-loop deployable mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Atherosclerotic plaques are found at distinct locations in the arterial
   system, despite the exposure to systemic risk factors of the entire
   vascular tree. From the study of arterial bifurcation regions, emerges
   ample evidence that haemodynamics are involved in the local onset and
   progression of the atherosclerotic disease. This observed
   co-localisation of disturbed flow regions and lesion prevalence at
   geometrically predisposed districts such as arterial bifurcations has
   led to the formulation of a `haemodynamic hypothesis', that in this
   review is grounded to the most current research concerning localising
   factors of vascular disease. In particular, this review focuses on
   carotid and coronary bifurcations because of their primary relevance to
   stroke and heart attack. We highlight reported relationships between
   atherosclerotic plaque location, progression and composition, and fluid
   forces at vessel's wall, in particular shear stress and its
   `easier-to-measure' surrogates, i.e. vascular geometric attributes
   (because geo metry shapes the flow) and intravascular flow features
   (because they mediate disturbed shear stress), in order to give more
   insight in plaque initiation and destabilisation. Analogous to Virchow's
   triad for thrombosis, atherosclerosis must be thought of as subject to a
   triad of, and especially interactions among, haemodynamic forces,
   systemic risk factors, and the biological response of the wall.}},

Abstract = {{Gas flow in small pore throats in compact rocks is usually affected by
   the gas slippage effect due to the dense structure and low porosity of
   the rocks. In this study, permeability and porosity of two granitic
   gneiss specimens under different pore and confining pressures are
   measured. Petrographic studies are also performed using X-ray
   diffraction, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy
   coupled with an energy-dispersive spectrometer. Test data indicate that
   the gas flow in the compact rock does not follow Darcy's law due to the
   effect of gas slippage, and the measured permeability needs to be
   corrected by the gas slippage effect. The test results show that the gas
   slippage effect increases subsequently when the pore pressure is low,
   which leads to the measured permeability higher than the absolute
   permeability. The influence of confining pressure on the impact rate of
   the slippage effect appears to approach an upper limit symptomatically.
   It is found that a power law describes well the relationship between the
   absolute permeability and the effective porosity. A correlation of the
   slippage factor and the absolute permeability is provided. When the
   confining pressure is high and the pore pressure is low, the flows are
   slip flow and transitional flow and traditional fluid dynamics N-S
   equations are not applicable and Knudsen's diffusion equations should be
   used.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic ridesharing involves a service provider that matches potential
   drivers and passengers with similar itineraries allowing them to travel
   together and share the costs. Centralized (binary integer programming)
   and decentralized (dynamic auction-based multi-agent) optimization
   algorithms are formulated to match passengers and drivers. Numerical
   experiments on the decentralized approach provides near optimal
   solutions for single-driver, single-passenger cases with lower
   computational burden. The decentralized approach is then extended to
   accommodate both multi-passenger and multi-driver matches. The results
   indicate higher user cost savings and vehicle kilometers traveled (VICE)
   savings when allowing multi-passenger rides. Sensitivity analysis is
   conducted to test the impact of the service provider commission rate on
   revenue and system reliability. While short term revenue can be
   maximized at a commission rate of roughly 50\% of each trip's cost, the
   resulting drop in system reliability would be expected to reduce
   patronage and revenues in the longer term. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Objectives To engineer the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the
   heterologous production of linalool.
   Results Expression of linalool synthase gene from Lavandula angustifolia
   enabled heterologous production of linalool in S. cerevisiae.
   Downregulation of ERG9 gene, that encodes squalene synthase, by
   replacing its native promoter with the repressible MET3 promoter in the
   presence of methionine resulted in accumulation of 78 A mu g linalool
   l(-1) in the culture medium. This was more than twice that produced by
   the control strain. The highest linalool titer was obtained by combined
   repression of ERG9 and overexpression of tHMG1. The yeast strain
   harboring both modifications produced 95 mu g linalool l(-1).
   Conclusions Although overexpression of tHMG1 and downregulation of ERG9
   enhanced linalool titers threefold in the engineered yeast strain,
   alleviating linalool toxicity is necessary for further improvement of
   linalool biosynthesis in yeast.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: More than 70 million couples worldwide are affected by
   infertility, with male-factor infertility accounting for about half of
   the cases. Semen analysis is critical for determining male fertility
   potential, but conventional testing is costly and complex. Here, we
   demonstrate a paper-based microfluidic approach to quantify male
   fertility potential, simultaneously measuring 3 critical semen
   parameters in 10 min: live and motile sperm concentrations and sperm
   motility.
   METHODS: The device measures the colorimetric change of yellow
   tetrazolium dye to purple formazan by the diaphorase flavoprotein enzyme
   present in metabolically active human sperm to quantify live and motile
   sperm concentration. Sperm motility was determined as the ratio of
   motile to live sperm. We assessed the performance of the device by use
   of clinical semen samples, in parallel with standard clinical
   approaches.
   RESULTS: Detection limits of 8.46 and 15.18 million/mL were achieved for
   live and motile sperm concentrations, respectively. The live and motile
   sperm concentrations and motility values from our device correlated with
   those of the standard clinical approaches (R-2 >= 0.84). In all cases,
   our device provided 100\% agreement in terms of clinical outcome. The
   device was also robust and could tolerate conditions of high absolute
   humidity (22.8 g/m(3)) up to 16 weeks when packaged with desiccant.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our device outperforms existing commercial paper-based
   assays by quantitatively measuring live and motile sperm concentrations
   and motility, in only 10 min. This approach is applicable to current
   clinical practices as well as self-diagnostic applications. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Synchrotron X-ray radiography, due to its high temporal and spatial
   resolutions, provides a valuable means for understanding the in operando
   water transport behaviour in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells.
   The purpose of this study is to address the specific artefact of imaging
   sample movement, which poses a significant challenge to
   synchrotron-based imaging for fuel cell diagnostics. Specifically, the
   impact of the micrometer-scale movement of the sample was determined,
   and a correction methodology was developed. At a photon energy level of
   20 keV, a maximum movement of 7.5 mu m resulted in a false water
   thickness of 0.93 cm (9\% higher than the maximum amount of water that
   the experimental apparatus could physically contain). This artefact was
   corrected by image translations based on the relationship between the
   false water thickness value and the distance moved by the sample. The
   implementation of this correction method led to a significant reduction
   in false water thickness (to similar to 0.04 cm). Furthermore, to
   account for inaccuracies in pixel intensities due to the scattering
   effect and higher harmonics, a calibration technique was introduced for
   the liquid water X-ray attenuation coefficient, which was found to be
   0.657 +/- 0.023 cm(-1) at 20 keV. The work presented in this paper
   provides valuable tools for artefact compensation and accuracy
   improvements for dynamic synchrotron X-ray imaging of fuel cells.}},

Abstract = {{Instant social video sharing which combines the online social network
   and user-generated short video streaming services, has become popular in
   today's Internet. Cloud-based hosting of such instant social video
   contents has become a norm to serve the increasing users with
   user-generated contents. A fundamental problem of cloud-based social
   video sharing service is that users are located globally, who cannot be
   served with good service quality with a single cloud provider. In this
   paper, we investigate the feasibility of dispersing instant social video
   contents to multiple cloud providers. The challenge is that inter-cloud
   social propagation is indispensable with such multi-cloud social video
   hosting, yet such inter-cloud traffic incurs substantial operational
   cost. We analyze and formulate the multi-cloud hosting of an instant
   social video system as an optimization problem. We conduct large-scale
   measurement studies to show the characteristics of instant social video
   deployment, and demonstrate the trade-off between satisfying users with
   their ideal cloud providers, and reducing the inter-cloud data
   propagation. Our measurement insights of the social propagation allow us
   to propose a heuristic algorithm with acceptable complexity to solve the
   optimization problem, by partitioning a propagation-weighted social
   graph in two phases: a preference-aware initial cloud provider selection
   and a propagation-aware re-hosting. Our simulation experiments driven by
   real-world social network traces show the superiority of our design.}},

   METHODS MEDLINE, Embase, and Psyclnfo were systematically searched for
   studies that reported on the cognitive status of UIA patients before and
   after aneurysm treatment. The search was restricted to prospective
   cohort and case control studies published between January 1, 1998, and
   January 1, 2013. The analyses focused on the effect of treatment on
   general cognitive functioning, with an emphasis on 4 specific cognitive
   domains: executive functions, verbal and visual memory, and visuospatial
   functions.
   RESULTS Eight studies, with a total of 281 patients, were included in
   the meta-analysis. Treatment did not affect general cognitive
   functioning (effect size {[}ES] -0.22 {[}95\% CI -0.78 to 0.34]).
   Executive functions and verbal memory domains trended toward
   posttreatment impairment (ES -0.46 {[}95\% CI -0.93 to 0.01] and ES
   -0.31 {[}95\% CI -1.24 to 0.61]), and performance of visual memory tasks
   trended toward posttreatment improvement (ES 1.48 {[}95\% CI -0.36 to
   3.31]). Lastly, treatment did not significantly affect visuospatial
   functions (ES -0.08 {[}95\% CI -0.30 to 0.45]).
   CONCLUSIONS The treatment of an UIA does not seem to affect long-term
   cognitive function. However, definitive conclusions were not possible
   due to the paucity of studies addressing this issue.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal poling of femtosecond laser written waveguides was investigated
   using second-harmonic microscopy under three approaches: (1) pre-poling
   and (2) post-poling in which fused silica substrates were poled before
   or after waveguide formation, respectively, and (3) double poling in
   which poling was applied both before and after laser writing. Effective
   nonlinear waveguide interaction strength was assessed relative to the
   mode profile and the assessments demonstrated an erasure effect of 81\%
   in pre-poling and an ion migration blocking effect of 26\% in
   post-poling. Double poling was found to recover the nonlinearity over
   the modal zone, overcoming prior difficulties with combining laser
   processing and thermal poling, opening up a future avenue for creating
   active devices through femtosecond laser writing of nonlinear optical
   circuits in fused silica. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles can provide significant improvements in the diagnosis and
   treatment of cancer. How nanoparticle size, shape, and surface chemistry
   can affect their accumulation, retention, and penetration in tumors
   remains heavily investigated, because such findings provide guiding
   principles for engineering optimal nano-systems for tumor targeting.
   Currently, the experimental focus has been on particle design and not
   the biological system. Here, we varied tumor volume to determine whether
   cancer pathophysiology can influence tumor accumulation and penetration
   of different sized nanoparticles. Monte Carlo simulations were also used
   to model the process of nanoparticle accumulation. We discovered that
   changes in pathophysiology associated with tumor volume can selectively
   change tumor uptake of nanoparticles of varying size. We further
   determine that nanoparticle retention within tumors depends on the
   frequency of interaction of particles with the perivascular
   extracellular matrix for smaller nanoparticles, whereas transport of
   larger nanomaterials is dominated by Brownian motion. These results
   reveal that nanoparticles can potentially be personalized according to a
   patient's disease state to achieve optimal diagnostic and therapeutic
   outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Because soil microbes drive many of the processes underpinning ecosystem
   services provided by soils, understanding how cropping systems affect
   soil microbial communities is important for productive and sustainable
   management. We characterized and compared soil microbial communities
   under restored prairie and three potential cellulosic biomass crops
   (corn, switchgrass, and mixed prairie grasses) in two spatial
   experimental designs - side-by-side plots where plant communities were
   in their second year since establishment (i.e., intensive sites) and
   regionally distributed fields where plant communities had been in place
   for at least 10years (i.e., extensive sites). We assessed microbial
   community structure and composition using lipid analysis, pyrosequencing
   of rRNA genes (targeting fungi, bacteria, archaea, and lower
   eukaryotes), and targeted metagenomics of nifH genes. For the more
   recently established intensive sites, soil type was more important than
   plant community in determining microbial community structure, while
   plant community was the more important driver of soil microbial
   communities for the older extensive sites where microbial communities
   under corn were clearly differentiated from those under switchgrass and
   restored prairie. Bacterial and fungal biomasses, especially biomass of
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, were higher under perennial grasses and
   restored prairie, suggesting a more active carbon pool and greater
   microbial processing potential, which should be beneficial for plant
   acquisition and ecosystem retention of carbon, water, and nutrients.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a highly flexible multichannel output stage for
   battery-powered portable electric stimulators (ESs), based on novel
   power converter architecture. Compared with other solutions, the
   presented output stage for transcutaneous (surface) stimulations
   increases the number of applicable therapies, improves the battery
   operating time through reduced power consumption, and potentially
   results in more comfortable and shorter healing therapies. The new
   hybrid switch-mode power converter is a combination of flyback and
   switched-capacitor (SC) topologies. The flyback steps up the battery
   voltage and provides galvanic isolation. The following power-efficient
   SC stage replaces lossy linear current sources (CSs) of conventional
   solutions and produces pulses with a much higher slew rate, reducing the
   pulse energy needed to cause the stimulus. The SC also inherently
   produces pulses with zero-net charge, eliminating bulky blocking
   capacitors and/or dedicated discharging circuits. The regulation of the
   amplitudes of the pulses is performed with a new digital
   voltage-programmed current mode controller, forcing the output of the SC
   stage to behave as a CS. The flexible digital controller allows for
   creation of various types of pulses and also features several levels of
   patient protection. An experimental prototype of the output stage has
   undergone proof of principle tests with able-bodied individuals. The
   results show that the new output stage produces pulses with a 1-mA/ns
   slew rate, about two orders of magnitude higher than the other known
   solutions. The trials show that the faster slew rate pulses generate the
   same muscle contraction with 34\% lower amplitudes, reducing energy
   consumption by 55\%, allowing longer battery life of portable ES
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency-domain photoacoustic radar (FD-PAR) imaging of absorbers in
   turbid media and their comparison and/or validation as well as
   co-registration with their corresponding ultrasound (US) images are
   demonstrated in this paper. Also presented are the FD-PAR tomography and
   the effects of reducing the number of scan lines (or angles) on image
   quality, resolution, and contrast. The FD-PAR modality uses
   intensity-modulated (coded) continuouswave laser sources driven by
   frequency-swept (chirp) waveforms. The spatial cross-correlation
   function between the PAresponse and the reference signal used for laser
   source modulation produces the reconstructed image. Live animal testing
   is demonstrated, and images of comparable signal-to-noise ratio,
   contrast, and spatial resolution were obtained. Various image
   improvement techniques to further reduce absorber spread and artifacts
   in the images such as normalization, filtering, and amplification were
   also investigated. The co-registered image produced from the combined US
   and PA images provides more information than both images independently.
   The significance of this work lies in the fact that achieving PA imaging
   functionality on a commercial ultrasound instrument could accelerate its
   clinical acceptance and use. This work is aimed at functional PA imaging
   of small animals in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Multifunctional shape memory composites composed of shape memory
   polymers and shape memory alloys exhibit superior shape memory
   properties; therefore, it is of great interest to researchers to model
   their thermo-mechanical behavior numerically. Although a number of
   constitutive models of shape memory alloys and shape memory polymers
   have been developed, very few models have been developed for shape
   memory composites and validated with experimental data. In this study,
   we first review separately constitutive models of shape memory alloys
   and shape memory polymers developed in previous studies. Both models
   were validated with thermo-mechanical tests conducted on a shape memory
   alloy fiber and shape memory polymer, respectively. A constitutive model
   for the shape memory composite was then developed utilizing the
   homogenization scheme. Shape memory composites containing 0.5\% or 1\%
   of the shape memory alloy fiber volume content embedded in the shape
   memory polymer matrix were fabricated. Thermo-mechanical tests were
   carried out on these shape memory composites to validate the proposed
   constitutive model. The experimental results showed that the proposed
   shape memory composite model was able to predict the general trend of
   the thermo-mechanical behavior of the shape memory composites.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue-engineered heart valves are promising alternatives to address the
   limitations of current valve replacements, particularly for growing
   children. Current heart valve tissue engineering strategies involve the
   selection of biomaterial scaffolds, cell types, and often in vitro
   culture conditions aimed at regenerating a valve for implantation and
   subsequent maturation in vivo. However, identifying optimal combinations
   of cell sources, biomaterials, and/or bioreactor conditions to produce
   functional, durable valve tissue remains a challenge. Despite some
   short-term success in animal models, attempts to recapitulate aspects of
   the native heart valve environment based on best guesses' of a limited
   number of regulatory factors have not proven effective. Better outcomes
   for valve tissue regeneration will likely require a systems-level
   understanding of the relationships between multiple interacting
   regulatory factors and their effects on cell function and tissue
   formation. Until recently, conventional culture methods have not allowed
   for multiple design parameters to be considered at once. Emerging
   microtechnologies are well suited to systematically probe multiple
   inputs, in combination, in high throughput and with great precision.
   When combined with statistical and network systems analyses, these
   microtechnologies have excellent potential to define multivariate
   signal-response relationships and reveal key regulatory pathways for
   robust functional tissue regeneration. WIREs Syst Biol Med 2016,

   Composition}},
Journal = {{MSYSTEMS}},

Abstract = {{In the United States, humans spend the majority of their time indoors,
   where they are exposed to the microbiome of the built environment (BE)
   they inhabit. Despite the ubiquity of microbes in BEs and their
   potential impacts on health and building materials, basic questions
   about the microbiology of these environments remain unanswered. We
   present a study on the impacts of geography, material type, human
   interaction, location in a room, seasonal variation, and indoor and
   microenvironmental parameters on bacterial communities in offices. Our
   data elucidate several important features of microbial communities in
   BEs. First, under normal office environmental conditions, bacterial
   communities do not differ on the basis of surface material (e.g.,
   ceiling tile or carpet) but do differ on the basis of the location in a
   room (e.g., ceiling or floor), two features that are often conflated but
   that we are able to separate here. We suspect that previous work showing
   differences in bacterial composition with surface material was likely
   detecting differences based on different usage patterns. Next, we find
   that offices have city-specific bacterial communities, such that we can
   accurately predict which city an office microbiome sample is derived
   from, but office-specific bacterial communities are less apparent. This
   differs from previous work, which has suggested office-specific
   compositions of bacterial communities. We again suspect that the
   difference from prior work arises from different usage patterns. As has
   been previously shown, we observe that human skin contributes heavily to
   the composition of BE surfaces.
   IMPORTANCE Our study highlights several points that should impact the
   design of future studies of the microbiology of BEs. First, projects
   tracking changes in BE bacterial communities should focus sampling
   efforts on surveying different locations in offices and in different
   cities but not necessarily different materials or different offices in
   the same city. Next, disturbance due to repeated sampling, though
   detectable, is small compared to that due to other variables, opening up
   a range of longitudinal study designs in the BE. Next, studies requiring
   more samples than can be sequenced on a single sequencing run (which is
   increasingly common) must control for run effects by including some of
   the same samples in all of the sequencing runs as technical replicates.
   Finally, detailed tracking of indoor and material environment covariates
   is likely not essential for BE microbiome studies, as the normal range
   of indoor environmental conditions is likely not large enough to impact
   bacterial communities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the behaviour of a composite walling system

   (DSCW) specimens with overall wall dimensions of 1626 mm high by 720 mm
   wide were tested. Steel sheet-concrete connections were provided by
   intermediate fasteners along the height and width of the wall to
   generate composite action. Two types of concrete namely
   self-consolidating concrete (SCC) and highly ductile engineered
   cementitious composite (ECC) as well as cold formed profiled steel sheet
   having same geometry but with two different yield strengths were
   incorporated to investigate their influence on the composite wall
   behaviour. The benefit of using mild over high strength steel was
   demonstrated through more ductile failure. Overall, ECC wall showed
   better performance showing lower stiffness degradation and higher
   displacement ductility as well as higher energy ductility (based on
   hysteretic loop) compared to its SCC counterpart. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper presents the methodology of generating a corresponding
   electrical circuit for a simple piezoelectric plate modeled with the
   finite volume method. The corresponding circuit is implemented using a
   circuit simulation software and the simulation results are compared to
   the finite volume modeling results for validation. It is noticed that
   both, the finite volume model and its corresponding circuit, generate
   identical results. The results of a corresponding circuit based on the
   finite volume model are also compared to the results of a corresponding
   circuit based on a simplified analytical model for a long piezoelectric
   plate, and to finite element simulation results for the same plate. It
   is observed that, for one control volume, the finite volume model
   corresponding circuit and the simplified analytical model corresponding
   circuit generate close results. It is also noticed that the results of
   the two corresponding circuits are different from the best approximation
   results obtained with high resolution finite element simulations due to
   the approximations made in the simplified analytical model and the fact
   that only one finite volume was used in the finite volume model. The
   implementation of the circuit can be automated for higher order systems
   by a program that takes as an input the matrix of the system and the
   forcing function vector, and returns a net list for the circuit. (C)

Title = {{Improvements in the mechanical properties of carbon nanotube fibers
   through graphene oxide interlocking}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{291-299}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted remarkable attention due to their
   high mechanical performance and low density which are desirable for
   application as lightweight materials in automotive and aerospace
   industries to improve fuel efficiency. However, CNT fibers generally
   exhibit far lower mechanical properties (strength, toughness, etc.) than
   individual CNTs due to the weak interfacial shear strength between
   adjacent shells, nanotubes, and nanotube bundles, causing insufficient
   load transfer. In this study, to improve the interfacial shear strength
   of the fibers, graphene oxide (GO) was infiltrated into the CNT fibers
   to interlock CNT bundles. GO was selected due to its high mechanical
   properties and similar carbon-based structure as the CNT fibers. In
   addition, GO interfaces are known to exhibit higher frictional forces
   for sliding contacts than those found for pristine graphene sheets,
   which makes it more desirable for enhancing the shear interactions. GO
   particles with a width of similar to 40 nm, which match closely to the
   void size within fibers, were optimal for enhancing the mechanical
   properties of the CNT fibers. Tensile testing demonstrated optimized GO
   infiltrated CNT fibers exhibited improvement in: stiffness similar to
   100\%, yield strength similar to 110\%, ultimate tensile strength
   similar to 56\%, and energy to failure similar to 30\% of pristine CNT
   fibers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CARBON}},

Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{313-333}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Because of its unique electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties,
   graphene is being explored for various applications and has attracted
   enormous academic and industrial interest. Graphene and its derivatives
   have also been considered as promising nanoscale fillers in gas barrier
   application of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). In this study, recent
   research and development of the utilization of graphene and its
   derivatives in the fabrication of nanocomposites with different polymer
   matrices for barrier application are explored, and most synthesis
   methods of graphene-based PNCs such as solution and melt mixing, in situ
   polymerization, and layer-by-layer process are covered. Graphene layers
   in the polymer matrix are capable of producing a tortuous path, which
   acts as a barrier for gases. A high tortuosity leads to superior barrier
   properties and lower permeability of PNCs. The influence of the
   intrinsic properties of these fillers (graphene and its derivatives) and
   their state of dispersion in polymer matrix on the gas barrier
   properties of graphene/PNCs is discussed. Analytical modeling aspects of
   barrier performance of graphene/PNCs are also reviewed in detail. Key
   permeability modeling techniques for gas separation mixed matrix
   membranes are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Twinning in body-centered cubic metals is typically attributed to glide
   of 1/6 < 111 > dislocations originated from material defects. Here we
   report an alternative mechanism for twin formation in body-centered
   cubic nanowires using molecular dynamics simulations. In this mechanism,
   twinning is triggered by dissociation of the 1/6 < 111 > dislocation
   into two 1/12 < 111 > partials gliding on adjacent (211) planes. By
   comparing the generalized stacking fault energies of the two competing
   twin boundary configurations in five different BCC crystals, the
   propensity of a particular mechanism to occur is evaluated. The
   fundamental insight gained from this study will help engineer nanoscale
   materials with novel mechanical properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this work, the solubility of rivaroxaban (form I) in binary solvent
   mixtures of ethyl acetate (EA) with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF),
   N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) was firstly
   experimentally measured over the temperature range from (278.15 to
   318.15) K. Then the measured solubility data were correlated with such
   semiempirical thermodynamic models as Jouyban-Acree (JA) equation and
   Buchowski (lambda h) equation. The crystal form of the residual solids
   in equilibrium with liquids was identified by powder X-ray diffraction
   (PXRD). The melting temperature and fusion enthalpy were determined
   using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results show that,
   the solubility of rivaroxaban generally increases with the temperature
   and decreases with the increase in the content of EA in the binary
   solvent mixtures. Furthermore, when lambda h equation is used to
   correlate the solubility of rivaroxaban with the temperature in each
   solvent mixture, the average relative deviation (ARD) between the
   experimental and calculated values is about 0.0671, while it is about
   0.0905 when JA equation is employed to correlate the solubility with the
   temperature and the composition of solvent mixtures simultaneously. (C)

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) periodic nanostructures underpin a promising
   research direction on the frontiers of nanoscience and technology to
   generate advanced materials for exploiting novel photonic crystal (PC)
   and nanofluidic functionalities. However, formation of uniform and
   defect-free 3D periodic structures over large areas that can further
   integrate into multifunctional devices has remained a major challenge.
   Here, we introduce a laser scanning holographic method for 3D exposure
   in thick photoresist that combines the unique advantages of large area
   3D holographic interference lithography (HIL) with the flexible
   patterning of laser direct writing to form both micro-and
   nano-structures in a single exposure step. Phase mask interference
   patterns accumulated over multiple overlapping scans are shown to stitch
   seamlessly and form uniform 3D nanostructure with beam size scaled to
   small 200 mu m diameter. In this way, laser scanning is presented as a
   facile means to embed 3D PC structure within microfluidic channels for
   integration into an optofluidic lab-on-chip, demonstrating a new laser
   HIL writing approach for creating multi-scale integrated microsystems.}},

Abstract = {{Structural neuroimaging of humans with typical and atypical
   sex-chromosome complements has established the marked influence of both
   Yand X-/Y-chromosome dosage on total brain volume (TBV) and identified
   potential cortical substrates for the psychiatric phenotypes associated
   with sex-chromosome aneuploidy (SCA). Here, in a cohort of 354 humans
   with varying karyotypes (XX, XY, XXX, XXY, XYY, XXYY, XXXXY), we
   investigate sex and SCA effects on subcortical size and shape; focusing
   on the striatum, pallidum and thalamus. Wefind large effect-size
   differences in the volume and shape of all three structures as a
   function of sex and SCA. We correct for TBV effects with a novel
   allometric method harnessing normative scaling rules for subcortical
   size and shape in humans, which we derive here for the first time. We
   show that all three subcortical volumes scale sublinearly with TBV among
   healthy humans, mirroring known relationships between subcortical volume
   and TBV among species. Traditional TBV correction methods assume linear
   scaling and can therefore invert or exaggerate sex and SCA effects on
   subcortical anatomy. Allometric analysis restricts sex-differences to:
   (1) greater pallidal volume (PV) in males, and (2) relative caudate head
   expansion and ventral striatum contraction in females. Allometric
   analysis of SCA reveals that supernumerary X-and Y-chromosomes both
   cause disproportionate reductions in PV, and coordinated deformations of
   striatopallidal shape. Our study provides a novel understanding of sex
   and sex-chromosome dosage effects on subcortical organization, using an
   allometric approach that can be generalized to other basic and clinical
   structural neuroimaging settings.}},

Month = {{FEB 24}},
Abstract = {{Fluid flowing through a deformable porous medium imparts viscous drag on
   the solid matrix, causing it to deform. This effect is investigated
   theoretically and experimentally in a one-dimensional configuration. The
   experiments consist of the downwards flow of water through a saturated
   pack of small, soft, hydrogel spheres, driven by a pressure head that
   can be increased or decreased. As the pressure head is increased, the
   effective permeability of the medium decreases and, in contrast to flow
   through a rigid medium, the flux of water is found to increase towards a
   finite upper bound such that it becomes insensitive to changes in the
   pressure head. Measurements of the internal deformation, extracted by
   particle tracking, show that the medium compacts differentially, with
   the porosity being lower at the base than at the upper free surface. A
   general theoretical model is derived, and the predictions of the model
   give good agreement with experimental measurements from a series of
   experiments in which the applied pressure head is sequentially
   increased. However, contrary to theory, all the experimental results
   display a distinct and repeatable hysteresis: the flux through the
   material for a particular applied pressure drop is appreciably lower
   when the pressure has been decreased to that value compared to when it
   has been increased to the same value.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a source of correlated photon pairs which will have
   applications in future integrated quantum photonic circuits. The source
   utilizes spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in a dispersion-engineered
   nanowaveguide made of AlGaAs, which has merits of negligible two-photon
   absorption and low spontaneous Raman scattering (SpRS). We observe a
   coincidence-to-accidental (CAR) ratio up to 177, mainly limited by
   propagation losses. Experimental results agree well with theoretical
   predictions of the SFWM photon pair generation and the SpRS noise photon
   generation. We also study the effects from the SpRS, propagation losses,
   and waveguide lengths on the quality of our source. (C) 2016 Optical

Abstract = {{Precise control of biosystems requires development of materials that can
   dynamically change physicochemical properties. Inspired by the ability
   of proteins to alter their conformation to mediate function, we explored
   the use of DNA as molecular keys to assemble and transform colloidal
   nanoparticle systems. The systems consist of a core nanoparticle
   surrounded by small satellites, the conformation of which can be
   transformed in response toDNAvia a toe-hold displacementmechanism. The
   conformational changes can alter the optical properties and biological
   interactions of the assembled nanosystem. Photoluminescent signal is
   altered by changes in fluorophore-modified particle distance, whereas
   cellular targeting efficiency is increased 2.5 times by changing the
   surface display of targeting ligands. These concepts provide strategies
   for engineering dynamic nanotechnology systems for navigating complex
   biological environments.}},

Abstract = {{This study involved the development of a model for evaluating the
   potential costs and benefits of ozone control with combined
   particle/activated carbon filtration (referred to here as activated
   carbon filtration) in buildings. The modeling effort included the
   prediction of indoor ozone and ozone reaction products with and without
   activated carbon filtration in the HVAC system. Benefit-to-cost ratios
   were estimated for various types of buildings in 12 American cities in 5
   different climate zones. Health benefits were evaluated using
   disability-adjusted life-years attributed to the difference in indoor
   ozone concentration with and without activated carbon filtration, and
   included city-specific age demographics for each simulation. Costs of
   activated-carbon filters included capital cost differences when compared
   against conventional HVAC filters of similar minimum efficiency
   reporting value rating (e.g., minimum efficiency reporting value 6-8),
   energy penalties due to additional pressure drop, and regional utility
   rates. When assuming a single-pass ozone removal efficiency of 60\%,
   carbon filtration during the ozone season was beneficial and
   economically viable in commercial office buildings, long-term
   health-care facilities, and K-12 schools. Residential activated carbon
   filtration could be economically viable for conditions of higher ozone
   removal efficiencies, lower filter costs, and lower pressure drop across
   the filter.}},

   Biosynthesis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 16}},
Abstract = {{The Jagn1 protein was indentified in a SILAC proteomic screen of
   proteins that are increased in insulinoma cells expressing a
   folding-deficient proinsulin. Jagn1 mRNA was detected in primary rodent
   islets and in insulinoma cell lines and the levels were increased in
   response to ER stress. The function of Jagn1 was assessed in insulinoma
   cells by both knock-down and overexpression approaches. Knock-down of
   Jagn1 caused an increase in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
   resulting from an increase in proinsulin biosynthesis. In contrast,
   overexpression of Jagn1 in insulinoma cells resulted in reduced cellular
   proinsulin and insulin levels. Our results identify a novel role for
   Jagn1 in regulating proinsulin biosynthesis in pancreatic beta-cells.
   Under ER stress conditions Jagn1 is induced which might contribute to
   reducing proinsulin biosynthesis, in part by helping to relieve the
   protein folding load in the ER in an effort to restore ER homeostasis.}},

Abstract = {{Four field campaigns were conducted between February 2014 and January
   2015 to measure emissions from light-duty gasoline direct injection
   (GDI) vehicles (2013 Ford Focus) in an urban near-road environment in
   Toronto, Canada. Measurements of CO2, CO, NOx, black carbon (BC),
   benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene-xylenes (BTEX), and size-resolved
   particle number (PN) were recorded 15 m from the roadway and converted
   to fuel-based emission factors (EFs). Other than for NOx and CO, the GDI
   engine had elevated emissions compared to the Toronto fleet, with BC EFs
   in the 73rd percentile, BTEX EFs in the 80-90th percentile, and PN EFs
   in the 75th percentile during wintertime measurements. Additionally, for
   three campaigns, a second platform for measuring PN and CO2 was placed
   1.5-3 m from the roadway to quantify changes in PN with distance from
   point of emission. GDI vehicle PN EFs were found to increase by up to
   240\% with increasing distance from the roadway, predominantly due to an
   increasing fraction of sub-40 nm particles. PN and BC EFs from the same
   engine technology were also measured in the laboratory. BC EFs agreed
   within 20\% between the laboratory and real-world measurements; however,
   laboratory PN EFs were an order of magnitude lower due to exhaust
   conditioning.}},

Abstract = {{Autophagy is an essential component of innate immunity, enabling the
   detection and elimination of intracellular pathogens. Legionella
   pneumophila, an intracellular pathogen that can cause a severe pneumonia
   in humans, is able to modulate autophagy through the action of effector
   proteins that are translocated into the host cell by the pathogen's
   Dot/Icm type IV secretion system. Many of these effectors share
   structural and sequence similarity with eukaryotic proteins. Indeed,
   phylogenetic analyses have indicated their acquisition by horizontal
   gene transfer from a eukaryotic host. Here we report that L. pneumophila
   translocates the effector protein sphingosine-1 phosphate lyase (LpSpl)
   to target the host sphingosine biosynthesis and to curtail autophagy.
   Our structural characterization of LpSpl and its comparison with human
   SPL reveals high structural conservation, thus supporting prior
   phylogenetic analysis. We show that LpSpl possesses S1P lyase activity
   that was abrogated by mutation of the catalytic site residues. L.
   pneumophila triggers the reduction of several sphingolipids critical for
   macrophage function in an LpSpl-dependent and -independent manner. LpSpl
   activity alone was sufficient to prevent an increase in sphingosine
   levels in infected host cells and to inhibit autophagy during macrophage
   infection. LpSpl was required for efficient infection of A/J mice,
   highlighting an important virulence role for this effector. Thus, we
   have uncovered a previously unidentified mechanism used by intracellular
   pathogens to inhibit autophagy, namely the disruption of host
   sphingolipid biosynthesis.}},

Abstract = {{We have systematically studied interface structure formed by vapor-phase
   deposition of typical transition metal oxide MoO3 on organic
   semiconductors. Eight organic hole transport materials have been used in
   this study. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy are used to measure the evolution of the
   physical, chemical and electronic structure of the interfaces at various
   stages of MoO3 deposition on these organic semiconductor surfaces. For
   the interface physical structure, it is found that MoO3 diffuses into
   the underlying organic layer, exhibiting a trend of increasing diffusion
   with decreasing molecular molar mass. For the interface chemical
   structure, new carbon and molybdenum core-level states are observed, as
   a result of interfacial electron transfer from organic semiconductor to
   MoO3. For the interface electronic structure, energy level alignment is
   observed in agreement with the universal energy level alignment rule of
   molecules on metal oxides, despite deposition order inversion.}},

Title = {{Assessing the environmental sustainability with a co-benefits approach:
   a study of industrial sector in Baoshan District in Shanghai}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{114-123}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{It is often difficult to determine the effects of policies at a sectoral
   level in the overlapping domains of pollution control and energy
   conservation, making it difficult to consider co-benefits of energy
   conservation and air pollution reduction and tensions. In China, the
   industry sector contributes much more carbon and pollution emissions
   than other sectors. In this paper, Baoshan District (BSD), one of the
   most important industrial zones in the Shanghai metropolis, is used as a
   case study to illustrate the situation and to provide information to
   assess the effectiveness of environmental sustainable development
   policies in industries. The policies resulting from China's Eleventh
   Five-year Plan (FYP) are considered at the level of BSD. In particular,
   the result of implementing local policies of air pollution control and
   energy are analysed at BSD. Three indicator systems are adopted for
   quantitatively and qualitatively evaluating energy saving and air
   pollution reduction achieved by technical, structural and management
   measures in industrial enterprises of BSD. Analysis made in the paper
   shows that the co-benefits of pollution cutting and energy conservation
   have been achieved at certain scopes and degrees in the industry sector
   in BSD, e.g. SO2 and Particulate Matter (PM) were reduced by 35.1\% and
   7.7\% respectively, and the energy density was cut by 26.7\%. Due to
   existing barriers of the lack of co-planning and co-operations in the
   process of designing and implementing the policies, and the overlooking
   the leakage of emissions in the whole project area, the overall
   co-benefits cannot be achieved effectively in BSD. Recommendations are
   made for future detailed studies of this or similar districts to develop
   an indicator system of co-benefits to help demonstrate the advantages of
   joint planning and policies for co-benefits. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Purpose: The low survival rate of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients is
   attributable to late disease diagnosis and high recurrence rate. Current
   HNC staging has inadequate accuracy and low sensitivity for effective
   diagnosis and treatment management. The multimodal porphyrin
   lipoprotein-mimicking nanoparticle (PLP), intrinsically capable of
   positron emission tomography (PET), fluorescence imaging, and
   photodynamic therapy (PDT), shows great potential to enhance the
   accuracy of HNC staging and potentially HNC management.
   Experimental Design: Using a clinically relevant VX-2 buccal carcinoma
   rabbit model that is able to consistently develop metastasis to regional
   lymph nodes after tumor induction, we investigated the abilities of PLP
   for HNC diagnosis and management.
   Results: PLPs facilitated accurate detection of primary tumor and
   metastatic nodes (their PET image signal to surrounding muscle ratios
   were 10.0 and 7.3, respectively), and provided visualization of the
   lymphatic drainage from tumor to regional lymph nodes by both
   preoperative PET and intraoperative fluorescence imaging, allowing the
   identification of unknown primaries and recurrent tumors. PLP-PDT
   significantly enhanced cell apoptosis in mouse tumors (73.2\% of PLP-PDT
   group vs 7.1\% of PLP alone group) and demonstrated complete eradication
   of primary tumors and obstruction of tumor metastasis in HNC rabbit
   model without toxicity in normal tissues or damage to adjacent critical
   structures.
   Conclusions: PLPs provide a multimodal imaging and therapy platform that
   could enhance HNC diagnosis by integrating PET/computed tomography and
   fluorescence imaging, and improve HNC therapeutic efficacy and
   specificity by tailoring treatment via fluorescence-guided surgery and
   PDT. (C) 2015 AACR.}},

   Crackling Noises}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Characterizing the fast evolution of microstructural defects is key to
   understanding ``crackling{''} phenomena during the deformation of solid
   materials. For example, it has been proposed using atomistic simulations
   of crack propagation in elastic materials that the formation of a
   nonlinear hyperelastic or plastic zone around moving crack tips controls
   crack velocity. To date, progress in understanding the physics of this
   critical zone has been limited due to the lack of data describing the
   complex physical processes that operate near microscopic crack tips. We
   show, by analyzing many acoustic emission events during rock deformation
   experiments, that the signature of this nonlinear zone maps directly to
   crackling noises. In particular, we characterize a weakening zone that
   forms near the moving crack tips using functional networks, and we
   determine the scaling law between the formation of damages (defects) and
   the traversal rate across the critical point of transition. Moreover, we
   show that the correlation length near the transition remains effectively
   frozen. This is the main underlying hypothesis behind the Kibble-Zurek
   mechanism (KZM) and the obtained power-law scaling verifies the main
   prediction of KZM.}},

Abstract = {{This work reports the solubility and density of a ternary solid liquid
   equilibrium (SLE) system (NaCl + HOCH2COONa + H2O) from (283.15 to

   diffraction (PXRD). The phase diagrams at (283.15 and 353.15) K were
   thus plotted and discussed. In each phase diagram, there were only one
   invariant point, two boundary curves, and two crystalline areas in
   response to pure HOCH2COONa and NaCl. When comparing the phase diagram
   at 353.15 K with that at 283.15 K, it shows that the crystallization
   region of sodium glycolate is decreased remarkably and that of sodium
   chloride is obviously increased. The reported data of liquid composition

Abstract = {{Development of high thermally conductive and electrically insulative
   composites is of interest for electronic packaging industry.
   Advancements in smaller and more compact electronic devices required
   improvements in packing materials, including their weight, thermal
   conductivity, and electrical resistivity. In addition, with the
   increasing environmental awareness, the usage of green (bio-based)
   alternatives was equally important. In the present study a hybrid based
   on fibers of highly concentrated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) in liquid
   crystal polymer (LCP) matrix were fabricated. These hybrids were formed
   by arranging hBN platelets into LCP fiber form to reach high filler
   concentration and then randomly mix it in polylactide (PLA) matrix. With
   appropriate filler interaction within the hybrid, thermal conductivity
   similar to that of pure fiber could be achieved. Filler interaction may
   be tailored by optimizing the fibers aspect ratio. This study
   demonstrated the effect of random fillers in fibers shape in increasing
   the overall thermal conductivity of PLA polymeric hybrid using hBN and

Abstract = {{While silicon nanocrystals (ncSi) embedded in silicon dioxide thin films
   have been intensively studied in physics, the potential of batch
   synthesis of silicon nanocrystals from the solid-state
   disproportionation of SiO powder has not drawn much attention in
   chemistry. Herein we describe some remarkable effects observed in the
   diffraction, microscopy and spectroscopy of SiO powder upon thermal
   processing in the temperature range 850-1100 degrees C. Quantum
   confinement effects and structural changes of the material related to
   the size of the silicon nanocrystals nucleated and grown in this way
   were established by Photoluminescence (PL), Raman, FTIR and UV-Visible
   spectroscopy, PXRD and STEM, pinpointing that the most significant
   disproportionation transformations happened in the temperature range
   between 900 and 950 degrees C. With this know-how a high yield synthesis
   was developed that produced polydispersions of decyl-capped,
   hexane-soluble silicon nanocrystals predominantly with near infrared
   (NIR) PL. Using size-selective precipitation, these polydispersions were
   separated into monodisperse fractions, which allowed their PL absolute
   quantum yield (AQY) to be studied as a function of silicon nanocrystal
   size. This investigation yielded volcano-shaped plots for the AQY
   confirming the most efficient PL wavelength for ncSi to be located at
   around 820-830 nm, which corresponded to a size of 3.5-4.0 nm. This work
   provides opportunities for applications of size-selected near infrared
   emitting silicon nanocrystals in biomedical imaging and photothermal
   therapy.}},

Title = {{Sister Dehalobacter Genomes Reveal Specialization in Organohalide
   Respiration and Recent Strain Differentiation Likely Driven by
   Chlorinated Substrates}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{The genomes of two closely related Dehalobacter strains (strain CF and
   strain DCA) were assembled from the metagenome of an anaerobic
   enrichment culture that reductively dechlorinates chloroform (CF),
   1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA) and 1,1-dichloroethane (1,1-DCA). The
   3.1 Mbp genomes of strain CF (that dechlorinates CF and 1,1,1-TCA) and
   strain DCA (that dechlorinates 1,1-DCA) each contain 17 putative
   reductive dehalogenase homologous (rdh) genes. These two genomes were
   systematically compared to three other available organohalide-respiring
   Dehalobacter genomes (Dehalobacter restrictus strain PER-K23,
   Dehalobacter sp. strain El and Dehalobacter sp. strain UNSWDHB), and to
   the genomes of Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain 195 and
   Desulfitobacterium hafniense strain Y51. This analysis compared 42
   different metabolic and physiological categories. The genomes of strains
   CF and DCA share 90\% overall average nucleotide identity and >99.8\%
   identity over a 2.9 Mbp alignment that excludes large insertions,
   indicating that these genomes differentiated from a close common
   ancestor. This differentiation was likely driven by selection pressures
   around two orthologous reductive dehalogenase genes, cfrA and dcrA, that
   code for the enzymes that reduce CF or 1,1,1-TCA and 1,1-DCA. The many
   reductive dehalogenase genes found in the five Dehalobacter genomes
   cluster into two small conserved regions and were often associated with
   Crp/Fnr transcriptional regulators. Specialization is on-going on a
   strain-specific basis, as some strains but not others have lost
   essential genes in the Wood-Ljungdahl (strain El) and corrinoid
   biosynthesis pathways (strains El and PER-K23). The gene encoding
   phosphoserine phosphatase, which catalyzes the last step of serine
   biosynthesis, is missing from all five Dehalobacter genomes, yet D.
   restrictus can grow without serine, suggesting an alternative or
   unrecognized biosynthesis route exists. In contrast to D. mccartyi, a
   complete heme biosynthesis pathway is present in the five Dehalobacter
   genomes. This pathway corresponds to a newly described alternative heme
   biosynthesis route first identified in Archaea. This analysis of
   organohalide-respiring Firmicutes and Chloroflexi reveals profound
   evolutionary differences despite very similar niche-specific metabolism
   and function.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate miRNA function in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) stem
   cells (LSC), we generated a prognostic LSC-associated miRNA signature
   derived from functionally validated subpopulations of AML samples. For
   one signature miRNA, miR-126, high bioactivity aggregated all in vivo
   patient sample LSC activity into a single sorted population, tightly
   couplingmiR-126 expression to LSC function. Through functional studies,
   miR-126 was found to restrain cell cycle progression, prevent
   differentiation, and increase self-renewal of primary LSC in vivo.
   Compared with prior results showing miR-126 regulation of normal
   hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) cycling, these functional stem effects are
   opposite between LSC and HSC. Combined transcriptome and proteome
   analysis demonstrates that miR-126 targets the PI3K/AKT/MTOR signaling
   pathway, preserving LSC quiescence and promoting chemotherapy
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Dopamine (DA) is a classical neurotransmitter and dysfunction in its
   synaptic handling underlies many neurological disorders, including
   addiction, depression, and neurodegeneration. A key to understanding DA
   dysfunction is the accurate measurement of dopamine uptake by
   dopaminergic neurons. Current methods that allow for the analysis of
   dopamine uptake rely on standard multiwell-plate based ELISA, or on
   carbon-fibre microelectrodes used in in vivo recording techniques. The
   former suffers from challenges associated with automation and analyte
   degradation, while the latter has low throughput and is not ideal for
   laboratory screening. In response to these challenges, we introduce a
   digital microfluidic platform to evaluate dopamine homeostasis in in
   vitro neuron culture. The method features voltammetric dopamine sensors
   with limit of detection of 30 nM integrated with cell culture sites for
   multi-day neuron culture and differentiation. We demonstrate the utility
   of the new technique for DA uptake assays featuring in-line culture and
   analysis, with a determination of uptake of approximately similar to 32
   fmol in 10 min per virtual microwell (each containing similar to 200
   differentiated SH-SY5Y cells). We propose that future generations of
   this technique will be useful for drug discovery for neurodegenerative
   disease as well as for a wide range of applications that would benefit
   from integrated cell culture and electroanalysis.}},

Title = {{Critical stiffness damage envelopes for multidirectional laminated

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},

Volume = {{91}},

Month = {{FEB 5}},
Abstract = {{Load-bearing laminated structures undergo complex crack evolution
   processes and consequent stiffness degradation, which leads to a decline
   in their overall performance. Thus, consideration of damage evolution is
   important for stiffness critical applications. In this study, a
   multi-scale damage model combining synergistic damage mechanics (SDM)
   with an energy-based damage evolution model is developed for
   multidirectional laminated structures. The SDM approach combines
   computational finite element-based micromechanics with continuum damage
   mechanics, enabling the evaluation of the laminate stiffness. The damage
   model predicts evolution of sub-critical matrix cracks in different
   plies under multiaxial loading. Model predictions, which include ply
   crack density evolution and laminate stiffness degradation, correlate
   well with available experimental data, while model results for various
   CFRP and GFRP multidirectional laminates demonstrate its robustness.
   Additionally, damage envelopes corresponding to pre-selected critical
   stiffness degradation levels are developed to serve as an alternative to
   current approaches of final failure envelopes, and are regarded as a
   useful design tool for stiffness critical composite structures in
   practical applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{White organic light emitting diodes (WOLEDs) is becoming a new platform
   technology for a range of applications such as flat-panel displays,

   constructed using four stacked emission layers which independently emit
   lights at blue, green, yellow and red color respectively. The intensity
   of each emission layer is then engineered by funneling excitons to the
   targeted emission layer to achieve an ultrahigh 92 CRI at 5000 cd/ m2,
   and to reduce CCT to below 2500 K.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we investigated, theoretically and experimentally, the
   unique photoactive behavior of pristine and defected indium oxide
   surfaces providing fundamental insights into their excited state
   properties as well as an explanation for the experimentally observed
   enhanced activity of defected indium oxide surfaces for the gas-phase
   reverse water gas shift reaction, CO2 + H-2 + h nu -> CO + H2O in the
   light compared to the dark. To this end, a detailed excited-state study
   of pristine and defected forms of indium oxide (In2O3, In2O3,
   In2O3(OH)(y) and In2O3-x(OH)(y)) surfaces was performed using time
   dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations, the results of
   which were supported experimentally by transient absorption spectroscopy
   and photoconductivity measurements. It was found, that the surface
   frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) created by a Lewis acidic coordinately
   unsaturated surface indium site proximal to an oxygen vacancy and a
   Lewis basic surface hydroxide site in In2O3-x(OH)(y) become more acidic
   and basic and hence more active in the ES compared to the GS. This
   provides a theoretical mechanism responsible for the enhanced activity
   and reduced activation energy of the photochemical reverse water gas
   shift reaction observed experimentally for In2O3-x(OH)(y) compared to
   the thermochemical reaction. This fundamental insight into the role of
   photoexcited surface FLPs for catalytic CO2 reduction could lead to
   improved photocatalysts for solar fuel production.}},

Title = {{Prosody and Semantics Are Separate but Not Separable Channels in the
   Perception of Emotional Speech: Test for Rating of Emotions in Speech}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{72-89}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Our aim is to explore the complex interplay of prosody (tone of
   speech) and semantics (verbal content) in the perception of discrete
   emotions in speech.
   Method: We implement a novel tool, the Test for Rating of Emotions in
   Speech. Eighty native English speakers were presented with spoken
   sentences made of different combinations of 5 discrete emotions (anger,
   fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral) presented in prosody and
   semantics. Listeners were asked to rate the sentence as a whole,
   integrating both speech channels, or to focus on one channel only
   (prosody or semantics).
   Results: We observed supremacy of congruency, failure of selective
   attention, and prosodic dominance. Supremacy of congruency means that a
   sentence that presents the same emotion in both speech channels was
   rated highest; failure of selective attention means that listeners were
   unable to selectively attend to one channel when instructed; and
   prosodic dominance means that prosodic information plays a larger role
   than semantics in processing emotional speech.
   Conclusions: Emotional prosody and semantics are separate but not
   separable channels, and it is difficult to perceive one without the
   influence of the other. Our findings indicate that the Test for Rating
   of Emotions in Speech can reveal specific aspects in the processing of
   emotional speech and may in the future prove useful for understanding
   emotion-processing deficits in individuals with pathologies.}},

Title = {{Comparison of Independent Error Checks for Oral Versus Intravenous
   Chemotherapy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{168+}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Intravenous (IV) chemotherapy is routinely delivered to patients in
   hospital settings, where safeguards such as independent checks and
   guidelines govern their administration. In contrast, oral chemotherapy,
   which is typically ordered in a cancer center but dispensed and
   administered in the community and home, respectively, is subject to
   fewer controls. Research in the United States has found that few
   safeguards in routine use for IV chemotherapy have been adopted for oral
   chemotherapy; however, less is known about the Canadian context. The
   objective of this study was to determine whether similar safeguards, in
   the form of independent checks, existed to identify potential errors
   related to both formulations.
   Methods
   Human factors specialists conducted observations and interviews in
   cancer center clinics, a cancer center pharmacy, and four community
   pharmacies across Nova Scotia. Processes were analyzed to determine if
   an independent check was performed, which qualified provider completed
   the check, and at what point of the process the check occurred.
   Results
   A total of 57 systematic checks were identified for IV chemotherapy,
   whereas only six systematic checks were identified for oral
   chemotherapy. Community pharmacists were the only qualified
   professionals involved in independent systematic checking of oral
   chemotherapy, which occurred during ordering and dispensing.
   Conclusion
   There is an enormous opportunity for pharmacists and other qualified
   professionals to take on an expanded role in improving patient safety
   for oral chemotherapy. Greater involvement of pharmacists, in both the
   clinic environment and the community, would facilitate increased
   systematic checking, which could improve patient safety related to oral
   chemotherapy.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) with orthogonal frequency division
   multiplexing (OFDM) systems typically use orthogonal-triangular (QR)
   decomposition. In this article, we present an enhanced systolic array
   architecture to realize QR decomposition based on the Givens rotation
   (GR) method for a 4 x 4 real matrix. The coordinate rotation digital
   computer (CORDIC) algorithm is adopted and modified to speed up and
   simplify the process of GR. To verify the function and evaluate the
   performance, the proposed architectures are validated on a Virtex 5 FPGA
   development platform. Compared to a commercial implementation of
   vectoring CORDIC, the enhanced vectoring CORDIC is presented that uses
   37.7\% less hardware resources, dissipates 71.6\% less power, and
   provides a 1.8 times speedup while maintaining the same computation

Abstract = {{A device that achieves controllable rotation of the state of
   polarization by rotating the orientation of the eigenmodes of a
   waveguide by 45. is introduced and analyzed. The device can be
   implemented using lossless materials on the nanoscale and helps
   circumvent the inherent polarization dependence of photonic devices
   realized within the silicon-on-insulator platform. We propose and
   evaluate two novel polarization rotator-based schemes to achieve
   polarization engineering functions: 1) A multipurpose device, with
   dimensions on the order of a few wavelengths which can function as a
   polarization splitter or an arbitrary linear polarization state
   generator. 2) An energy efficient optical modulator that utilizes
   eigenmode rotation and epsilon near zero effects to achieve high
   extinction ratio, polarization insensitive amplitude modulation without
   the need to sweep the device geometry tomatch the TE and TM mode
   attributes. By using indium tin oxide as an example for a tunable
   material, the proposed modulator provides polarization insensitive
   operation and can be realized with a modulation bandwidth of 112 GHz, a
   length of 1800 nm, an energy per bit of 7.5 fJ and an optical bandwidth
   of 210 nm.}},

Abstract = {{Air cleaning is broadly applied to reduce contaminant concentrations in
   many buildings. Although diverse in underlying technology, mode of
   application, target contaminants, and effectiveness, there are also
   commonalities in the framework for understanding their primary impact
   (i. e. concentration reductions) and secondary impacts (e. g. energy use
   and by-product production). Furthermore, both primary and secondary
   impacts are moderated by the specific indoor context in which an air
   cleaner is used. This investigation explores the dynamics of removal
   efficiency in a variety of air cleaners and combines efficiency and flow
   rate to put air cleaning in the context of real indoor environments.
   This allows for the direct comparison to other indoor pollutant loss
   mechanisms (ventilation and deposition) and further suggests that
   effective air cleaner use is context and contaminant specific. The
   concentration reduction impacts of air cleaning need to be contrasted
   with the secondary consequences that arise from the use of air cleaners.
   This study emphasizes two important secondary consequences: energy use
   of the air cleaning process and primary and secondary emissions from air
   cleaners. This study also identifies current research challenges and
   areas for large leaps in our understanding of the role of air cleaners
   in improving indoor environmental quality.}},

Abstract = {{Tensor impedance transmitarrays consist of tensor impedance surfaces,
   separated by dielectric spacers. In this paper, we present a design
   method for realizing tensor impedance transmitarrays that are capable of
   controlling the reflection and transmission of circularly polarized
   waves, referred to as chiral polarization control. To achieve this, we
   implement a multi-conductor transmission-line (MTL) model to
   characterize how vertically and horizontally polarized waves are
   transmitted and reflected through the surface and to synthesize the
   desired tensor impedances, which comprise the array. Using this MTL
   model, we show how to synthesize two different chiral transmitarrays.
   This includes a polarization rotator, which rotates any linear
   polarization by 90 and a circular polarization selective surface (CPSS),
   which transmits one hand of circular polarization while reflecting the
   other. This is verified with full-wave simulation showing that our
   proposed model works. We also fabricate and measure the CPSS at X-band
   based on our design procedure. To measure the CPSS, we use a novel
   four-port quasi-optical system to characterize both the reflection and
   transmission of vertically and horizontally polarized fields off of the
   surface. We achieve a good agreement with our simulated results though
   we have -1.7 dB more loss than expected due to the use of FR-4 as our
   substrate.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based
   XY-stage integrating compliant motion amplification mechanism for
   nanopositioning at sub nanometer resolution. The MEMS stage is driven by
   bidirectional Z-beam electrothermal actuators that generate large output
   forces to actuate the motion amplification mechanism. The motion
   amplification mechanisms are used in their inverse (motion reduction)
   mode to convert micrometer input displacements (from the Z-beam
   actuators) into nanometer output displacements at a constant motion
   reduction ratio with good linearity. This unique design significantly
   enhances the positioning resolution of the XY-stage. An analytical model
   is developed to predict output displacements of the XY-stage as a
   function of the input voltages applied to the Z-beam actuators, and the
   predicted results agree with the experimental results. Capacitive
   displacement sensors are arranged along both X- and Y-axes for measuring
   the input displacements of the amplification mechanisms, enabling
   closed-loop nanopositioning control of the XY-stage. The device
   calibration results show that, within an actuation voltage of +/- 15 V,
   the MEMS stage offers a motion range close to +/- 1 mu m and a
   displacement resolution better than 0.3 nm root Hz(-1).}},

Volume = {{80}},

Abstract = {{Continuous development of advanced technologies has created increasing
   demand for rare-earth elements (REE), with global emphasis on
   identifying new alternate sources to ensure adequate supply. Ore
   deposits containing physically adsorbed lanthanides are substantially
   lower grade than other REE deposit types; however, the low mining and
   processing costs make them economically attractive as sources of REE. To
   evaluate the commercial potential for the recovery of REEs from
   ion-adsorption deposits in a systematic manner, a standardized procedure
   for REE leaching was developed previously. Using this procudure it was
   found that, regardless of variations in ore origin and REE content, all
   REE consistently reached peak extraction levels under ambient conditions
   with fast kinetics. Various techniques to improve the REE extraction
   through process variations were also investigated: it was found that
   decreasing the L:S ratio, re-using leachate on fresh ores and
   counter-current leaching were all capable of increasing REE
   concentrations in the resultant leachate, albeit at the expense of REE
   extraction levels. In addition, the water content trapped in the leached
   material was found to contain significant amounts of REE and residual
   lixiviant requiring thorough washing of the solid residue.}},

Abstract = {{Some forms of sensorineural hearing loss involve damage or degenerative
   changes to the stria vascularis and/or other vascular structures in the

   methodology, corrosion casting, has proved useful in some species,

   method that allows visualization of vasculature along much of the
   cochlear length but maintains some structural integrity of the specimen.
   We provide a detailed step-by-step description of this novel technique.

Abstract = {{Single-switch access in conjunction with scanning remains a fundamental
   solution in restoring communication for many children with profound
   physical disabilities. However, untimely switch inaction and
   unintentional switch activations can lead to user frustration and impede
   functional communication. A previous preliminary study, in the context
   of a case series with three single-switch users, reported that correct,
   accidental and missed switch activations could elicit cardiac
   deceleration and increased phasic skin conductance on average, while
   deliberate switch non-use was associated with autonomic nonresponse. The
   present study investigated the possibility of using blood volume pulse
   recordings from the same three pediatric single-switch users to track
   the aforementioned switch events on a single-trial basis. Peaks of the
   line length time series derived from the empirical mode decomposition of
   the inter-beat interval time series matched, on average, a high
   percentage (above 80\%) of single-switch events, while unmatched peaks
   coincided moderately (below 37\%) with idle time during scanning. These

Title = {{Evaluation of PET Imaging Performance of the TSPO Radioligand {[}F-18]

Abstract = {{Purpose: Many radioligands have been explored for imaging the 18-kDa
   translocator protein (TSPO), a diagnostic and therapeutic target for
   inflammation and cancer. Here, we investigated the TSPO radioligand
   {[}F-18]DPA-714 for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of cancer
   and inflammation.
   Procedures: {[}F-18]DPA-714 PET imaging was performed in 8 mouse and rat
   models of breast and brain cancer and 4 mouse and rat models of muscular
   and bowel inflammation.
   Results: {[}F-18]DPA-714 showed different uptake levels in healthy
   organs and malignant tissues of mice and rats. Although high and
   displaceable {[}F-18]DPA-714 binding is observed ex vivo, TSPO-positive
   PET imaging of peripheral lesions of cancer and inflammation in mice did
   not show significant lesion-to-background signal ratios. Slower
   {[}F-18]DPA-714 metabolism and muscle clearance in mice compared to rats
   may explain the elevated background signal in peripheral organs in this
   species.
   Conclusion: Although TSPO is an evolutionary conserved protein,
   inter-and intra-species differences call for further exploration of the
   pharmacological parameters of TSPO radioligands.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Most types of cancers are made up of heterogeneous mixtures of
   genetically distinct subclones. In particular, acute myeloid leukemia
   (AML) has been shown to undergo substantial clonal evolution over the
   course of the disease. AML tends to harbor fewer mutations than solid
   tumors, making it challenging to infer clonal structure. Here, we
   present a 9-year, whole-exome sequencing study of a single case at 12
   time points, from the initial diagnosis until a fourth relapse,
   including 6 remission samples in between. To the best of our knowledge,
   it covers the longest time span of any data set of its kind. We used
   these time series data to track the hierarchy and order of variant
   acquisition, and subsequently analyzed the evolution of somatic variants
   to infer clonal structure. From this, we postulate the development and
   extinction of subclones, as well as their anticorrelated expansion via
   varying drug responses. In particular, we show that new subclones
   started appearing after the first complete remission. The presence and
   absence of different subclones during remission and relapses implies
   differing drug responses among subclones. Our study shows that time
   series analysis contrasting remission and relapse periods provides a
   much more comprehensive view of clonal structure and evolution.}},

Abstract = {{A biochemical methane potential assay was conducted to investigate the
   anaerobic digestibility of bleaching effluent from hardwood kraft
   pulping and the potential of codigestion with other effluents from an
   integrated pulp and paper mill. Four in-mill streams were tested
   individually and in combination: total bleaching effluent, alkaline
   bleaching effluent, kraft evaporator condensate, and
   chemithermomechanical pulping effluent. The total bleaching effluent,
   consisting of the chlorine dioxide bleaching and alkaline bleaching
   effluents, exhibited the highest potential for organic matter
   degradation and methane generation. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal
   ranged from 57\%-76\%, and methane generation was 220-280 mL/g COD
   contained in the wastewater, depending on the degree of dilution. When
   codigestion was tested, the composite consisting of total bleaching
   effluent, chemithermomechanical pulping effluent, and kraft condensate
   was most efficient in terms of COD removal (51\%) and methane generation
   (200 mL/g COD contained in the wastewater). The total bleaching effluent
   is the largest contributor to the overall amount of wastewater at this
   mill; it contains relatively low concentrations of anaerobic inhibitors
   such as adsorbable organic halogens (36 mg/L), total sulfur (170 mg/L),
   and resin and fatty acids (3.2 mg/L). Therefore, the total bleaching
   effluent from hardwood kraft pulping may be considered for full-scale
   anaerobic wastewater treatment, either as a singular stream or as part
   of a composite stream including other in-mill effluents.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene oxide (GO) is considered as one of the most promising layered
   materials with tunable physical properties and applicability in many
   important engineering applications. In this work, the interfacial
   behavior of multilayer GO films was directly investigated via GO-to-GO
   friction force microscopy, and the interfacial shear strength (ISS) was
   measured to be 5.3 +/- 3.2 MPa. Based on high resolution atomic force
   microscopy images and the available chemical data, targeted molecular
   dynamics simulations were performed to evaluate the influence of
   functional structure, topological defects, and interlayer registry on
   the shear response of the GO films. Theoretical values for shear
   strength ranging from 17 to 132 MPa were predicted for the different
   structures studied, providing upper bounds for the ISS. Computational
   results also revealed the atomic origins of the stochastic nature of
   friction measurements. Specifically, the wide scatter in experimental
   measurements was attributed to variations in functional structure and
   topological defects within the sliding volume. The findings of this
   study provide important insight for understanding the significant
   differences in strength between monolayer and bulk graphene oxide
   materials and can be useful for engineering topological structures with
   tunable mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental problem for the delay and backlog analysis across multihop
   paths in wireless networks is how to account for the random properties
   of the wireless channel. Since the usual statistical models for radio
   signals in a propagation environment do not lend themselves easily to a
   description of the available service rate, the performance analysis of
   wireless networks has resorted to higher-layer abstractions, e. g.,
   using Markov chain models. In this paper, we propose a network calculus
   that can incorporate common statistical models of fading channels and
   obtain statistical bounds on delay and backlog across multiple nodes. We
   conduct the analysis in a transfer domain, where the service process at
   a link is characterized by the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio at
   the receiver. We discover that, in the transfer domain, the network
   model is governed by a dioid algebra, which we refer to as the algebra.
   Using this algebra, we derive the desired delay and backlog bounds.
   Using arguments from large deviations theory, we show that the bounds
   are asymptotically tight. An application of the analysis is demonstrated
   for a multihop network of Rayleigh fading channels with cross traffic at
   each hop.}},

Title = {{Algorithms Based on Divide and Conquer for Topic-Based Publish/Subscribe
   Overlay Design}},
Journal = {{IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{422-436}},

Abstract = {{Overlay design for topic-based publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems is of
   primary importance because the overlay forms the basis for the system
   and directly impacts its performance. This paper focuses on the
   MinAvg-TCO problem: Use the minimum number of edges to construct a
   topic-connected overlay (TCO) such that all nodes that are interested in
   the same topic are organized in a directly connected dissemination
   suboverlay. Existing algorithms for MinAvg-TCO suffer from three key
   drawbacks: 1) prohibitively high runtime cost; 2) reliance on global
   knowledge and centralized operation; and 3) nonincremental operation by
   reconstructing the TCO from scratch. From a practical point of view,
   these are all severe limitations. To address these concerns, we develop
   algorithms that dynamically join multiple TCOs. Inspired by the
   divide-and-conquer character of this idea, we derive a number of
   algorithms for the original MinAvg-TCO problem that accommodate a
   variety of practical pub/sub workloads. Both theoretical analysis and
   experimental evaluations demonstrate that our divide-and-conquer
   algorithms seek a balance between time efficiency and the number of
   edges required: Our algorithms cost a fraction (up to 1.67\%) of the
   runtime cost of their greedy alternatives, which come at the expense of
   an empirically insignificant increase in the average node degree.
   Furthermore, in order to reduce the probability of poor partitioning at
   the divide phase, we develop a bulk-lightweight partitioning scheme on
   top of random partitioning. This more refined partitioning imposes a
   marginally higher runtime cost, but leads to improvements in the output
   TCOs, including average node degrees and topic diameters.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the supervisory control theory (SCT) of timed discrete-event
   systems (TDES), this study presents a dynamic reconfiguration technique
   for real-time scheduling of real-time systems running on uniprocessors.
   A new formalism is developed to assign periodic tasks with
   multiple-periods. By implementing SCT, a real-time system (RTS) is
   dynamically reconfigured when its initial safe execution sequence set is
   empty. During the reconfiguration process, based on the
   multiple-periods, the supervisor proposes different safe execution
   sequences. Two real-world examples illustrate that the presented
   approach provides an increased number of safe execution sequences as
   compared with the earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{We consider bounds for the price of a European-style call option under
   regime switching. Stochastic semidefinite programming models are
   developed that incorporate a lattice generated by a finite-state Markov
   chain regime-switching model as a representation of scenarios
   (uncertainty) to compute bounds. The optimal first-stage bound value is
   equivalent to a Value at Risk quantity, and the optimal solution can be
   obtained via simple sorting. The upper (lower) bounds from the
   stochastic model are bounded below (above) by the corresponding
   deterministic bounds and are always less conservative than their robust
   optimization (min-max) counterparts. In addition, penalty parameters in
   the model allow controllability in the degree to which the regime
   switching dynamics are incorporated into the bounds. We demonstrate the
   value of the stochastic solution (bound) and computational experiments
   using the S\&P 500 index are performed that illustrate the advantages of
   the stochastic programming approach over the deterministic strategy.}},

Title = {{Increasing angulation decreases measured aortic stent graft pullout
   forces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{493-499}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Experimentally measured pullout forces for stent grafts (SGs)
   are used in clinical discussions and as reference values in bench
   studies and computer simulations. Previous values of these forces are
   available from studies in which the SG was pulled out in the straight
   caudal direction. However, clinical and numerical studies have suggested
   that displacement forces acting on SGs are directed more anteriorly. The
   objective of this study was to measure pullout forces as a function of
   angulation and to test the hypothesis that pullout forces decrease with
   increasing angulation.
   Methods: Six different SGs (Bolton Treovance, Cook Zenith Flex, Cook
   Zenith LP, Medtronic Endurant, Medtronic Talent, and Vascutek Anaconda)
   were deployed in fresh bovine aortas, then pulled out by an electronic
   motor at 1 mm/s, while tension force was measured continuously with a
   digital load cell. The SG off-axis angulation was changed from 0 to 90
   degrees in increments of 10 degrees. The test system was submerged in a
   custom-built temperature-controlled saline bath at 37 degrees C. At
   least three tests were performed for each device at each angle (with the
   exception of the Cook Zenith Flex, which experienced plastic deformation
   of its barbs after a single test per device). Each aortic specimen was
   used only once and then discarded. Hand-sutured graft anastomoses were
   also tested at 0 degrees to provide a reference value.
   Results: A total of 374 pullout tests were performed for the SGs and
   anastomoses. Sixty-four tests were excluded because of failure of the
   aorta or apparatus before device pullout. The remaining 310 tests showed
   pullout forces that demonstrated a decrease in the average pullout force
   for all six devices from 0 to 90 degrees (Bolton Treovance from 39.3 N
   to 23.9 N; Cook Zenith Flex from 59.8 N to 48.9 N; Cook Zenith LP from
   50.3 N to 41.8 N; Medtronic Endurant from 29.9 N to 25.8 N; Medtronic
   Talent from 6.0 N to 5.5 N; and Vascutek Anaconda from 37.0 N to 30.3
   N). For reference, the mean pullout force for the hand-sutured
   anastomoses was 63 N.
   Conclusions: This study reports for the first time the change in pullout
   force with angulation, showing a general pullout force decrease with
   increasing angle. With a larger number of samples than in previous
   studies, our results provide updated benchmark data that can be used for
   clinical discussions, computational and experimental studies, and future
   device design.
   Clinical Relevance: It is becoming clear that the displacement forces
   acting on stent grafts are not directed straight inferiorly but have a
   significant anteriorly directed component. However, all benchmark
   studies reporting experimental pullout forces for devices have been in a
   straight, axial direction. This study will characterize what effect
   nonaxial angulation has on pullout forces. This will allow more
   meaningful clinical discussion about ``pullout forces{''} and allow more
   educated and informed predictions regarding the behavior of stent
   grafts. It will provide a reference for computer simulation and
   experimental studies, including those used to design next-generation
   devices.}},

   agreement was found between the theoretically predicted and
   experimentally measured heterodyne amplitude dependence on excitation
   intensity. A contrast inversion feature in the high-frequency heterodyne
   amplitude images was observed. High-frequency information presents a
   method for resolving local near-surface carrier transport parameters

Abstract = {{Poor cell survival in vitro and in vivo is one of the key challenges in
   tissue engineering. Prosurvival therapeutic proteins, such as
   insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), can promote cell viability but
   require controlled delivery systems due to their short half-lives and
   rapid clearance. Biocompatible materials are commonly used for drug
   delivery platforms or to encapsulate cells for increased viability, but
   few materials have been used for both applications simultaneously. In
   this work, we present a dual-use platform. A blend of hyaluronan and
   methylcellulose, known to promote cell survival, was covalently modified
   with Src homology 3 (SH3)-binding peptides and demonstrated tunable,
   affinity-based release of the prosurvival fusion protein SH3 IGF-1. The
   material also significantly increased the viability of retinal pigment
   epithelium cells under anchorage-independent conditions. This novel
   platform is applicable to a broad range of cells and protein
   therapeutics and is a promising drug delivery/cell transplantation
   strategy to increase the viability of both exogenous and endogenous
   cells in tissue engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{Bioflocculants have been previously recognized as an alternative to
   synthetic polymers due to their renewable sources and biodegradability.
   In this study, the flocculating activity of lysozyme on kaolin
   suspensions was investigated and compared to a known flocculant, a
   cationic polyacrylamide. Lysozyme was found to significantly aid in the
   flocculation of kaolin particles. The flocculating activity of lysozyme
   on kaolin was affected by the pH of the suspensions, while the addition
   of Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions did not have a significant effect. Potential
   industrial applications such as the flocculation of powdered activated
   carbon and algae suspensions were investigated and the addition of
   lysozyme resulted in significant flocculation. Furthermore, the
   flocculating properties of lysozyme are independent of its enzymatic
   activity. Our results indicate that lysozyme acts as a low molecular
   mass cationic polymer, where the main mechanism for flocculation on
   negatively-charged particles is charge neutralization. Other cationic
   proteins could potentially be used as bioflocculants to enhance
   solid-liquid separation.}},

Abstract = {{The complexity and diversity of noise in corona current measurements of
   high-voltage direct current (HVdc) transmission lines leads to
   challenges in estimating corona performance. This paper proposes an
   offline noise suppression method for HVdc corona current measurements.
   Given that the corona current and background noise processes coexist
   within the same frequency band, we develop a novel multifaceted
   filtering approach for HVdc corona currents. Specifically, a cross
   correlation function-based center frequency recognition method is
   presented to provide filter design specification for a multiple notch
   filter to suppress narrow-band radio interference. To then suppress the
   residual full-band noise, wavelet denoising techniques with hard and
   soft thresholds are applied and compared. The proposed noise suppression
   method is applied to fieldmeasured corona current data from the HVdc
   Experimental Base in China. We assert that the noise suppression method
   has versatile implementation and can be readily applied for corona loss
   estimation of HVdc systems.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying key steps and barriers within complex and simple surgical
   procedures can be accomplished in a structured and rigorous manner using
   surgical process modeling. For lower extremity long bone fracture
   stabilization, the current standard of care is closed intramedullary
   (IM) nailing, which, despite its widespread use, is associated with
   challenges that greatly impact operative time and lead to the
   frustration of medical staff. The aim of this study was to identify
   challenging surgical steps in IM nailing and understand their underlying
   causation.
   Eight semi-structured interviews with staff orthopedic surgeons and
   eight detailed surgical observations were conducted to understand the
   surgical steps, challenges and adapted techniques used in IM nailing.
   Hierarchical decomposition was then utilized to structure the IM nailing
   surgical procedure into phases, steps and activities.
   In the developed IM nailing surgical process model, the most challenging
   steps were identified as fracture reduction (75 \%) and entry point
   selection (25 \%), both of which were associated with high levels of
   frustration in the observed surgeries. Both of these steps utilize 2D
   fluoroscopic imaging to guide 3D alignment. Challenges arise when the
   alignment in one plane is lost while adjusting the alignment in the
   perpendicular plane. This leads to unpredictable repetition of
   activities which can be time-consuming and frustrating.
   Identifying the causation of surgical challenges in IM nailing through
   surgical process modeling forms a knowledge base that can be used to
   guide future improvements to techniques and surgical instrumentation.}},

Abstract = {{Species diversity in algae biofuel and biochemical culturing systems can
   affect yield; in many large-scale algae growth systems, it is not
   practical to maintain a monoculture. To better understand and monitor
   these complex systems, techniques are required which can quickly and
   effectively quantify the species distribution and overall growth of a
   mixed microbial community in suspension. A flow cytometric method has
   been developed which can be used to differentiate populations of three
   Chlorophyta species, one diatom species, cyanobacteria, and
   heterotrophic bacteria according to their fluorescence and morphology.
   The nucleic acid stain SYTO9 was used to discriminate species with
   similar natural autofluorescence and to identify heterotrophic bacteria.
   Absolute cell enumeration was performed with counting beads and
   validated with a hemocytometer. Species identification was validated by
   analyzing known mixtures of axenic cell cultures. The utility of the
   method was demonstrated by studying the effect of light intensity on
   species succession, growth, and biomass accumulation in small algae
   growth systems over 22 days. Flow cytometric analysis, augmented with
   SYTO9 stain and counting beads, can be utilized to monitor algae biofuel
   and biochemical growth systems involving multiple species. This method
   allows for monitoring of contamination, succession, and overall growth
   in both natural and intentionally created microbial communities.}},

Abstract = {{Trunk muscles are responsible for maintaining trunk stability during
   sitting. However, the effects of anticipation of perturbation on trunk
   muscle responses are not well understood. The objectives of this study
   were to identify the responses of trunk muscles to sudden support
   surface translations and quantify the effects of anticipation of
   direction and time of perturbation on the trunk neuromuscular responses.
   Twelve able-bodied individuals participated in the study. Participants
   were seated on a kneeling chair and support surface translations were
   applied in the forward and backward directions with and without
   direction and time of perturbation cues. The trunk started moving on
   average approximately 40 ms after the perturbation. During unanticipated
   perturbations, average latencies of the trunk muscle contractions were
   in the range between 103.4 and 117.4 ms. When participants anticipated
   the perturbations, trunk muscle latencies were reduced by 16.8 +/- 10.0
   ms and the time it took the trunk to reach maximum velocity was also
   reduced, suggesting a biomechanical advantage caused by faster muscle
   responses. These results suggested that trunk muscles have medium
   latency responses and use reflexive mechanisms. Moreover, anticipation
   of perturbation decreased trunk muscles latencies, suggesting that the
   central nervous system modulated readiness of the trunk based on
   anticipatory information. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As spinal cord injury (SCI) trials begin to involve subjects with acute
   cervical SCI, establishing the property of an upper limb outcome measure
   to detect change over time is critical for its usefulness in clinical
   trials. The objectives of this study were to define responsiveness,
   sensitivity, and minimally detectable difference (MDD) of the Graded
   Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility, and Prehension (GRASSP).
   An observational, longitudinal study was conducted. International
   Standards of Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI), GRASSP,
   Capabilities of Upper Extremity Questionnaire (CUE-Q), and Spinal Cord
   Independence Measure (SCIM) were administered 0-10 days, 1, 3, 6, and 12
   months post-injury. Standardized Response Means (SRM) for GRASSP and
   ISNCSCI measures were calculated. Longitudinal construct validity was
   calculated using Pearson correlation coefficients. Smallest real
   difference for all subtests was calculated to define the MDD values for
   all GRASSP subtests. Longitudinal construct validity demonstrated GRASSP
   and all external measures to be responsive to neurological change for 1
   year post-injury. SRM values for the GRASSP subtests ranged from 0.25 to
   0.85 units greater than that for ISNCSCI strength and sensation,
   SCIM-SS, and CUE-Q. MDD values for GRASSP subtests ranged from 2-5
   points. GRASSP demonstrates good responsiveness and excellent
   sensitivity that is superior to ISNCSCI and SCIM III. MDD values are
   useful in the evaluation of interventions in both clinical and research
   settings. The responsiveness and sensitivity of GRASSP make it a
   valuable condition-specific measure in tetraplegia, where changes in
   upper limb neurological and functional outcomes are essential for
   evaluating the efficacy of interventions.}},

Title = {{In vivo effects of two novel ALN-EP4a conjugate drugs on bone in the

Abstract = {{A Summary Two alendronate-EP4 agonist (ALN-EP4a) conjugate drugs, C1 and
   C2, which differ in structure by a short linker molecule, were evaluated
   in ovariectomized (OVX) rats for their anabolic effects. We showed that
   C1 led to significant anabolic effects on cortical and trabecular bone
   while anabolic effects associated with C2 were minimal.
   Introduction EP4as were covalently linked to ALN to create ALN-EP4a
   conjugate anabolic bone drugs, C1 and C2, which differ in structure by a
   short linker molecule in C1. When administered systemically, C1 and C2
   are delivered to bone through targeted binding of ALN, where local
   hydrolytic enzymes liberate EP4a from ALN to exert anabolic effects.
   Here, we compare effects of C1 to C2 in a curative in vivo study.
   Methods Three-month-old female Sprague Dawley rats were OVX or sham
   operated and allowed to lose bone for 3 months. Animals were then
   treated via tail vein injections for 3 months and sacrificed. Treatment
   groups were as follows: C1L (5 mg/kg biweekly), C1H (5 mg/kg weekly),
   C2L (15 mg/kg monthly), C2H (15 mg/kg biweekly), OVX and sham control
   (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) biweekly), and ALN/EP4a-unconjugated
   mixture (0.75 mg/kg each biweekly).
   Results MicroCT analysis showed that C1H treatment significantly
   increased vertebral bone mineral density (vBMD) and trabecular bone
   volume versus OVX controls while C2 treatments did not. Biomechanical
   testing showed that C1H treatment but not C2 treatments led to
   significant improvement in the load bearing abilities of the vertebrae
   compared to OVX controls. C1 stimulated endocortical bone formation and
   increased load bearing in femurs, while C2 did not.
   Conclusions We showed that C1 led to significant anabolic effects on
   cortical and trabecular bone while anabolic effects associated with C2
   were minimal. These results led us to hypothesize a mode of action by
   which presence of a linker is crucial in facilitating the anabolic
   effects of EP4a when dosed as a prodrug with ALN.}},

Abstract = {{When continuous casting was used to replace electro-slag remelting for
   the production of heat-resistant alloy Incoloy 800 containing Al and Ti,
   there were a number of quality problems associated with the cast product
   which were attributed to the use of an inappropriate mold flux. The aim
   of the current investigation was to develop and evaluate an improved
   mold flux by combining data derived from laboratory experiments with
   results obtained from plant-trials. The effects of composition on
   viscosity and heat transfer properties were investigated and a new mold
   flux was designed with improved casting behavior. By decreasing the
   characteristic melting temperatures, selecting an appropriate viscosity
   and enhancing the heat transfer properties, slab quality was improved.
   Chemical analysis combined with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) evaluation of liquid flux and flux film
   samples indicated that changes in composition, characteristic
   temperatures, and viscosity during the casting operation were negligibly
   small. The flux film with a thickness of 1.1mm, a crystalline ratio of
   30\%, and cuspidine as the main crystalline phase was beneficial for
   improving heat transfer thus strengthening the initial shell and
   improving the quality of the cast product.}},

Abstract = {{This paper developed a high-fidelity dynamic model of flexible space
   tether systems by considering the elastic, thermal, and electrical
   coupling effects on the dynamics and stability of bare electrodynamic
   tether systems. A simple and effective control strategy based on the
   libration energy of the flexible tether is derived and applied in the
   deorbit process. Numerical results show that the newly proposed energy
   control strategy is effective in controlling the libration and
   transverse elastic motion of the electrodynamic tether. In addition, the
   effect of the mass of sub-satellite on the system dynamics and stability
   is investigated. It is found that the libration and transverse motion of
   the electrodynamic tether can be stabilized by the proposed control
   strategy even without the sub-satellite when the electrodynamic force is
   dominant. This new finding shows the satellite deorbit with the
   electrodynamic tethers is advantageous in term of mass saving. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Functionally graded materials (FGMs) have the advantage of continuous
   microstructure over conventional composite materials. This continuity
   eliminates many undesired problems like delamination and abrupt change
   of material properties as in conventional composites. It is also
   favoured for numerical analysis when homogenizing the properties with a
   continuous function. Most of the focus has been on particulate-based
   functionally graded composites and metallic ceramic FGMs which performed
   very well in thermal-barrier system and many other applications. Little
   attention has been on functionally graded porous structures. In this
   work, we study experimental and numerical procedures of this class of
   material using a constrained foaming process and homogenization based
   finite element analysis with plate theory. Plate-like structures of
   polylactic acid (PLA) are fabricated with a constrained foaming process.
   The fabricated structures have a gradual porosity with variable cellular
   size throughout the thickness but homogeneous on-average at parallel
   planar sections. SEM characterization of the microstructure is
   statistically analysed with Burr distribution and used as an input to a
   new homogenization model that accounts for cellular distribution. A
   higher order plate theory is developed for the analysis that satisfies
   the free traction condition a priori to the consistency of transverse
   shear strain energy which had been rarely considered by similar theories
   in the area. Implementing the theory in finite element procedure
   necessitates the curvature continuity across elements. This was resolved
   by implementing the penalty enforcement technique and the use of
   conforming/nonconforming finite elements with derivative based nodal
   degrees of freedom. The conforming element showed a better convergence
   and thus selected for further analysis. The linear viscoelastic
   behaviour of PLA is assumed to obey Boltzmann superposition principle
   with hereditary integrals. The stress relaxation functions are
   determined experimentally for property characterization and from the
   homogenization model. The proposed plate theory and homogenization model
   agree very well with the work done by other researchers and experimental
   data. The numerical tool proved its validity for conducting accurate
   computer experiments with the minimal input about material properties
   and microstructure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a simplified phasor model for predicting harmonics
   present at the point of common coupling between a voltage-source power
   converter and the utility network. It employs the frequency coupling
   matrix (FCM) modeling technique. The FCM is experimentally determined
   without requiring access to converter internal details, such as control
   and output filter parameters, which are generally not available for
   converters used in distributed generation systems. Experimental
   measurements are conducted on a commercially available two-stage, three
   phase, grid-tied photovoltaic inverter to assess the accuracy of
   experimentally determined FCMs to predict the harmonic behavior of
   grid-connected converters. This paper considers two grid conditions for
   the experimental analysis: 1) when the grid is stiff and contains only
   background voltage harmonics and 2) when the grid contains harmonic grid
   impedances as well as background voltage harmonics. In all cases, a
   close match between the results predicted by the FCM approach and
   experimental measurements is achieved, thus demonstrating the practical
   viability of using experimentally determined FCM models for harmonic

Abstract = {{Effective estimation of voltage flicker components plays an important
   role in distribution systems for either flicker meters or flicker

   The error correction factor K of the Teager energy operator is presented
   and ITEO is established to reduce the extraction errors of voltage
   flicker waveform. ICZT is used to extract the frequency and magnitude of
   the voltage envelope which is corrected by the K factor of ITEO. The
   effects of signal sampling rate, sampling number, spectrum subdivision
   points of ICZT, voltage harmonics and interharmonics, frequency
   fluctuation, and white noise are investigated. The implementation of the
   proposed approach in the digital-signal-processor platform is also

   controlled dc buses and m - k independent dc networks. Power-flow
   control is achieved via the injection of incremental dc voltages between
   the networks; thus, the converter structure is only rated for a fraction
   of the rated power and voltage of the connecting dc networks. Unlike
   previously proposed dc power-flow devices, these incremental dc voltages
   are generated without requiring power exchange with an external ac
   network. There are four variants of the structure, each offering unique
   advantages for deployment. These variants, and the modules that comprise
   them, are presented. A sample simulation case study is performed to
   demonstrate three-port bidirectional power-flow control between networks
   of similar voltage (495/500/505 kV). The proposed converter structure is
   shown to route power between the networks using modules with
   megavolt-ampere ratings of approximately 2\% of the transmitted power.
   Thus, the proposed converter structure offers a highly cost-effective
   means of routing and controlling dc power flows within emerging HVDC
   grids.}},

Abstract = {{As part of power distribution network verification, one should check if
   the voltage fluctuations exceed some critical threshold. The traditional
   simulation-based solution to this problem is intractable due to the
   large number of possible circuit behaviors. This approach also requires
   full knowledge of the details of the underlying circuitry, not allowing
   one to verify the power distribution network early in the design flow.
   Contrary to previous work on power distribution network verification, we
   consider the power and ground (P/G) grids together and describe an early
   verification approach under the framework of current constraints. Then,
   we present a solution technique in which tight lower and upper bounds on
   worst case voltage fluctuations are computed via linear programs.
   Experimental results indicate that the proposed technique results in
   errors in the range of a few millivolts. In addition to P/G grid
   verification techniques, we also provide very efficient solution
   technique to power (single) grid verification under hierarchical current
   constraints.}},

Abstract = {{An improved data analysis approach has been developed for the combined
   laser extinction and two-angle elastic light scattering diagnostics to
   relate the various measured optical cross sections to soot aggregate
   properties. The performance of the proposed approach is assessed using
   the comprehensive dataset of Santoro ethylene-air co-flow diffusion
   flame. Compared to previously reported studies, the proposed approach
   can be applied to a wider range of soot sources by removing the
   assumption made to the scattering regime or moment ratio of aggregate
   size distribution. The proposed approach also considers the contribution
   of scattering to extinction in determining the soot volume fraction, and
   this contribution is shown to increase as soot aggregate size becomes
   larger. The sensitivity of the calculation to the assumed parameters of
   the approach is examined and discussed. The mean radius of gyration of
   soot aggregates and the ratio of scattering intensities at the two
   measurement angles are shown to be independent of soot refractive index
   and are therefore recommended for soot model validation purposes. (C)

Title = {{Influence of a family 29 carbohydrate binding module on the activity of

Abstract = {{Background: Galactose oxidase (GaO) selectively oxidizes the primary
   hydroxyl of galactose to a carbonyl, facilitating targeted chemical
   derivatization of galactose-containing polysaccharides, leading to
   renewable polymers with tailored physical and chemical properties. Here
   we investigate the impact of a family 29 glucomannan binding module on
   the activity and binding of GaO towards various polysaccharides.
   Specifically, CBM29-1-2 from Piromyces equi was separately linked to the
   N-and C-termini of GaO.
   Results: Both GaO-CBM29 and CBM29-GaO were successfully expressed in
   Pichia pastoris, and demonstrated enhanced binding to galactomannan,
   galactoglucomannan and galactoxyloglucan. The position of the CBM29
   fusion affected the enzyme function. Particularly, C-terminal fusion led
   to greatest increases in galactomannan binding and catalytic efficiency,
   where relative to wild-type GaO, k(cat)/K-m,, values increased by 7.5
   and 19.8 times on guar galactomannan and locust bean galactomannan,
   respectively. The fusion of CBM29 also induced oligomerization{''} of
   GaO-CBM29.
   Major conclusions: Similar to impacts of cellulose-binding modules
   associated with cellulolytic enzymes, increased substrate binding
   impeded the action of GaO fusions on more concentrated preparations of
   galactomannan, galactoglucomannan and galactoxyloglucan; this was
   especially true for GaO-CBM29. Given the N-terminal positioning of the
   native galactose-binding CBM32 in GaO, the varying impacts of N-terminal
   versus C-terminal fusion of CBM29-1-2 may reflect competing action of
   neighboring CBMs.
   General significance: This study thoroughly examines and discusses the
   effects of CBM fusion to nonlignocellulytic enzymes on soluble
   polysaccharides. Herein kinetics of GaO on galactose containing
   polysaccharides is presented for the first time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Patients with diabetes often face serious complications due to limited
   self-management skills, the inability to adhere to care regimens, and
   psychosocial factors. Although regular self-monitoring of blood glucose
   is known to benefit patients receiving insulin therapy, its role in
   patients not treated with insulin has been unclear. However, recent
   studies have demonstrated that structured self-monitoring of blood
   glucose can significantly benefit patients who are not taking insulin,
   facilitating improved self-awareness and clinical decision making. We
   hypothesize that effective self-management by patients with type 2
   diabetes who do not need insulin requires a behavioural intervention
   that enables the association between lifestyle behaviours, such as
   dietary intake and physical activity, and overall glycemic control.
   Mobile health applications (apps), coupled with wireless medical
   peripheral devices, can facilitate self-monitoring; deliver tailored,
   actionable knowledge; elicit positive behaviour changes and promote
   effective self-management of diabetes. Although existing apps
   incorporate tracking and feedback from healthcare providers, few attempt
   to elicit positive behaviour changes for the purposes of developing
   patients' self-care skills. The purpose of this article is to present a
   systematic approach to the design and development a diabetes
   self-management mobile app, which included 1) a scoping review of
   literature; 2) the development of an overarching theoretical approach
   and 3) validation of the app features through user-centred design
   methods. The resulting app, bant II, facilitates 1) self-monitoring of
   blood glucose, physical activity, diet and weight; 2) identification of
   glycemic patterns in relation to lifestyle; 3) remedial decision making
   and 4) positive behaviour change through incentives. (C) 2015 Canadian

Abstract = {{The formation of an exposed eye in the gas-stirred metallurgical vessels
   such as ladle or tundish is a common observation. Although gas stirring
   results in proper homogenization of melt composition and temperature,
   the resulting exposed eye leads to higher heat losses, re-oxidation of
   liquid steel, and formation of inclusions. Most of the previous research
   related to slag eye were carried out explicitly for ladles. In the
   present work, a large number of experiments were performed to measure
   the slag eye area in full scale and one-third scale water models of an
   inert gas-shrouded tundish under various operating conditions. Based on
   the polynomial regression of experimental data, and the method of
   dimensional analysis, correlations for diameter of gas bubbles and plume
   velocity were developed. Subsequently, these results were used to obtain
   correlations for the slag eye area, and critical gas flow rate in an
   inert gas-shrouded tundish in terms of the operational parameters viz.,
   gas flow rate, thickness of the slag and melt baths, along with the
   physical properties of the liquids viz., kinematic viscosity and
   density. It was observed that the dimensionless slag eye area can be
   expressed in terms of dimensionless numbers such as the density ratio,
   Froude number, and Reynolds number.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic levitation (EML) is a contact-less, high-temperature
   technique which has had extensive application with respect to the
   investigation of both thermophysical and thermochemical properties of
   liquid alloy systems. The varying magnetic field generates an induced
   current inside the metal droplet, and interactions are created which
   produce both the Lorentz force that provides support against gravity and
   the Joule heating effect that melts the levitated specimen. Since metal
   droplets are opaque, transport phenomena inside the droplet cannot be
   visualized. To address this aspect, several numerical modeling
   techniques have been developed. The present work reviews the
   applications of EML techniques as well as the contributions that have
   been made by the use of mathematical modeling to improve understanding
   of the inherent processes which are characteristic features of the
   levitation system.}},

Abstract = {{The profound metabolic reprogramming that occurs in cancer cells has
   been investigated primarily in two-dimensional cell cultures, which fail
   to recapitulate spatial aspects of cell-to-cell interactions as well as
   tissue gradients present in three-dimensional tumours. Here, we describe
   an engineered model to assemble three-dimensional tumours by rolling a
   scaffold-tumour composite strip. By unrolling the strip, the model can
   be rapidly disassembled for snapshot analysis, allowing spatial mapping
   of cell metabolism in concert with cell phenotype. We also show that the
   establishment of oxygen gradients within samples that are shaped by
   oxygen-dependent signalling pathways, as well as the consequential
   variations in cell growth, response to hypoxic gradients extending from
   normoxia to severe hypoxia, and therapy responsiveness, are consistent
   with those of tumours in vivo. Moreover, by using liquid chromatography
   tandem mass spectrometry, we mapped cellular metabolism and identified
   spatially defined metabolic signatures of cancer cells to reveal both
   known and novel metabolic responses to hypoxia.}},

Abstract = {{Localized drug delivery strategies could greatly benefit patients with
   peripheral nerve injury and could be easy for surgeons to implement. We
   developed a local drug delivery system (DDS) using drug-loaded
   poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres (MS) embedded in a
   fibrin gel. In an in vitro study, we investigated the biocompatibility
   of this DDS by performing a toxicity assay in which we incubated PC-12
   cells with the medium released from the DDS in vitro. In an in vivo
   study, this DDS was applied at the rat common peroneal (CP) nerve injury
   site to deliver exogenous glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor
   (GDNF) to the regenerating axons after delayed nerve repair. In vitro,
   PC-12 cells incubated with released media samples from the DDS had
   similar viability to control cells cultured with normal media,
   demonstrating that the DDS was not toxic. In vivo, the numbers of motor
   and sensory neurons that regenerated their axons with empty MS treatment
   were the same as when there was no MS treatment. The DDS increased the
   numbers of regenerating motor- and sensory neurons to levels
   indistinguishable from those observed with immediate nerve repair. The
   DDS increased neuron regeneration to levels double those observed with
   negative control groups. This biocompatible, nontoxic, fibrin gel-based
   DDS enhances outcomes following severe peripheral nerve injuries. (c)

Abstract = {{A hybrid micro-electrostatic actuator is presented. The actuator
   integrates a vertical comb driving (VCD) unit and a parallel-plate
   driving (PPD) unit. The hybrid actuator is fabricated using a one
   structural layer microfabrication process, i.e., MetalMUMPs instead of a
   two-layer microfabrication process needed for traditional vertical
   comb-drive actuators by taking advantage of the residual stress gradient
   in the MetalMUMPs nickel layer, which raises the moving parts of the
   actuator above the substrate after release. The hybrid actuator
   significantly simplifies the fabrication process for vertical comb-drive
   actuators, i.e., turning a process requiring two structural layers into
   a process requiring only one structural layer and thus avoids any
   misalignment between the two layers. The hybrid actuator can generate
   larger force and then a larger displacement than the actuator having
   only the VCD with the same area since no extra space is needed for the
   PPD unit which uses the moving electrode existing in the VCD unit and a
   fixed electrode under the VCD unit. The VCD and PPD units in the hybrid
   actuator are subject to the same driving voltage and work together to
   pull the moving parts of the actuator downward. A model is established
   for the hybrid actuator to analyze its displacement. The analytical
   results show that displacement of the moving part of the hybrid actuator
   is about half of the gap between the electrodes of the PPD unit.
   Prototypes are fabricated and tested. With a driving voltage of 150 V,
   the hybrid actuator achieved a measured displacement of 6.48 A mu m.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of dynamic strain rates on failure responses of a
   fine-grained granitic rock is studied experimentally and theoretically.
   Theoretical investigation employs a model incorporating dynamic fracture
   criterion with damage mechanics theory. Experimental investigation is
   conducted using split Hopkinson pressure bar device. In order to
   investigate the effects of microstructure on dynamic fracture failure
   under different loading rates, fragment debris of each tested specimen
   is collected and analyzed. It is found through the debris analysis that
   the granitic rock breaks down into the fragment debris in grain size
   scales and the effect of strain rates on the formation of fragment
   debris appears to be related to the microstructure of the rock. It is
   also found that dynamic inertia induced by the dynamic loading can
   reduce the effect of friction confinement generated by the contact
   between the cylindrical specimen and two split Hopkinson pressure bars
   on the dynamic responses of the specimen. Theoretical evaluations agree
   with the corresponding experimental observations.}},

   for a wide range of connection geometries and which is the sum of
   existing design recommendations for branch plate-to-CHS connections
   loaded in axial tension and compression, is hence proposed for
   through-plate-to-CHS T-connections. This therefore enables maximum

Abstract = {{Most P300 event-related potential (ERP)-based brain-computer interface
   (BCI) studies focus on gaze shift-dependent BCIs, which cannot be used
   by people who have lost voluntary eye movement. However, the performance
   of visual saccade-independent P300 BCIs is generally poor. To improve
   saccade-independent BCI performance, we propose a bimodal P300 BCI
   approach that simultaneously employs auditory and tactile stimuli. The
   proposed P300 BCI is a vision-independent system because no visual
   interaction is required of the user. Specifically, we designed a
   direction-congruent bimodal paradigm by randomly and simultaneously
   presenting auditory and tactile stimuli from the same direction.
   Furthermore, the channels and number of trials were tailored to each
   user to improve online performance. With 12 participants, the average
   online information transfer rate (ITR) of the bimodal approach improved
   by 45.43\% and 51.05\% over that attained, respectively, with the
   auditory and tactile approaches individually. Importantly, the average
   online ITR of the bimodal approach, including the break time between
   selections, reached 10.77 bits/min. These findings suggest that the
   proposed bimodal system holds promise as a practical visual
   saccade-independent P300 BCI.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{24-30}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Polymeric composites have the potential to replace current electronic
   packaging and improve thermal management of electronics to open the way
   for further size shrinkage. Such composites need to provide high thermal
   conductivity and high electrical resistivity while possessing suitable
   mechanical properties. This paper reports the study of thermal behavior
   of arranged and random network of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) in
   composite with different polymers. Thermal barrier factors and possible
   solutions to reduce the effect of these factors are thoroughly
   investigated. Thermal behavior of hBN filler network in composite with
   different polymers as well as the possibility of using green (bio-based)
   polymers as the matrix have been studied. Fully bio-based, partially
   bio-based and petroleum based composites are compared to investigate the
   effect of different polymer matrices on thermal properties of
   composites. Designed high thermally conductive and electrically
   insulative composites are expected to possess unique properties. This
   includes being lightweight, injection moldable, low coefficients of
   thermal expansion, eco-friendly, and with proper service temperature and
   mechanical properties. Such composites will result in more compact,
   lighter and cheaper electronics with higher performance, by avoiding the
   use of electrical fans, heat sinks and other methods of heat
   dissipation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this study, mechanical properties and self-healing performance of a
   water-based acrylic coating containing linseed oil-filled ethyl
   cellulose (EC) microcapsules were evaluated. In order to improve
   interfacial interactions between microcapsules' shell and their
   surrounding latex matrix, EC was treated with three different
   trimethoxysilane coupling agents before microencapsulation process.
   Water-based acrylic coatings containing various amounts of different
   microcapsules were prepared and their tensile properties were studied.
   The effect of silane pre-treatment of microcapsules' shell on the
   self-healing performance of the coating was also evaluated via optical
   microscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy, AFM and SEM. Water vapor
   transmission (WVT) of intact and healed scratched coating samples was
   measured and their healing efficiency values calculated.
   It was found that the addition of microcapsules with pre-silanized shell
   compound has a positive effect on the tensile and mechanical properties
   of the coating. The degree of this effect depended on the silane type
   and microcapsules' loading wt\% in the coating material. Sample
   containing microcapsules with amino-based silane treatment revealed
   appropriate tensile properties among the others owing to better
   compatibility with polymeric matrix, improving barrier properties of
   scratched area by releasing of hydrophobic oil and therefore, minimizing
   the penetration of water and water vapor through the coating layer. (C)

Title = {{Bitterfeld amber is not Baltic amber: Three geochemical tests and

Journal = {{REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{225}},
Pages = {{21-32}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Baltic and Bitterfeld ambers are important deposits of polymerized
   conifer resin that are widely recognized for their exquisite fossil
   inclusions, especially insects. Because of over-arching similarities
   with respect to visual appearance, organic geochemistry, arthropod
   assemblages, and proximity to forests of the Paleogene North Sea margin,
   these two ambers have not yet been differentiated definitively, leading
   to ongoing debate as to whether or not they (and their respective
   inclusions) are truly equivalent. We combine micro-Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), time of flight-secondary ion mass
   spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), and stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta H-2)
   to establish that Baltic and Bitterfeld ambers differ consistently in
   their geochemical properties, and thus capture distinct depositional
   episodes in space, but not necessarily in time. Baltic amber has more
   succinic acid, succinic anhydride, and communic acid relative to
   Bitterfeld amber, but less dehydroabietic acid. Although both ambers
   produce overlapping delta C-13 values, supporting a similar age of
   formation, delta H-2 is markedly depleted (by similar to 20 parts per
   thousand in Baltic amber relative to Bitterfeld amber. The hydrogen
   isotopic results confer paleolatitudinal differences in amber
   provenance, that is, a clear differentiation between sources originating
   from the northern (Baltic) and southern (Bitterfeld) margins of the
   Paleogene North Sea. We conclude that the two deposits are geologically
   distinct in origin, but that similarities in their respective faunal
   records arise because they are broadly coeval in time. We also present
   new ToF-SIMS results that imply only resins from modern conifers of the
   families Pinaceae and Sciadopityaceae begin to satisfy the expanded
   geochemical profiles presented for Baltic and Bitterfeld ambers. (C)

Abstract = {{CouR, a MarR-type transcriptional repressor, regulates the cou genes,
   encoding p-hydroxycinnamate catabolism in the soil bacterium Rhodococcus
   jostii RHA1. The CouR dimer bound two molecules of the catabolite
   p-coumaroyl-CoA (K-d = 11 +/- 1 mu M). The presence of p-coumaroyl-CoA,
   but neither p-coumarate nor CoASH, abrogated CouR's binding to its
   operator DNA in vitro. The crystal structures of ligand-free CouR and
   its p-coumaroyl-CoA-bound form showed no significant conformational
   differences, in contrast to other MarR regulators. The
   CouR-p-coumaroyl-CoA structure revealed two ligand molecules bound to
   the CouR dimer with their phenolic moieties occupying equivalent
   hydrophobic pockets in each protomer and their CoA moieties adopting
   non-equivalent positions to mask the regulator's predicted DNA-binding
   surface. More specifically, the CoA phosphates formed salt bridges with
   predicted DNA-binding residues Arg36 and Arg38, changing the overall
   charge of the DNA-binding surface. The substitution of either arginine
   with alanine completely abrogated the ability of CouR to bind DNA. By
   contrast, the R36A/R38A double variant retained a relatively high
   affinity for p-coumaroyl-CoA (K-d = 89 +/- 6 mu M). Together, our data
   point to a novel mechanism of action in which the ligand abrogates the
   repressor's ability to bind DNA by steric occlusion of key DNA-binding
   residues and charge repulsion of the DNA backbone.}},

Title = {{A Systematic Study of the Effect of Different Molecular Weights of
   Hyaluronic Acid on Mesenchymal Stromal Cell-Mediated Immunomodulation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   Osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with chronic inflammation, and
   mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been shown to provide pain relief
   and reparative effects in clinical investigations. MSCs are often
   delivered with hyaluronic acid (HA), although the combined mechanism of
   action is not fully understood; we thus investigated the
   immunomodulatory effects of combining MSCs with different molecular
   weights (MW) of HA.
   Methods
   HAs with MWs of 1.6 MDa (hHA), 150 kDa or 7.5 kDa, were added to MSCs
   alone or MSC-immune cell co-cultures. Gene expression analyses, flow
   cytometry and cytokine measurements were assessed to determine the
   effect of HAs on the MSC interactions with immune cells.
   Results
   MSCs in the presence of HAs, in both normal and lymphocyte-conditioned
   medium, showed negligible changes in gene expression. While addition of
   hHA resulted in increased proliferation of activated lymphocytes, both
   in the presence and absence of MSCs, the overall combined effect was a
   more regulated, homeostatic one; this was supported by higher ratios of
   secreted IL10/IFN. and IL10/IL2, in lymphocyte cultures, than with lower
   MW HAs or no HA, both in the presence and absence of MSCs. In addition,
   examination of monocyte-derived macrophages showed an increased M2
   macrophage frequency (CD14 +CD163+CD206+) in the presence of hHA, both
   with and without MSCs.
   Conclusions
   hHA produces a less pro-inflammatory environment than lower MW HAs.
   Moreover, combining hHA with MSCs has an additive effect on the
   MSC-mediated immunomodulation, suggestive of a more potent combination
   treatment modality for OA.}},

Abstract = {{Methane oxidation rates uncorrupted by nonchemical effects of transport,
   taken together with stoichiometric oxygen uptake (oxidation cycle) and
   evolution (decomposition cycle) data, are used to establish for the
   first time a set of conditions required for true thermodynamic
   equilibrium during metal-to-oxide interconversions in small Pd clusters
   (1.8-8.8 nm). These conditions allow us to assess the intrinsic
   thermodynamics of small Pd clusters and their catalytic effects in CH4
   oxidation. PdO decomposition in the absence of CH4 deviates from
   equilibrium, as this step is limited by the nucleation of an oxygen
   vacancy ensemble on oxide domains. The nucleation bottleneck is removed
   by CH4 during its catalytic sojourns, when CH4 pressure and the related
   rates exceed a critical value, because CH4 effectively removes the
   oxygen adatoms near an oxygen vacancy site-via CH bond activation on an
   oxygen-oxygen vacancy site pair that converts the O{*} adatom to a
   hydroxyl intermediate, which desorbs as H2O in sequential steps. CH4
   oxidation turnovers promote the nucleation of oxygen vacancy ensembles
   at conditions that maintain the global oxygen equilibration, as
   confirmed from the absence of CH4 oxidation rate hysteresis in both Pd
   oxidation and PdO decomposition cycles and from coincidence of rate and
   oxygen content profiles during Pd oxidation. A theoretical construction
   decoupling the inherent cluster size variance from cluster diameter
   effects shows marked effects of size on bulk phase transition. The bulk
   phase transition occurs at lower oxygen chemical potentials for the
   smaller clusters, which confirm their more negative Gibbs free energy
   for PdO formation than the large structures. The bulk phase transition
   converts 0{*}-0{*} adatom sites to Pd2+-O2- ion pairs that are more
   effective for the kinetically relevant C-H bond activation in CH4. These
   effects of size on the thermodynamics and reactivities of small clusters
   illustrated, in this study are general and extend beyond the Pd PdO
   system.}},

Abstract = {{As antibiotic resistance is increasingly becoming a public health
   concern, an improved understanding of the bacterial DNA damage response
   (DDR), which is commonly targeted by antibiotics, could be of tremendous
   therapeutic value. Although the genetic components of the bacterial DDR
   have been studied extensively in isolation, how the underlying
   biological pathways interact functionally remains unclear. Here, we
   address this by performing systematic, unbiased, quantitative synthetic
   genetic interaction (GI) screens and uncover widespread changes in the
   GI network of the entire genomic integrity apparatus of Escherichia coli
   under standard and DNA-damaging growth conditions. The GI patterns of
   untreated cultures implicated two previously uncharacterized proteins
   (YhbQ and YqgF) as nucleases, whereas reorganization of the GI network
   after DNA damage revealed DDR roles for both annotated and
   uncharacterized genes. Analyses of pan-bacterial conservation patterns
   suggest that DDR mechanisms and functional relationships are near
   universal, highlighting a modular and highly adaptive genomic stress
   response.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the room-temperature synthesis and characterization of
   needle-like lanthanide phosphate (LnPO(4)) nanocrystals in water, based
   on in situ precipitation of LnPO(4) using functional aqueous microgels
   as a soft nanoreactor. The poly(NIPAm/VCL/MAA) microgels were prepared
   by the copolymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide, N-vinylcaprolactam,
   and methacrylic acid. Our goal was to prepare Ln-encoded microgels
   suitable for bead-based biological assays employing mass cytometry. The
   low solubility of nanocrystalline LnPO(4) avoids the problem of Ln ion
   leakage from the microgels. The main challenge was to find appropriate
   conditions to confine the LnPO(4) precipitate to the interior of the
   microgels. Various sources of phosphate ions led to precipitation of
   LnPO(4) on the exterior of the microgels. One approach worked. It
   involved three steps: neutralization of the MAA groups in the microgels
   with NaOH, ion exchange with a lanthanide salt, followed by treatment
   with a large excess of PBS buffer at pH 7.4. In this way, we obtained
   microgels containing ca. 10(7) Ln atoms per microgel (Ln = La, Nd, Eu,
   Tb, Ho, Tm). The microgels were shown to be uniform in size by dynamic
   light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The
   LnPO(4)-containing microgels showed much higher stability against
   leakage of metals to acidic buffers compared to the LnF(3)-containing
   microgels reported previously {[}Lin, W.; et al. Langmuir 2011, 27,
   7265]. Small-angle X-ray scattering measurements and selected area
   electron diffraction data showed striking differences in the internal
   structure of hybrid microgels containing TbPO4 from those containing
   TbF3. The TbF3-containing microgels had a core shell structure with an
   amorphous TbF3 core, whereas the TbPO4 microgels contained needle-like
   nanocrystals (width ca. 2 nm, lengths on the order of 80 nm) distributed
   throughout the structure. These microgels are very promising materials
   for biological assays based on mass cytometry.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a novel adaptive fault tolerant control (FTC)
   scheme for a class of control input and system state constrained
   multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems with both
   multiplicative and additive actuator faults. The input constraints can
   be asymmetric, and the state constraints can be time-varying. A novel
   tan-type time-varying Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) is proposed to
   deal with the state constraints, and an auxiliary system is designed to
   analyze the effect of the input constraints. We show that under the
   proposed adaptive FTC scheme, exponential convergence of the output
   tracking error into a small neighbourhood of zero is guaranteed, while
   the constraints on the system state will not be violated during
   operation. Estimation errors for actuator faults are bounded in the
   closed loop. An illustrative example on a two degree-of-freedom robotic
   manipulator is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed FTC scheme. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, significant progress has been made towards the
   development of approaches that enable the capture of rare circulating
   tumor cells (CTCs) from the blood of cancer patients, a critical
   capability for noninvasive tumor profiling. These advances have
   leveraged new insights in materials chemistry and microfluidics and
   allowed the capture and enumeration of CTCs with unprecedented
   sensitivity. However, it has become increasingly clear that simply
   capturing and counting tumor cells launched into the bloodstream may not
   provide the information needed to advance our understanding of the
   biology of these rare cells, or to allow us to better exploit them in
   medicine. A variety of advances have now emerged demonstrating that more
   information can be extracted from CTCs with next-generation devices and
   materials featuring tailored physical and chemical properties. In this
   Minireview, the last ten years of work in this area will be discussed,
   with an emphasis on the groundbreaking work of the last five years,
   during which the focus has moved beyond the simple capture of CTCs and
   gravitated towards approaches that enable in-depth analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors consider two multiple-antenna transceivers
   exchanging information through a relay-assisted network using a
   single-carrier communication scheme. The authors assume that the
   propagation delay in different relaying path is negligible and the relay
   nodes are synchronous. As a result, the end-to-end multipath channel is
   not frequency-selective (time-dispersive) and hence, the successive
   arriving signals at the transceivers do not interfere with each other.
   Otherwise, inter-symbol-interference (ISI) will be inevitable and cyclic
   insertion and removal matrices will be required to combat ISI. In such a
   two-way network, the relay nodes harvest energy from the surrounding
   environment and utilise this energy to forward their received messages
   using a harvest-then-forward protocol. For different receiver diversity
   combining techniques, the authors design an optimal relay beamforming to
   maximise the quality of the received signals at the transceivers subject
   to the energy casualty constraint at the relay nodes (the energy
   consumed for transmission of each block cannot exceed the accumulative
   harvested energy). For each diversity combining technique, a closed-form
   solution is obtained for the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that
   shows how adjusting the data transmission rate of the transceivers and
   the amount of energy harvested at the relays affects the received SNR.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of heterogeneous surface of commercial gas diffusion layers
   (GDLs) which is made from carbon papers on a droplet transport in
   microchannels of proton exchange membrane fuel cells are investigated
   using the volume of fluid method. A random function is used for
   generating the heterogeneous surface of GDL in terms of roughness
   density and roughness height, which is derived from experimental data of
   commercial carbon paper GDLs. Surface tension, and wall adhesion forces
   are applied by using the volume of fluid method. The hydrophilic walls
   and hydrophobic GDL are considered. Results show that the heterogeneous
   surface of GDLs greatly affects droplet transport in the mircochannels.
   The movement mechanism of large droplet is translational while rolling
   mechanism is dominant for small droplet movement. Pressure drop and
   pressure fluctuation of large droplet are reduced after the formation of
   film flow. Generally, time-averaged pressure drop, droplet elongation,
   and the amount of remaining water on the GDL increase by increasing
   roughness density and roughness height, which is undesirable for better
   water management. It is also observed that the amount of adhered droplet
   to the hydrophilic surface of microchannel increases by increasing the
   roughness height and airflow velocity, which is favorable for better
   water removal. Average velocity of the droplet decreases by increasing
   roughness parameters for low airflow velocities while it increases for
   high airflow velocities. The detachment velocity of droplets on the
   rough GDL is compared with analytical solution for smooth GDLs.

Abstract = {{Controllable doping of semiconductors is a fundamental technological
   requirement for electronic and optoelectronic devices. As intrinsic
   semiconductors, hybrid perovskites have so far been a phenomenal success
   in photovoltaics. The inability to dope these materials heterovalently
   (or aliovalently) has greatly limited their wider utilizations in
   electronics. Here we show an efficient in situ chemical route that
   achieves the controlled incorporation of trivalent cations (Bi3+, Au3+,
   or In3+ by exploiting the retrograde solubility behavior of perovskites.
   We term the new method dopant incorporation in the retrograde regime. We
   achieve Bi3+ incorporation that leads to bandgap tuning (similar to 300
   meV), 10(4) fold enhancement in electrical conductivity, and a change in
   the sign of majority charge carriers from positive to negative. This
   work demonstrates the successful incorporation of dopants into
   perovskite crystals while preserving the host lattice structure, opening
   new avenues to tailor the electronic and optoelectronic properties of
   this rapidly emerging class of solution-processed semiconductors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach to general type-2 fuzzy clustering
   called Multi-central general type-2 fuzzy clustering model. This model
   mainly focuses on uncertainty associated with the cluster centers. In
   this model, a set of points is considered as the center for each
   cluster. The membership values to the clusters are defined as general
   type-2 fuzzy sets including primary and secondary variables. Primary
   variable indicates the degree of belonging to the central objects, and
   the secondary variables indicate the degree of belonging of the central
   objects to the center of the cluster. There is not any type reduction or
   defuzzification for updating cluster prototypes in the proposed
   clustering algorithm. The compatible indexes with the proposed model are
   defined for validation and verification of the clustering process and
   results. Several experimental results are given to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed Multi-central general type-2 fuzzy
   clustering. The results also compared with the results of the type-1
   fuzzy clustering model. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering functional human cardiac tissue that mimics the native adult
   morphological and functional phenotype has been a long held objective.
   In the last 5 years, the field of cardiac tissue engineering has
   transitioned from cardiac tissues derived from various animal species to
   the production of the first generation of human engineered cardiac
   tissues (hECTs), due to recent advances in human stem cell biology.
   Despite this progress, the hECTs generated to date remain immature
   relative to the native adult myocardium. In this review, we focus on the
   maturation challenge in the context of hECTs, the present state of the
   art, and future perspectives in terms of regenerative medicine, drug
   discovery, preclinical safety testing and pathophysiological studies.

Abstract = {{Surgical replacement of dysfunctional valves is the primary option for
   the treatment of valvular disease and congenital defects. Existing
   mechanical and bioprosthetic replacement valves are far from ideal,
   requiring concomitant anticoagulation therapy or having limited
   durability, thus necessitating further surgical intervention. Heart
   valve tissue engineering (HVTE) is a promising alternative to existing
   replacement options, with the potential to synthesize mechanically
   robust tissue capable of growth, repair, and remodeling. The clinical
   realization of a bioengineered valve relies on the appropriate
   combination of cells, biomaterials, and/or bioreactor conditioning.
   Biomechanical conditioning of valves in vitro promotes differentiation
   of progenitor cells to tissue synthesizing myofibroblasts and prepares
   the construct to withstand the complex hemodynamic environment of the
   native valve. While this is a crucial step in most HVTE strategies, it
   also may contribute to fibrosis, the primary limitation of engineered
   valves, through sustained myofibrogenesis. In this review, we examine
   the progress of HVTE and the role of mechanical conditioning in the
   synthesis of mechanically robust tissue, and suggest approaches to
   achieve myofibroblast quiescence and prevent fibrosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The primary function of vascular networks is to transport blood and
   deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues, which occurs at the interface
   of the microvasculature. Therefore, the formation of the vessels at the
   microcirculatory level, or angiogenesis, is critical for tissue
   regeneration and repair. Current strategies for vascularization of
   engineered tissues have incorporated multi-disciplinary approaches
   including engineered biomaterials, cells and angiogenic factors.
   Pre-vascularization of scaffolds composed of native matrix, synthetic
   polymers, or other biological materials can be achieved through the use
   of single cells in mono or co-culture, in combination or not with
   angiogenic factors or by the use of isolated vessels. The advance of
   these methods, together with a growing understanding of the biology
   behind vascularization, has facilitated the development of
   vascularization strategies for engineered tissues with therapeutic
   potential for tissue regeneration and repair. Here, we review the
   different cell-based strategies utilized to pre-vascularize engineered
   tissues and in making more complex vascularized cardiac tissues for
   regenerative medicine applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The recent classification of glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5) members
   into subfamilies enhances the prediction of substrate specificity by
   phylogenetic analysis. However, the small number of well characterized
   members is a current limitation to understanding the molecular basis of
   the diverse specificity observed across individual GH5 subfamilies. GH5
   subfamily 4 (GH5\_4) is one of the largest, with known activities
   comprising (carboxymethyl) cellulases, mixedlinkage endo-glucanases, and
   endo-xyloglucanases. Through detailed structure-function analysis, we
   have revisited the characterization of a classic GH5\_4
   carboxymethylcellulase, PbGH5A (also known as Orf4,
   carboxymethylcellulase, and Cel5A), from the symbiotic rumen
   Bacteroidetes Prevotella bryantii B(1)4. We demonstrate that
   carboxymethylcellulose and phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose are in fact
   relatively poor substrates for PbGH5A, which instead exhibits clear
   primary specificity for the plant storage and cell wall polysaccharide,
   mixedlinkage beta-glucan. Significant activity toward the plant cell
   wall polysaccharide xyloglucan was also observed. Determination of
   PbGH5A crystal structures in the apo-form and in complex with (xylo)
   glucan oligosaccharides and an active-site affinity label, together with
   detailed kinetic analysis using a variety of well defined
   oligosaccharide substrates, revealed the structural determinants of
   polysaccharide substrate specificity. In particular, this analysis
   highlighted the PbGH5A active-site motifs that engender predominant
   mixed-linkage endo-glucanase activity vis a vis predominant
   endo-xyloglucanases in GH5\_4. However the detailed phylogenetic
   analysis of GH5\_4 members did not delineate particular clades of
   enzymes sharing these sequence motifs; the phylogeny was instead
   dominated by bacterial taxonomy. Nonetheless, our results provide key
   enzyme functional and structural reference data for future
   bioinformatics analyses of (meta) genomes to elucidate the biology of
   complex gut ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{An interval type-2 fuzzy fractional programming (IT2FFP) method is
   developed for planning the renewable energy in electric power system for
   supporting sustainable development under uncertainty. IT2FFP can tackle
   output/input ratio problems where complex uncertainties are expressed as
   type-2 fuzzy intervals (T2FI) with uncertain membership functions. The
   IT2FFP method is then applied to planning Beijing electric power system,
   where issues of renewable energy utilization, electricity supply
   security, and pollutant/greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation are
   incorporated within the modeling formulation. The obtained results
   suggest that the coal-fired power would continue to decrease and the
   share of renewable energy in gross electricity supply would maintain an
   increasing trend. Results also reveal that imported electricity plays a
   significant role in the city's energy supply. A number of decision
   alternatives are also analyzed based on the interval solutions as well
   as the projected applicable conditions, which represent multiple options
   with sustainable and economic considerations. The optimal alternative
   that can give rise to the desirable sustainable option under the
   maximization of the share of renewable power generation has been
   suggested. The findings can help decision makers identify desired
   alternatives for managing such a mixed energy system in association with
   sustainable development. Compared with the conventional optimization
   methods that optimize single criterion, it is proved that IT2FFP is
   advantageous in balancing conflicting objectives and reflecting
   complicated relationships among multiple system factors as well as in
   tackling various subjective judgments of decision makers with different
   interests and preferences. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, indoor air quality has become an important health and
   safety concern, as more energy efficient and air tight buildings are
   built and the existing buildings age. Clean air is essential for good
   health, and this is especially true when it comes to indoor air.
   However, many work environments lack proper detection mechanisms to
   identify health risks for occupants. Wireless ad hoc sensor networks
   have the potential to alleviate this problem. This paper presents a
   real-time cognitive wireless sensor network system for carbon dioxide
   monitoring at a complex indoor environment. The system aims to monitor
   and detect the concentration of carbon dioxide in a real-time basis and
   provide overall air quality alerts in a timely manner. Moreover, the
   system coexists with minimum interference with other systems in the
   monitoring area. A prototype is designed to show the enhanced real-time
   data transmission. Experiments are conducted to validate and support the

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider optical pulses encoded with two nonanalytic
   points, and we evaluate the detectable information of these pulses in
   media supporting slow-and fast-light propagation. It is shown that, in
   some configurations of slow-(subluminal) light propagation, the signal
   is not readily detectable, albeit the arrival of the encoded nonanalytic
   points at the receiver. It is thus argued that, from a practical point
   of view, information should not be entirely associated with the pulse
   discontinuities. On the other hand, it is confirmed that for propagation
   in vacuum or a fast-light medium, detectable information is bounded by
   the nonanalytic points, which create a space-time window within which
   detectable information cannot escape. As such, the distinction between
   the nonanalytic points of a signal, its energy transport, and detectable
   information is demonstrated.}},

Title = {{Barriers and facilitators to uptake of systematic reviews by policy
   makers and health care managers: a scoping review}},
Journal = {{IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JAN 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: We completed a scoping review on the barriers and
   facilitators to use of systematic reviews by health care managers and
   policy makers, including consideration of format and content, to develop
   recommendations for systematic review authors and to inform research
   efforts to develop and test formats for systematic reviews that may
   optimise their uptake.
   Methods: We used the Arksey and O'Malley approach for our scoping
   review. Electronic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo) were
   searched from inception until September 2014. Any study that identified
   barriers or facilitators (including format and content features) to
   uptake of systematic reviews by health care managers and policy
   makers/analysts was eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently
   screened the literature results and abstracted data from the relevant
   studies. The identified barriers and facilitators were charted using a
   barriers and facilitators taxonomy for implementing clinical practice
   guidelines by clinicians.
   Results: We identified useful information for authors of systematic
   reviews to inform their preparation of reviews including providing
   one-page summaries with key messages, tailored to the relevant audience.
   Moreover, partnerships between researchers and policy makers/managers to
   facilitate the conduct and use of systematic reviews should be
   considered to enhance relevance of reviews and thereby influence uptake.
   Conclusions: Systematic review authors can consider our results when
   publishing their systematic reviews. These strategies should be
   rigorously evaluated to determine impact on use of reviews in
   decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we asked whether we could identify pharmacological agents that
   enhance endogenous stem cell function to promote skin repair, focusing
   on skin-derived precursors (SKPs), a dermal precursor cell population.
   Libraries of compounds already used in humans were screened for their
   ability to enhance the self-renewal of human and rodent SKPs. We
   identified and validated five such compounds, and showed that two of
   them, alprostadil and trimebutine maleate, enhanced the repair of full
   thickness skin wounds in middle-aged mice. Moreover, SKPs isolated from
   drug-treated skin displayed long-term increases in self-renewal when
   cultured in basal growth medium without drugs. Both alprostadil and
   trimebutine maleate likely mediated increases in SKP self-renewal by
   moderate hyperactivation of the MEK-ERK pathway. These findings identify
   candidates for potential clinical use in human skin repair, and provide
   support for the idea that pharmacological activation of endogenous
   tissue precursors represents a viable therapeutic strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Organo-metal halide perovskites have recently emerged as a highly

   evaporating ultra-thin films of organic semiconductor on thermally
   evaporated CH3NH3PbI3 and using in-situ ultraviolet photoemission
   spectroscopy, we directly measure the interfacial energy offset between
   CH3NH3PbI3 valence band maximum and the highest occupied molecular
   orbital for 5 different archetypal organic semiconductors. It is found
   that the energy offsets scale linearly as a function of the ionization
   energies of the organic semiconductors. The experimental data are in
   excellent agreement with a theoretical model for ideal semiconductor

Abstract = {{Synchrotron X-ray radiography and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
   (EIS) were concurrently used to quantify the effects of varying MPL
   thickness on PEMFC performance. Increasing the MPL thickness from 30 mu
   m to 50 mu m was found to lower the liquid water volume by 8\% in the
   cathode substrate, which resulted in a 50\% decrease in the oxygen mass
   transport resistance at a current density of 2.0 A/cm(2). Increasing the
   MPL thickness beyond 50 mu m at the same current density did not lead to
   any further substantial reductions of the liquid water volume in the
   cathode substrate (2\%); however, the ohmic resistance increases
   significantly (16\%). Among the four MPL thicknesses studied, the 50 mu
   m-thick MPL provides an optimized trade-off between the hydration of the
   membrane and the liquid water content in the fibrous substrate. A key
   observation of this work is the significant influence that high current
   density operation has on the heat and water management of polymer
   electrolyte membrane fuel cells. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   elongation in Drosophila}},
Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{Axis elongation is a conserved process in which the head-to-tail or
   anterior-posterior (AP) axis of an embryo extends. In Drosophila,
   cellular rearrangements drive axis elongation. Cells exchange neighbours
   by converging into transient multicellular vertices which resolve
   through the assembly of new cell interfaces parallel to the AP axis. We
   found that new interfaces elongate in pulses correlated with periodic
   contractions of the surrounding cells. Inhibiting actomyosin
   contractility globally, or specifically in the cells around
   multicellular vertices, disrupted the rate and directionality of new
   interface assembly. Laser ablation indicated that new interfaces
   sustained greater tension than non-elongating ones. We developed a
   method to apply ectopic tension and found that increasing AP tension
   locally increased the elongation rate of new edges by more than twofold.
   Increasing dorsal-ventral tension resulted in vertex resolution
   perpendicular to the AP direction. We propose that local, periodic
   contractile forces polarize vertex resolution to drive Drosophila axis
   elongation.}},

Abstract = {{Computed tomography (CT)-based aberration corrections are employed in
   transcranial ultrasound both for therapy and imaging. In this study,
   analytical and numerical approaches for calculating aberration
   corrections based on CT data were compared, with a particular focus on
   their application to transcranial passive imaging. Two models were
   investigated: a three-dimensional full-wave numerical model (Connor and
   Hynynen 2004 IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 51 1693-706) based on the
   Westervelt equation, and an analytical method (Clement and Hynynen 2002
   Ultrasound Med. Biol. 28 617-24) similar to that currently employed by
   commercial brain therapy systems. Trans-skull time delay corrections
   calculated from each model were applied to data acquired by a sparse
   hemispherical (30 cm diameter) receiver array (128 piezoceramic discs:
   2.5 mm diameter, 612 kHz center frequency) passively listening through
   ex vivo human skullcaps (n = 4) to emissions from a narrow-band, fixed
   source emitter (1 mm diameter, 516 kHz center frequency). Measurements
   were taken at various locations within the cranial cavity by moving the
   source around the field using a three-axis positioning system. Images
   generated through passive beamforming using CT-based skull corrections
   were compared with those obtained through an invasive source-based
   approach, as well as images formed without skull corrections, using the
   main lobe volume, positional shift, peak sidelobe ratio, and image
   signal-to-noise ratio as metrics for image quality. For each CT-based
   model, corrections achieved by allowing for heterogeneous skull
   acoustical parameters in simulation outperformed the corresponding case
   where homogeneous parameters were assumed. Of the CT-based methods
   investigated, the full-wave model provided the best imaging results at
   the cost of computational complexity. These results highlight the
   importance of accurately modeling trans-skull propagation when
   calculating CT-based aberration corrections. Although presented in an
   imaging context, our results may also be applicable to the problem of
   transmit focusing through the skull.}},

Journal = {{IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION \& DISTRIBUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},

Pages = {{41-47}},
Month = {{JAN 7}},
Abstract = {{A DC microgrid (DC-MG) provides an effective mean to integrate various
   sources, energy storage units and loads at a common dc-side. The
   droop-based, in the context of a decentralised control, has been widely
   used for the control of the DC-MG. However, the conventional droop
   control cannot achieve both accurate current sharing and desired voltage
   regulation. This study proposes a new adaptive control method for DC-MG
   applications which satisfies both accurate current sharing and
   acceptable voltage regulation depending on the loading condition. At
   light load conditions where the output currents of the DG units are well
   below the maximum limits, the accuracy of the current sharing process is
   not an issue. As the load increases, the output currents of the DG units
   increase and under heavy load conditions accurate current sharing is
   necessary. The proposed control method increases the equivalent droop
   gains as the load level increases and achieves accurate current sharing.
   This study evaluates the performance and stability of the proposed
   method based on a linearised model and verifies the results by digital
   time-domain simulation and hardware-based experiments.}},

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{Evaluating performance-based contracts (PBCs) for capital equipment can
   be a challenge because it is difficult to map service-level improvements
   to operational availability. This article considers scenario-based
   stochastic programming models for the evaluation of PBC alternatives for
   capital equipment consisting of a single-component system. In
   particular, PBC alternatives are evaluated for robustness under
   uncertainty in mean time between failures and mean downtime. The models
   measure expected deviation of implied contract operational availability
   and realized operational availability, and robustness is measured by the
   extent of improvement in service quality under a budget constraint.
   Optimal contract service levels are also computed that can be compared
   to service levels offered in a contract alternative. Value at risk (VaR)
   and conditional value at risk (CVaR) values for contracts are generated
   to gain insight into the readiness risk of contracts.}},

Abstract = {{Since part of car dependency is stemmed from personal choices of car
   over other modes of transportation, technological solutions are not the
   only way to reduce car use. Travel Behaviour Change Programmes (TBCP)
   are significantly cheaper transportation policy measures, which have
   evolved in order to shift people voluntarily out of their cars and into
   public transportation or non-polluting modes of travel, such as walking
   or cycling. Recently, a two-wave activity scheduling process panel
   survey was conducted over a period of two years in the city of Valencia
   (Spain). Part of the respondents received a set of TBCP between both
   survey waves. We have used doubled censored Tobit models to assess the
   effect of the TBCP on time allocation to driving a car or a motorbike.
   Results show that participation in the TBCP is significantly positive to
   reduce car or motorbike use, and its effectiveness is affected by
   different socio-economic factors.}},

Abstract = {{An SGL 29BC gas diffusion layer (GDL) was degraded (aged) in hydrogen
   peroxide. The impact of ageing was measured through deviations from
   pristine GDLs in terms of limiting current densities, oxygen mass
   transport resistances, and liquid water spatial distributions in the
   GDL. For dry and saturated cathode conditions (oxygen concentrations of
   1\% and 21\%, respectively) the fuel cell containing the aged GDL
   reached limiting current densities that were up to 10.3\% lower and
   experienced increases in oxygen mass transport resistance of up to
   11.7\% versus the pristine GDL. This performance reduction was
   attributed to a higher liquid water content (13\% more at an oxygen

Abstract = {{A commercial gas diffusion layer (GDL) with a microporous layer (MPL)
   containing multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) exhibited better
   performance in a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell than that
   with a conventional GDL. This performance benefit was attributed to
   improved oxygen mass transport in the cathode GDL. The operation of the
   fuel cell was visualized with synchrotron X-ray radiography to measure
   the liquid water saturation in the two GDLs. A higher liquid water
   saturation was measured in the operating fuel with the MWCNT-based MPL
   than with the conventional MPL. But, the MWCNTs induced higher effective
   porosity within the GDL, allowing for improved overall oxygen transport,
   and thus the cell performed better even with higher saturation of liquid
   water in the GDL.}},

   In-operando synchrotron X-ray radiography was used to measure the

   during changes in operational current density. Through in-operando
   visualizations at high temporal and spatial resolutions, we observed
   that the liquid water saturation of the GDL increases with increasing

Abstract = {{A numerical model was developed to predict the attenuated component and
   the undesired scattered component in the measured X-ray intensity during
   water visualizations using synchrotron X-ray radiography. The scattering
   component was found to increase as a function of water thickness
   traversed by the X-ray beam, and this led to a decrease in the
   calibrated attenuation coefficient. Due to this relationship between the
   scattering component and the water thickness, a small water thickness
   range was demonstrated to produce highly representative attenuation
   coefficients that resulted in the improved accuracy of water
   quantifications. Therefore, it was recommended that the calibrated
   attenuation coefficient should be obtained based on a water thickness
   range that most appropriately matches the expected liquid water
   thickness in an operating polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell.}},

Abstract = {{As-received pristine gas diffusion layers (GDLs) were degraded through
   an accelerated artificial aging process by immersion into a 35\%
   solution of H2O2 at 90 degrees C for 12 hours. Polarization curves were
   obtained while synchrotron X-ray radiography was performed to
   investigate the effect of ageing on liquid water transport behavior.
   Peak output power density of the fuel cell composed of the aged GDL
   reached only 76\% of that of the fuel cell composed of the pristine GDL.
   This performance degradation was attributed to an increase in mass
   transport resistance associated with liquid water accumulation at the
   aged GDL and flow field channel interface. The aged GDLs showed more
   liquid water accumulation at the microporous layer (MPL)/carbon
   substrate interface and carbon substrate regions than pristine GDLs at
   low current density operation. A fully developed water profile was
   established at lower current density for the aged GDLs compared to
   pristine GDLs.}},

Abstract = {{In underlay Device-to-Device (D2D) communication, where a D2D pair
   reuses the cellular spectrum and creates interference to regular
   cellular users, there exists a tradeoff between the achieved D2D rate
   and the interference to cellular users. In this work, we present
   stochastic optimization solutions to allocate the D2D transmission power
   over multiple resource blocks (RBs), to maximize the D2D rate, under a
   sum-power constraint and long-term individual power constraints over
   each RB at the D2D transmitter, which gives probabilistic guarantees on
   the interference to regular cellular users. This stochastic optimization
   problem can be solved optimally in the Lagrange dual domain with
   stochastic subgradient updating. However, since the vector channel state
   space is exponentially increasing in size, the standard subgradient
   updating method has prohibitive computation and storage complexity.
   Instead, by first showing that only the signs of subgradients are
   necessary to find the optimal Lagrange multipliers, we propose a
   distributed algorithm where each interference-victim cellular user
   calculates the subgradient and reports only its sign in one-bit
   feedback. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed optimization with limited feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Single cell surgery has been gaining increasing attention due to its
   extensive applications in physiological and pathological of cell
   research. Orientation control of biological cell is a basic and vital
   technique required in cell surgery procedures. By adjusting the
   orientation of the cell appropriately, the components and sites of
   interest can be captured by a microscope, such that further analysis,
   diagnosis, extraction and treatment can be performed. Cell rotation
   reduces the potential unwanted damage to components of cell during cell
   surgery. Currently, orientation control of biological cells is typically
   carried out with manual operations. With ongoing trend towards automated
   manipulation, a framework that can automate the multi-axis rotation of
   suspended biological cells is urgently needed. In this paper, we utilize
   two optical traps, generated by robotically controlled holographic
   optical tweezers (HOT), as two special manipulators to manipulate the
   cell for out of image plane rotation. By utilizing the T-matrix approach
   and experimental calibration, the relationship between the relative
   vertical height of the optical traps and the rotational angle is
   characterized. A visual feedback controller is further developed to
   rotate the cell to the pre-determined orientation accurately.
   Experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{In mammalian embryo development, the first cell lineage differentiation
   produces an inner cell mass and trophoblasts. Although it was speculated
   in biology that mechanical forces facilitate the first cell lineage
   differentiation, due to the natural physical barrier formed by the zona
   pellucida (i.e., outer membrane of an embryo), there is no technology
   for directly measuring the mechanical properties of the inner cell mass
   and trophoblasts inside the embryo. This paper reports a robotic fluidic
   jet system that enables mechanical characterization of intra-embryonic
   structures. The system accurately positions the fluidic jet to the
   target cell in 3D, based on visual servo control with a contact
   detection algorithm and a focus adjustment method. Under forces
   generated by the fluidic jet, the cell is deformed and cell deformation
   is measured with a sub-pixel contour detection algorithm. The fluidic
   jet system is capable of applying forces up to 50 nN with a resolution
   of 10 pN and measuring cell deformation with a sub-pixel resolution. In
   validation experiments, the system was used to measure the mechanical
   properties of two types of cancer cell lines. The results showed higher
   grade of cancer cells has lower stiffness. Further experiments performed
   inside mouse embryos, for the first time, revealed a significant
   difference in Young's modulus between the inner cell mass and
   trophoblasts (3.5 +/- 0.72 kPa vs. 4.7 +/- 0.65 kPa).}},

Abstract = {{Data-parallel applications, especially those associated with user-facing
   web services, have struggled to enhance their worst case performance. It
   is therefore important to improve the minimum amount of resources
   guaranteed for applications in a cluster. Existing cluster management
   frameworks, however, provide isolation for computation resources (such
   as CPU) only, and are oblivious to network isolation guarantees. In this
   paper, we design, implement and evaluate Libra, a new cluster management
   framework that helps to maximize the isolation guarantee for the
   bandwidth requirements from applications. We start with a theoretical
   analysis of the network sharing problem, which contains two key steps:
   container placement and bandwidth allocation. By collecting the status
   of access links and the bandwidth demand of applications, we coordinate
   the placement of containers to minimize the system bottleneck such that
   the bandwidth guarantee for applications can be optimized. We further
   embrace host-based rate limiting to ensure such maximized bandwidth
   guarantee can be reached without hurting network utilization. Both our
   testbed-based experiments and large-scale simulations demonstrate that
   Libra significantly improves the network isolation guarantee: in
   comparison with existing cluster managers and network schedulers, the
   performance gain is more than 105.59\%. Meanwhile, it improves
   application performance by 57.71\% and maintains high network
   utilization.}},
