Abstract = {{A new class of triarylamine compound functionalized with bulky
   triisopropylsilyl ether (-OTIPS) groups is used as a hole transport
   material in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Using both optical and
   photoelectro-chemical techniques, we compared the performance of this
   compound with that of a parent compound containing methyl ethers as well
   as the conventional I-3(-)/I- redox couple. DSSCs fabricated with the
   triisopropylsilyl ether-substituted triarylamine exhibited high open
   circuit potentials (V-oc > 0.9 V on average) and efficiencies of up to
   1.9\%. However, cells fabricated with triarylamine containing methyl
   ethers performed very poorly, pointing to the Importance of -OTIPS in
   the overall performance of this material.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. Pencil grasps other than the dynamic tripod may be functional
   for handwriting. This study examined the impact of grasp on handwriting
   speed and legibility.
   METHOD. We videotaped 120 typically developing fourth-grade students
   while they performed a writing task. We categorized the grasps they used
   and evaluated their writing for speed and legibility using a handwriting
   assessment. Using linear regression analysis, we examined the
   relationship between grasp and handwriting.
   RESULTS. We documented six categories of pencil grasp: four mature grasp
   patterns, one immature grasp pattern, and one alternating grasp pattern.
   Multiple linear regression results revealed no significant effect for
   mature grasp on either legibility or speed.
   CONCLUSION. Pencil grasp patterns did not influence handwriting speed or
   legibility in this sample of typically developing children. This finding
   adds to the mounting body of evidence that alternative grasps may be
   acceptable for fast and legible handwriting.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the potential of ultrasonic non-destructive
   measurements of residual stresses using the modal frequency spacing
   method based on the interference spectrum of leaky Lamb waves as an
   alternative to the commonly used flight-time approach in ultrasonic
   methods. Extensive experiments were carried out to verify the viability
   and robustness of the technique using an instrumented leaky Lamb wave
   setup with uniaxial stressed samples and welded steel samples. To
   improve the signal-to-noise ratio, multiple sets of raw signals of
   specularly reflected and leaky Lamb waves were acquired and then
   averaged in the time domain. The acquired data in the time domain were
   then transformed into the frequency domain to form the interference
   spectrum of leaky Lamb waves with a good repeatability. The
   acoustoelastic coefficient of carbon steel is then derived from the
   measured relationship of wave velocity and applied stress. Finally, a
   welded steel plate was examined and residual stress was evaluated. The
   current work demonstrates the feasibility and the potential of the
   proposed method in measuring residual stresses in welded plates and
   thin-walled structures.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid CMOS-microfluidic microsystem for chemiluminescence and
   electrochemiluminescence-based biochemical sensing is presented. The
   microsystem integrates a two-layer soft polymer microfluidic network and
   a CMOS imager fabricated in a standard 0.35-mu m technology. The CMOS
   imager consists of a 64 x 128-pixel array interdigitated with a 32 x 64
   electrolessly plated nickel-gold microelectrode array. A two-transistor
   reset path technique attenuates the subthreshold leakage current of the
   reset transistor which constitutes a significant portion of the dark
   current. An active reset technique, in-pixel flicker noise cancellation,
   and pixel binning contribute to noise reduction. The imager achieves a
   low dark current of 3.6 nA/cm(2) for photodiode reset voltages as high
   as 2.3 V, noise of 110 mu Vrms with maximum time of photon integration
   of 90 s, and a dynamic range of 67.8 dB. The CMOS-microfluidic

Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1367-1376}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Embryonic stem cells (ESC) and epiblast stem cells (EpiSC) are distinct
   pluripotent stem cell states that require different signaling pathways
   for their self-renewal. Forward transitions between ESC and EpiSC can be
   accomplished by changing culture conditions; however reverse transitions
   between EpiSC and ESC are rare events that require transgene insertion
   or culture on feeders. We demonstrate that transgene-free reversion of
   EpiSCs to ESCs can be enhanced by local microenvironmental control and
   the subsequent reactivation of dormant LIF-STAT3 signaling. Reactivation
   of LIF responsiveness occurs in regions of colony constraint (high local
   cell density) typical of culture on feeders, a condition that can be
   recapitulated using micropatterned (mu P) colonies under defined
   conditions. This increased LIF responsiveness results in a subsequent
   increase in the frequency of EpiSC reversion. Importantly, the resulting
   revertant EpiSCs are functionally indistinguishable from naive mESC. Our
   findings demonstrate that signaling pathway activation and repression
   create barriers to cell fate transitions that can be overcome by
   microenvironmental control.}},

   guarantee state averaging on arbitrary strongly connected digraphs; in
   particular, this graphical condition does not require that the network
   be balanced or symmetric, thereby extending previous results in the
   literature. The key novelty of our approach is to augment an additional
   variable for each agent, called ``surplus{''}, whose function is to
   locally record individual state updates. For convergence analysis, we
   employ graph-theoretic and nonnegative matrix tools, plus the eigenvalue
   perturbation theory playing a crucial role. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Protein adsorption is an important phenomenon influencing the cellular
   response to biomaterials. Previous studies comparing monocyte activation
   on a degradable polar hydrophobic ionic polyurethane (D-PHI) indicated a
   reduced pro-inflammatory monocyte response relative to tissue culture
   polystyrene (TCPS) and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) substrates. The
   present study investigated the influence of protein binding in order to
   gain further insight into the observed differential monocyte activation.
   Several proteins, identified in different relative amounts within the
   bound protein layers on D-PHI vs. PLGA and TCPS, were evaluated for
   their effect on monocyte activation. It was found that, in general, both
   non-coated and protein pre-adsorbed D-PHI supported a reduced
   pro-inflammatory response relative to PLGA, as indicated by lower levels
   of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) release. An initial increase
   in TNF-alpha release occurred when alpha(2)-macroglobulin (A2M) was
   pre-adsorbed to D-PHI, which was shown to involve the
   alpha(2)-macroglobulin receptor and was active on D-PHI but not on the
   two other biomaterials. This response was not observed during
   competitive protein binding in the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS),
   suggesting that a more complex arrangement of the bound proteins and
   their interactions with one another, as well as with the surface
   chemistry of the individual biomaterials, resulted in the low-activating
   character of D-PHI when interacting with human monocytes. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Noninvasive glucose monitoring will greatly improve diabetes management.
   We applied Wavelength-Modulated Differential Laser Photothermal
   Radiometry (WM-DPTR) to noninvasive glucose measurements in human skin
   in vitro in the mid-infrared range. Glucose measurements in human blood
   serum diffused into a human skin sample (1 mm thickness from abdomen) in
   the physiological range (21-400 mg/dl) demonstrated high sensitivity and
   accuracy to meet wide clinical detection requirements. It was found that
   the glucose sensitivity could be tuned by adjusting the intensity ratio
   and phase difference of the two laser beams in the WM-DPTR system. The
   measurement results demonstrated the feasibility of the development of
   WM-DPTR into a clinically viable noninvasive glucose biosensor. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{A novel channel diagonalization scheme for an amplify-and-forward,
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), two-way relay channel (TWRC) is
   proposed using generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD).
   Diagonalization of the MIMO TWRC is a sub-optimal approach that achieves
   two main purposes: reducing the computational complexity for optimizing
   the linear precoders at each node; and reducing the detection complexity
   at the source nodes by separating the multiple data streams. For the
   given diagonalized structure, we first align the entries of the
   diagonalized channels using a permutation to maximize a lower bound of
   average achievable sum rate (ASR), and a joint source-relay power
   allocation is then performed to maximize the ASR of the aligned TWRC;
   the overall problem is divided into two convex subproblems, the
   solutions to which are provided in closed-form. Our analysis for the
   proposed scheme underlines the benefits of acquiring channel state
   information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GSVD-based
   relaying scheme, with the signal alignment and closed-form power
   allocation, significantly improves the ASR while retaining the
   diagonalized channel structure. In addition, the proposed scheme
   achieves the same level of ASR with much less computational complexity
   as compared to the iterative schemes.}},

Abstract = {{In this correspondence, we consider the problem of linear processing
   design at the relay for amplified-and-forward relaying in a multichannel
   system. Assuming a fixed-gain power amplification at the relay, we study
   the linear processing structure tomaximize the end-to-end achievable
   rate. For both the cases of relaying with or without direct path, we
   show that the optimal unitary processing matrix is of permutation
   structure, i.e., channel pairing is optimal. Furthermore, in each case,
   the explicit optimal channel pairing strategy is obtained based on
   sorting certain function of received SNR over the incoming and outgoing
   subchannels. This result is especially noticeable for the case with
   direct path, where the optimal linear processing was not known before
   under any power allocation. Specifically, we show that the pairing is
   according to the ordering of the relative SNR ratio on a subchannel over
   first hop to its direct path, and that of SNR strengths on subchannels
   over the second hop. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the
   achievable gain of optimal channel pairing over non-optimal linear
   processing or no-pairing cases. It is also shown that the performance of
   channel pairing under the simple fixed-gain power allocation outperforms
   that under the traditional uniform power allocation.}},

Abstract = {{Metal-insulator-metal (MIM) waveguide mesh structures utilize
   X-junctions as power distribution elements to create interference and
   feedback effects, thereby providing rich device functionality. We
   present a generalized analytical model for MIM mesh structures by
   incorporating a modified characteristic impedance model for MIM
   junctions into the scattering matrix formalism. The modified impedance
   model accounts for metal absorption and provides accurate prediction of
   plasmonic field distribution at X-junctions in terms of both magnitude
   and phase. Closed-form expressions for 2 x 1 and 2 x 2 MIM mesh
   architectures as well as MIM stub structures are then obtained and are
   dependent only on waveguide geometry and junction configuration. The
   model does not require numerically extracted parameters, and results
   agree, within a few percent, with those obtained from finite-difference
   time-domain method for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional
   waveguide geometries. The capability of the model for efficient design
   and optimization of junction-based MIM devices is demonstrated through
   the development of various filter and resonant devices. (C) 2012 Optical

   C30H17BN6O3S, (I)] crystallizes in the space group P (1) over bar with Z
   = 2. The structure contains two centrosymmetric pi-stacking interactions
   between the concave faces of the isoindoline units in the BsubPc
   ligands. 3-Nitrobenzenesulfonate boron subphthalocyanine
   {[}(3-nitrobenzenesulfonato)(subphthalocyaninato) boron, C30H16BN7O5S,
   (II)] crystallizes in the space group P2(1)/c with Z = 4. The structure
   contains an intermolecular S-O center dot center dot center dot pi
   interaction from the sulfonate group to a five-membered N-containing
   ring of an isoindoline unit on the concave side of a neighbouring BsubPc
   ligand, at a distance of 3.151 (3) angstrom. The crystal of
   methanesulfonate boron subphthalocyanine
   {[}(methanesulfonato)(subphthalocyaninato) boron, C25H15BN6O3S, (III)]
   was produced via sublimation and it is not a solvate, in contrast with
   two previously published structures of the same compound. Compound (III)
   crystallizes in the space group P2(1)/n with Z = 2, and its structure is

Abstract = {{The need for higher degree of infrastructure utilization of the electric
   power system inevitably results in its operation closer to the limits.
   This in turn places the burden on control and protection strategies to
   ensure the constraints are not violated. This is especially imperative
   in microgrids in which resources are more limited and constraints are
   tighter. This paper presents an adaptive control strategy to augment the
   existing controllers and enhance their performance. This strategy
   monitors the response of a controlled device and temporarily modulates
   its control set point to achieve close tracking of the set point in the
   presence of disturbances. A detailed analytical derivation for the case
   that the overall behavior of the system (the devices and its controller)
   is approximated with a second-order transfer function is presented to
   confirm the viability of this strategy and its ability in designing a
   response with limited over-or undershoot.}},

Title = {{Speech-like and non-speech lip kinematics and coordination in aphasia}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE \& COMMUNICATION DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{654-672}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: In addition to the well-known linguistic processing
   impairments in aphasia, oro-motor skills and articulatory implementation
   of speech segments are reported to be compromised to some degree in most
   types of aphasia.
   Aims: This study aimed to identify differences in the characteristics
   and coordination of lip movements in the production of a bilabial
   closure gesture between speech-like and non-speech tasks in individuals
   with aphasia and healthy control subjects.
   Methods \& Procedures: Upper and lower lip movement data were collected
   for a speech-like and a non-speech task using an AG 100 EMMA system from
   five individuals with aphasia and five age- and gender-matched control
   subjects. Each task was produced at two rate conditions (normal and
   fast), and in a familiar and a less familiar manner. Single articulator
   kinematic parameters (peak velocity, amplitude, duration and cyclic
   spatio-temporal index) and multi-articulator coordination indices
   (average relative phase and variability of relative phase) were measured
   to characterize lip movements.
   Outcomes \& Results: The results showed that when the two lips had
   similar task goals (bilabial closure) in speech-like and non-speech
   task, kinematic and coordination characteristics were not found to be
   different. However, when changes in rate were imposed on the bilabial
   gesture, only speech-like task showed functional adaptations, indicated
   by a greater decrease in amplitude and duration at fast rates. In terms
   of group differences, individuals with aphasia showed smaller amplitudes
   and longer movement durations for upper lip, higher spatio-temporal
   variability for both lips, and higher variability in lip coordination
   than the control speakers. Rate was an important factor in
   distinguishing the two groups, and individuals with aphasia were limited
   in implementing the rate changes.
   Conclusions \& Implications: The findings support the notion of subtle
   but robust differences in motor control characteristics between
   individuals with aphasia and the control participants, even in the
   context of producing bilabial closing gestures for a relatively simple
   speech-like task. The findings also highlight the functional differences
   between speech-like and non-speech tasks, despite a common movement
   coordination goal for bilabial closure.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the effective through-plane thermal conductivities for
   compressed, anisotropic and heterogeneous polymer electrolyte membrane
   (PEM) fuel cell gas diffusion layers (GDLs) were determined analytically
   from representative physical GDL models, which were informed by
   microscale computed tomography imaging of four commercially available
   GDL materials. The number of fibre-to-fibre contact points and
   corresponding contact areas were extracted from these physical models as
   inputs to a thermal resistance model. It was found that the effective
   thermal conductivity increased with increasing GDL thickness (with bulk
   porosity remaining almost constant). The analytical model was employed
   to determine the bulk thermal conductivity as well as the thermal
   conductivity of the core region of the material. By isolating the core
   region from the bulk, a better understanding of the effect of the
   heterogeneous porosity profiles on the through-plane thermal
   conductivity was determined and discussed. Unlike the bulk thermal
   conductivity, the thermal conductivity of the core region was not
   dependent upon the material thickness. It was also found that the
   surface transition regions of the porosity distributions have a
   dominating effect over the addition of PTFE in impacting the overall
   thermal conductivity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The inflammatory response to liver injury plays an important role in the
   onset of liver fibrosis, which may ultimately lead to liver failure. The
   attenuation of inflammation and hepatocyte rescue are, therefore, of the
   utmost importance for recovery. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from
   adult bone marrow have been shown to rescue hepatocyte function. Here we
   explore a more plentiful source of neonatal MSCs: human umbilical cord
   perivascular cells (HUCPVCs). We cocultured HUCPVCs or bone
   marrowderived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) with rat hepatocytes
   or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in order to identify their
   effects on hepatocyte functionality and the proliferation of
   phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells
   (phaPBMCs). The expression of hepatotrophic factors by both types of
   MSCs in the presence of hepatocytes and the functional implications of
   blocking putative MSC anti-inflammatory factors were compared. Both
   types of MSCs improved albumin secretion, ureagenesis, hepatospecific
   gene expression, cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity, and functional
   hepatocyte mass maintenance. However, although HUCPVCs had an improved
   effect on the maintenance of ureagenesis, BM-MSCs had a strong effect on
   hepatocyte CYP activity. Additionally, each MSC type differentially
   expressed putative hepatotrophic factors, whereas phaPBMC proliferation
   was significantly decreased. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) was the
   main immunosuppressive mechanism used by both types of MSCs, but HUCPVCs
   exhibited higher expression of programmed death 1 ligands. However, the
   functional significance of the difference in anti-inflammatory factor
   expression still remains to be elucidated. Thus, both MSC types can
   serve as hepatocyte stromal cells and mitigate inflammation with IDO,
   but they present differences in the manner in which they affect
   hepatocytes and in the expression of both hepatotrophic and
   anti-inflammatory factors. Liver Transpl 18:13841394, 2012. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{In this paper, a parameter estimation procedure for a condition-based
   maintenance model under partial observations is presented. The
   deterioration process of the partially observable system is modeled as a
   continuous-time homogeneous semi-Markov process. The system can be in a
   healthy or unhealthy operational state, or in a failure state, and the
   sojourn time in the operational state follows a phase-type distribution.
   Only the failure state is observable, whereas operational states are
   unobservable. Vector observations that are stochastically related to the
   system state are collected at equidistant sampling times. The objective
   is to determine maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters
   using the ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithm. We derive explicit
   formulae for both the pseudo likelihood function and the parameter
   updates in each iteration of the EM algorithm. A numerical example is
   developed to illustrate the efficiency of the estimation procedure.

   Laurentian granite (LG) was investigated in this work. Notched
   semi-circular bend (NSCB) LG specimens are heat treated at temperatures
   up to 850 A degrees C. The micro-cracks in the rock samples induced by
   thermal treatment are examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM).
   The microscopic observations are consistent with the subsequent P-wave
   velocity measurements, which shows that the P-wave velocity decreases
   with the treatment temperature monotonically when the temperature is
   higher than 250 A degrees C. Dynamic fracture toughness measurements are
   then carried out on these samples with the dynamic load exerted by a
   modified split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system. The relationship
   between fracture toughness and treatment temperature is investigated.
   Experimental results show that fracture toughness increases with the
   loading rate but decreases with the treatment temperature. However, when
   the heating temperature is below 250 A degrees C and above 450 A degrees
   C, the dependence of dynamic fracture toughness on the temperature is
   different from other temperatures, which can be explained by the
   physical processes at the microscopic level of the rock due to heating.
   At treatment temperatures below 250 A degrees C, the thermal expansion
   of grains leads to an increase in the toughness of the rock. At
   treatment temperatures above 450 A degrees C, the sources of weakness
   such as grain boundaries and phase transition of silicon are depleted,
   and as a result the decrease in fracture toughness is not as significant
   as other treatment temperature ranges.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual environments have been investigated for fitness and medical
   rehabilitation. In this study, the Sony EyeToy (A (R)) and PlayStation 2
   (A (R)) were used with the AntiGrav (TM) game to evaluate their
   potential for improving postural balance. The game required lateral
   head, body, and arm movements. The performance on balance tests of
   subjects who trained for 3 weeks with this game was compared to the
   performance of controls who were not trained. Training subjects showed
   improvement for two of the three tests (each testing a different facet
   of balance), suggesting specificity of training, while control subjects
   did not show significant improvement on any test. Simulator sickness
   questionnaire results showed a variety of mild symptoms, which decreased
   over the training sessions. Motor learning analysis of the game scores
   showed that mastery had been achieved on the easier level in the game,
   but not on the second level of difficulty. This reflects the potential
   for continued learning and training through advanced levels within a
   game. A model parameter using the time constants of game score
   improvement was developed, which could be used to quantify the
   difficulty for any video game design. The results suggest that this
   video game could be used for some aspects of balance training.}},

Abstract = {{Synchrotron X-ray radiography on beamline 05B1-1 at the Canadian Light
   Source Inc. was employed to study dynamic liquid water transport in the
   porous electrode materials of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells.
   Dynamic liquid water distributions were quantified for each radiograph
   in a sequence, and non-physical liquid water measurements were obtained.
   It was determined that the position of the beam oscillated vertically
   with an amplitude of similar to 25 mu m at the sample and a frequency of
   similar to 50 mHz. In addition, the mean beam position moved linearly in
   the vertical direction at a rate of 0.74 mu m s(-1). No evidence of
   horizontal oscillations was detected. In this work a technique is
   presented to account for the temporal and spatial dependence of
   synchrotron beam intensity, which resulted in a significant reduction in
   false water thickness. This work provides valuable insight into the

Abstract = {{Rapid reach-to-grasp reactions are a prevalent response to sudden loss
   of balance and play an important role in preventing falls. A previous
   study indicated that young adults are able to guide functionally
   effective grasping reactions using visuospatial information (VSI) stored
   in working memory. The present study addressed whether healthy older
   adults are also able to use ``stored{''} VSI in this manner or are more
   dependent on ``online{''} visual control.
   Liquid-crystal goggles were used to force reliance on either stored or
   online VSI while reaching to grasp a small handhold in response to
   unpredictable platform perturbations. A motor-driven device varied the
   handhold location unpredictably for each trial. Twelve healthy older
   adults (65-79 years) were compared with 12 young adults (19-29 years)
   tested in a previous study.
   Reach-to-grasp reactions were slower and more variable in older adults,
   regardless of the nature of the available VSI. When forced to rely on
   stored VSI, both age groups showed a reduction in reach accuracy;
   however, a tendency to undershoot the handhold was exacerbated in the
   older adults. Forced reliance on online VSI led to similar delays in
   both age groups; however, the older adults were more likely to reach
   with the ``wrong{''} limb (contralateral to the handhold) and/or raise
   both arms initially (possibly to ``buy{''} more time for final limb
   selection).
   Situations that force the central nervous system to rely on either
   stored or online VSI tend to exacerbate age-related reductions in speed
   and accuracy of reach-to-grasp balance-recovery reactions. Further work
   is needed to determine if this increases risk of falling in daily life.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of the
   variously sulfated chitosans on lysozyme activity and structure. It was
   shown that the specific enzymatic activity of lysozyme remained almost
   similar to the native protein after being bound to 6-O-sulfated chitosan
   (6S-chitosan) and 3,6-O-sulfated chitosan (3,6S-chitosan), but decreased
   greatly after being bound to 2-N-6-O-sulfated chitosan (2,6S-chitosan).
   Meanwhile, among these sulfated chitosans, 2,6S-chitosan induced the
   greatest conformational change in lysozyme as indicated by the
   fluorescence spectra. These findings demonstrated that when sulfated
   chitosans of different structures bind to lysozyme, lysozyme undergoes
   conformational change of different magnitudes, which results in
   corresponding levels of lysozyme activity. Further study on the
   interaction of sulfated chitosans with lysozyme by surface plasmon
   resonance (SPR) suggested that their affinities might be determined by
   their molecular structures.}},

   clearly higher than that of a half thread tool. However, the failure
   load of the joints made using a half thread tool increased when the tool

   further increased, the failure load became almost the same as the
   failure load of joints made using a threaded tool. In Al 5052/Al 6061
   butt joints made using the threaded and half thread tools, the area of

Abstract = {{We present the constitutive equation for the volume-averaged
   hydrodynamic stress for a dilute emulsion in a linear ambient flow, when
   there is slip at the liquid-liquid interface between the Newtonian drop
   and the suspending fluids. Slip is modeled using a simple Navier slip
   boundary condition. We provide analytical solutions in the limit of
   small capillary numbers for the shape deformation, viscosity, and normal
   stresses. Slip moderates these quantities, with changes from the no-slip
   case being more pronounced for large viscosity ratios of the drop
   relative to the suspending fluid. It has been suggested in the past that
   slip can explain the anomalously low viscosities of certain polymeric
   blends. Our analysis indicates that slip can only partially account for
   these deviations, and that other mechanisms should be explored to
   explain the residual discrepancy. (C) 2012 The Society of Rheology.

Abstract = {{The Maule (Chile) earthquake of 27 February, 2010 has caused severe
   disruption and economic losses. With a magnitude of 8.8, it has been
   recorded as one of the largest earthquakes of the last century. The
   ground motion records from large subduction earthquakes, such as the
   Chile earthquake, are sparse. The number of accelerograms that recorded
   the strong ground motion was relatively few and only a few of these
   ground motions were released to engineering community. One of the
   objectives of this paper is to develop site specific ground motions that
   take into account the particular characteristics of this major
   earthquake. These are proposed to the engineering community as
   representative ground motions based on the best available data. The
   second objective of the paper is to investigate, using numerical tools,
   some typical failures observed in the engineered buildings and bridges.
   Although, in general engineered structures performed very well and the
   majority of failures, hence losses, were to non-engineered structures,
   some repeated deficiencies in structural design were observed. The
   developed hazard and site specific ground motions are used as inputs for
   inelastic dynamic analysis of advanced finite element building and
   bridge models. The results are processed to explain quantitatively the
   structural deficiencies observed in the field. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this paper, the performance of a particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   algorithm named Annealing-based PSO (APSO) is investigated to solve the
   redundant reliability problem with multiple component choices (RRP-MCC).
   This problem aims to choose an optimal combination of components and
   redundancy levels for a system with a series-parallel configuration that
   maximizes the overall system reliability. PSO is a population-based
   meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by the social behavior of the
   biological swarms that is designed for continuous decision spaces. As a
   local search engine (LSE), the proposed APSO employs the
   Metropolis-Hastings strategy, the key idea behind the simulated
   annealing (SA) algorithm. In APSO, the best position among all particles
   in each iteration is dynamically improved using the inner loop of the SA
   (i.e., equilibrium loop) while the temperature is updated in the main
   loop of the PSO algorithm. The well-known benchmarks are used to verify
   the performance of the proposed APSO. Even though APSO fails to
   outperform the best solution obtained in the literature, the
   contribution of this paper is comprised of the implementation of APSO as
   a hybrid meta-heuristic as well as the effect of Metropolis-Hastings
   strategy on the performance of the classical PSO. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.

Abstract = {{Stock price prediction is an important task for most investors and
   professional analysts. However, it is a tough problem because of the
   uncertainties involved in prices. This paper presents a four-layer fuzzy
   multiagent system (FMAS) architecture to develop a hybrid artificial
   intelligence model based on the coordination of intelligent agents
   performing data preprocessing and function approximation tasks for
   next-day stock price prediction. The first layer is dedicated to
   metadata creation. The second layer is aimed at data preprocessing using
   stepwise regression analysis and self-organizing map neural network
   clustering for modularizing prediction problems. The third layer is
   aimed at model building for each cluster using genetic fuzzy systems and
   evaluating built models to choose the best evolved fuzzy system for each
   cluster. Finally, the fourth layer provides model analysis and knowledge
   presentation. The capability of FMAS is evaluated by applying it on
   stock price data gathered from IT and airline sectors and comparing the
   outcomes with the results of other methods. The results show that FMAS
   outperforms all previous methods, so it can be considered as a suitable
   tool for stock price prediction problems. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to explore the use of the Dow Jones
   Sustainability Index (DJSI), with an emphasis on Canadian corporations.
   The paper provides insight into the use of the DJSI in several areas,
   including the use of its logo, the steps taken by corporations to
   achieve initial acceptance to the index, and the steps corporations take
   to maintain their inclusion in the DJSI. A content analysis of publicly
   available information from 24 Canadian corporations listed in the DJSI
   North America (DJSINA) showed that less than half of those sampled used
   the DJSI logo in their sustainability reports or on their websites. The
   majority of the published references to the DJSI were in highlighting
   corporate achievements or in providing background information on the
   index. A survey of 10 experts from the Canadian corporations listed in
   the DJSINA revealed a wide range of strategies for gaining and
   maintaining inclusion in the index, particularly involving a large
   number of internal stakeholders in responding to data requests and
   working with third parties. Several suggestions for improving the DJSI
   were also provided, including streamlining the questionnaire, improving
   coordination among sustainability ratings agencies, and enhancing

Abstract = {{This paper deals with photovoltaic power installations in urban
   environments. A general simulation method is developed to quantify the
   total energy yield for photovoltaic (PV) installation sites exploiting
   different levels of Distributed Maximum Power Point Tracking (DMPPT)
   granularity. The process includes 3-D modeling, shading evaluation of
   the installation site, and irradiance calculations on the PV surfaces on
   an hourly basis throughout the year. Three leading microconverter
   topologies are analyzed and the cost/performance tradeoff is discussed
   for panel-level DMPPT. The energy yield evaluation technique is
   confirmed by means of several miniature PV acquisition units for
   frequent irradiance and temperature measurements in the installation
   site. The yearly energy yield benefit is shown to be highly dependent on
   the relative shading in the three installation sites. It is found that
   the energy yield benefit easily outweighs the power electronics costs in
   two of the three installations for panel-level DMPPT. The analysis

Abstract = {{In this paper the problem of critical node detection (CNDP) is
   approached using population-based incremental learning (an estimation of
   distribution algorithm) and simulated annealing optimization algorithms
   using a combinatorial unranking-based problem representation. This
   representation is space-efficient and alleviates the need for any repair
   mechanisms. CNDP is a very recently proposed problem that aims to
   identify a vertex set V' subset of V of k > 0 nodes from a given graph G
   = (V,E) such that G(V\textbackslash{}V') has minimum pairwise
   connectivity. Numerous practical applications for this problem exist,
   including pandemic disease mitigation, computer security and
   anti-terrorism. In order to test the proposed heuristics 16 benchmark
   random graph structures are additionally proposed that utilize
   Erdos-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz, Forest Fire and Barabasi-Albert models.
   Each of these models presents different network characteristics,
   yielding variations in problem difficulty. The relative merits of the
   two proposed approaches are compared and it is found that the
   population-based incremental learning approach, using a windowed
   perturbation operator is able to outperform the proposed simulated
   annealing method. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Boundaries of the Origin of Replication: Creation of a pET-28a-Derived
   Vector with p15A Copy Control Allowing Compatible Coexistence with pET
   Vectors}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{During our studies involving protein-DNA interactions, we constructed
   plasmid pSAM to fulfill two requirements: 1) to facilitate transfer of
   cloned sequences from widely used expression vector pET-28a(+), and 2)
   to provide a vector compatible with pBR322-derived plasmids for use in
   cells harboring two different plasmids. Vector pSAM is a
   pET-28a(+)-derived plasmid with the p15A origin of replication (ori);
   pET-28a(+) contains the pBR322 replicon that is incompatible with other
   pBR322-derived plasmids. By replacing the original pET-28a(+)
   replicon-comprising the ori, RNAI, RNAII, and Rom-with the p15A
   replicon, we generated pSAM, which contains the pET-28a(+) multiple
   cloning site and is now compatible with pBR322-derived vectors. Plasmid
   copy number was assessed using quantitative PCR: pSAM copy number was
   maintained at 18 +/- 4 copies per cell, consistent with that of other
   p15A-type vectors. Compatibility with pBR322-derived vectors was tested
   with pGEX-6p-1 and pSAM, which maintained their copy numbers of 49 +/-
   10 and 14 +/- 4, respectively, when both were present within the same
   cell. Swapping of the ori is a common practice; however, it is vital
   that all regions of the original replicon be removed. Additional vector
   pSAMRNAI illustrated that incompatibility remains when portions of the
   replicon, such as RNAI and/or Rom, are retained; pSAMRNAI, which
   contains the intact RNAI but not ROM, lowered the copy number of
   pGEX-6p-1 to 18 +/- 2 in doubly transformed cells due to retention of
   the pET-28a(+)-derived RNAI. Thus, pSAMRNAI is incompatible with vectors
   controlled by the pBR322 replicon and further demonstrates the need to
   remove all portions of the original replicon and to quantitatively
   assess copy number, both individually and in combination, to ensure
   vector compatibility. To our knowledge, this is the first instance where
   the nascent vector has been quantitatively assessed for both plasmid
   copy number and compatibility. New vector pSAM provides ease of
   transferring sequences from commonly used pET-28a(+) into a vector
   compatible with the pBR322 family of plasmids. This essential need is
   currently not filled.}},

Abstract = {{Femtosecond laser exposure produces form and stress birefringence in
   glasses, mainly controlled by laser polarization and pulse energy, which
   leads to challenges in certain applications where polarization mode
   dispersion or birefringence splitting is critical for the desired
   responses from optical devices. In this paper, parallel laser
   modification tracks with different geometries were applied to
   preferentially stress the laser-written waveguides and explore the
   possibility of tuning the waveguide birefringence in devices fabricated
   in bulk fused silica glass. Polarization splitting in Bragg grating
   waveguides showed the laser modification tracks to controllably add or
   subtract stress to the pre-existing waveguide birefringence,
   demonstrating independence from the nanograting induced form
   birefringence and the contributions from material stress. Stressing bars
   are shown that offer tunable birefringence in the range from similar to
   0 up to 4.35 x 10(-4), possibly enabling great flexibility in designing
   polarization dependent devices, as well as making polarization
   independent devices. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Pages = {{8805-8812}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new format for particle-based immunoassays relying on
   digital microfluidics (DMP) and magnetic forces to separate and
   resuspend antibody-coated paramagnetic particles. In DMF, fluids are
   electrostatically controlled as discrete droplets (picoliters to
   microliters) on an array of insulated electrodes. By applying
   appropriate sequences of potentials to these electrodes, multiple
   droplets can be manipulated simultaneously and various droplet
   operations can be achieved using the same device design. This
   flexibility makes DMF well-suited for applications that require complex,
   multistep protocols such as immunoassays. Here, we report the first
   particle-based immunoassay on DMF without the aid of oil carrier fluid
   to enable droplet movement (i.e., droplets are surrounded by air instead
   of oil). This new format allowed the realization of a novel on-chip
   particle separation and resuspension method capable of removing greater
   than 90\% of unbound reagents in one step. Using this technique, we
   developed methods for noncompetitive and competitive immunoassays, using
   thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) as model
   analytes, respectively. We show that, compared to conventional methods,
   the new DMF approach reported here reduced reagent volumes and analysis
   time by 100-fold and 10-fold, respectively, while retaining a level of
   analytical performance required for clinical screening. Thus, we propose
   that the new technique has great potential for eventual use in a fast,
   low-waste, and inexpensive instrument for the quantitative analysis of
   proteins and small molecules in low sample volumes.}},

Abstract = {{Porphyrin-phospholipid conjugates were used to create photonic
   microbubbles (MBs) having a porphyrin shell ({''}porshe{''}), and their
   acoustic and photoacoustic properties were investigated. The inclusion
   of porphyrin-lipid in the MB shell increased the yield, improved the
   serum stability, and generated a narrow volumetric size distribution
   with a peak size of 2.7 +/- 0.2 mu m. Using an acoustic model, we
   calculated the porshe stiffness to be 3-5 times greater than that of
   commercial lipid MBs. Porshe MBs were found to be intrinsically suitable
   for both ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging with a resonance frequency
   of 9-10 MHz. The distinctive properties of porshe MBs make them
   potentially advantageous for a broad range of biomedical imaging and
   therapeutic applications.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{Current research supports the use of cognitive training interventions to
   improve the brain functioning of both adults and children. Our work
   focuses on exploring the potential use of robot assistants to allow for
   these interventions to become more accessible. Namely, we aim to develop
   an intelligent, socially assistive robot that can engage individuals in
   person-centred cognitively stimulating activities. In this paper, we
   present the design of a novel control architecture for the robot Brian
   2.0, which enables the robot to be a social motivator by providing
   assistance, encouragement and celebration during an activity. A
   hierarchical reinforcement learning approach is used in the architecture
   to allow the robot to: 1) learn appropriate assistive behaviours based
   on the structure of the activity, and 2) personalize an interaction
   based on user states. Experiments show that the control architecture is
   effective in determining the robot's optimal assistive behaviours during
   a memory game interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Boron subphthalocyanines have been explored as functional materials in a
   wide range of organic electronic applications including organic
   light-emitting diodes and organic solar cells. They have only, however,
   been studied as small molecules; there have been no reports of boron
   subphthalocyanine polymer(s) in the literature. Herein, the synthesis of
   the first boron subphthalocyanine-containing polymer,
   poly(4-methylstyrene)-co-poly(phenoxy boron subphthalocyanine), is
   reported along with its basic physical characterization/properties. The
   synthesis of the boron subphthalocyanine polymer was only possible via a
   postpolymerization functionalization approach, where the boron
   subphthalocyanine moiety is appended to the side chain of a
   styrene-based prepolymer. The three-step transformation begins with the
   nitroxide-mediated copolymerization of 4-methylstyrene and
   4-acetoxystyrene to form
   poly(4-methylstyrene)-co-poly(4-acetoxystyrene). The acetoxy groups are
   subsequently deacetylated to afford hydroxyl groups prior to
   phenoxylation with bromo boron subphthalocyanine to afford the title
   polymer(s).}},

Abstract = {{Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) have been used extensively for a variety
   of applications such as telecommunications, electronic devices and
   sensors. The emerging need for high-bit data processing at GHz
   frequencies and the requirement of high-sensitivity sensors demand the
   development of high-efficiency SAW devices. With the objective of
   exploiting the high acoustic velocity of diamond, the authors report on
   an optimally developed nanodiamond (ND) thin film with crystal size of
   3-5 nm, embedded in an amorphous carbon matrix with grain boundaries of
   1-1.5 nm, that is integrated with aluminium nitride (AlN) to extend the
   operating frequency of SAW transducers. The authors utilise this
   attractive property of diamond through facile synthesis of a bi-layer
   structure consisting of sputtered AlN deposited on ND. Deposition of ND
   was carried out using microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapour
   deposition. AlN/ND-based SAW structures were fabricated using electron
   beam lithography to produce high acoustic velocity transducers. The
   fabricated SAW transducers were composed of two spatial periods of 1400
   and 3200 nm devices. The fabricated devices exhibit an operating
   frequency of >2 GHz with an acoustic velocity of 8120 and 9280 m/s,

Abstract = {{Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) is a valuable
   tool for analyzing very small geological materials, like exposed melt
   inclusions, because it provides high mass and spatial resolution with
   little sample destruction. In this study, ToF-SIMS quantitative analysis
   of major and trace elements and isotope ratios were determined in a
   vapor bubble wall of a melt inclusion and in its host clinopyroxene. Two
   standard glass reference materials, BCR-1 and JB-2, of similar
   composition were used. Results indicate that quantification using
   ToF-SIMS is possible for many mineral-forming elements. High mass and
   spatial resolution elemental maps clearly show the preferential
   partitioning of S, Na, Cu, Au, Li, and K into the vapor bubble in the
   clinopyroxene-hosted melt inclusion. Moreover, the presence of C, H, and
   associated hydrocarbon fragments in the element maps suggest the
   heterogeneous entrapment of brine and hydrocarbon metal-bearing phases
   in the melt inclusion. Variability in isotope ratios found particularly
   in the standard reference materials suggests either or both
   heterogeneous distribution in the sample or analytical variability. In
   any case, more research is necessary in order to better constrain the
   multitude of variables.}},

Abstract = {{We present a 16-channel, mixed-signal CMOS DNA analyzer that utilizes
   frequency response analysis (FRA) to extract the real and imaginary
   impedance components of the biosensor. Two computationally intensive
   operations, the multiplication and integration required by the FRA

   the mixed-signal domain resulting in minimal area and power consumption.
   Multiplication of the input current by a digital coefficient is
   implemented by modulating the counter-controlled duration of the
   charging phase of the ADC. Integration is implemented by accumulating
   output digital bits in the ADC counter over multiple input samples. The
   1.05 mm X 1.6 mm prototype fabricated in a 0.13 mu m standard CMOS
   technology has been validated in prostate cancer DNA detection. Each

Abstract = {{Public transportation systems play a significant role in emergency
   evacuation. Therefore, this paper is geared towards harnessing subway
   and bus transit to alleviate congestion pressure during evacuation of
   busy urban areas. Routing and scheduling of transit vehicles and subway
   operation is envisioned as a new variant of the well-established vehicle
   routing problem. The model presented in this paper combines multiple
   variants of the traditional vehicle routing problem while reflecting on
   the operational characteristics during emergency evacuation, to include
   (1) multiple depots to better distribute the transit fleet, (2) time
   constraints to account for the evacuation time window, and (3)
   constraints for pick-up and delivery locations of evacuees. The
   evacuation problem is hereafter defined as a multi-depot
   time-constrained pick-up delivery vehicle route problem. A framework,
   using constraint programming and local search methods, was developed to
   model and solve the problem. An optimal spatio-temporal evacuation model
   was performed first to optimize evacuation of background vehicular
   traffic, generating transit travel cost (i.e., link travel times) as an
   input to the evacuation problem. The methodology was applied to evacuate
   the entire city of Toronto. The results show that the Toronto Transit
   Commission fleet is capable of evacuating the transit-dependent
   population (1.34 million) within 2 h on average. The four subway lines
   of the city of Toronto carry approximately 0.62 million people and can
   evacuate these people in less than 3 h on average. Toronto Transit
   Commission shuttle buses (1,320 vehicles) can evacuate the remainder of
   the transit-dependent population (0.72 million) in approximately 1.5 h
   on average. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000371. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{To better understand the effect of an asperity on crack closure
   behavior, K-CMOD relations were examined using artificial
   asperity/wedge, inserted into the fatigue crack in a three point bending
   specimen made of a hardened medium carbon steel. Experimental results
   revealed that the unloading phase of the K vs. CMOD curve exhibited a
   concave shape if soft artificial asperity (Al alloy) was inserted,
   signifying acceleration in the CMOD decrease at zero applied load. This
   was mainly related to elastic and plastic deformation in the wedge
   material during the unloading process. On the contrary, the linear
   unloading portion of K vs. CMOD was obtained as hard asperity (high
   carbon steel) was employed, which specified deceleration in the CMOD
   decrease at zero applied load, where the only elastic deformation in the
   asperity was affected. From their unloading curves, the severity of
   crack closure or Delta K-eff value was found to be related to the
   strength of the asperity material. The values of Delta K-eff were
   examined in two different ways, e.g., (i) the remote displacement method
   and (ii) the adjusted compliance ratio method (ACR). The Delta K-eff
   value, measured using both approaches, decreases with increasing wedge
   strength, such as hardness and yield strength. The rate of reduction in
   Delta K-eff was, however, changed depending on the manner of Delta K-eff
   examination, in which the Delta K-eff decreased at a higher rate for the
   compliance ratio method and at a lower rate for the remote displacement
   method. The reason for this is discussed in the present work.}},

   in current efforts to produce pancreatic beta cells, wherein robust

   desulphurization with fluxes made from these residue materials in
   comparison with those obtained from bauxite. To facilitate this
   comparative behavior of fluxes derived from different source materials,
   particular attention was given to the enhancing effects of controlled
   amounts of sodium oxide in contrast to the deleterious effects
   associated with the presence of silica and titanium dioxide on the
   desulphurization process. A major advantage of refining fluxes made from
   white mud waste products is that they contain significant amounts of

   The estimated effective thermal conductivities of various Mn-Al compacts

   lower than that of Al (237 W m(-1) degrees C-1), and close to that of Mn

   powder compacts decreased with an increase in the compact's Mn
   composition and porosity. Within the examined temperature range of 250
   to 600 degrees C, the effect of temperature on the effective thermal

   of this article is on removal of phosphorus, as a critical impurity in
   solar silicon. In order to assess the feasibility and efficiency of
   phosphorus removal through solvent refining, the distribution of
   phosphorus between solid Si and Fe-Si melt at 1483-1583 K (1210-1310
   degrees C) was measured. Interaction parameter between phosphorus and

   organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photo-voltaics (OPVs).
   Here we review the material properties of chloroboron subphthalocyanine
   (Cl-BsubPc) and its use as an organic semiconductor. We then highlight
   our efforts toward derivatives of boron subpthalocyanine beyond
   Cl-BsubPc and discuss the impact of molecular design on the material
   properties and the performance of the EsubPc. Finally, we comment on the

Abstract = {{We have recently developed a simple phenomenological model that allows
   one to account for the modifications of the gain characteristics of
   nanocomposite optical materials with specific geometries. Here we give a
   generalized formulation of our model to show that it can be applied to a
   broad variety of composite geometries. We demonstrate the application of
   our model using the Maxwell Garnett composite geometry with the resonant
   molecules in its host, which represent a practically important case that
   has not been treated earlier. We also give numerical examples for the
   Maxwell Garnett composite geometry with the resonances in either host or
   inclusions, and find the conditions under which it is possible to
   achieve an enhancement or suppression of the small-signal gain
   coefficient compared to its value in a bulk material. Using our simple
   model, one can identify the set of parameters, exhibiting the desired
   changes to the gain characteristics, prior to or instead of performing a
   more precise computationally intensive analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The physical properties, including the solid state arrangement,

   halo-BsubPcs (halo = F, Cl, Br) have been measured (IUPAC name
   halo-(7,12:14,19-diimino-21,5-nitrilo-5H-tribenzo(c,h,m)(1,6,11)triazacy
   clopentadecinato)-boron(III)). We have found that across the series all
   are relatively similar in most regards. Exceptions include that F-BsubPc
   can be 5 to 25 times more soluble than Cl-BsubPc in common organic
   solvents. F-BsubPc was also found to be hydrolytically stable under the
   conditions tested, whereas Cl-BsubPc and Br-BsubPc readily hydrolyzed to
   form HO-BsubPc. The relative rates of reaction for the series of
   halo-BsubPcs under standard phenoxylation conditions have also been
   measured. It was found that F-BsubPc does not undergo phenoxylation,
   whereas Br-BsubPc showed a markedly higher reaction rate relative to
   Cl-BsubPc. Based on these data some assumptions can be made as to the
   suitability of either F-BsubPc or Br-BsubPc to be used in place of the
   more common Cl-BsubPc. The data indicate that F-BsubPc is a potential
   replacement for Cl-BsubPc in organic electronic materials whereas
   Br-BsubPc might be more suitable as a chemical intermediate. Comments on
   the synthetic methods used to produce each halo-BsubPc are also made.}},

Abstract = {{Feasibility of detecting intravascular flow using a catheter based
   endovascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) system is demonstrated
   in a porcine carotid model in vivo. The effects of A-line density,
   radial distance, signal-to-noise ratio, non-uniform rotational
   distortion (NURD), phase stability of the swept wavelength laser and
   interferometer system on Doppler shift detection limit were investigated
   in stationary and flow phantoms. Techniques for NURD induced phase shift
   artifact removal were developed by tracking the catheter sheath.
   Detection of high flow velocity (similar to 51 cm/s) present in the
   porcine carotid artery was obtained by phase unwrapping techniques and
   compared to numerical simulation, taking into consideration flow profile
   distortion by the eccentrically positioned imaging catheter. Using
   diluted blood in saline mixture as clearing agent, simultaneous Doppler
   OCT imaging of intravascular flow and structural OCT imaging of the
   carotid artery wall was feasible. To our knowledge, this is the first in
   vivo demonstration of Doppler imaging and absolute measurement of
   intravascular flow using a rotating fiber catheter in carotid artery.

Abstract = {{The study asks how well are cities doing in reducing their greenhouse
   gas emissions. Data from six cities with repeat GHG emission inventories
   for the period 2004-2009 is examined: Berlin, Boston, Greater Toronto,
   London, New York City and Seattle. All of the cities are reducing their
   per capita GHG emissions, primarily through changes to stationary
   combustion. On average the cities are reducing per capita emissions by
   0.27 t CO(2)e/capita per year; this is about the same average rate as
   the cities nation states, although the cities are reducing emissions

   transmission power constraints are imposed on both individual
   transmitters and the aggregate over all transmitters. The joint
   optimization problem naturally leads to a mixed-integer program. Despite
   the general expectation that such problems are intractable, we construct
   an efficient algorithm to find an optimal solution, which incurs
   computational complexity that is polynomial in the number of channels
   and the number of users. We further demonstrate through numerical
   experiments that the jointly optimal solution can significantly improve
   system performance over its suboptimal alternatives.}},

   excitability. Both integrating and differentiating PDMs were present in
   the neuronal dynamics, and both of them increased in absolute magnitude
   for increased excitability levels. However, the integrating PDMs
   dominated at all levels of excitability in terms of their relative
   contributions to the overall response, whereas the dominant frequency
   responses of the differentiating PDMs were shifted to higher ranges
   under epileptogenic conditions, from ripple activities (75-200 Hz) to
   fast ripple activities (200-500 Hz).}},

   hippocampal epileptiform dynamics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Fractal methods offer an invaluable means of investigating turbulent
   nonlinearity in non-stationary biomedical recordings from the brain.
   Here, we investigate properties of complexity (i.e. the correlation
   dimension, maximum Lyapunov exponent, 1/f(gamma) noise and approximate
   entropy) and multifractality in background neuronal noise-like activity
   underlying epileptiform transitions recorded at the intracellular and
   local network scales from two in vitro models: the whole-intact mouse
   hippocampus and lesional human hippocampal slices. Our results show
   evidence for reduced dynamical complexity and multifractal signal
   features following transition to the ictal epileptiform state. These
   findings suggest that pathological breakdown in multifractal complexity
   coincides with loss of signal variability or heterogeneity, consistent
   with an unhealthy ictal state that is far from the equilibrium of
   turbulent yet healthy fractal dynamics in the brain. Thus, it appears
   that background noise-like activity successfully captures complex and
   multifractal signal features that may, at least in part, be used to
   classify and identify brain state transitions in the healthy and
   epileptic brain, offering potential promise for therapeutic
   neuromodulatory strategies for afflicted patients suffering from
   epilepsy and other related neurological disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(ethylene-co-octene)/multiwall carbon nanotube (PEOc/MWNT)
   nanocomposites were prepared by a melt blending process. The MWNT's
   solubility and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation
   indicated that the MWNT bonded well with a PEOc matrix. This facilitated
   the orientation of the MWNT when shear and extensional forces were
   applied to the nanocomposite melts. Microcellular PEOc/MWNT
   nanocomposite foams were prepared by a rising temperature process using
   supercritical CO2 as the blowing agent. Various foaming times were
   selected to reveal the cell-structure evolution during the cell growth
   stage. The obvious cell opening, resulting from cell coalescence, was
   observed in the cell wall in the neat PEOc foams. When the MWNT was
   introduced, however, the MWNT tended to orient in the cell wall. Here,
   as a result of the strain hardening, it acted as a self-reinforcing
   element, protecting the cells from destruction during cell growth.
   Consequently, a dramatic decrease in the open cell content and a still
   high cell density at long foaming times were obtained in the PEOc/MWNT
   nanocomposite foams. The present study provides experimental evidence of
   the vital effects of nanoparticle orientation on cell coalescence.

   measurement technique, including a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) cell

   utilized for measuring forces applied to an oocyte and resultant cell
   deformations in real time during oocyte manipulation. To characterize
   elastic and viscoelastic properties of the oocytes, a stress-relaxation
   indentation test is performed. A two-step, large-deformation mechanical
   model is developed to extract the mechanical properties of the oocytes
   from the measured force-deformation data. The experimental results
   demonstrate that the aged oocytes are significantly softer
   (instantaneous modulus: 2.2 vs. 5.2 kPa in young oocytes) but more
   viscous (relaxation time: 4.1 vs. 2.3 s in young oocytes) than the young

Abstract = {{Geometric indices defined on intracranial aneurysms have been widely
   used in rupture risk assessment and surgical planning. However, most
   indices employed in clinical settings are currently evaluated based on
   two-dimensional images that inevitably fail to capture the
   three-dimensional nature of complex aneurysmal shapes. In addition,
   since measurements are performed manually, they can suffer from poor
   inter and intra operator repeatability. The purpose of the current work
   is to introduce objective and robust techniques for the 3D
   characterization of intracranial aneurysms, while preserving a close
   connection to the way aneurysms are currently characterized in clinical
   settings. Techniques for automatically identifying the neck plane, key
   aneurysm dimensions, shape factors, and orientations relative to the
   parent vessel are demonstrated in a population of 15 sidewall and 15
   terminal aneurysms whose surface has been obtained by two trained
   operators using both level-set segmentation and thresholding, the latter
   reflecting typical clinical practice. Automatically-identified neck
   planes are shown to be in concordance with those manually positioned by
   an expert neurosurgeon, and automatically-derived geometric indices are
   shown to be largely insensitive to segmentation method or operator. By
   capturing the 3D nature of aneurysmal sacs and by minimizing observer
   variability, our approach allows large retrospective and prospective
   studies on aneurysm geometric risk factors to be performed using
   routinely acquired clinical images.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Recent advances have led to improved outcomes in lung transplantation.
   The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Registry
   data have shown a steady increase in the number of cases performed
   annually. Although somewhat controversial, lung transplantation (LTx)
   for lung cancer has also slowly increased. The current role of LTx for
   malignant diseases and the management challenge of incidental lung
   cancer in the explanted lungs are reviewed herein.
   Recent findings
   For a few particular scenarios (advanced multifocal bronchioloalveolar
   carcinoma causing chronic respiratory failure, end-stage lung disease
   concomitant with early stage lung cancer, and metastatic disease
   restricted to the lungs with the primary site controlled) in which
   nonsurgical alternatives fail to provide adequate palliation, LTx may be
   considered. Nevertheless, in order to achieve acceptable results,
   careful patient selection and staging are paramount. In patients with
   incidental bronchogenic carcinoma in the explanted lung following
   transplantation, the prognosis is mainly driven by the malignancy stage.
   Summary
   LTx can be performed to treat malignant diseases with results
   approaching those for nonneoplastic indications, given that patients are
   carefully selected and staged. Although they have not been widely
   applied in the reported lung transplant literature, modalities such as
   endobronchial ultrasound and positron emission tomography scan are
   strongly encouraged and have the potential to further refine staging in
   this population.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents fundamental concepts of a central power-management
   system (PMS) and a decentralized, robust control strategy for autonomous
   mode of operation of a microgrid that includes multiple distributed
   energy resource (DER) units. The DER units are interfaced to the utility
   grid through voltage-sourced converters (VSCs). The frequency of each
   DER unit is specified by its independent internal oscillator and all
   oscillators are synchronized by a common time-reference signal received
   from a global positioning system. The PMS specifies the voltage set
   points for the local controllers. A linear, time-invariant,
   multivariable, robust, decentralized, servomechanism control system is
   designed to track the set points. Each control agent guarantees fast
   tracking, zero steady-state error, and robust performance despite
   uncertainties of the microgrid parameter, topology, and the operating
   point. The theoretical concept of the proposed control strategy,
   including the existence conditions, design of the controller, robust
   stability analysis of the closed-loop system, time-delay tolerance,
   tolerance to high-frequency effects and its gain-margins, are presented
   in this Part I paper. Part II reports on the performance of the control
   strategy based on digital time-domain simulation and

Abstract = {{In Part I of this two-part paper, a power-management and a control
   strategy for the microgrid autonomous mode of operation were presented.
   The strategy consists of 1) open-loop frequency control of the system
   and synchronization of DER units based on a GPS signal; 2) voltage
   reference setpoint determination for the DER units by the central
   power-management system; and 3) tracking the assigned setpoints and
   rejecting disturbances by robust, decentralized, local controllers of
   DER units. This Part II paper applies the envisioned strategy to a
   three-DER microgrid. Offline digital time-domain simulation studies in
   the EMTDC/PSCAD software environment demonstrate the robustness of the
   local controllers to parametric, topological, and unmodelled
   uncertainties of the microgrid, its fast performance in tracking the
   setpoints with zero steady-state error, and rapid disturbance rejection.
   The results also show the effectiveness of the proposed power-management
   system in achieving prescribed load sharing of DER units. The digitized
   algorithms of the proposed control system of the three-DER microgrid are
   also implemented in NI-cRIO industrial-grade platforms and tested in an
   RTDS-based real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) environment to
   demonstrate the feasibility of the strategy for hardware implementation
   and hardware-based performance validation.}},

   algorithm}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{40-52}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A consistent numerical method for two-phase flows has been devised, that
   properly includes generic body forces in the framework of a collocated
   variable arrangement. We first discuss the accurate implementation of
   body forces, and then apply this to interfacial forces. Having shown the
   problems associated with applying forcing terms in a collocated
   framework, we introduce piezometric pressure into the governing
   equations for two-phase flow. As a result, the Navier-Stokes equations
   written for variable property flow, developed by Hong and Walker, are
   revised to be consistent with the numerical implementation of the
   level-set function. Consequently, the interfacial forces consist of both
   surface tension and gravity. We develop appropriate numerical methods to
   incorporate a generic body force, including the interfacial forces,
   within the framework of pressure-based algorithms (e.g. SIMPLE
   algorithm). A suitable pressure-velocity coupling scheme is then
   proposed for this type of flow solver and compared with other schemes.
   To validate the formulation, the results of several test cases including
   the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, a magnetized ferrofluid, and a falling
   water droplet are presented and compared with the results obtained by a
   conventional implementation of body forces. The advantages of confining
   the effect of gravity to the vicinity of an interface are explained, and
   we demonstrate how this approach enhances numerical solutions. Crown

Volume = {{383}},
Pages = {{198-207}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{We have generated stability parameters using a linear stability analysis
   to predict the onset criteria for Marangoni convection in evaporating
   sessile droplets for two types of substrates, insulating and conducting.
   The stability problem was formulated with boundary conditions that allow
   for a temperature discontinuity at the liquid-vapour interface and the
   inclusion of an expression for the evaporation flux that considers this
   temperature discontinuity. We introduce no fitting coefficients;
   therefore, the stability parameters we generate contain only physical
   variables. The results indicate that spherical sessile droplets
   evaporating on insulating substrates are predicted to have a similar
   onset criteria with sessile droplets evaporating on conducting
   substrates. The onset prediction for sessile droplets evaporating on
   insulating substrates is found to be considerably different than the
   case of liquids evaporating from conical funnels constructed of
   insulating materials owing to the modification of the boundary condition
   from the geometrical shift and the corresponding retention of modes in
   the solution. A parametric analysis demonstrates how the input variables
   impact the stability of evaporating sessile droplets. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Mechanomyography has recently been proposed as a control modality for
   alternative access technologies for individuals with disabilities.
   However, MMG recordings are highly susceptible to contamination from
   limb movements. Pressure-based transducers are touted to be the most
   robust to external movement although there is some debate about their
   optimal chamber geometry, in terms of low frequency gain and spectral
   flatness.
   To investigate the question of preferred geometry, transducers with
   cylindrical and conical chambers of varying dimensions were designed,
   manufactured and tested. Using a computer-controlled electrodynamic
   shaker, the frequency response of each chamber geometry was empirically
   derived.
   Of the cylindrical chambers, the highest gain and the flattest frequency
   response was exhibited by a chamber 10 mm in diameter and 5-7 mm in
   height. However, conical chambers offered an average rise in gain of
   6.79 +/- 1.06 dB/Hz over that achievable with cylindrical geometries.
   The highest gain and flattest response was achieved with a transducer
   consisting of a low-frequency MEMS microphone, a 4 mu m aluminized mylar
   membrane and a rigid conical chamber 7 mm in diameter and 5 mm in
   height. This design is recommended for MMG applications where limb

Abstract = {{A numerical study is conducted of ethane-air coflow diffusion flames at
   pressures from 2 to 15 atm. The model employed uses a detailed gas phase
   chemical kinetic mechanism that includes PAH formation and growth, and
   is coupled to a detailed sectional soot particle dynamics model. The
   model is able to accurately predict the trends observed experimentally
   with increasing pressure without any tuning of the model for different
   pressures. The model shows good agreement with the experimental data on
   both the flame wings and centerline regions. Peak wing and centerline
   soot volume fractions are found to scale with P-2.49 and P-2.02
   respectively. This scaling compares well to that observed experimentally
   for methane-air and ethylene-air flames. As pressure is increased, the
   flame cross-sectional area decreases according to P-1.0 due to a
   constant mass flux and a thinning of the flame, which is consistent with
   experimental observations. Soot formation along the wings is seen to be
   surface growth dominated, while PAH condensation dominates centerline
   soot formation. Surface growth and PAH condensation increase with
   increasing pressure primarily due to both of these processes being a
   function of surface area. This causes increases in soot volume fraction
   to further accelerate surface growth and PAH condensation, acting in a
   positive feedback manlier. This positive feedback mechanism is initiated
   by increases in reaction rates caused by increases in gas phase density.
   Additionally, the significance of surface growth decreases with
   increasing pressure, while the role of PAH condensation increases. (C)

Title = {{Forest protection and forest harvest as strategies for ecological

Abstract = {{An important consideration in forest management to mitigate climate
   change is the balance between forest carbon (C) storage and ecological
   sustainability. We explore the effects of management strategies on
   tradeoffs between forest C stocks and ecological sustainability under
   five scenarios, three of which included management and two scenarios
   which provide baselines emulating the natural forest. Managed forest
   scenarios were: (a) Protection (PROT), i.e., management by suppression
   of natural disturbance and harvest exclusion; (b) Harvest at a higher
   rate removing all sustainably available wood (HHARV); (c) Harvest at the
   lower historical average rate of harvest, AHARV. Both harvest scenarios
   reflected current forest management practices in the study area,
   including suppression of natural disturbance and a large (>20\% of
   total) forest area reserved from harvest. Scenarios (d) and (e)
   simulated ``natural{''} forest with unsuppressed fire at higher (NDH) or
   lower (NDL) levels and no harvest. Ecological sustainability was
   evaluated using a coarse filter approach where forest age class and tree
   species composition were indicators of condition. The study area
   encompassed 3.4 million hectares of forest in northeastern Ontario at
   the interface between the temperate hardwood and boreal forest zones.
   Future forest condition for each scenario was modeled using a timber
   supply model (SFMM), and C stored in forests and wood products were
   estimated using the FORCARB-ON model. Forest protection (PROT) resulted
   in greatest forest C stocks, especially in the near term, but was within
   95\% of its maximum, becoming saturated within 30 years. Harvesting
   (HHARV and AHARV) resulted in less forest C stock compared to PROT,
   however, after 100 years of adding C in wood products to that in
   regenerating forests total C storage was equivalent or greater than
   forest C with PROT. In contrast, removing management (NDH and NDL)
   decreased C relative to any of the management regimes, though in NDL the
   decrease was delayed for 30 years compared to HHARV. Forest
   sustainability measured by similarity to natural forest age class was
   superior with HHARV and AHARV compared to PROT, although no management
   regime produced a fully natural result. PROT in particular largely
   lacked younger age classes. All management regimes produced species
   composition that was near or within the range of natural variation. This
   analysis provides an example of the types of tradeoffs that can be
   considered in evaluating the contribution of forests to climate change
   mitigation, either in a commercial forestry context or in an approach
   based on protected areas. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Acetate amendment at uranium contaminated sites in Rifle, CO. leads to
   an initial bloom of Geobacter accompanied by the removal of U(VI) from
   the groundwater, followed by an increase of sulfate-reducing bacteria
   (SRBs) which are poor reducers of U(VI). One of the challenges
   associated with bioremediation is the decay in Geobacter abundance,
   which has been attributed to the depletion of bio-accessible Fe(III),
   motivating the investigation of simultaneous amendments of acetate and
   Fe(III) as an alternative bioremediation strategy. In order to
   understand the community metabolism of Geobacter and SRBs during
   artificial substrate amendment, we have created a genome-scale dynamic
   community model of Geobacter and SRBs using the previously described
   Dynamic Multi-species Metabolic Modeling framework. Optimization
   techniques are used to determine the optimal acetate and Fe(III)
   addition profile. Field-scale simulation of acetate addition accurately
   predicted the in situ data. The simulations suggest that batch amendment
   of Fe(III) along with continuous acetate addition is insufficient to
   promote long-term bioremediation, while continuous amendment of Fe(III)
   along with continuous acetate addition is sufficient to promote
   long-term bioremediation. By computationally minimizing the acetate and
   Fe(III) addition rates as well as the difference between the predicted
   and target uranium concentration, we showed that it is possible to
   maintain the uranium concentration below the environmental safety
   standard while minimizing the cost of chemical additions. These
   simulations show that simultaneous addition of acetate and Fe(III) has
   the potential to be an effective uranium bioremediation strategy. They
   also show that computational modeling of microbial community is an
   important tool to design effective strategies for practical applications
   in environmental biotechnology. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012; 109:

   the percentage of cork, cork size, and the cork blend. Key findings from
   this study revealed that: (i) The greatest early age (days 3 and 7) cube
   strengths were achieved by 24 h moisture saturation of the cork followed
   by draining it prior to use in concrete. Heat exposure of 50 degrees C
   or 100 degrees C resulted in detrimental effects on cube strength gain.
   (ii) Finer cork sizes were most beneficial to achieve optimum
   mechanical, and transport properties however high permeability values
   indicate that concrete-cork composites considered in this study may be
   vulnerable to poor durability performance. (iii) Greater percentages of
   cork as sand or stone replacement had the greatest impact on thermal

Title = {{A Galvanotaxis Assay for Analysis of Neural Precursor Cell Migration
   Kinetics in an Externally Applied Direct Current Electric Field}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{The discovery of neural stem and progenitor cells (collectively termed
   neural precursor cells) (NPCs) in the adult mammalian brain has led to a
   body of research aimed at utilizing the multipotent and proliferative
   properties of these cells for the development of neuroregenerative
   strategies. A critical step for the success of such strategies is the
   mobilization of NPCs toward a lesion site following exogenous
   transplantation or to enhance the response of the endogenous precursors
   that are found in the periventricular region of the CNS. Accordingly, it
   is essential to understand the mechanisms that promote, guide, and
   enhance NPC migration. Our work focuses on the utilization of direct
   current electric fields (dcEFs) to promote and direct NPC migration - a
   phenomenon known as galvanotaxis. Endogenous physiological electric
   fields function as critical cues for cell migration during normal
   development and wound repair. Pharmacological disruption of the
   trans-neural tube potential in axolotl embryos causes severe
   developmental malformations(1). In the context of wound healing, the
   rate of repair of wounded cornea is directly correlated with the
   magnitude of the epithelial wound potential that arises after injury, as
   shown by pharmacological enhancement or disruption of this dcEF(2-3). We
   have demonstrated that adult subependymal NPCs undergo rapid and
   directed cathodal migration in vitro when exposed to an externally
   applied dcEF. In this protocol we describe our lab's techniques for
   creating a simple and effective galvanotaxis assay for high-resolution,
   long-term observation of directed cell body translocation (migration) on
   a single-cell level. This assay would be suitable for investigating the
   mechanisms that regulate dcEF transduction into cellular motility
   through the use of transgenic or knockout mice, short interfering RNA,
   or specific receptor agonists/antagonists.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the dynamics of martensitic transformations in shape
   memory alloy (SMA) constrained finite nanostructures is studied using a
   phase field model with the Ginzburg-Landau free energy. The nonlinear
   coupled thermo-mechanical properties in SMAs have been extensively
   studied in the bulk case. However at the nanoscale the thermal physics
   has been usually neglected in a study of SMA properties, and most of the
   model developments have been carried out under the assumption of
   isothermal phase transformations. The main aim of this paper is to
   develop a model that couples the thermal physics and the mechanical
   dynamics to study the influence of such coupling on the mechanical
   properties of SMA nanostructures. The developed model is solved using
   the finite element method. Analyzing FePd alloy nanowires, we observe a
   steeper slope of the stress-strain curve in the coupled
   thermo-mechanical case due to temperature evolution during the
   loading-unloading cycle of such nanostructures. We also observe the
   martensitic suppression phenomenon in constrained nanowires and
   nanograins on cooling. We have developed a semi-analytical model to
   predict a critical size at the onset of martensitic suppression. The
   semi-analytical model predicts a critical size which is in a good
   agreement with the numerical results for FePd nanograins. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The assembly of RecA on linear dsDNA with ATP gamma S in the reaction
   was elucidated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) on a single-molecule
   level. It was found that assembly generally (similar to 95\%) proceeded
   from a single nucleation site that started from one end of the DNA
   strand. About 5\% of the complexes were formed starting either from both
   ends or from the middle of dsDNA strand. In all these cases, the RecA
   coating was contiguous for each region suggesting the binding of RecA to
   DNA is cooperative. The AFM observation provides direct experimental
   evidence to show how RecA binds to linear dsDNA in the presence of ATP
   gamma S. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents analytical solutions of the three-dimensional
   groundwater flow to a well in leaky confined and leaky water table
   wedge-shaped aquifers. Leaky wedge-shaped aquifers with and without
   storage in the aquitard are considered, and both transient and
   steady-state drawdown solutions are derived. Unlike the previous
   solutions of the wedge-shaped aquifers, the leakages from aquitard are
   considered in these solutions and unlike similar previous work for leaky
   aquifers, leakage from aquitards and from the water table are treated as
   the lower and upper boundary conditions. A special form of finite
   Fourier transforms is used to transform the z-coordinate in deriving the
   solutions. The leakage induced by a partially penetrating pumping well
   in a wedge-shaped aquifer depends on aquitard hydraulic parameters, the
   wedge-shaped aquifer parameters, as well as the pumping well parameters.
   We calculate lateral boundary dimensionless flux at a representative
   line and investigate its sensitivity to the aquitard hydraulic
   parameters. We also investigate the effects of wedge angle, partial
   penetration, screen location and piezometer location on the steady-state
   dimensionless drawdown for different leakage parameters. Results of our
   study are presented in the form of dimensionless flux-dimensionless time
   and dimensionless drawdown-leakage parameter type curves. The results
   are useful for evaluating the relative role of lateral wedge boundaries
   and leakage source on flow in wedge-shaped aquifers. This is very useful
   for water management problems and for assessing groundwater pollution.
   The presented analytical solutions can also be used in parameter
   identification and in calculating stream depletion rate and volume.

Abstract = {{Current tissue engineering scaffolds created by electrospinning
   techniques are mostly limited to two-dimensional membranes. In this
   article, a novel method for fabricating three-dimensional (3D) fibrous
   scaffolds is presented. The fabrication technique uses the saturation of
   carbon dioxide in poly(lactide-co-glycolide) acid to lower the
   glass-transition temperature of the polymer to allow for the sintering
   of multiple layers of electrospun films. The effect of gas saturation on
   the films was first examined by variation of the saturation pressure and
   time. Fiber sintering was observed as the saturation pressure and time
   were increased. Next, the adhesion strength between two layers of
   scaffolds that were sintered by gas saturation was examined, and a
   higher pressure of 400 psi was found to better adhere the layers of the
   membranes together. From the first two parts of this study, the optimal
   combination of gas saturation parameters was determined to a pressure of
   400 psi for 3 min. With this set of parameters, 3D structures were
   fabricated by the sintering of 30 layers of electrospun scaffolds. Also,
   by patterning individual layers using microfeatured plates, we improved
   the open porosity. This demonstration of the ability to fabricate 3D
   scaffolds improves current electrospinning techniques and maintains a
   desirable fibrous structure for tissue engineering. (C) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{The main purpose of the study is to verify if helical flow might be a
   surrogate marker of the exposure to disturbed shear in normal carotid
   bifurcations. Based on hemodynamic simulations data of 50 carotid
   bifurcations, we defined appropriate helicity-based bulk flow
   descriptors and multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to
   assess the potential for a combination of helicity-based indicators in
   describing the exposure to disturbed shear. To select the optimal
   combination of helicity-based descriptors in the regression model, the
   Akaike information criterion was applied. The identified statistical
   model is composed of two bulk flow descriptors proposed here to quantify
   helicity intensity and the balance between counter-rotating helical flow
   patterns in the flow field. The model revealed the existence of a
   significant relationship with adjusted squared Pearson's correlation
   coefficient in the range 0.4-0.7 (P < 0.0001). In detail, while a high
   helicity intensity is instrumental in suppressing flow disturbances,
   this protective effect could be moderated when one direction of rotation
   is dominant in the flow field. The in vivo quantification of the bulk
   flow features emerging in this study would offer a practical way to
   infer the presence of disturbed shear in large-scale in vivo studies of
   local risk factors in atherosclerosis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Pages = {{7357-7366}},

Abstract = {{Oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) that have four repeats of the human
   telomeric sequence d(TTAGGG)(n) can assume multiple monomolecular
   G-quadruplex topologies. These are determined by the cation species
   present, the bases at the 5' or 3' end, and the sample preparation
   technique. In this work, we report our studies of the concentration
   dependence of the circular dichroism (CD) and the vibrational modes
   probed by Raman scattering of three previously characterized
   monomolecular G-quadruplexes: H-Tel, d{[}5'-A(GGGTTA)(3)GGG-3'];
   hybrid-1, d{[}5'-AAA(GGGTTA)(3)GGGAA-3']; and hybrid-2,
   d{[}5'-TTA(GGGTTA)(3)GGGTT-3']. At high (millimolar) ODN concentrations,
   we observed a transformation of the CD spectrum of H-Tel, with a
   relaxation time on the order of 10 h. Analysis of the kinetics of this
   process is consistent with the formation of an aggregated complex of
   folded H-Tel monomers. Upon dilution, the aggregates dissociate rapidly,
   yielding spectra identical to those of monomeric H-Tel. Both hybrid
   sequences undergo a similar transition under high-salt (1 M) conditions.
   The measurements suggest that for these ODN concentrations, which are
   typically used in high-resolution spectroscopies, the monomolecular
   G-quadruplex structures undergo a transition to multimolecular
   structures at room temperature. Guided by our findings, we propose that
   the terminal bases of the hybrid-1 and hybrid-2 ODNs impede the
   formation of these aggregates; however, in solutions containing 1 M
   salt, the hybrid oligonucleotides aggregate.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of fracture characteristics, specific discharge, and ionic
   strength on microsphere transport in variable-aperture dolomite rock
   fractures were studied in a laboratory-scale system. Fractures with
   different aperture distributions and mineral compositions were
   artificially created in two dolomite rock blocks. Transport tests were
   conducted with bromide and carboxylate-modified latex microspheres (20,
   200, and 500 nm diameter). Under overall unfavorable attachment
   conditions, there was significant retention of the 20 nm microsphere and
   minimal retention of the 500 nm microsphere for all conditions examined.
   Aperture variability produced significant spatial variation in colloid
   transport. Flushing with low ionic strength solution (1 mM) following
   microsphere transport at 12 mM ionic strength solution produced a spike
   in effluent microsphere concentrations, consistent with retention of
   colloids secondary energy minima. Surface roughness and charge
   heterogeneity effects may have also contributed to the effect of
   microsphere size on retention. Matrix diffusion influenced bromide
   transport but was not a dominant factor in transport for any microsphere
   size. Calibrated one-dimensional, two-site kinetic model parameters for
   colloid transport in fractured dolomite were sensitive to the physical
   and chemical properties of both the fractured dolomite and the colloids,
   indicating the need for mechanistic modeling for accurate prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA) has been applied to monitor
   bioremediation of groundwater contaminants and provide insight into
   mechanisms of transformation of chlorinated ethanes. To date there is
   little information on its applicability for chlorinated methanes.
   Moreover, published enrichment factors (epsilon) observed during the
   biotic and abiotic degradation of chlorinated alkanes, such as carbon
   tetrachloride (CT); 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA); and
   1,1-dichloroethane (1,1-DCA), range from -26.5 parts per thousand to
   -1.8 parts per thousand and illustrate a system where similar C-Cl bonds
   are cleaved but significantly different isotope enrichment factors are
   observed. In the current study, biotic degradation of chloroform (CF) to
   dichloromethane (DCM) was carried out by the Dehalobacter containing
   culture DHI3-CF/MEL also shown to degrade 1,1,1-TCA and 1,1-DCA. The
   carbon isotope enrichment factor (e) measured during biodegradation of
   CF was -27.5 parts per thousand +/- 0.9 parts per thousand, consistent
   with the theoretical maximum kinetic isotope effect for C-Cl bond
   cleavage. Unlike 1,1,1-TCA and 1,1-DCA, reductive dechlorination of CF
   by the Dehalobacter-containing culture shows no evidence of suppression
   of the intrinsic maximum kinetic isotope effect. Such a large
   fractionation effect, comparable to those published for
   cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) suggests CSIA has
   significant potential to identify and monitor biodegradation of CF, as
   well as important implications for recent efforts to fingerprint natural
   versus anthropogenic sources of CF in soils and groundwater.}},

   ability of dissolved air flotation (DAF) systems to improve bubble
   removal during drinking water treatment were explored using
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. Both analytical and CFD
   analyses demonstrated benefits to horizontal flow. Two dimensional CFD
   modeling of a DAF system showed that increasing the amount of air in the
   system improved the bubble removal and generated a beneficial stratified
   horizontal flow pattern. Loading rates beyond a critical level disrupted
   the horizontal flow pattern, leading to significantly lower bubble
   removal. The results also demonstrated that including the effects of
   bubble aggregation in CFD modeling of DAF systems is an essential
   component toward achieving realistic modeling results. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Known to be involved in emotional processing the human prefrontal cortex
   (PFC), can be non-invasively monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy
   (NIRS). As such, PFC NIRS can serve as a means for studying emotional
   processing by the PFC. Identifying patterns associated with emotions in
   PFC using NIRS may provide a means of bedside emotion identification for
   nonverbal children and youth with severe physical disabilities. In this
   study, NIRS was used to characterize the PFC hemodynamic response to
   emotional arousal and valence in a music-based emotion induction
   paradigm in 9 individuals without disabilities or known health
   conditions. In particular, a novel technique based on wavelet-based peak
   detection was used to characterize chromophore concentration patterns.
   The maximum wavelet coefficients extracted from oxygenated hemoglobin
   concentration waveforms from all nine recording locations on the PFC
   were significantly associated with emotional valence and arousal.
   Specifically, high arousal and negative emotions were associated with
   larger maximum wavelet coefficients. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Comparative genomics of the white-rot fungi, Phanerochaete carnosa and
   P. chrysosporium, to elucidate the genetic basis of the distinct wood
   types they colonize}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{SEP 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Softwood is the predominant form of land plant biomass in
   the Northern hemisphere, and is among the most recalcitrant biomass
   resources to bioprocess technologies. The white rot fungus,
   Phanerochaete carnosa, has been isolated almost exclusively from
   softwoods, while most other known white-rot species, including
   Phanerochaete chrysosporium, were mainly isolated from hardwoods.
   Accordingly, it is anticipated that P. carnosa encodes a distinct set of
   enzymes and proteins that promote softwood decomposition. To elucidate
   the genetic basis of softwood bioconversion by a white-rot fungus, the
   present study reports the P. carnosa genome sequence and its comparative
   analysis with the previously reported P. chrysosporium genome.
   Results: P. carnosa encodes a complete set of lignocellulose-active
   enzymes. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that P. carnosa is
   enriched with genes encoding manganese peroxidase, and that the most
   divergent glycoside hydrolase families were predicted to encode
   hemicellulases and glycoprotein degrading enzymes. Most remarkably, P.
   carnosa possesses one of the largest P450 contingents (266 P450s) among
   the sequenced and annotated wood-rotting basidiomycetes, nearly double
   that of P. chrysosporium. Along with metabolic pathway modeling,
   comparative growth studies on model compounds and chemical analyses of
   decomposed wood components showed greater tolerance of P. carnosa to
   various substrates including coniferous heartwood.
   Conclusions: The P. carnosa genome is enriched with genes that encode
   P450 monooxygenases that can participate in extractives degradation, and
   manganese peroxidases involved in lignin degradation. The significant
   expansion of P450s in P. carnosa, along with differences in
   carbohydrate- and lignin-degrading enzymes, could be correlated to the
   utilization of heartwood and sapwood preparations from both coniferous
   and hardwood species.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Communication and collaboration failures can have negative
   impacts on the efficiency of both individual clinicians and health care
   system delivery as well as on the quality of patient care. Recognizing
   the problems associated with clinical and collaboration communication,
   health care professionals and organizations alike have begun to look at
   alternative communication technologies to address some of these
   inefficiencies and to improve interprofessional collaboration.
   Objective: To develop recommendations that assist health care
   organizations in improving communication and collaboration in order to
   develop effective methods for evaluation.
   Methods: An interprofessional meeting was held in a large urban city in
   Canada with 19 nationally and internationally renowned experts to
   discuss suitable recommendations for an ideal communication and
   collaboration system as well as a research framework for general
   internal medicine (GIM) environments.
   Results: In designing an ideal GIM communication and collaboration
   system, attendees believed that the new system should possess attributes
   that aim to: a) improve workflow through prioritization of information
   and detection of individuals' contextual situations; b) promote stronger
   interprofessional relationships with adequate exchange of information;
   c) enhance patient-centered care by allowing greater patient autonomy
   over their health care information; d) enable interoperability and
   scalability between and within institutions; and e) function across
   different platforms. In terms of evaluating the effects of technology in
   GIM settings, participants championed the use of rigorous scientific
   methods that span multiple perspectives and disciplines. Specifically,
   participants recommended that consistent measures and definitions need
   to be established so that these impacts can be examined across
   individual, group, and organizational levels.
   Conclusions: Discussions from our meeting demonstrated the complexities
   of technological implementations in GIM settings. Recommendations on the
   design principles and research paradigms for an improved communication
   system are described. (Interact J Med Res 2012;1(2):e9)

Abstract = {{This paper presents sensitivity analysis results for a distributed
   evolutionary implementation of the estimation of time-dependent
   origin-destination (TDOD) matrices. The system uses a noniterative
   origin-destination (OD) estimation process, which attempts to minimize
   the discrepancy between observed link flow counts and assigned counts.
   At the same time, the system anchors the search process to the vicinity
   of an a priori OD matrix to maintain travel patterns and OD structure.
   The sensitivity analysis examines various factors that are expected to
   affect the performance of the evolutionary-based TDOD estimation method.
   The factors examined are congestion levels, network size, size of the
   search space, and degree of precision of the a priori matrix. Simulation
   results for the waterfront network in Toronto, ON, Canada, show that the
   algorithm is robust in terms of replicating observed vehicle counts and
   the closeness to the real demand. The use of distributed evolutionary
   algorithm is also shown to provide good results for a large network and
   within fast computing speeds. However, the quality of the estimated OD
   relative to the true OD is shown to deteriorate if a totally random a
   priori matrix is used as a starting point, which has no structural
   resemblance to the prevailing OD patterns in the network. In addition,
   the quality of the estimated OD matrix was found to deteriorate as
   congestion levels and the network size increased. It is notable that, in
   all cases, the estimated OD matrix resulted in better matching flows.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to study the mechanical responses of a piezoelectric
   composite nanotube subject to an axial strain and electrical voltage.
   The nanotubes are fabricated by coating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with
   zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocrystal. The axial buckling of the ZnO-CNTs
   nanotubes (ZCNTs) is investigated by using a composite Euler beam model
   accounting for the piezoelectricity of the coating layer. Particular
   attention is paid to the strengthening effect of the core CNT and the
   effect of the piezoelectricity of the outer ZnO layer. Pre-buckling
   analysis is also conducted to study the static deformation prior to the
   buckling. Analytical solutions are obtained based on the theory of
   three-dimensional elasticity and piezoelectricity. In particular, a
   tensile radial stress is achieved at the ZnO-CNT interface, which tends
   to separate the ZnO layer from core CNT and may generate delamination in
   composite ZCNTs. The size-dependence and physical basis of such an
   interface stress is thus discussed in details for ZCNTs. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the use of the
   self-organizing map (SOM) method for visualization, modeling, and
   comparison of trunk neuromuscular synergies during perturbed sitting.
   Thirteen participants were perturbed at the level of the sternum, in
   eight directions during sitting. Electromyographic (EMG) responses of
   ten trunk muscles involved in postural control were recorded. The SOM
   was used to encode the EMG responses on a 2-D projection (i.e.,
   visualization). The result contains similar patterns mapped close
   together on the plot therefore forming clusters of data. Such
   visualization of ten EMG responses, following eight directional
   perturbations, allows for comparisons of direction-dependent postural
   synergies. Direction-dependent neuromuscular response models for each
   muscle were then constructed from the SOM visualization. The results
   demonstrated that the SOM was able to encode neuromuscular responses,
   and the SOM visualization showed direction-dependent differences in the
   postural synergies. Moreover, each muscle was modeled using the
   SOM-based method, and derived models showed that all muscles, except for
   one, produced a Gaussian fit for direction-dependent responses. Overall,
   SOM analysis offers a reverse engineering method for exploration and
   comparison of complex neuromuscular systems, which can describe postural
   synergies at a glance.}},

   recovery boilers in Sweden using force-measurement probes to determine
   the force of sootblower jets under various blowing conditions. The
   results confirm the findings of previous trials that, at a given
   distance, the force exerted on a target by a fully expanded sootblower
   jet increases nearly linearly with an increase in lance pressure. At a
   given lance pressure, the jet force decreases drastically as the
   distance between the sootblower nozzle and the target increases. At a
   distance farther than 1 m from the nozzle, the jet retains less than
   10\% of its original strength. The studies also show clearly that the
   size and shape of the target have a significant effect on the force
   exerted on it by the jet. A flat surface receives a greater force from
   the jet than a target with an inclined surface.}},

Abstract = {{The specific membrane capacitance (SMC) is an electrical parameter that
   correlates with both the electrical activity and morphology of the
   plasma membrane, which are physiological markers for cellular phenotype
   and health. We have developed a microfluidic device that enables
   impedance spectroscopy measurements of the SMC of single biological
   cells. Impedance spectra induced by single cells aspirated into the
   device are captured over a moderate frequency range (5 kHz-1MHz).
   Maximum impedance sensitivity is achieved using a tapered microfluidic
   channel, which effectively routes electric fields across the cell
   membranes. The SMC is extracted by curve-fitting impedance spectra to an
   equivalent circuit model. From our measurement, acute myeloid leukemia
   (AML) cells are found to exhibit larger SMC values in hypertonic
   solutions as compared with those in isotonic solutions. In addition, AML
   cell phenotypes (AML2 and NB4) exhibiting varying metastatic potential
   yield distinct SMC values (AML2: 16.9 +/- 1.9mF/m(2) (n = 23); NB4: 22.5
   +/- 4.7mF/m(2) (n = 23)). Three-dimensional finite element simulations
   of the microfluidic device confirm the feasibility of this approach. (C)

Abstract = {{Many complications in craniofacial surgery can be attributed to a lack
   of characterization of facial skeletal strain patterns. This study aimed
   to delineate human midfacial strain patterns under uniform muscle
   loading. The left sides of 5 fresh-frozen human cadaveric heads were
   dissected of all soft tissues except the temporalis and masseter
   muscles. Tensile forces were applied to the free mandibular ends of the
   muscles. Maxillary alveolar arches were used to restrain the skulls.
   Eight strain gauges were bonded to the surface of the midface to measure
   the strain under single muscle loading conditions (100 N). Maxillary
   strain gauges revealed a biaxial load state for both muscles. Thin
   antral bone experienced high maximum principal tensile strains (maximum
   of 685.5 mu epsilon) and high minimum principal compressive strains
   (maximum of -722.44 mu epsilon). Similar biaxial patterns of lower
   magnitude were measured on the zygoma (maximum of 208.59 mu epsilon for
   maximum principal strains and -78.11 mu epsilon for minimum principal
   strains). Results, consistent for all specimens and counter to
   previously accepted concepts of biomechanical behavior of the midface
   under masticatory muscle loading, included high strain in the thin
   maxillary antral wall, rotational bending through the maxilla and
   zygoma, and a previously underestimated contribution of the temporalis
   muscle. This experimental model produced repeatable strain patterns
   quantifying the mechanics of the facial skeleton. These new
   counterintuitive findings underscore the need for accurate
   characterization of craniofacial strain patterns to address problems in
   the current treatment methods and develop robust design criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine which trunk inclination directions most
   accurately predict multidirectional-seated limits of stability among
   individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI).
   Design: Predictive study using cross-sectional data.
   Setting: Pathokinesiology Laboratory.
   Participants: Twenty-one individuals with complete or incomplete
   sensorimotor SCI affecting various vertebral levels participated in this
   study.
   Interventions: Participants were instructed to lean their trunk as far
   as possible in eight directions, separated by 45 degrees intervals,
   while seated on an instrumented chair with their feet positioned on
   force plates.
   Outcomes measures: Eight direction-specific stability indices (DSIs)
   were used to define an overall stability index (OSI) (limits of
   stability).
   Results: All DSIs significantly correlated with the OSI (r =
   0.816-0.925). A protocol that only tests the anterior, left
   postero-lateral, and right lateral trunk inclinations accurately
   predicts multidirectional-seated postural stability (R-2 = 0.98; P <
   0.001).
   Conclusion: Multidirectional-seated postural. stability can be predicted
   almost perfectly by evaluating trunk inclinations performed toward the
   anterior, left postero-lateral, and right lateral directions.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the effects of functional electrical stimulation
   (FES)-assisted walking on body composition, compared to a non-FES
   exercise program in individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI).
   Design: Parallel-group randomized controlled trial.
   Methods: Individuals with chronic (>= 18 months) incomplete SCI (level
   C2 to 112, AIS C or D) were recruited and randomized to FES-assisted
   walking (intervention), or aerobic and resistance training (control)
   sessions thrice-weekly for 16 weeks. Whole body and leg lean mass and
   whole body fat mass, measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and
   lower-limb muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and fat CSA, measured with
   peripheral computed tomography were assessed at baseline, 4 months, and
   12 months. Intention-to-treat analyses using repeated measures general
   linear models were used to assess between-group differences.
   Results: Thirty-four individuals were randomized (17 per group); 27
   remained at 12 months. There were no significant main effects of
   FES-assisted walking on body composition variables in intention-to-treat
   analyses with group means. There was a significant group-by-time
   interaction for muscle area from baseline to 12 months (P = 0.04).
   Intention-to-treat analysis of muscle area change scores between
   baseline and 12 months revealed a significant difference between groups
   (mean (SD) muscle area change score 212 (517) mm(s) for FES, -136 (268)
   mm(s) for control, P = 0.026). There were 13 side effects or adverse
   events deemed related to study participation (7 intervention, 5
   control); most were resolved with modifications to the protocol. One
   fainting episode resulted in a hospital visit and study withdrawal.
   Conclusions: Thrice-weekly FES-assisted walking exercise over 4 months
   did not result in a change in body composition in individuals with
   chronic, motor incomplete C2 to T12 SCI (AIS classification C and D).
   However, longer-term follow-up revealed that it might maintain muscle
   area.}},

Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Pages = {{382-391}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To test the feasibility of controlling a computer cursor
   asynchronously in two dimensions using one subdural electrode.
   Design: Proof of concept study.
   Setting: Acute care hospital in Toronto, Canada.
   Participant: A 68-year-old woman w th a subdural electrode implanted for
   the treatment of essential tremor (ET) using direct brain stimulation of
   the primary motor cortex (MI).
   Interventions: Power changes in the electrocorticography signals were
   used to implement a ``brain switch{''}. To activate the switch the
   subject had to decrease the power in the 7-13 Hz frequency range using
   motor imagery of the left hand. The brain switch was connected to a
   system for asynchronous control of movement in two dimensions. Each time
   the user reduced the amplitude in the 7-13 Hz frequency band below an
   experimentally defined threshold the direction of cursor changed
   randomly. The new direction was always different from those previously
   rejected ensuring the convergence of the system on the desired
   direction.
   Outcome measures: Training time, time and number of switch activations
   required to reach specific targets, information transfer rate.
   Results: The user was able to contra the cursor to specific targets on
   the screen after only 15 minutes of training. Each target was reached in
   51.7 +/- 40.2 seconds (mean +/- SD) and after 9.4 +/- 6.8 switch
   activations. Information transfer rate of the system was estimated to be
   0.11 bit/second.
   Conclusion: A novel brain-machine interface for asynchronous
   two-dimensional control using one subdural electrode was developed.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the transferability of a microsimulation framework
   to estimate the movements of commercial vehicles in urban areas. We
   build on the pioneering efforts of Hunt and Stefan (2007) from Calgary,
   Alberta by considering three types of movements: tour-based; fleet
   allocator; and internal/external. Some sub-models from Calgary are
   transferred, while others are newly developed. The framework is
   implemented and validated for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area
   (GTHA) as a case study. A list of 185,790 records of individual business
   establishments in the GTHA was acquired from InfoCanada to conduct the
   microsimulations. The achieved results are promising with favorable
   correlations between observed and simulated commercial vehicle flows. We
   conclude that the modeling framework from Calgary can be transferred and
   used to depict the travel patterns of commercial vehicle movements in
   other urban areas. This can be beneficial when refined and costly data
   are unavailable to study urban commercial vehicle movements. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Bragg reflection waveguides are shown to be structures that can enable
   the integration of a laser and optically nonlinear medium within the
   same cavity for efficient frequency conversion. An effective and simple
   method of designing phase-matched laser structures utilizing transfer
   matrix analysis is described. The structures are first optimized in
   terms of laser performance and then for enhancement of chi((2))
   nonlinearity. The method for optimization shows that designing for
   either optimum laser performance or optimum nonlinear performance can
   conflict. An efficiency term encompassing the requirements of both the
   laser and nonlinear element is derived. This serves as a figure of merit
   that includes parameters relevant to both the laser and the nonlinear
   device. It is then utilized to optimize the structure for efficient
   parametric conversion. This figure of merit is extended to examine
   parametric oscillation in the laser cavity for both singly resonant and
   doubly resonant configurations. It is found that threshold values of 4 W
   in a practical device can be obtained. Such power levels are easily
   obtained by mode locking the pump laser. With reduced propagation loss
   through etch and design improvement, sub-Watt thresholds can be
   realized. (c) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{We explore the potential of versatile and efficient entangled photon
   pair generation by spontaneous parametric downconversion in Bragg
   reflection waveguides. By employing a quantum treatment of modes in
   channel waveguides, and by accounting for group velocity dispersion in
   the modes, the quantum state of the generated biphotons is realistically
   calculated. The pair production rate is predicted to reach 4 x 10(8)
   pairs/s/nm/mW of pump light in a 2 mm-long structure, on par with or
   exceeding the performance of previously reported designs. This is
   attributable to an enhanced nonlinear interaction through tight mode
   confinement in the waveguide. Strategies for device performance
   optimization and phase matching wavelength tunability are outlined and
   numerically demonstrated. The proposed design platformis versatile and
   allows photon pair generation with controllable flux, bandwidth, Schmidt
   number, and degree of polarization entanglement. The possibility of
   monolithic integration with a diode laser pump offers a way to design an
   electrically pumped entangled photon source. (c) 2012 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{We present a framework validated using both modeling and experiment to
   predict doping in CQD films. In the ionic semiconductors widely deployed
   in COD films, the framework reduces to a simple accounting of the
   contributions of the oxidation state of each constituent, including both
   inorganic species and organic ligands. We use density functional theory
   simulations to confirm that the type of doping can be reliably predicted
   based on the overall stoichiometry of the CQDs, largely independent of
   microscopic geometrical bonding configurations. Studies employing
   field-effect transistors constructed from CQDs that have undergone
   various chemical treatments, coupled with Rutherford backscattering and
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to provide compositional analysis,
   allow us to test and confirm the proposed model in an experimental
   framework. We investigate both p- and n-type electronic doping spanning
   a wide range of carrier concentrations from 10(16) cm(-3) to over 10(18)
   cm(-3), and demonstrate reversible switching between p- and n-type
   doping by changing the COD stoichiometry. We show that the summation of
   the contributions from all cations and anions within the film can be
   used to predict accurately the majority carrier type. The findings
   enable predictable control over majority carrier concentration via
   tuning of the overall stoichiometry.}},

Abstract = {{Biomass fast pyrolysis liquid, also known as bio-oil, is a promising
   renewable fuel for heat and power generation; however, implementing
   crude bio-oil in some current combustion systems can degrade combustion
   performance and emissions. Optimizing fuel properties to improve
   combustion is one way to solve this problem. There is currently limited
   information on the relationship between fuel properties and combustion
   performance and emissions of bio-oil. In this study, various
   hardwood-derived bio-oils with different fuel properties were tested in
   a pilot stabilized spray burner under the same flow conditions. The
   effect of solids, ash, and water contents of bio-oil as well as ethanol
   blending was examined. Steady-state gas phase and particulate matter
   emissions were measured. The results show that carbon monoxide and
   unburned hydrocarbon emissions correlate with the solids and ash
   fractions of bio-oil. Carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions
   decrease with both higher water and ethanol contents. Increasing the
   volatile content of fuel by blending in ethanol is shown to improve
   flame stability. The fraction of fuel nitrogen that is converted to
   nitrogen oxide emissions decreases with an increasing fuel nitrogen
   content. Also, the organic fraction of particulate matter emissions is
   found to be a strong function of the thermogravimetric analysis residue
   of the fuel. A conceptual model for bio-oil combustion is proposed that
   relates the fuel properties to the emissions.}},

Abstract = {{The microscopic strain distributions were studied for stress corrosion
   cracks produced electrochemically in C-rings of Alloy 600 (0.65 Ni, 0.16
   Cr, 0.08 Fe). The strain data were obtained using polychromatic X-ray
   microdiffraction (PXM) and (in part) by electron backscatter diffraction
   (EBSD). PXM was used to measure plastic and elastic strain distributions
   around the tip of a short crack, along with the changes to the direction
   and shape of the diffraction spots (ellipticity). For a sample with a
   short (30 mu m) crack, the misorientation map showed a well-defined
   region of plastic deformation along the grain boundary in advance of the
   crack tip, extending to the next triple point. For the large crack
   sample, plastic and elastic stains as well as crystalline order could be
   measured in high detail with respect to the crack path. However, no
   correlation between these could be obtained, except for a notable
   degradation of crystalline order near the crack mouth. A comparable EBSD
   misorientation map shows strong correlation between misorientation and
   the crack edges; this may in part reflect the role of sharp edges in the
   more surface-sensitive approach. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{Inspired by our past manual aspect mining experiences, this paper
   describes a probabilistic random walk model to approximate the process
   of discovering crosscutting concerns (CCs) in the absence of the domain

   performed on the concept graphs extracted from the program sources to
   calculate metrics of ``utilization{''} and ``aggregation{''} for each of
   the program elements. We rank all the program elements based on these
   metrics and use a threshold to produce a set of candidates that
   represent crosscutting concerns. We implemented the algorithm as the
   Prism CC miner (PCM) and evaluated PCM on Java applications ranging from
   a small-scale drawing application to a medium-sized middleware
   application and to a large-scale enterprise application server. Our
   quantification shows that PCM is able to produce comparable results (95
   percent accuracy for the top 125 candidates) with respect to the manual
   mining effort. PCM is also significantly more effective as compared to
   the conventional approach.}},

Title = {{Is the term ``obstetrical brachial plexus palsy{''} obsolete? An
   international survey to assess consensus among peripheral nerve surgeons}},

Abstract = {{Background: Brachial plexus injury diagnosed following delivery often
   causes life-long disability and frequently results in litigation. While
   there is no universally accepted name for this condition, the term
   `obstetrical brachial plexus palsy' (OBPP) is commonly used worldwide.
   The difficulty with the term `OBPP' lies with the use of the word
   `obstetrical', which some have construed to imply obstetrical
   malpractice even if none occurred. Many regions, especially in the
   United States, are suffering increasing obstetrician shortages,
   sometimes as a result of unsustainable liability insurance premiums. We
   wanted to determine whether surgeons felt that an alternative to the
   term `OBPP' was more appropriate.
   Methods: We surveyed peripheral nerve surgeons worldwide to determine
   the appropriateness of the term `OBPP' and alternative terms.
   Results: The majority of US-based surgeons (94\%) preferred alternative
   terms, such as ` neonatal brachial plexus palsy'. However, only 53\% of
   surgeons from other regions preferred alternative terms. This difference
   was statistically significant (p < 0.0002).
   Conclusions: More precise and descriptive alternatives to the term
   `OBPP' are available and acceptable to many surgeons. An alternative to
   `OBPP' may improve communication between practitioners, families and the
   legal system, especially in the United States. Our peripheral nerve
   organisations may be able to provide further leadership on this matter.

Abstract = {{The identification of fast and slow waves propagating through trabecular
   bone is a challenging task due to temporal wave overlap combined with
   the high attenuation of the fast wave in the presence of noise. However,
   it can provide valuable information about bone integrity and become a

   apply different coded excitation methods for this purpose. The results
   for single-sine cycle pulse, Golay code, and chirp excitations are
   compared. It is shown that Golay code is superior to the other
   techniques due to its signal enhancement while exhibiting excellent

Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dot solids combine convenient solution-processing with
   quantum size effect tuning, offering avenues to high-efficiency
   multijunction cells based on a single materials synthesis and processing
   platform. The highest-performing colloidal quantum dot rectifying
   devices reported to date have relied on a junction between a
   quantum-tuned absorber and a bulk material (e.g., TiO2); however,
   quantum tuning of the absorber then requires complete redesign of the
   bulk acceptor, compromising the benefits of facile quantum tuning. Here
   we report rectifying junctions constructed entirely using inherently
   band-aligned quantum-tuned materials. Realizing these quantum junction
   diodes relied upon the creation of an n-type quantum dot solid having a
   clean bandgap. We combine stable, chemically compatible,
   high-performance n-type and p-type materials to create the first quantum
   junction solar cells. We present a family of photovoltaic devices having
   widely tuned bandgaps of 0.6-1.6 eV that excel where conventional
   quantum-to-bulk devices fail to perform. Devices having optimal
   single-junction bandgaps exhibit certified AM1.5 solar power conversion
   efficiencies of 5.4\%. Control over doping in quantum solids, and the
   successful integration of these materials to form stable quantum
   junctions, offers a powerful new degree of freedom to colloidal quantum
   dot optoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dot (CQD) films allow large-area solution processing
   and bandgap tuning through the quantum size effect(1-6). However, the
   high ratio of surface area to volume makes CQD films prone to high trap
   state densities if surfaces are imperfectly passivated, promoting
   recombination of charge carriers that is detrimental to device
   performance(7). Recent advances have replaced the long insulating
   ligands that enable colloidal stability following synthesis with shorter
   organic linkers or halide anions(8-12), leading to improved passivation
   and higher packing densities. Although this substitution has been
   performed using solid-state ligand exchange, a solution-based approach
   is preferable because it enables increased control over the balance of
   charges on the surface of the quantum dot, which is essential for
   eliminating midgap trap states(13,14). Furthermore, the solution-based
   approach leverages recent progress in metal: chalcogen chemistry in the
   liquid phase(15-19). Here, we quantify the density of midgap trap
   states(20-22) in CQD solids and show that the performance of CQD-based
   photovoltaics is now limited by electron-hole recombination due to these
   states. Next, using density functional theory and optoelectronic device
   modelling, we show that to improve this performance it is essential to
   bind a suitable ligand to each potential trap site on the surface of the
   quantum dot. We then develop a robust hybrid passivation scheme that
   involves introducing halide anions during the end stages of the
   synthesis process, which can passivate trap sites that are inaccessible
   to much larger organic ligands. An organic crosslinking strategy is then
   used to form the film. Finally, we use our hybrid passivated CQD solid
   to fabricate a solar cell with a certified efficiency of 7.0\%, which is
   a record for a CQD photovoltaic device.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Root canal fillings are intended to prevent microbial
   proliferation over time in the canal after treatment. The objective of
   this study was to assess biofilm proliferation within the sealer-dentin
   interfaces of 2 methacrylate resin-based systems, self-etch (SE) and
   total-etch (TE), and an epoxy resin based sealer (EP), aged for up to 6
   months. Methods: Standardized specimens (n = 45) comprising the coronal
   5 mm of human roots were filled with the test materials and
   gutta-percha. Specimens were either not preincubated (control, n = 9) or
   were incubated in sterile saline for 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, or 6
   months (n = 3/group). Monospecies biofilms of Enterococcus faecalis were
   grown on the specimens for 7 days in a chemostat-based biofilm fermentor
   mimicking pathogenic oral conditions. The extent of E. faecalis
   proliferation within the sealer-dentin interface for each material and
   incubation period group was assessed by using fluorescence microscopy of
   dihydroethidium-stained specimens. Results: TE had less biofilm
   proliferation than both EP and SE (P < .01). Deeper biofilm
   proliferation was detected in SE and EP specimens aged for 1 and 3
   months than those aged for 1 week or 6 months (P < .05). Maximum depth
   of biofilm penetration was recorded for SE at 1 month (P < .05).
   Conclusions: Within the test model used, the SE and EP sealers were more
   susceptible to interfacial biofilm proliferation than the TE restorative
   material. This susceptibility diminished after aging the materials'
   interfaces for 6 months. (J Endod 2012;38:1253-1256)}},

Title = {{Multiresponse Metamodeling in Simulation-Based Design Applications}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The optimal design of complex systems in engineering requires the
   availability of mathematical models of system's behavior as a function
   of a set of design variables; such models allow the designer to search
   for the best solution to the design problem. However, system models
   (e.g., computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, physical prototypes)
   are usually time-consuming and expensive to evaluate, and thus unsuited
   for systematic use during design. Approximate models of system behavior
   based on limited data, also known as metamodels, allow significant
   savings by reducing the resources devoted to modeling during the design
   process. In this work in engineering design based on multiple
   performance criteria, we propose the use of multi-response Bayesian
   surrogate models (MR-BSM) to model several aspects of system behavior
   jointly, instead of modeling each individually. To this end, we
   formulated a family of multiresponse correlation functions, suitable for
   prediction of several response variables that are observed
   simultaneously from the same computer simulation. Using a set of test
   functions with varying degrees of correlation, we compared the
   performance of MR-BSM against metamodels built individually for each
   response. Our results indicate that MR-BSM outperforms individual
   metamodels in 53\% to 75\% of the test cases, though the relative
   performance depends on the sample size, sampling scheme and the actual
   correlation among the observed response values. In addition, the
   relative performance of MR-BSM versus individual metamodels was
   contingent upon the ability to select an appropriate
   covariance/correlation function for each application, a task for which a
   modified version of Akaike's Information Criterion was observed to be
   inadequate. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006996]}},

Abstract = {{We have recently proposed quantized gossip algorithms which solve the

   restrictive connectivity requirements. In this paper we study the
   convergence time of these algorithms. To this end, we investigate the
   shrinking time of the smallest interval that contains all states for the
   consensus algorithm, and the decay time of a suitable Lyapunov function
   for the averaging algorithm. The investigation leads us to characterize
   the convergence time by the hitting time in certain special Markov
   chains. We simplify the structures of state transition by considering
   the special case of complete graphs, where every edge can be activated

Abstract = {{Spinal metastasis commonly occurs in advanced breast cancer. Treatment
   is often multimodal including radiation therapy (RT), bisphosphonates
   (BPs), and surgery, yet alternative minimally invasive local treatments
   are needed. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been shown to ablate tumor
   cells and enhance bone formation secondary to metastatic breast cancer,
   demonstrating potential as a treatment for spinal metastasis. Combined
   with previous BP treatment, bone formation was further enhanced by PDT.
   This study aimed to determine the effects of PDT in combination with
   previous RT on healthy and metastatically involved vertebrae. Forty-six
   athymic rats underwent RT (4 Gy on day-7), twenty-three of them were
   inoculated with MT-1 human breast cancer cells on day 0. Thirteen
   healthy and ten metastatically involved rats underwent PDT treatment on
   day 14. All rats were sacrificed on day 21. L2 vertebrae were analyzed
   using mu CT imaging, mechanical testing, and histological methods. In
   healthy vertebrae, while modest increases in trabecular structure were
   found in RT + PDT compared to RT only, mechanical stability was
   negatively affected. The 4 Gy RT dose was found to ablate all tumor
   cells and prevent further vertebral metastasis. As such, in
   metastatically involved rats, no differences in stereological or
   mechanical properties were detected. RT + PDT and RT-only treatment
   resulted in greatly improved vertebral structural and mechanical
   properties versus untreated or PDT-only treatment in metastatically
   involved rats, due to early tumor destruction in RT-treated groups.
   Increased amounts of woven bone and osteoid volume were found in
   PDT-treated vertebrae. Further investigation is needed to understand if
   structural improvements seen in RT + PDT treatment can translate into
   longer-term improvements in strength to support the potential of PDT as
   a viable adjuvant treatment for spinal metastasis postradiation.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the shared relay architecture for the wireless
   cellular network, where instead of deploying multiple separate relays
   within each cell sector, a single relay with multiple antennas is placed
   at the cell edge and is shared by multiple sectors. The advantage of
   shared relaying is that the joint processing of signals at the relay
   enables the mitigation of intercell interference. To maximize the
   benefit of shared relaying, the resource allocation and the scheduling
   of users among adjacent cell sectors need to be optimized jointly. Based
   on this motivation, this paper formulates a network utility maximization
   problem for the shared relay system that considers the practical
   wireless backhaul constraint of matching the relay-to-user rate demand
   with the base-station-to-relay rate supply using a set of pricing
   variables. In addition, zero-forcing beamforming is used at the shared
   relay to separate users spatially; multiple users are scheduled in the
   frequency domain to maximize frequency reuse. A heuristic but efficient
   scheduling and resource allocation algorithm is proposed accordingly.
   System-level simulations quantify the effectiveness of the proposed
   approach, and show that the incorporation of the shared relay can
   improve the overall network performance and in particular significantly
   increase the throughput of cell edge users as compared to separate
   relaying.}},

Abstract = {{Guarded evaluation is a power reduction technique that involves
   identifying subcircuits (within a larger circuit) whose inputs can be
   held constant (guarded) at specific times during circuit operation,
   thereby reducing switching activity and lowering dynamic power. The
   concept is rooted in the property that under certain conditions, some
   signals within digital designs are not ``observable{''} at design
   outputs, making the circuitry that generates such signals a candidate
   for guarding. Guarded evaluation has been demonstrated successfully for
   application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs); in this paper, we
   apply the technique to field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In ASICs,
   guarded evaluation entails adding additional hardware to the design,
   increasing silicon area and cost. Here, we apply the technique in a way
   that imposes minimal area overhead by leveraging existing unused
   circuitry within the FPGA. The primary challenge in guarded evaluation
   is in determining the specific conditions under which a subcircuit's
   inputs can be held constant without impacting the larger circuit's
   functional correctness. We propose a simple solution to this problem
   based on discovering gating inputs using ``noninverting{''} and
   ``partial noninverting{''} paths in a circuit's AND-inverter graph
   representation. Experimental results show that guarded evaluation can
   reduce switching activity on average by as much as 32\% and 25\% for
   6-input look-up table (6-LUT) and 4-LUT architectures, respectively.
   Dynamic power consumption in the FPGA interconnect is reduced on average
   by as much as 24\% and 22\% for 6-LUT and 4-LUT architectures,
   respectively. The impact to critical path delay ranges from 1\% to 43\%,
   depending on the guarding scenario and the desired power/delay tradeoff.}},

Abstract = {{Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices have been used extensively for a
   variety of applications such as telecommunications, electronic devices,
   and sensors. The emerging need for high-bit data processing at gigahertz
   frequencies and the requirement of high-sensitivity sensors demand the
   development of high-efficiency SAW devices. With the objective of
   exploiting the high acoustic velocity of diamond, we report on an
   optimally developed nanodiamond thin film with crystal size of 3-5 nm,
   embedded in an amorphous carbon matrix with grain boundaries of 1-1.5
   nm, that is integrated with aluminum nitride (AlN) to extend the
   operating frequency of SAW transducers. We utilize this attractive
   property of diamond through facile synthesis of a bilayer structure
   consisting of sputtered AlN deposited on an ultrananocrystalline diamond
   (UNCD) film. We report the realization of a high-frequency SAW
   resonator, using a device architecture based on an UNCD layer. The UNCD
   films were synthesized using a microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor
   deposition (MWPECVD) technique and were used to enhance the SAW velocity
   in the AlN thin film, thus opening the way for the application of CMOS
   compatible high-frequency SAW devices. The deposition and
   characterization of UNCD thin films are presented and highlighted for
   the realization of the SAW resonators. The high velocity associated with
   the UNCD/AlN bi-layered approach together with the high lateral
   resolution of the interdigital transducers obtained with electron beam
   lithography is essential for the realization of high-frequency SAW
   devices. The fabricated devices demonstrate resonance frequencies of
   11.3 and 6.2 GHz corresponding to spatial periods of 800 and 1600 nm,
   respectively, yielding a SAW velocity of 9040 and 10 064 m/s,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Glow plugs are a possible ignition source for direct injected natural
   gas engines. This ignition assistance application is much different than
   the cold start assist function for which most glow plugs have been
   designed. In the cold start application, the glow plug is simply heating
   the air in the cylinder. In the cycle-by-cycle ignition assist
   application, the glow plug needs to achieve high surface temperatures at
   specific times in the engine cycle to provide a localized source of
   ignition. Whereas a simple lumped heat capacitance model is a
   satisfactory representation of the glow plug for the air heating
   situation, a much more complex situation exists for hot surface
   ignition. Simple measurements and theoretical analysis show that the
   thickness of the heat penetration layer is small within the time scale
   of the ignition preparation period (1-2 ms). The experiments and
   analysis were used to develop a discretized representation of the glow
   plug domain. A simplified heat transfer model, incorporating both
   convection and radiation losses, was developed for the discretized
   representation to compute heat transfer to and from the surrounding gas.
   A scheme for coupling the glow plug model to the surrounding gas
   computational domain in the KIVA-3V engine simulation code was also
   developed. The glow plug model successfully simulates the natural gas
   ignition process for a direct-injection natural gas engine. As well, it
   can provide detailed information on the local glow plug surface
   temperature distribution, which can aid in the design of more reliable
   glow plugs. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006692]}},

   for formation of vascular cords in cardiac tissue engineering}},
Journal = {{BIOFABRICATION}},

Abstract = {{We previously reported that preculture of fibroblasts (FBs) and
   endothelial cells (ECs) prior to cardiomyocytes (CMs) improved the
   structural and functional properties of engineered cardiac tissue
   compared to culture of CMs alone or co-culture of all three cell types.
   However, these approaches did not result in formation of capillary-like
   cords, which are precursors to vascularization in vivo. Here we
   hypothesized that seeding the ECs first on Matrigel and then FBs 24 h
   later to stabilize the endothelial network (sequential preculture) would
   enhance cord formation in engineered cardiac organoids. Three sequential
   preculture groups were tested by seeding ECs (D4T line) at 8\%, 15\% and
   31\% of the total cell number on Matrigel-coated microchannels and
   incubating for 24 h. Cardiac FBs were then seeded (32\%, 25\% and 9\% of
   the total cell number, respectively) and incubated an additional 24 h.
   Finally, neonatal rat CMs (60\% of the total cell number) were added and
   the organoids were cultivated for seven days. Within 24 h, the 8\% EC
   group formed elongated cords which eventually developed into beating
   cylindrical organoids, while the 15\% and 31\% EC groups proliferated
   into flat EC monolayers with poor viability. Excitation threshold (ET)
   in the 8\% EC group (3.4 +/- 1.2 V cm(-1)) was comparable to that of the
   CM group (3.3 +/- 1.4 V cm(-1)). The ET worsened with increasing EC
   seeding density (15\% EC: 4.4 +/- 1.5 V cm(-1); 31\% EC: 4.9 +/- 1.5 V
   cm(-1)). Thus, sequential preculture promoted vascular cord formation
   and enhanced architecture and function of engineered heart tissues.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design of a multi-gigabit fiber-optic receiver
   with integrated large-area photo detectors for plastic optical fiber
   applications. An integrated 250 mu m diameter non-SML NW/P-sub photo
   detector is adopted to allow efficient light coupling. The theory of
   applying a fully-differential pre-amplifier with a single-ended photo
   current is also examined and a super-Gm transimpedance amplifier has
   been proposed to drive a C-PD of 14 pF to multi-gigahertz frequency.
   Both differential and common-mode operations of the proposed super-Gm
   transimpedance amplifier have been analyzed and a differential noise
   analysis is performed. A digitally-controlled linear equalizer is
   proposed to produce a slow-rising-slope frequency response to compensate
   for the photo detector up to 3 GHz. The proposed POF receiver consists
   of an illuminated signal photo detector, a shielded dummy photo
   detector, a super-Gm transimpedance amplifier, a variable-gain
   amplifier, a linear equalizer, a post amplifier, and an output driver. A
   test chip is fabricated in TSMC's 65 nm low-power CMOS process, and it
   consumes 50 mW of DC power (excluding the output driver) from a single
   1.2 V supply. A bit-error rate of less than 10(-12) has been measured at
   a data rate of 3.125 Gbps with a 670 nm VCSEL-based electro-optical
   transmitter.}},

Abstract = {{New phosphorescent Pt-II compounds based on dimesitylboron
   (BMes(2))-functionalized 2-phenylpyridyl (ppy) N,C-chelate ligands and
   an acetylacetonato ancillary ligand have been achieved. We have found
   that BMes(2) substitution at the 4'-position of the phenyl ring can
   blue-shift the phosphorescent emission energy of the Pt-II compound by
   approximately 50 nm, compared to the 5'-BMes(2) substituted analogue,
   without substantial loss of luminescent quantum efficiencies. The
   emission color of the 4'-BMes(2) substituted Pt-II compound,
   Pt(Bppy)(acac) (1) can be further tuned by the introduction of a
   substituent group at the 3'-position of the phenyl ring. A methyl
   substituent red-shifts the emission energy of 1 by approximately 10 nm
   whereas a fluoro substituent blue-shifts the emission energy by about 6
   nm. Using this strategy, three bright blue-green phosphorescent Pt-II
   compounds 1, 2 and 3 with emission energy at 481, 492, and 475 nm and
   Phi(PL)=0.43, 0.26 and 0.25, respectively, have been achieved. In
   addition, we have examined the impact of BMes2 substitution on
   3,5-dipyridylbenzene (dpb) N,C,N-che-late Pt-II compounds by
   synthesizing compound 4, Pt(Bdpb)Cl, which has a BMes(2) group at the
   4'-position of the benzene ring. Compound 4 has a phosphorescent
   emission band at 485 nm and Phi(PL)=0.70. Highly efficient blue-green
   electroluminescent (EL) devices with a double-layer structure and
   compounds 1, 3 or 4 as the phosphorescent dopant have been fabricated.
   At 100 cd m(-2) luminance, EL devices based on 1, 3 and 4 with an
   external quantum efficiency of 4.7, 6.5 and 13.4\%, respectively, have

Abstract = {{Attempts are made to analyze the temporal and spatial effect and the
   complex mechanical behaviors of microcracks and the macro crack at
   mesoscopic scale based on the damage evolution principle. The mechanism
   of crack curving and branching in quasi-brittle materials under dynamic
   biaxial loading is investigated. The effects of different ratios between
   the load in the horizontal and vertical directions (for convenience, the
   loading ratio is denoted by B in this paper), crack dip angles and
   material homogeneity on crack curving and branching are considered. The
   results indicate that: Crack curving is mainly controlled by the loading
   ratio, while initiation and propagation of branch microcracks are
   related to the stress level. The initial dip angle of crack can vary the
   stress configuration at the crack tip zone. If the loading ratio remains
   constant, the crack tends to propagate toward the vertical direction
   with increasing crack dip angle. It is also found that heterogeneity due
   to defects in the material play an important role in the distribution of
   tiny voids and cracks in the material and the crack propagation mode.
   The results in this study are not only in good agreement with the
   physical test results, but also can provide some valuable reference for
   studies on the tensile properties and failure modes of heterogeneous
   quasi-brittle materials with internal defects.}},

Abstract = {{The flow of viscoelastic fluids through square arrays of parallel
   cylinders was investigated experimentally by measuring the pressure drop
   and flow rate and by mapping the velocity field using particle image
   velocimetry. The arrays had solid volume fractions of 2 1/2\%, 5\%, and
   10\% and the fluids were Boger fluids-specifically, two solutions of
   polyisobutylene in polybutene. With Reynolds numbers less than 0.1,
   viscosity and elasticity were the only relevant fluid properties.
   Measurements were made first with a glycerol/water mixture to establish
   an inelastic baseline. For the three arrays and two viscoelastic fluids,
   elastic effects started consistently at a Deborah number (De) of 0.5.
   For De up to 4, the flow resistance due to elasticity was up to several
   times that due to viscosity, which is comparable to previous findings
   with much higher volume fractions. But, unlike prior flows, the present
   ones were steady. Particle image velocimetry measurements revealed
   unit-cell velocity profiles, which became progressively asymmetrical as
   De increased. Also, flow structures related to elasticity were found in
   the wake regions; they were spaced periodically in the spanwise
   direction and offset from column to column to create a honeycomb-like
   pattern. Stress analyses indicate that the flow resistance due to
   elasticity was likely caused more by the normal stresses of N-1 than by
   extensional stresses. (C) 2012 The Society of Rheology.

Abstract = {{The regenerative capacity of injured adult central nervous system (CNS)
   tissue is very limited. Specifically, traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI)
   leads to permanent loss of motor and sensory functions below the site of
   injury, as well as other detrimental complications. A potential
   regenerative strategy is stem cell transplantation; however, cell
   survival is typically less than 1\%. To improve cell survival, stem
   cells can be delivered in a biomaterial matrix that provides an
   environment conducive to survival after transplantation. One major
   challenge in this approach is to define the biomaterial and cell
   strategies in vitro. To this end, we investigated both
   peptide-modification of gellan gum and olfactory ensheathing glia (OEG)
   on neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) fate. To enhance cell adhesion,
   the gellan gum (GG) was modified using Diels-Alder click chemistry with
   a fibronectin-derived synthetic peptide (GRGDS). Amino acid analysis
   demonstrated that approximately 300 nmol of GRGDS was immobilized to
   each mg of GG. The GG-GRGDS had a profound effect on NSPC morphology and
   proliferation, distinct from that of NSPCs in GG alone, demonstrating
   the importance of GRGDS for cell-GG interaction. To further enhance NSPC
   survival and outgrowth, they were cultured with OEG. Here NSPCs
   interacted extensively with OEG, demonstrating significantly greater
   survival and proliferation relative to monocultures of NSPCs. These
   results suggest that this co-culture strategy of NSPCs with OEG may have
   therapeutic benefit for SCI repair. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We previously showed that the sequential, but not simultaneous, culture
   of endothelial cells (ECs), fibroblasts (FBs), and cardiomyocytes (CMs)
   resulted in elongated, beating cardiac organoids. We hypothesized that
   the expression of Cx43 and contractile function are mediated by vascular
   endothelial growth factor (VEGF) released by nonmyocytes during the
   preculture period. Cardiac organoids (similar to 200 mu m diameter) were
   cultivated in microchannels to enable rapid screening. Three
   experimental groups were formed: (i) Simultaneous Preculture (ECs + FBs
   for 48 h, followed by CMs), (ii) Sequential Preculture (ECs for 24 h,
   FBs for 24 h, followed by CMs), and (iii) Simultaneous Triculture (ECs +
   FBs + CMs). Controls included CMs only, FBs only, and ECs only groups,
   and preculture with ECs only or FBs only. The highest VEGF levels were
   found in the Preculture groups {[} Simultaneous Preculture, 8.9 +/- 2.7
   ng/(mL.h(-1)); Sequential Preculture, 16.6 +/- 3.4 ng/(mL.h(-1))], as
   compared with Simultaneous Triculture where VEGF was not detectable, as
   shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Analytical flow cytometry
   showed that VEGFR2 was expressed by ECs (86\% +/- 2 VEGFR2 +), FBs (44\%
   +/- 1 VEGFR2 +), and CMs (49\% +/- 2 VEGFR2 +), showing that all three
   cell types were capable of responding to changes in VEGF. Addition of
   anti-VEGF neutralizing IgG (0.4 mu g/mL) to Simultaneous Preculture
   resulted in 3-fold decrease in Cx43 mRNA and 1.5-fold decrease in Cx43
   protein, while Simultaneous Triculture supplemented with VEGF ligand (30
   ng/mL) had a threefold increase in Cx43 mRNA and a twofold increase in
   Cx43 protein. Addition of a small molecule inhibitor of the VEGFR2
   receptor (19.4 nM) to Sequential Preculture caused a 1.4-fold decrease
   in Cx43 mRNA and a 4.1-fold decrease in Cx43 protein. Cx43 was localized
   within CMs, and not within FBs or ECs. Enriched CM organoids and
   Sequential Preculture organoids grown in the presence of VEGFR2

Abstract = {{To reduce the driving voltage, and hence enhance the power efficiency of
   OLEDs, the mobility of the various carrier transport layers needs to be
   increased. Buckminsterfullerene (C-60) has been proposed to be one
   possible alternative conductive electron transport layer (ETL) to
   enhance the power efficiency in OLEDs, due to its high conductivity and
   the formation of an ohmic contact with the LiF/Al cathode. The optical
   properties of a nanocomposite of C-60 with LiF (C-60:LiF) and its
   potential as an efficient ETL in OLEDs was studied. With proper
   optimization of the device structure, a more than 50\% improvement in
   the power efficiency, without sacrificing the high EQE, in optimized
   fluorescent OLEDs with the use of C-60:LiF nanocomposite ETL was
   achieved.}},

   distribution}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},

Month = {{AUG 27}},
Abstract = {{The length of signal pulses is finite in practical quantum key
   distribution. The finite-key analysis of an unconditional quantum key
   distribution is a burning problem, and the efficient quantum key
   distribution protocol suitable for practical implementation,
   measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI QKD), was
   proposed very recently. We give the finite-key analysis of MDIQKD, which
   removes all detector side channels and generates many orders of key rate
   higher than that of full-device-independent quantum key distribution.
   The secure bound of the ultimate key rate is obtained under the
   statistical fluctuations of relative frequency, which can be applied
   directly to practical threshold detectors with low detection efficiency
   and highly lossy channels. The bound is evaluated for reasonable values
   of the observed parameters. The simulation shows that the secure
   distance is around 10 km when the number of sifted data is 10(10).
   Moreover the secure distance would be much longer in practice because of
   some simplified treatments used in our paper.}},

Abstract = {{Walking is a complex, rhythmic task performed by the locomotor system.
   However, natural gait rhythms can be influenced by metronomic auditory
   stimuli, a phenomenon of particular interest in neurological
   rehabilitation. In this paper, we examined the effects of aural, visual
   and tactile rhythmic cues on the temporal dynamics associated with human
   gait. Data were collected from fifteen healthy adults in two sessions.
   Each session consisted of five 15-minute trials. In the first trial of
   each session, participants walked at their preferred walking speed. In
   subsequent trials, participants were asked to walk to a metronomic beat,
   provided through visually, aurally, tactile or all three cues
   (simultaneously and in sync), the pace of which was set to the preferred
   walking speed of the first trial. Using the collected data, we extracted
   several parameters including: gait speed, mean stride interval, stride
   interval variability, scaling exponent and maximum Lyapunov exponent.
   The extracted parameters showed that rhythmic sensory cues affect the
   temporal dynamics of human gait. The auditory rhythmic cue had the
   greatest influence on the gait parameters, while the visual cue had no
   statistically significant effect on the scaling exponent. These results
   demonstrate that visual rhythmic cues could be considered as an
   alternative cueing modality in rehabilitation without concern of
   adversely altering the statistical persistence of walking.}},

Title = {{The bZIP Dimer Localizes at DNA Full-Sites Where Each Basic Region Can
   Alternately Trans locate and Bind to Subsites at the Half-Site}},
Journal = {{BIOCHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{51}},

Abstract = {{Crystal structures of the GCN4 bZIP (basic region/leucine zipper) with
   the AP-I or CRE site show how each GCN4 basic region binds to a 4 bp
   cognate half-site as a single DNA target; however, this may not always
   fully describe how bZIP proteins interact with their target sites.
   Previously, we showed that the GCN4 basic region interacts with all S bp
   in half-site TTGCG (termed 5H-LR) and that 5H-LR comprises two 4 bp
   subsites, TTGC and TGCG, which individually are also target sites of the
   basic region. In this work, we explore how the basic region interacts
   with 5H-LR when the bZIP dimer localizes to full-sites. Using AMBER
   molecular modeling, we simulated GCN4 bZIP complexes with full-sites
   containing 5H-LR to investigate in silico the interface between the
   basic region and SH-LR We also performed in vitro investigation of
   bZIP-DNA interactions at a number of frill-sites that contain 5H-LR
   versus either subsite: we analyzed results from DNase I footprinting and
   electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and from EMSA titrations to
   quantify binding affinities. Our computational and experimental results
   together support a highly dynamic DNA-binding model: when a bZIP dimer
   localizes to its target full-site, the basic region can alternately
   recognize either subsite as a distinct target at SH-LR and translocate
   between the subsites, potentially by sliding and hopping. This model
   provides added insights into how a-helical DNA-binding domains of
   transcription factors can localize to their gene regulatory sequences in
   vivo.}},

Volume = {{86}},

Month = {{AUG 17}},
Abstract = {{We consider the security of continuous-variable quantum key distribution
   using thermal (or noisy) Gaussian resource states. Specifically, we
   analyze this against collective Gaussian attacks using direct and
   reverse reconciliation where both protocols use either homodyne or
   heterodyne detection. We show that in the case of direct reconciliation
   with heterodyne detection, an improved robustness to channel noise is
   achieved when large amounts of preparation noise is added, as compared
   to the case when no preparation noise is added. We also consider the
   theoretical limit of infinite preparation noise and show a secure key
   can still be achieved in this limit provided the channel noise is less
   than the preparation noise. Finally, we consider the security of quantum
   key distribution at various electromagnetic wavelengths and derive an
   upper bound related to an entanglement-breaking eavesdropping attack and
   discuss the feasibility of microwave quantum key distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in solar photovoltaics are urgently needed to increase the
   performance and reduce the cost of harvesting solar power.
   Solution-processed photovoltaics are cost-effective to manufacture and

   development has increased their solar-power conversion efficiencies. The
   nanometre (electron) and micrometre (photon) scale interfaces between
   the crystalline domains that make up solution-processed solar cells are
   crucial for efficient charge transport. These interfaces include large
   surface area junctions between photoelectron donors and acceptors, the
   intralayer grain boundaries within the absorber, and the interfaces
   between photoactive layers and the top and bottom contacts. Controlling
   the collection and minimizing the trapping of charge carriers at these
   boundaries is crucial to efficiency.}},

Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{208-217}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{The kinetics of bioleaching of Mo, Ni, and Al from spent hydrocracking
   catalyst, using Aspergillus niger was studied. The four most effective
   bioleaching variables were selected in accordance with the
   Plackett-Burman design and were further optimized via central composite
   design (CCD). The optimal values of the variables for maximum
   multi-metal bioleaching were as follows: particle size 150-212 mu m,
   sucrose 93.8 g/L, pulp density 3\% w/v. and pH 7. The maximum metal
   recoveries corresponding to these conditions were 99.5 +/- 0.4\% Mo,
   45.8 +/- 1.2\% Ni, and 13.9 +/- 0.1\% Al. The relatively low Ni
   extraction was attributed to the precipitation of Ni in the presence of
   oxalic acid. Under the optimal conditions, the fungus growth was found
   to be higher in the presence of spent catalyst than that in the
   catalyst-free medium. Determinations of the organic acid concentration
   showed noticeable variation during bioleaching, particularly for
   gluconic acid. Accordingly, a modified form of shrinking core model was
   used to take these variations into account. The predictions by the model
   showed good consistency with the experimental results, suggesting that
   diffusion of bioleaching agent through the solid matrix was the
   rate-controlling step. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   are concentrated in two different regions of the guide, the
   characteristics of the two modes can be controlled independently by
   changing the waveguide dimensions. We propose to use this property to
   implement a hybrid plasmonic polarization-independent directional

Abstract = {{Superhydrophobic surfaces are extremely non-wetting by virtue of their
   surface chemistry and roughness. Applications for them are being pursued
   in coatings, microfluidics, textiles, and other areas. Most analyses of
   the wetting of superhydrophobic surfaces have focused on pillar
   geometries. However, mass-produced superhydrophobic surfaces are likely
   to have random topologies. A computational model for the wetting of
   rough one-dimensional surfaces is described, and applied to random,
   self-affine surfaces with various levels of roughness and intrinsic
   contact angles. It is found that all wetting properties are generally
   controlled by the Wenzel roughness parameter r, even when drops are in
   the suspended Cassie state. Superhydrophobicity is attained above a
   threshold value of r. Similar results are also found for the wetting of
   dual-scale surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Although branch plate-to-circular hollow section (CHS) connections under
   branch axial load are simple to fabricate and cost-effective, they
   generally experience significant deformation at relatively low loads
   resulting in an imposed deformation limit. To increase the connection
   capacity, various stiffening methods such as use of ring stiffeners,
   grout filling, and ``through plate{''} connections have been proposed.
   To determine the effectiveness of previously unstudied plate-to-CHS
   through plate connections, an experimental investigation consisting of
   12 connections was undertaken. Additionally, the behavior of
   nonorthogonal or skewed connections and the effect of load sense were
   examined. The experimental study determined that through plate-to-CHS
   connection behavior can be obtained by algebraically combining the
   behavior of a T-type branch plate-to-CHS connection in tension with
   another in compression. Moreover, the through plate connection increased
   the capacity by more than three times that of a branch plate connection
   loaded in compression. Finite-element (FE) models were constructed to
   replicate, and be compared with, the experimental connections to
   validate the use of FE modeling for a subsequent parametric study with
   the aim of expanding the scope of the experimental results database.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a numerical finite-element parametric study on the
   behavior of transverse or longitudinal X-type plate-to-circular hollow
   section connections loaded under branch plate tension or compression, to
   evaluate the suitability of present international (CIDECT) design
   recommendations, the effect of boundary conditions and chord length, and
   the influence of applied chord normal stress. A total of 449 connections
   with wide-ranging values of geometric properties and chord normal stress
   levels were modeled and analyzed using commercially available software.
   An analysis of the effect of chord length determined that, to exclude
   the influence of chord end boundary conditions, an effective chord
   length of at least 10 times the chord diameter should be used for
   experimental and numerical studies. Further, the present CIDECT chord
   stress functions (Q(f)) provide an acceptable lower bound for all
   connections examined. Evaluation of present CIDECT partial design
   strength functions (Q(u)) indicated general conservatism, lack of plate
   thickness incorporation, and underutilization of tension-only
   connections. Partial design strength functions, determined through
   regression analysis, are hence proposed with lower-bound reduction
   (resistance) factors. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000545. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Many small molecules, including bioactive molecules and approved drugs,
   spontaneously form colloidal aggregates in aqueous solution at
   micromolar concentrations. Though it is widely accepted that aggregation
   leads to artifacts in screens for ligands of soluble proteins, the
   effects of colloid formation in cell-based assays have not been studied.
   Here, seven anticancer drugs and one diagnostic reagent were found to
   form colloids in both biochemical buffer and in cell culture media. In
   cell-based assays, the antiproliferative activities of three of the
   drugs were substantially reduced when in colloidal form as compared to
   monomeric form; a new formulation method ensured the presence of drug
   colloids versus drug monomers in solution. We also found that Evans
   Blue, a dye classically used to measure vascular permeability and to
   demonstrate the ``enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect{''}
   in solid tumors, forms colloids that adsorb albumin, as opposed to older
   literature that suggested the reverse.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new video face recognition (FR) method that is
   designed for significantly improving FR via adaptive fusion of multiple
   face features (belonging to the same subject) acquired from a face

   recognition error arising from the proposed weighted feature fusion to
   justify theoretically its effectiveness for recognition from videos. In
   addition, in order to compute the optimal weights of face features to be
   fused, we develop a novel weight determination solution based on fuzzy
   membership function and quality measurement for face images. Using four
   public video databases, the effectiveness of the proposed method has
   been successfully evaluated under the conditions that are similar to
   those in real-world video FR applications. Furthermore, our method is
   simple and straightforward to implement.}},

Title = {{Cascaded systems analysis of noise and detectability in dual-energy
   cone-beam CT}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{5145-5156}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Dual-energy computed tomography and dual-energy cone-beam
   computed tomography (DE-CBCT) are promising modalities for applications
   ranging from vascular to breast, renal, hepatic, and musculoskeletal
   imaging. Accordingly, the optimization of imaging techniques for such
   applications would benefit significantly from a general theoretical
   description of image quality that properly incorporates factors of
   acquisition, reconstruction, and tissue decomposition in DE tomography.
   This work reports a cascaded systems analysis model that includes the
   Poisson statistics of x rays (quantum noise), detector model (flat-panel
   detectors), anatomical background, image reconstruction (filtered
   backprojection), DE decomposition (weighted subtraction), and simple
   observer models to yield a task-based framework for DE technique
   optimization.
   Methods: The theoretical framework extends previous modeling of DE
   projection radiography and CBCT. Signal and noise transfer
   characteristics are propagated through physical and mathematical stages
   of image formation and reconstruction. Dual-energy decomposition was
   modeled according to weighted subtraction of low- and high-energy images
   to yield the 3D DE noise-power spectrum (NPS) and noise-equivalent
   quanta (NEQ), which, in combination with observer models and the imaging
   task, yields the dual-energy detectability index (d'). Model
   calculations were validated with NPS and NEQ measurements from an
   experimental imaging bench simulating the geometry of a dedicated
   musculoskeletal extremities scanner. Imaging techniques, including kVp
   pair and dose allocation, were optimized using d' as an objective
   function for three example imaging tasks: (1) kidney stone
   discrimination; (2) iodine vs bone in a uniform, soft-tissue background;
   and (3) soft-tissue tumor detection on power-law anatomical background.
   Results: Theoretical calculations of DE NPS and NEQ demonstrated good
   agreement with experimental measurements over a broad range of imaging
   conditions. Optimization results suggest a lower fraction of total dose
   imparted by the low-energy acquisition, a finding consistent with
   previous literature. The selection of optimal kVp pair reveals the
   combined effect of both quantum noise and contrast in the kidney stone
   discrimination and soft-tissue tumor detection tasks, whereas the K-edge
   effect of iodine was the dominant factor in determining kVp pairs in the
   iodine vs bone task. The soft-tissue tumor task illustrated the benefit
   of dual-energy imaging in eliminating anatomical background noise and
   improving detectability beyond that achievable by single-energy scans.
   Conclusions: This work established a task-based theoretical framework
   that is predictive of DE image quality. The model can be utilized in
   optimizing a broad range of parameters in image acquisition,
   reconstruction, and decomposition, providing a useful tool for
   maximizing DE-CBCT image quality and reducing dose. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{We present an investigation of accumulated numerical error in the
   simulation of four-wave mixing, which is frequently used to model a
   variety of nonlinear optical devices. The Dormand-Prince method
   (commonly used by commercial solving software such as MATLAB) has been
   found to be susceptible to numerical error, which manifests itself in a
   3.8\% increase in the total power over 200 m of nonlinear interaction
   length. This numerical error can lead to qualitatively mistaken physical
   interpretations of simulation results, which are similar to those found
   in previously published materials. We use a home-built Adams-Bashforth
   solver to simulate four-wave mixing, which produces results that do not
   lead to unphysical results, even for simulation over a large nonlinear
   interaction length. By comparing the results of these two methods we
   were able to illustrate the qualitative effects of the accumulated
   numerical error in the former. The source of this cumulative power error
   is traced to the solutions provided by the Dormand-Prince method for the
   self-and cross-phase modulation terms of the coupled mode equations;
   this error increases for larger nonlinearities or if step size
   increases. Even when this power accumulates from infinitesimal per-step
   errors, significant changes occur that could lead to qualitative
   differences in generated power values and conversion efficiencies. This
   reveals the potential danger of applying commonly used numerical solvers
   in simulating nonlinear optical processes. (C) 2012 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{A modular approach to adipose tissue engineering was explored by
   embedding adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (adMSC) in
   sub-mm-sized collagen rods or ``modules{''} and coating with human
   microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC). After subcutaneous injection
   into a SCID/Bg mouse, HMEC on modules containing embedded adMSC appeared
   to detach from the modules to form vessels as early as day 3, as
   confirmed by the human EC-specific UEA-1 lectin stain, and these vessels
   persisted for up to 90 days. Vessel numbers decreased over 14 days, but
   vessel size increased suggesting a maturing of the vasculature. Vessel
   perfusion with the host was confirmed at 21 days by microCT. HMEC on
   modules without embedded adMSC remained attached to the module surface
   at day 3 and UEA-1 staining disappeared over 14 days suggesting cell
   death. It appeared that cotransplantation with adMSC had an
   anti-apoptotic and proangiogenic effect on HMEC. The early
   revascularization strategy may be successful in supporting adMSC
   viability and differentiation, as a preliminary study suggests
   progressive fat accumulation in the HMEC + adMSC implants: similar to
   60\% of the implant area stained positive for Oil Red O by day 90.
   adMSC-embedded modules without HMEC surface coating did not show similar
   levels of Oil Red O staining. All implant volumes decreased over the
   time course of the experiment, yet HMEC+ adMSC module implants were
   larger than adMSC-only implants at day 90. Collagen gel is mechanically
   weak and contracts in vivo making it unsuitable as a biomaterial for
   adipose tissue engineering where volume maintenance is critical. When
   combined with an appropriate biomaterial, the modular approach to
   adipose tissue engineering may represent a successful strategy to
   engineer soft tissue substitutes of clinical relevance.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the potential of active video game (AVG) play for
   physical activity promotion and rehabilitation therapies in children
   with cerebral palsy (CP) through a quantitative exploration of energy
   expenditure, muscle activation, and quality of movement.
   Design: Single-group, experimental study.
   Setting: Human movement laboratory in an urban rehabilitation hospital.
   Participants: Children (N =17; mean age +/- SD, 9.43 +/- 1.51y) with CP.
   Intervention: Participants played 4 AVGs (bowling, tennis, boxing, and a
   dance game).
   Main Outcome Measures: Energy expenditure via a portable cardiopulmonary
   testing unit; upper limb muscle activations via single differential
   surface electrodes; upper limb kinematics via an optical motion capture
   system; and self-reported enjoyment via the Physical Activity Enjoyment
   Scale (PACES).
   Results: Moderate levels of physical activity were achieved during the
   dance (metabolic equivalent for task {[}MET]= 3.20 +/- 1.04) and boxing
   (MET=3.36 +/- 1.50) games. Muscle activations did not exceed maximum
   voluntary exertions and were greatest for the boxing AVG and for the
   wrist extensor bundle. Angular velocities and accelerations were
   significantly larger in the dominant arm than in the hemiplegic arm
   during bilateral play. A high level of enjoyment was reported on the
   PACES (4.5 +/- 0.3 out of 5).
   Conclusions: AVG play via a low-cost, commercially available system can
   offer an enjoyable opportunity for light to moderate physical activity
   in children with CP. While all games may encourage motor learning to
   some extent, AVGs can be strategically selected to address specific
   therapeutic goals (eg, targeted joints, bilateral limb use). Future
   research is needed to address the challenge of individual variability in
   movement patterns/play styles. Likewise, further study exploring home
   use of AVGs for physical activity promotion and rehabilitation
   therapies, and its functional outcomes, is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{In the control of linear time-invariant (LTI) decentralized systems, a
   decentralized fixed mode (DFM) is one which is immovable using an LTI
   decentralized controller. However, some DFMs can be moved using more
   complicated decentralized controllers; the ones which cannot are
   labelled quotient DFMs (QDFMs), since they arise from a related quotient
   system. The classical algorithm used to compute the QDFMs requires two
   steps: a partitioning of the sub-systems, using graph theory, followed
   by the application of standard tools from decentralized control. Here
   the goal is to provide a more direct approach to computing them. (C)

Abstract = {{Elliptical hollow sections (EHS) are the newest steel shape to have
   emerged in the construction industry. They have been incorporated in a
   variety of structures around the world, including Canada, without
   structural design guidelines. To date, EHS are completely absent from
   Canadian codes and guides. A possible application of EHS is within
   truss-systems and, as such, a research project has been undertaken to
   investigate the behaviour of EHS-to-EHS welded connections. Twelve T and
   X connection tests have been performed to study the effect of connection
   angle, orientation type, and loading sense. Two methods to predict
   connection capacities and failure modes are investigated: an equivalent
   circular hollow section (CHS) approach and an equivalent rectangular
   hollow section (RHS) approach. The equivalent RHS approach proved to be
   more successful at capturing the actual failure mode of welded
   EHS-to-EHS connections and is therefore recommended at this time as a
   preliminary design method for EHS truss-type connections.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Currently, there are a variety of test methods to evaluate the plastic
   properties of self-consolidating concrete (SCC) specified in provincial,
   national, and international guidelines. There is, however, a dearth of
   knowledge on how the results of the various test methods compare with
   each other. Some of the tests are direct measures, others are indirect;
   some of the tests are qualitative and others are quantitative; and some
   tests have specified acceptance limits while others do not. The purpose
   of this study, initiated by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation
   (MTO), is to compare the plastic properties (filling ability, passing
   ability, and segregation resistance) of SCC and identify any
   correlations between them to determine the most appropriate test methods
   for evaluating the plastic properties of SCC. The filling ability (slump
   flow, L-box (t(20) and t(40)), and V-funnel), passing ability (J-ring
   and L-box blocking ratio), and segregation resistance (visual stability
   index, column method, V-funnel (t(5)-t(0))) tests are conducted on eight
   SCC mix designs. The results are compared to the acceptance criteria
   specified by the MTO for SCC. Based on the results, and their
   relationships, the plastic property tests most suitable for laboratory,
   prequalification, and field-testing are recommended.}},

Abstract = {{A reduced surface electric field in an AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility
   transistor (HEMT) is investigated by employing a localized Mg-doped
   layer under the two-dimensional electron gas (2-DEG) channel as an
   electric field shaping layer. The electric field strength around the
   gate edge is effectively relieved and the surface electric field is
   distributed evenly as compared with those of HEMTs with conventional
   source-connected field plate and double field plate structures with the
   same device physical dimensions. Compared with the HEMTs with
   conventional source-connected field plates and double field plates, the
   HEMT with a Mg-doped layer also shows that the breakdown location shifts
   from the surface of the gate edge to the bulk Mg-doped layer edge. By
   optimizing both the length of Mg-doped layer, L-m, and the doping
   concentration, a 5.5 times and 3 times the reduction in the peak
   electric field near the drain side gate edge is observed as compared
   with those of the HEMTs with source-connected field plate structure and
   double field plate structure, respectively. In a device with V-GS = 5 V,
   L-m = 1.5 mu m, a peak Mg doping concentration of 8x10(17) cm(-3) and a
   drift region length of 10 mu m, the breakdown voltage is observed to
   increase from 560 V in a conventional device without field plate
   structure to over 900 V without any area overhead penalty.}},

Abstract = {{Suppression of immune response by mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs)
   is well documented. However, their regulatory effects on immune cells,
   especially regulatory dendritic cells, are not fully understood. We have
   identified a novel Sca-1(+)Lin(-)CD117(-) MSC population isolated from
   mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) that suppressed lymphocyte
   proliferation in vitro. Moreover, the Sca-1(+)Lin(-)CD117(-) MEF-MSCs
   induced hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells to differentiate into novel
   regulatory dendritic cells (DCs) (Sca-1(+)Lin(-)CD117(-) MEF-MSC-induced
   DCs) when cocultured in the absence of exogenous cytokines. Small
   interfering RNA silencing showed that Sca-1(+)Lin(-)CD117(-) MEF-MSCs
   induced the generation of Sca-1(+)Lin(-)CD117(-) MEF-MSC-induced DCs via
   IL-10-activated SOCS3, whose expression was regulated by the JAK-STAT
   pathway. We observed a high degree of H3K4me3 modification mediated by
   MLL1 and a relatively low degree of H3K27me3 modification regulated by
   SUZ12 on the promoter of SOCS3 during SOCS3 activation. Importantly,
   infusion of Sca-1(+)CD117(-)Lin(-) MEF-MSCs suppressed the inflammatory
   response by increasing DCs with a regulatory phenotype. Thus, our
   results shed new light on the role of MSCs in modulating regulatory DC
   production and support the clinical application of MSCs to reduce the
   inflammatory response in numerous disease states. The Journal of

Abstract = {{As some of the most rapidly urbanizing places in the world, China's
   cities have a unique relationship with global climate change. The
   economies found in Chinese cities are extremely resource and energy
   intensive; as a result, they produce significant levels of greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions. This article provides comprehensive and detailed
   emissions inventories for Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin, which were
   found to be responsible for 12.8, 10.7, and 11.9 tonnes of carbon
   dioxide equivalent per capita (t CO2-eq/capita), respectively, in 2006.
   The majority of emissions were from electricity production, heating and
   industrial fuel use, and ground transportation. The prevalence of coal
   in the energy supply mix (including up to 98\% in Tianjin) was a
   fundamental cause of high energy emissions. Non-energy emissions from
   industrial processes were also significant, including emissions from
   cement and steel production. The GHG inventories for Shanghai, Beijing,
   and Tianjin point to sectors requiring the most attention in terms of
   low-carbon growth. Compared to ten other global cities, Chinese cities
   are among the highest per capita emitters, alluding to the important
   challenge China faces of reducing emissions while improving the quality
   of life for urban residents. Accordingly, this article concludes with a
   discussion of the opportunities and issues concerning low-carbon growth
   in China, including the potential for renewable energy and the
   difficulties associated with emissions relocation and policy adoption.}},

Abstract = {{Among currently known alternatives for renewable energy sources, solar
   power is generally regarded as having the most potential to satisfy the
   ever-growing demand. While solar photovoltaic power is a
   well-established technology, its widespread uptake has been hindered by
   the prohibitively high price of units and thus electricity. This is due
   mainly to the high cost of the silicon used to fabricate the devices.
   This article presents a review of the development of established
   pyrometallurgical techniques as applied to refining metallurgical
   silicon to solar grade for the purposes of reducing reliance on
   expensive traditional silicon feedstock. Four basic high-temperature
   methods-solvent refining, vaporization, electrorefining, and slag
   treatment-are described, and the limitations and advantages of each
   method are presented. It is apparent that these techniques are very
   useful for removing impurities from silicon, but are often selective and
   not able to remove all problematic elements. Therefore, refining may
   need to be as a sequence of steps, targeting specific elements each
   time, or as novel methods combining multiple techniques simultaneously.
   Ultimately, the successful approach will have to achieve large-scale
   production by cost-effective means to replace current methods.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time pseudodynamic (PSD) and hybrid PSD testing methods are
   displacement controlled experimental techniques that are used to
   investigate the dynamic behaviour of complex and load rate-dependent
   structures. Because the imposed command displacements are not predefined
   but generated during the test based on measured feedback, these methods
   are inherently prone to error propagation, which can affect the accuracy
   and even the stability of the entire experiment. As a result, to have
   these experimental methods as reliable tools, the accuracy of the test
   results needs to be assessed by carefully monitoring, and if possible,
   quantifying the errors involved. In this paper, phase and amplitude
   error indices (PAEI) are introduced to identify the experimental errors
   through uncoupled closed-form equations. Unlike the indicators that have
   been previously introduced in the literature for error identification
   purposes, PAEI do not use test setup specific parameters in their
   formulation, and can quantify the errors independent of the amplitude of
   the command displacements. As such, PAEI can be used as standard tools
   for assessing the quality of the experiments performed in different
   laboratories or under different conditions. Additionally, because they
   can quantify the error, when implemented online, PAEI have the potential
   to be incorporated in the control law and thereby improve the actuator
   control during the tests. The formulation and implementation of PAEI are
   provided in this paper. The enhanced performance of the proposed indices
   is demonstrated by processing several different measured and command
   signals using PAEI and comparing the results with those revealed by the
   previous indicators. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{With the proliferation of multi-touch mobile devices, such as
   smartphones and tablets, users interact with devices in non-conventional
   gesture-intensive ways. As a new way to interact with mobile devices,
   gestures have been proven to be intuitive and natural with a minimal
   learning curve, and can be used in interactive multimedia applications.
   In order for multiple users to collaborate in an interactive manner, we
   propose that gestures can be streamed in multiple broadcast sessions,
   with each session corresponding to one of the users as the source of a
   gesture stream. During the interactive session, the Quality of
   Experience (QoE) of mobile users hinges upon delays from when gestures
   are entered by the source to when they are recognized by each of the
   receivers, which we refer to as gesture recognizing delays. In this
   paper, we present the design of GestureFlow, a gesture broadcast
   protocol designed specifically for concurrent gesture streams in
   multiple broadcast sessions, such that the gesture recognizing delay in
   each session is minimized. We motivate the effectiveness and
   practicality of using inter-session network coding, and address
   challenges introduced by the linear dependence of coded packets. We
   evaluate our protocol design using an extensive array of real-world
   experiments on mobile devices, involving a new gesture-intensive
   interactive multimedia application, called MusicScore, that we developed
   from scratch.}},

Abstract = {{Robust generation of pelvic finite element models is necessary to

   in gender, aging, disease and injury. The objective of this study was to
   apply and evaluate mesh morphing and mapping techniques to facilitate
   the creation and structural analysis of specimen-specific finite element
   (FE) models of the pelvis. A specimen-specific pelvic FE model (source
   mesh) was generated following a traditional user-intensive meshing
   scheme. The source mesh was morphed onto a computed tomography scan
   generated target surface of a second pelvis using a landmarked-based
   approach, in which exterior source nodes were shifted to target surface
   vertices, while constrained along a normal. A second copy of the morphed
   model was further refined through mesh mapping, in which surface nodes
   of the initial morphed model were selected in patches and remapped onto
   the surfaces of the target model. Computed tomography intensity-based
   material properties were assigned to each model. The source, target,
   morphed and mapped models were analyzed under axial compression using
   linear static FE analysis, and their strain distributions were
   evaluated. Morphing and mapping techniques were effectively applied to
   generate good quality and geometrically complex specimen-specific pelvic
   FE models. Mapping significantly improved strain concurrence with the
   target pelvis FE model.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We consider the hybrid problem of reconstructing the isotropic electric
   conductivity of a body Omega from interior current density imaging data
   obtainable using MRI measurements. We only require knowledge of the
   magnitude vertical bar J vertical bar of one current for a given voltage
   f on the boundary partial derivative Omega. As previously shown, the
   corresponding voltage potential u in Omega is a minimizer of the
   weighted least gradient problem
   u = argmin \{integral(Omega) a(x)vertical bar del u vertical bar : u is
   an element of H-1 (Omega), u vertical bar partial derivative(Omega) =
   f\},
   with a(x) = vertical bar J(x)vertical bar. In this paper, we present an
   alternating split Bregman algorithm for treating such least gradient
   problems, for a is an element of L-2 (Omega) non-negative and f is an
   element of H-1/2 (partial derivative Omega). We give a detailed
   convergence proof by focusing to a large extent on the dual problem.
   This leads naturally to the alternating split Bregman algorithm (which
   is a re-interpretation of the alternating direction method of
   multipliers adapted to L-1 problems). The dual problem also turns out to
   yield a novel method to recover the full vector field J from knowledge
   of its magnitude and of the voltage f on the boundary. We then present
   several numerical experiments that illustrate the convergence behavior
   of the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of competing algorithms exist for segmentation of both
   single-channel and multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images.
   Among the most successful of these algorithms is the approach presented
   by Stewart et al. This algorithm defines a cost which is a weighted sum
   of a likelihood term that estimates the statistical likelihood of the
   membership of pixels to neighboring segments and a shape term that is
   intended to provide a smoothing constraint on segment boundaries. The
   shape term in the original implementation of the Stewart algorithm was
   rather rudimentary, and in this paper, we explore the performance of a
   shape term based on Sethian-Osher curvature-flow theory. We demonstrate
   the performance of the refined curvature-cost (CC) shape term on a set
   of simulated images as well as an ASAR scene. We assess the segmentation
   performance using a hybridized shape metric and on the number of
   segments produced. We find that the CC shape term significantly improves
   the performance of the Stewart segmentation algorithm, particularly for
   high-contrast edges. In spite of this success, we argue that further
   improvements to the algorithm will be difficult due to the architecture
   of the system.}},

   to determine the optimal length of the co-culture stage of the system.
   Biochemical data show that extracellular matrix accumulation was evident
   after 2 weeks of co-culture, which was 1 week behind the bP0 control
   culture. By 3 to 4 weeks, the amounts of accumulated proteoglycans and
   collagens were comparable. Expression of chondrogenic genes, Sox 9,
   aggrecan, and collagen type II, was also at similar levels by week 3 of
   culture. Immunohistochemical staining of both co-culture and control
   tissues showed accumulation of type II collagen, aggrecan, biglycan,
   decorin, and chondroitin sulfate in appropriate zonal distributions.
   These data indicate that co-cultured cells form cartilaginous tissue
   that starts to resemble that formed by bP0 after 3 weeks, suggesting
   that the optimal time to terminate the co-culture stage, isolate the now
   redifferentiated cells, and start stage 2 is just after 3 weeks. (J

Abstract = {{Diagnostic technologies that can provide the simultaneous detection of
   nucleic acids for gene expression, proteins for host response and small
   molecules for profiling the human metabolome will have a significant
   advantage in providing comprehensive patient monitoring. Molecular
   sensors that report changes in the electrostatics of a sensor's surface
   on analyte binding have shown unprecedented sensitivity in the detection
   of charged biomolecules, but do not lend themselves to the detection of
   small molecules, which do not carry significant charge. Here, we
   introduce the neutralizer displacement assay that allows charge-based
   sensing to be applied to any class of molecule irrespective of the
   analyte charge. The neutralizer displacement assay starts with an
   aptamer probe bound to a neutralizer. When analyte binding occurs the
   neutralizer is displaced, which results in a dramatic change in the
   surface charge for all types of analytes. We have tested the
   sensitivity, speed and specificity of this system in the detection of a
   panel of molecules: (deoxy)ribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, cocaine,
   adenosine triphosphate and thrombin.}},

Abstract = {{The WBC-2 consortium is an organohalide-respiring anaerobic microbial
   enrichment culture capable of dechlorinating 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane
   (TeCA) to ethene. In the WBC-2 culture, TeCA is first transformed to
   trans-dichloroethene (tDCE) by dichloroelimination; tDCE is subsequently
   transformed to vinyl chloride (VC) and then to ethene by hydrogenolysis.
   Analysis of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries from culture DNA revealed
   sequences from three putative dechlorinating organisms belonging to
   Dehalococcoides, Dehalobacter, and Dehalogenimonas genera. Quantitative
   PCR primers were designed for each of these sequences, and their
   abundance was quantified in enrichment cultures over time. These data
   revealed that complete dechlorination of TeCA to ethene involves all
   three organisms. Dehalobacter spp. grew during the dihaloelimination of
   TeCA to tDCE, while Dehalococcoides and Dehalogenimonas spp. grew during
   hydrogenolysis of tDCE to ethene. This is the first time a genus other

Abstract = {{The gas generation from reactions between direct reduced iron (DRI)
   pellets and steelmaking slags is known to take place in two stages; (1)
   the reaction of FeO and carbon within DRI, i.e., pellet internal
   reaction, followed by (2) the reduction of slag FeO with DRI carbon at
   the pellet-slag interface, if any carbon remains from the first step. To
   understand the controlling mechanism of the reaction between FeO and C
   inside DRI, the rate of the gas release and the temperature of pellets
   suspended in a slag-free atmosphere were quantified. The results were
   used to determine the apparent thermal conductivity of DRI that showed
   values of approximately 0.5 to 2 W.m(-1).K-1 for a temperature range of
   573 K to 1273 K (300 A degrees C to 1000 A degrees C). Furthermore, it
   was found that the experimental gas evolution rates are consistent with
   the values predicted by a heat-transfer based model, confirming that the
   FeO-C reaction within pellet is controlled by the rate of heat transfer
   from the slag to the DRI pellet.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical finite element parametric study is presented on the

   Finite element modelling and analysis techniques used in the parametric
   study were validated by comparison with previously tested experimental
   results. A total of 120 connections with wide-ranging values of
   geometric properties were modeled and analyzed using commercially
   available software. An analysis of the effect of chord length determined
   that, to exclude the influence of chord end boundary conditions, an
   effective chord length of at least eight times and four times the chord
   diameter, for thin and thick walled chords respectively, should be used
   for experimental and numerical studies. Evaluation of current CIDECT
   partial design strength functions (Q(u)) indicated general conservatism
   and under-utilization of branch tension-only connection capacity.
   Partial design strength functions, determined through regression
   analysis of numerical finite element results and existing international
   experimental data, are hence proposed with lower bound reduction

Abstract = {{There are many studies on vibrations of moving belts originated from
   automotive belt drives. These studies, however, mainly consider the
   nonlinear effect of the transversal vibration of the belt under
   transversal excitation without considering the coupling effect between
   the transversal and longitudinal vibrations under longitudinal
   excitation. In this paper, a nonlinear model is built for a standing
   tensioned belt periodically excited longitudinally at one end with a
   known amplitude and frequency and with the other end clamped, which
   allows for coupling between the periodic longitudinal excitation and
   transversal vibration. The nonlinear system is solved using the Analog
   Equation Method. The two coupled nonlinear hyperbolic differential
   equations of the system are reduced to two uncoupled linear equations
   pertaining to the longitudinal and transverse deformation of a
   substitute beam with unit longitudinal and bending stiffness,
   respectively. The reduced equations are under a fictitious
   time-dependent load distribution with the same boundary and initial
   conditions. The fictitious forces are established numerically from the
   integral expression of the oscillation solution with the requirement
   that the equations of motion be satisfied at discreet time intervals. It
   is found that the transversal vibration appears as a stable and
   predictable beating phenomenon due to an internal resonance from the
   periodic energy transfer between the longitudinal excitation and the
   transversal vibration, which manifests itself as a standing wave.}},

Abstract = {{In bone tissue engineering, the mechanical properties of the scaffolds
   need to be sufficiently high to prevent material failure when bearing
   loads. To strengthen the scaffold, various composites have been proposed
   in the literature, including poly(e-caprolactone) with hydroxyapatite
   (HA). In this study, the processing of this composite using the gas
   foaming/salt leaching technique is examined. The control of scaffold
   properties by varying the processing parameters was first investigated.
   Then, the change in properties, with a focus on the viscoelastic
   properties, from the varying morphology was examined. Although an
   increase in scaffold density and pore size increased the scaffold
   modulus, it did not significantly affect the viscoelastic properties.
   Furthermore, the addition of HA decreased the scaffold modulus and
   increased the loss factor of the composite scaffolds. The more
   viscoelastic behavior is believed to be due to the more open structure
   that was created. When tested in a water bath to better simulate the
   physiological environment, the mechanical properties decreased by up to
   85\%, and the scaffolds also behaved more viscoelastically. The
   comparison of the scaffold properties shows the differing behavior of
   the scaffolds in dry and wet conditions. Hence, the environment of
   testing should be more carefully considered when designing experiments.

   this study are emphasizes to rectify the learning the peak points, to
   increase the forecasting accuracy, to decrease the computational time
   and comply the multi-object forecasting in the algorithms. The structure
   of the proposed algorithms is based on approximation of its current
   estimate according to previously learned estimates. The short term
   traffic flow forecasting is a real benchmark that has been studied in
   this area. Traffic flow is a good measure of traffic activity. The
   time-series data used for fitting the proposed models are obtained from
   a two lane street I-494 in Minnesota City, USA. The research discuss the
   strong points of new method based on neurofuzzy and limbic system
   structure such as Locally Linear Neurofuzzy network (LLNF) and Brain
   Emotional Learning Based Intelligent Controller (BELBIC) models against
   classical and other intelligent methods such as Radial Basis Function
   (RBF), Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) neurofuzzy, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
   and the effect of noise on the performance of the models is also
   considered. Finally, findings confirmed the significance of structural
   brain modeling beyond the classical artificial neural networks. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Objective: Active videogames (AVGs) have potential in terms of physical
   activity and therapy for children with cerebral palsy. However, the
   effect of social interaction on AVG play has not yet been assessed. The
   objective of this study is to determine if multiplayer AVG versus solo
   affects levels of energy expenditure and movement patterns.
   Subjects and Methods: Fifteen children (9.77 {[}standard deviation (SD)
   1.78] years old) with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (Gross Motor Function
   Classification System Level I) participated in solo and multiplayer
   Nintendo (R) ``Wii (TM) Boxing'' (Nintendo, Inc., Redmond, WA) AVG play
   while energy expenditure and punching frequency were monitored.
   Results: Moderate levels of physical activity were achieved with no
   significant differences in energy measures during multiplayer and solo
   play. Dominant arm punching frequency increased during the multiplayer
   session from 95.75 (SD 37.93) punches/minute to 107.77 (SD 36.99)
   punches/minute. Conversely, hemiplegic arm punching frequency decreased
   from 39.05 (SD 29.57) punches/minutes to 30.73 (SD 24.74)
   punches/minutes during multiplayer game play. Children enjoyed
   multiplayer more than solo play.
   Conclusions: Opportunities to play AVGs with friends and family may
   translate to more frequent participation in this moderate physical
   activity. Conversely, increased hemiplegic limb use during solo play may
   have therapeutic advantages. As such, new strategies are recommended to
   promote use of the hemiplegic hand during multiplayer AVG play and to
   optimize commercial AVG systems for applications in virtual reality
   therapy.}},

Title = {{Developing healthcare rule-based expert systems: Case study of a heart
   failure telemonitoring system}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{556-565}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: The use of expert systems to generate automated alerts and
   patient instructions based on telemonitoring data could enable increased
   self-care and improve clinical management. However, of great importance
   is the development of the rule set to ensure safe and clinically
   relevant alerts and instructions are sent. The purpose of this work was
   to develop a rule-based expert system for a heart failure mobile
   phone-based telemonitoring system, to evaluate the expert system, and to
   generalize the lessons learned from the development process for use in
   other healthcare applications.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 heart failure
   clinicians to inform the development of a draft heart failure rule set
   for alerts and patient instructions. The draft rule set was validated
   and refined with 9 additional interviews with heart failure clinicians.
   Finally, the clinical champion of the project vetted the rule set. The
   concerns voiced by the clinicians during the interviews were noted, and
   methods to mitigate these concerns were employed. The rule set was then
   evaluated as part of a 6-month randomized controlled trial of a mobile
   phone-based heart failure telemonitoring system (n = 50 for each of the
   telemonitoring and control groups).
   Results: The developed expert system generated alerts and instructions
   based on the patient's weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and symptoms.
   During the trial, 1620 alerts were generated, which led to various
   clinical actions including 105 medication changes/instructions. The
   findings from the trial indicated the rule set was associated with
   improved quality of life and self-care.
   Conclusions: A rule set was developed with extensive input by heart
   failure clinicians. The results from the trial indicated the rule set
   was associated with significantly increased self-care and improved the
   clinical management of heart failure. The developed rule set can be used
   as a basis for other heart failure telemonitoring systems, but should be
   validated and modified as necessary. In addition, the process used to
   develop the rule set can be generalized and applied to create robust and
   complete rule sets for other healthcare expert systems. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of chloride-binder
   interactions on the physical pore structure of concrete containing
   0-60\% ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) as cement
   replacement. Physical and chemical chloride binder interaction was
   measured based on chloride binder isotherms. Physical chloride binder
   interaction was estimated to be the difference between the total binding
   capacity and chemically bound chloride. In this study it was assumed
   that the chemical binding is the binding capacity of the alumina phases
   which was estimated, using differential scanning calorimetry, as the
   area under the Friedel's salt peaks. The assumption that chemical
   binding capacity is controlled by alumina phases is supported by
   multiple linear regression analysis that was conducted to assess the
   relationship between Fruendlich isotherm constants and the concrete's
   chemical composition. To determine the effect physical and/or chemical
   chloride-binder interaction on the physical microstructure, paste
   samples were exposed to distilled water and 0.5 M NaCl solution for 6 h,
   and the total porosity and pore size distribution was evaluated using
   mercury intrusion porosimetry. Three key findings from this study are:
   (i) At a chloride concentration up to 0.5 M, and for mixtures containing
   0 and 40\% GGBFS the contribution of physically and chemically bound
   chloride are similar. (ii) At chloride concentrations greater than 0.5 M
   and less than 1 M, the total bound chloride is predominantly chemically
   bound for the 40\% GGBFS mixture. (iii) Concrete specimens exposed to
   NaCl solution for 6 h exhibited different pore characteristics in
   comparison to concrete exposed to distilled water. The differences in
   the concrete microstructure are not linearly dependant on GGBFS content,
   but are found to be mutually influenced by the total bound chloride
   content, the percentage of chemically bound chlorides, and the pore size
   distribution of the mixture.}},

Abstract = {{Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are increasingly used to
   implement embedded digital systems, however, the hardware design
   necessary to do so is time-consuming and tedious. The amount of hardware
   design can be reduced by employing a microprocessor for less-critical
   computation in the system. Often this microprocessor is implemented
   using the FPGA reprogrammable fabric as a soft processor which presently
   have simple architectures and moderate performance. Our goal is to scale
   the performance of existing soft processors hence expanding their
   suitability to more critical computation. To this end we propose
   extending soft processors with vector extensions to exploit the abundant
   data parallelism found in many embedded kernels. Such a soft vector
   processor can execute these kernels much faster than a single-core hence
   reducing the need for hardware implementations. We observe this improved
   execution speed through experimentation with vector extended soft
   processor architecture (VESPA) which is designed, implemented, and
   evaluated on real FPGA hardware. VESPA is shown to effectively scale
   performance up to 32 lanes, while providing substantial architectural
   flexibility to create a fine-grained design space. With these
   characteristics, and portability across FPGA devices, soft vector
   processors can provide exact-fit architectures which can efficiently and
   more easily implement data parallel workloads over custom FPGA hardware
   design.}},

   at various acceleration values. The model shows good agreement with the
   experimental findings, thus giving confidence into model. Both

Abstract = {{Investigating the factors and processes that influence the
   spatiotemporal distribution of built space and population in an urban
   area, plays an extremely important role in our greater understanding of
   the urban travel behaviour. Existing location of activity centres,
   especially home and work, strongly influences the short-term
   individual-level decisions such as mode of transportation, and long-term
   household-level decisions such as change in job and residential
   location. Conditions in the built space market also affect households'
   and firms' location and relocation decisions, and hence influence the
   general travel patterns in an urban area. In this context, this paper
   addresses a very important, but at the same time, not very widely
   investigated dimension that plays a key role in the evolution of built
   space and population distribution: Market. A disequilibrium based
   microsimulation modelling framework is developed for the built space
   markets. This framework is then used to operationalize the Greater
   Toronto and Hamilton Area's owner-occupied housing market within
   Integrated Land Use Transportation and Environment (ILUTE) modelling
   system. Simulation results captured heterogeneity in the transaction
   prices, due to type of dwellings and different market conditions, in a
   very disaggregate fashion. The proposed methodology is validated by
   running the simulation from 1986 to 2006 and comparing the results with
   the historic data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Residential location search has become an important topic to both
   practitioners and researchers as more detailed and disaggregate land-use
   and transportation demand models are developed which require information
   on individual household location decisions. The housing search process
   starts with an alternative formation and screening stage. At this level
   households evaluate all potential alternatives based on their lifestyle,
   preferences, and utilities to form a manageable choice set with a
   limited number of plausible alternatives. Then the final residential
   location is selected among these alternatives. This two-stage decision
   making process can be used for both aggregate zone-level selection as
   well as searching disaggregate parcel or building-based housing markets
   for potential dwellings. In this paper a zonal level household housing
   search model is developed. Initially, a household specific choice set is
   drawn from the entire possible alternatives in the area based on the
   average household work distance to each alternative. Following the
   choice set formation step, a discrete choice model is utilized for
   modeling the final residential zone selection of the household. A
   hazard-based model is used for the choice set formation module while the
   final choice selection is modeled using a multinomial logit formulation
   with a deterministic sample correction factor. The approach presented in
   the paper provides a remedy for the large choice set problem typically
   faced in housing search models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3827-3836}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Ultraviolet disinfection is a physical method of disinfecting secondary
   treated wastewaters. Bioflocs formed during secondary treatment harbor
   and protect microbes from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, and
   significantly decrease the efficiency of disinfection at high UV doses
   causing the tailing phenomena. However, the exact mechanism of tailing
   and the role of biofloc properties and treatment conditions are not
   widely understood. It is hypothesized that sludge bioflocs are composed
   of an easily disinfectable loose outer shell, and a physically stronger
   compact core inside that accounts for the tailing phenomena.
   Hydrodynamic shear stress was applied to the bioflocs to peel off the
   looser outer shell to isolate the cores. Biofloc and core samples were
   fractionated into narrow size distributions by sieving and their UV
   disinfection kinetics were determined and compared. The results showed
   that for bioflocs, the tailing level elevates as the biofloc size
   increases, showing greater resistance to disinfection. However, for the
   cores larger than 45 mu m, it was found that the UV inactivation curves
   overlap, and show very close to identical inactivation kinetics.
   Comparing bioflocs and cores of similar size fraction, it was found that
   in all cases cores were harder to disinfect with UV light, and showed a
   higher tailing level. This study suggests that physical structure of
   bioflocs plays a significant role in the UV inactivation kinetics. (C)

Abstract = {{As a pre-requisite for optimal urban water resource management, the
   challenge of devising a comprehensive evaluation method of urban water
   resource utilization has for years caught the attention of researchers
   and stakeholders. Yet, even when dealing with the complicated water
   resource management system comprising of large amounts of vague and
   incomplete data, an accurate assessment or useful indicators obtained
   from such data can be of great assistance to municipal managers and
   policy makers. This article presents a DRAEW algorithm based on
   (F-lambda)-dynamic reduct method for generating evaluation rules from
   historical local water environmental data. The proposed method
   introduces a conditional probability classifier for equivalence class
   and (F-lambda)-dynamic reduct method for feature extraction and decision
   rules generation to classify ambiguous undecided objects. The approach
   is tested using data from Beijing whose water scarcity problem not only
   represents a microcosm of China but generally illustrates the value of
   the new approach. The result based on DRAEW algorithm brings the
   provisional conclusion that Beijing's water status is likely to decline,
   a result which could greatly assist policy makers and water managers
   make better decisions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a scheduling problem with component availability
   constraints in a supply chain consisting of two manufacturing facilities
   and a merge-in-transit facility. Three mixed-integer programming (MIP)
   models and a constraint programming (CP) model are compared in an
   extensive numerical study. Results show that when there are no
   components shared among the two manufacturers, the MIP model based on
   time-index variables is the best for proving optimality for problems
   with short processing times whereas the CP model tends to perform better
   than the others for problems with a large range of processing times.
   When shared components are added, the performance of all models
   deteriorates, with the time-indexed MIP providing the best results. By
   explicitly modelling the dependence of scheduling decisions on the
   availability of component parts, we contribute to the literature on the
   integration of inventory and scheduling decisions, which is necessary

Abstract = {{This paper proposes two optimization models for the periodic inspection
   of a system with ``hard-type{''} and ``soft-type{''} components. Given
   that the failures of hard-type components are self-announcing, the
   component is instantly repaired or replaced, but the failures of
   soft-type components can only be detected at inspections. A system can
   operate with a soft failure, but its performance may be reduced.
   Although a system may be periodically inspected, a hard failure creates
   an opportunity for additional inspection (opportunistic inspection) of
   all soft-type components. Two optimization models are discussed in the
   paper. In the first, soft-type components undergo both periodic and
   opportunistic inspections to detect possible failures. In the second,
   hard-type components undergo periodic inspections and are preventively
   replaced depending on their condition at inspection. Soft-type and
   hard-type components are either minimally repaired or replaced when they
   fail. Minimal repair or replacement depends on the state of a component
   at failure; this, in turn, depends on its age. The paper formulates
   objective functions for the two models and derives recursive equations
   for their required expected values. It develops a simulation algorithm
   to calculate these expected values for a complex model. Several examples
   are used to illustrate the models and the calculations. The data used in
   the examples are adapted from a real case study of a hospital's
   maintenance data for a general infusion pump. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Comparative metagenomics of three Dehalococcoides-containing enrichment
   cultures: the role of the non-dechlorinating community}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUL 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Dehalococcoides are strictly anaerobic bacteria that
   gain metabolic energy via the oxidation of H-2 coupled to the reduction
   of halogenated organic compounds. Dehalococcoides spp. grow best in
   mixed microbial consortia, relying on non-dechlorinating members to
   provide essential nutrients and maintain anaerobic conditions. A
   metagenome sequence was generated for the dechlorinating mixed microbial
   consortium KB-1. A comparative metagenomic study utilizing two
   additional metagenome sequences for Dehalococcoides-containing
   dechlorinating microbial consortia was undertaken to identify common
   features that are provided by the non-dechlorinating community and are
   potentially essential to Dehalococcoides growth.
   Results: The KB-1 metagenome contained eighteen novel homologs to
   reductive dehalogenase genes. The metagenomes obtained from the three
   consortia were automatically annotated using the MG-RAST server, from
   which statistically significant differences in community composition and
   metabolic profiles were determined. Examination of specific metabolic
   pathways, including corrinoid synthesis, methionine synthesis, oxygen
   scavenging, and electron-donor metabolism identified the Firmicutes,
   methanogenic Archaea, and the partial derivative Proteobacteria as key
   organisms encoding these pathways, and thus potentially producing
   metabolites required for Dehalococcoides growth.
   Conclusions: Comparative metagenomics of the three
   Dehalococcoides-containing consortia identified that similarities across
   the three consortia are more apparent at the functional level than at
   the taxonomic level, indicating the non-dechlorinating organisms'
   identities can vary provided they fill the same niche within a
   consortium. Functional redundancy was identified in each metabolic
   pathway of interest, with key processes encoded by multiple taxonomic
   groups. This redundancy likely contributes to the robust growth and
   dechlorination rates in dechlorinating enrichment cultures.}},

Title = {{Intersession Consistency of Single-Trial Classification of the
   Prefrontal Response to Mental Arithmetic and the No-Control State by
   NIRS}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 23}},
Abstract = {{Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been recently investigated for use
   in noninvasive brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies. Previous
   studies have demonstrated the ability to classify patterns of neural
   activation associated with different mental tasks (e.g., mental
   arithmetic) using NIRS signals. Though these studies represent an
   important step towards the realization of an NIRS-BCI, there is a
   paucity of literature regarding the consistency of these responses, and
   the ability to classify them on a single-trial basis, over multiple
   sessions. This is important when moving out of an experimental context
   toward a practical system, where performance must be maintained over
   longer periods. When considering response consistency across sessions,
   two questions arise: 1) can the hemodynamic response to the activation
   task be distinguished from a baseline (or other task) condition,
   consistently across sessions, and if so, 2) are the spatiotemporal
   characteristics of the response which best distinguish it from the
   baseline (or other task) condition consistent across sessions. The
   answers will have implications for the viability of an NIRS-BCI system,
   and the design strategies (especially in terms of classifier training
   protocols) adopted. In this study, we investigated the consistency of
   classification of a mental arithmetic task and a no-control condition
   over five experimental sessions. Mixed model linear regression on
   intrasession classification accuracies indicate that the task and
   baseline states remain differentiable across multiple sessions, with no
   significant decrease in accuracy (p = 0.67). Intersession analysis,
   however, revealed inconsistencies in spatiotemporal response
   characteristics. Based on these results, we investigated several
   different practical classifier training protocols, including scenarios
   in which the training and test data come from 1) different sessions, 2)
   the same session, and 3) a combination of both. Results indicate that
   when selecting optimal classifier training protocols for NIRS-BCI, a
   compromise between accuracy and convenience (e.g., in terms of
   duration/frequency of training data collection) must be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with two major
   recovery and extraction processes currently utilized in Alberta's oil
   sands, surface mining and in situ, are quantified. Process modules are
   developed and integrated into a life cycle model-GHOST (Green House gas
   emissions of current Oil Sands Technologies) developed in prior work
   Recovery and extraction of bitumen through surface mining and in situ
   processes result in 3-9 and 9-16 g CO(2)eq/MJ bitumen, respectively;
   upgrading emissions are an additional 6-17 g CO(2)eq/MJ synthetic crude
   oil (SCO) (all results are on a HHV basis). Although a high degree of
   variability exists in well-to-wheel emissions due to differences in
   technologies employed, operating conditions, and product
   characteristics, the surface mining dilbit and the in situ SCO pathways
   have the lowest and highest emissions, 88 and 120 g CO(2)eq/MJ
   reformulated gasoline. Through the use of improved data obtained from
   operating oil sands projects, we present ranges of emissions that
   overlap with emissions in literature for conventional crude oil. An
   increased focus is recommended in policy discussions on understanding
   interproject variability of emissions of both oil sands and conventional
   crudes, as this has not been adequately represented in previous studies.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{14}},

Abstract = {{This work addresses the discrepancy in the literature regarding the
   effects of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) on elemental Hg uptake by activated
   carbon (AC). H2SO4 in AC substantially increased Hg uptake by absorption
   particularly in the presence of oxygen. Hg uptake increased with acid
   amount and temperature exceeding 500 mg-Hg/g-AC after 3 days at 200
   degrees C with AC treated with 20\% H2SO4. In the absence of other
   strong oxidizers, oxygen was able to oxidize Hg. Upon oxidation, Hg was
   more readily soluble in the acid, greatly enhancing its uptake by
   acid-treated AC. Without O-2, S(VI) in H2SO4 was able to oxidize Hg,
   thus making it soluble in H2SO4. Consequently, the presence of a bulk
   H2SO4 phase within AC pores resulted in an orders of magnitude increase
   in Hg uptake capacity. However, the bulk H2SO4 phase lowered the AC pore
   volume and could block the access to the active surface sites and
   potentially hinder Hg uptake kinetics. AC treated with SO2 at 700
   degrees C exhibited a much faster rate of Hg uptake attributed to sulfur
   functional groups enhancing adsorption kinetics. SO2-treated carbon
   maintained its fast uptake kinetics even after impregnation by 20\%
   H2SO4.}},

Abstract = {{The transport of particles through groundwater systems is governed by a
   complex interplay of mechanical and chemical forces that are ultimately
   responsible for binding to geological substrates. To understand these
   forces in the context of zero valent iron particles used in the
   remediation of groundwater, atomic force microscopy (AFM)based force
   spectroscopy was employed to characterize the interactions between AFM
   tips modified with either carbonyl iron particles (CIP) or
   electrodeposited Fe as a function of counterion valency, temperature,
   particle morphology, and age. The measured interaction forces were
   always attractive for both fresh and aged CIP and electrodeposited iron,
   except in 100 mM NaCl, as a consequence of electrostatic attraction
   between the negatively charged mica and positively charged iron. In 100
   mM NaCl, repulsive hydration forces appeared to dominate. Good agreement
   was found between the experimental data and predictions based on the
   extended DLVO (XDLVO) theory. The effect of aging on iron particle
   composition and morphology was assessed by X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy
   dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) revealing that the aged particles
   comprising zero valent iron core passivated by a mixture of iron oxides
   and hydroxides. Force spectroscopy showed that aging caused variations
   in the adhesive force due to the changes in particle morphology and
   contact area.}},

Title = {{Structure and activity of the cold-active and anion-activated carboxyl

Abstract = {{The uncharacterized alpha/beta-hydrolase protein OLEI01171 from the
   psychrophilic marine bacterium Oleispira antarctica belongs to the
   PF00756 family of putative esterases, which also includes human esterase
   D. In the present paper we show that purified recombinant OLEI01171
   exhibits high esterase activity against the model esterase substrate
   a-naphthyl acetate at 5 30 C with maximal activity at 15-20 degrees C.
   The esterase activity of OLEI01171 was stimulated 3-8-fold by the
   addition of chloride or several other anions (0.1-1.0 M). Compared with
   mesophilic PF00756 esterases, OLEI01171 exhibited a lower overall
   protein thermostability. Two crystal structures of OLEI01171 were solved
   at 1.75 and 2.1 angstrom resolution and revealed a classical serine
   hydrolase catalytic triad and the presence of a chloride or bromide ion
   bound in the active site close to the catalytic Ser(148). Both anions
   were found to co-ordinate a potential catalytic water molecule located
   in the vicinity of the catalytic triad His'. The results of the present
   study suggest that the bound anion perhaps contributes to the
   polarization of the catalytic water molecule and increases the rate of
   the hydrolysis of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. Alanine replacement
   mutagenesis of OLEI01171 identified ten amino acid residues important
   for esterase activity. The replacement of Asn(225) by lysine had no
   significant effect on the activity or thermostability of OLEI01171, but
   resulted in a detectable increase of activity at 35-45 degrees C. The
   present study has provided insight into the molecular mechanisms of
   activity of a cold-active and anion-activated carboxyl esterase.}},

Abstract = {{Surface evolution models have been used in the past to accurately
   predict the cross-sectional profile of micro-channels resulting from the
   abrasive jet micro-machining (AJM) of glass and polymeric substrates. In
   the present paper, the models are suitably modified and applied for the
   first time to the AJM of metallic substrates. The dependence of erosion
   rate on abrasive jet inclination angle was measured for aluminum
   6061-T6, Ti-6Al-4V alloy, and 316L stainless steel using 50 mu m Al2O3
   abrasive powder launched at an average velocity of 106 m/s. For all
   three systems the peak erosion rate was found to occur when the jet was
   inclined between 20 degrees and 35 degrees relative to the surface. The
   AJM etch rate was found to be much lower than that found in glass and
   polymers, and it was found that a significant amount of particle
   embedding occurred in the 316L stainless steel. When the erosion data
   were used in an AJM surface evolution model, the resulting predicted
   cross-sectional profiles of unmasked and masked channels were in
   reasonable agreement with the measured profiles up to an aspect ratio
   (channel depth/width) of 1.25. The results demonstrate that surface
   evolution during the abrasive jet micro-machining of metals can be
   predicted using existing models, originally developed for glass and
   polymers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Conditions leading to the embedding of angular and spherical particles
   during the solid particle erosion of polymers}},
Journal = {{WEAR}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{292}},
Pages = {{159-168}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Embedding of erodent particles is observed during abrasive jet
   micromachining (AJM) of polymers. Embedded particles may shield the
   surface from subsequent impacts resulting in a reduced erosion rate.
   They are also a potential concern in the performance of AJM fabricated
   devices such as micro-fluidic chips. In this work, the conditions
   leading to particle embedding in polymers were determined for both
   angular and spherical particles. Using experimental data and a
   rigid-plastic model of particle impact, it was shown that angular
   particles embed only if the impact conditions are such that
   particle-target interface remains contiguous throughout the impact. A
   further requirement for angular particles to embed is that the static
   coefficient of friction between the particle and the target material
   must be sufficiently high to prevent the particle from being ejected on
   rebound. These criteria are consistent with the intuitive observation
   that embedding increases with elongated particles, and when the major
   axis is parallel to the incident velocity. The size distributions of the
   particles that were predicted to embed by the model were similar to
   those in the abrasive stream indicating that particle embedding did not
   depend on particle size for the investigated particle/target systems.
   The embedding of spherical particles was then analyzed using a
   rigid-plastic impact model in comparison with published experimental
   data. It was shown that a spherical particle will embed if it penetrates
   the substrate to a depth greater than its radius, so that displaced
   material can surround it to prevent rebound. Embedding of spherical
   particles at 900 is unlikely because the rebound forces will be larger
   than the frictional forces that would retain the particle. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Endovascular optical coherence tomography (EV-OCT) is an emerging

   Fluctuating speckle noise, especially during rapid pull-back, can
   severely degrade the visibility of morphological structures. Moreover,
   the speckle pattern varies in different parts of the image due to beam
   divergence and is further complicated by interpolation through the
   coordinate transformation necessary for displaying the rotary scanning
   images, challenging the use of frequency domain analysis. In this study,
   a computationally efficient method using a generalized divergence
   regularization procedure is presented to suppress speckle noise in
   EV-OCT images. Results show substantial smoothing of the grainy
   appearance and enhanced visualization of deeper structures as
   demonstrated in porcine carotid arteries. (C) 2012 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{We consider the properties of a creeping flow, boundary integral
   operator which is the sum of a single layer potential arising from a
   surface density, and two double layer potentials, one each for the
   tangential and normal components of the same density with different
   coefficient weights. Specific cases of this operator are encountered
   quite frequently in the creeping flow literature, especially in the
   solution of problems with slip at an interface. We examine, in
   particular, the eigenspectrum of this mixed-type operator. As expected,
   when the coefficient of either the tangential or normal component of the
   double layer term is either much smaller in magnitude than unity or
   identically equal to zero, the solution of this operator for the unknown
   density is rendered ill-posed, and thus, solution with the Richardson
   iteration technique requires a prohibitively large number of iterations.
   However, a surprising result is that the solution via inversion (e.g.
   Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, etc.), for the component of the
   density whose coefficient in the double layer term of the operator is
   non-zero, can actually be a well-posed problem. We verify our
   theoretical developments by considering a spherical viscous drop with a
   slipping interface suspended in a viscous liquid undergoing a uniaxial
   extensional flow, the interfacial slip being proportional to the local
   tangential stress. In this case, the operator is equivalent to the mixed
   type operator with the normal coefficient set to zero. We demonstrate
   that the solution of this operator for the tangential stress is a
   well-posed problem, and we delineate the parametric space for a stable
   solution scheme. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Elastomeric silicone foams are generally produced by the generation of
   hydrogen through reaction of Si-H groups with active hydrogen compounds,
   including water and alcohols, in a process catalyzed by platinum or tin
   complexes. It can be very difficult to control the rate and magnitude of
   bubble formation, particularly because of adventitious water. Silicone
   foams in a variety of densities (0.08-0.46 g/cm(3)) were obtained using
   a newly developed Piers-Rubinsztajn reaction by combining
   alpha,omega-hydride-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) with an
   alkoxysilane crosslinker such as tetraethyl orthosilicate with catalysis
   by B(C6F5)(3). A single reaction leads both to crosslinking and bubble
   evolution. The reaction is not significantly impacted by humidity: foams
   are generated by the release of alkane gases derived from the
   alkoxysilane crosslinker, typically methane or ethane, rather than
   hydrogen. It was found that crosslinker reactivity and concentration,
   and silicone molecular weight, can be used to effectively control bubble
   nucleation, coalescence, viscosity build and, therefore, final foam
   density and the formation of open or closed cell foams. Better quality
   foams normally resulted when hexane, which acts as a blowing agent, was
   added to the pre-foam mixture. In addition to these advantages, and
   excellent reproducibility, the Piers-Rubinsztajn reaction benefits from
   a very fast induction time. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{3341-3353}},
Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the crystallization behavior of polylactide (PLA) was
   investigated in the presence of dissolved CO2 using high-pressure and
   regular differential scanning calorimeter. The isothermal and
   non-isothermal melt crystallization results showed that increasing the
   CO2 pressure decreased the crystallization half-time. During isothermal
   and low-cooling-rate non-isothermal crystallization, a very high
   crystallinity was achieved at 15 bar CO2 pressure by facilitating more
   perfect crystal formation with the plasticization effect of CO2 while
   limiting the crystal nucleation rate. At higher CO2 pressures, a larger
   number of less close-packed crystals were formed due to chain
   entanglement, and consequently, the final crystallinity was decreased.
   The non-isothermal results at high cooling rates showed the total
   crystallinity decreased for all CO2 contents, because of less time given
   for crystallization. Also the effects of the CO2 pressure and the
   cooling rate on T-c and T-g were investigated. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{For photovoltaic panels, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is a
   crucial process to ensure energy capture is maximised. Various tracking
   algorithms are available for this purpose. Of these, one of the more
   common presently implemented is the incremental conductance method.
   However, no linearised small signal model incorporating an incremental
   conductance-based MPPT process exists. As will be demonstrated, this is
   attributed to the formation of a degenerate model when conventional
   linearisation techniques are applied. In this study, a modelling
   approach is developed that overcomes this deficiency and permits
   linearisation of the incremental conductance MPPT algorithm. As a case
   study adopting this developed approach, a complete small signal dynamic
   model of the incremental conductance method utilising a boost converter
   is derived. The model is validated against simulations in PSCAD/EMTDC.
   This study also presents some applications of the model, such as
   controller design and stability testing. The results demonstrate that
   the system is highly robust to variations in the lighting condition.}},

Abstract = {{Traces offer an opportunity to improve the performance of inlining

   evaluate the effectiveness of using traces to perform inlining. We
   propose a number of ways in which traces can be used to inline methods
   in an offline feedback directed system. We build a trace collection
   system for the Jikes Research Virtual Machine and create traces based on
   the execution of the SPECjvm98 and Java Grande benchmarks. We evaluate
   the use of these traces for miming, and find that the use of traces
   leads to a decrease in overall execution time of 5.4\%, when compared to
   Jikes's adaptive system. This performance is slightly better than that
   achieved when using a greedy algorithm that is representative of
   previous work. Using the greedy algorithm leads to a decrease in overall
   execution time of 4.8\%, when compared to Jikes's adaptive system. We
   conclude that traces may be used effectively to perform inlining,

Abstract = {{Objectives: Order sets are widely used in hospitals to enter diagnosis
   and treatment orders. To determine the effectiveness of order sets in
   improving guideline adherence, treatment outcomes, processes of care,
   efficiency, and cost, we conducted a systematic review of the
   literature.
   Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed in various
   databases for studies published between January 1, 1990, and April 18,
   2009. A total of eighteen studies met inclusion criteria. No randomized
   controlled trials were found.
   Results: Outcomes of the included studies were summarized qualitatively
   due to variations in study population, intervention type, and outcome
   measures. There were no important inconsistencies between the results
   reported by studies involving different types of order sets. While the
   studies generally suggested positive outcomes, they were typically of
   low quality, with simple before-after designs and other methodological
   limitations.
   Conclusions: The benefits of order sets remain eminently plausible, but
   given the paucity of high quality evidence, further investigations to
   formally evaluate the effectiveness of order sets would be highly
   valuable.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Novel therapies capable of targeting drug resistant clonogenic MM cells
   are required for more effective treatment of multiple myeloma. This
   study investigates the cytotoxicity of natural killer cell lines against
   bulk and clonogenic multiple myeloma and evaluates the tumor burden
   after NK cell therapy in a bioluminescent xenograft mouse model.
   Design and Methods
   The cytotoxicity of natural killer cell lines was evaluated against bulk
   multiple myeloma cell lines using chromium release and flow cytometry
   cytotoxicity assays. Selected activating receptors on natural killer
   cells were blocked to determine their role in multiple myeloma
   recognition. Growth inhibition of clonogenic multiple myeloma cells was
   assessed in a methylcellulose clonogenic assay in combination with
   secondary replating to evaluate the self-renewal of residual progenitors
   after natural killer cell treatment. A bioluminescent mouse model was
   developed using the human U266 cell line transduced to express green
   fluorescent protein and luciferase (U266eGFPluc) to monitor disease
   progression in vivo and assess bone marrow engraftment after intravenous
   NK-92 cell therapy.
   Results
   Three multiple myeloma cell lines were sensitive to NK-92 and KHYG-1
   cytotoxicity mediated by NKp30, NKp46, NKG2D and DNAM-1 activating
   receptors. NK-92 and KHYG-1 demonstrated 2- to 3-fold greater inhibition
   of clonogenic multiple myeloma growth, compared with killing of the bulk
   tumor population. In addition, the residual colonies after treatment
   formed significantly fewer colonies compared to the control in a
   secondary replating for a cumulative clonogenic inhibition of 89-99\% at
   the 20:1 effector to target ratio. Multiple myeloma tumor burden was
   reduced by NK-92 in a xenograft mouse model as measured by
   bioluminescence imaging and reduction in bone marrow engraftment of
   U266eGFPluc cells by flow cytometry.
   Conclusions
   This study demonstrates that NK-92 and KHYG-1 are capable of killing
   clonogenic and bulk multiple myeloma cells. In addition, multiple
   myeloma tumor burden in a xenograft mouse model was reduced by
   intravenous NK-92 cell therapy. Since multiple myeloma colony frequency
   correlates with survival, our observations have important clinical
   implications and suggest that clinical studies of NK cell lines to treat
   MM are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The distributions of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated
   diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in
   the atmosphere of Toronto, Canada and the surrounding suburban/rural
   area were examined. A series of temporally- and spatially-distributed
   air samples was collected over a 1-year period with a high-volume active
   air sampler at one downtown site and polyurethane foam passive air
   samplers at 19 sites. Passive sampler air concentrations of Sigma PAHs
   ranged from 0.27 to 51 ng/m(3). Concentrations of Sigma PCBs ranged from
   6.0 to 1300 pg/m(3), and concentrations of Sigma PBDEs ranged from 0.47
   to 110 pg/m(3). All compounds exhibited the highest concentrations in
   the urban core, and lowest concentrations in the surrounding rural
   areas, however the exact ratio depended on location since concentrations
   varied considerably within the city. Results from the application of a
   radial dilution model highlighted the influence of the central business
   district (CBD) of the city as a source of contaminants to the
   surrounding environment, however the radial dilution comparison also
   demonstrated that sources outside the CBD have a significant influence
   on regional contaminant concentrations.
   A strong relationship between temperature and partial pressure of the
   gas-phase PCBs, low molecular weight PBDEs and less-reactive PAHs
   suggested that their dominant emissions originated from
   temperature-controlled processes such as volatilization from local
   sources of PCBs, PAHs and PBDEs at warm temperatures, condensation and
   deposition of emissions at cold temperatures, and ventilation of indoor
   air with elevated concentrations. The relationship between temperature
   and atmospheric PAH concentrations varied along the urban-rural
   gradient, which suggested that in highly urbanized areas, such as
   downtown Toronto, temperature-related processes have a significant
   impact on air concentrations, whereas winter emissions from domestic
   heating have a greater influence in areas with less impervious surface
   coverage. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: Acute myocardial infarction (MI) leads to fibrosis and severe left
   ventricular wall thinning. Enhancing vascularization within the infarct
   reduces cell death and maintains a thick left ventricular wall, which is
   essential for proper cardiac function. Here, we evaluated the controlled
   delivery of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), which supports cardiomyocyte
   survival by inducing vascularization and upregulating Akt activity, in
   the treatment of MI. Materials \& methods: We injected collagen chitosan
   hydrogel with controlled release of T beta 4 into the infarct after
   performing left anterior descending artery ligation in rats. Results: T
   beta 4-encapsulated hydrogel (thymosin) significantly reduced tissue
   loss post-MI (13 +/- 4\%), compared with 58 +/- 3\% and 30 +/- 8\%
   tissue loss for no treatment (MI only) and T beta 4-free hydrogel
   (control). Significantly more Factor VIII-positive blood vessels with
   diameter >50 mu m were in the thymosin group compared with both MI only
   and control (p < 0.0001), showing T beta 4-induced vascularization. Wall
   thickness was positively correlated with the mature blood vessel density
   (r = 0.9319; p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Controlled release of T beta 4
   within the infarct enhances angiogenesis and presence of cardiomyocytes
   that are necessary for cardiac repair.}},

Abstract = {{In vascular tissue, elastin is an essential extracellular matrix protein
   that plays an important biomechanical and biological signalling role.
   Native elastin is insoluble and is difficult to extract from tissues,
   which results in its relatively rare use for the fabrication of vascular
   tissue engineering scaffolds. Recombinant elastin-like polypeptide-4
   (ELP4), which mimics the structure and function of native tropoelastin,
   represents a practical alternative to the native elastic fibre for
   vascular applications. In this study, electrospinning was utilized to
   fabricate fibrous scaffolds which were subsequently surface modified
   with ELP4 and used as substrates for smooth muscle cell culture. ELP4
   surface modified materials demonstrated enhanced smooth muscle cell
   (SMC) adhesion and maintenance of cell numbers over a 1-week period
   relative to controls. SMCs seeded on the ELP4 surface modified materials
   were also shown to exhibit the cell morphology and biological markers of
   a contractile phenotype including a spindle-like morphology, actin
   filament organization and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain expression.
   Competitive inhibition experiments demonstrated that the elastin-laminin
   cell surface receptor and its affinity for the VGVAPG peptide sequence
   on ELP4 molecules are likely involved in the initial SMC contact with
   the ELP4 modified materials. Elastin-like polypeptides show promise as
   surface modifiers for candidate scaffolds for engineering contractile
   vascular tissues. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Contact detection for nanomanipulation in a scanning electron microscope}},
Journal = {{ULTRAMICROSCOPY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{118}},
Pages = {{61-66}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Nanomanipulation systems require accurate knowledge of the end-effector
   position in all three spatial coordinates, XYZ, for reliable
   manipulation of nanostructures. Although the images acquired by a
   scanning electron microscope (SEM) provide high resolution XY
   information, the lack of depth information in the Z-direction makes 3D
   nanomanipulation time-consuming. Existing approaches for contact
   detection of end-effectors inside SEM typically utilize fragile touch
   sensors that are difficult to integrate into a nanomanipulation system.
   This paper presents a method for determining the contact between an
   end-effector and a target surface during nanomanipulation inside SEM,
   purely based on the processing of SEM images. A depth-from-focus method
   is used in the fast approach of the end-effector to the substrate,
   followed by fine contact detection. Experimental results demonstrate
   that the contact detection approach is capable of achieving an accuracy
   of 21.5 nm at 50,000 x magnification while inducing little end-effector
   damage. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in swept source laser technology continues to increase the
   imaging speed of swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT)
   systems. These fast imaging speeds are ideal for microvascular detection
   schemes, such as speckle variance (SV), where interframe motion can
   cause severe imaging artifacts and loss of vascular contrast. However,
   full utilization of the laser scan speed has been hindered by the
   computationally intensive signal processing required by SS-OCT and SV
   calculations. Using a commercial graphics processing unit that has been
   optimized for parallel data processing, we report a complete high-speed
   SS-OCT platform capable of real-time data acquisition, processing,
   display, and saving at 108,000 lines per second. Subpixel image
   registration of structural images was performed in real-time prior to SV
   calculations in order to reduce decorrelation from stationary structures
   induced by the bulk tissue motion. The viability of the system was
   successfully demonstrated in a high bulk tissue motion scenario of human
   fingernail root imaging where SV images (512 x 512 pixels, n = 4) were
   displayed at 54 frames per second. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is the most commonly used
   technology for improving motor function in individuals who have spinal
   cord injury. Despite the wide range of FES applications reported in the
   literature, few electrical stimulation systems that can generate
   meaningful functional outcomes are currently available for use outside
   research laboratories. We tested proportional-integral-derivative, gain
   scheduling, and sliding mode control closed-loop control algorithms in a
   simulation of electrically induced knee extension against gravity to
   uncover some of the reasons why closed-loop control is not being more
   widely used in real-world FES systems. We also subjected the simulated
   FES system to muscle fatigue, muscle spasms, and the effects of muscle
   retraining. All of the controllers exhibited significantly degraded
   performance when these real-world nonlinear effects were included in the
   simulation. Moreover, all of the controllers were sensitive to variation
   in the parameters of the muscle recruitment function, which are subject
   to change during real-world FES use. We suggest several ways to improve
   the performance of closed-loop control algorithms for use in FES
   applications. We believe that closed-loop controllers have an important
   place in future FES applications, but the performance of these
   algorithms must be greatly improved before they can be implemented in
   real-world systems.}},

Abstract = {{This work reports on the dry adhesion strength of wood adhesives
   formulated with fractions of an alkaline extract obtained from
   wastewater activated sludge, a renewable and abundant resource. The
   extract was fractionated and desalted using ultrafiltration techniques.
   The effect of molecular weight and composition (protein and carbohydrate
   content) on the extract's adhesion strength was assessed, as well as the
   effect of crosslinking using glutaraldehyde. The dry adhesion strength
   of adhesives formulated with soluble mustard seed protein isolate, a
   protein-rich alkaline extract, is also reported. In the presence of
   glutaraldehyde, an extract fraction with high protein content and low
   salt and hydroxide content showed adhesion strength close to that of the
   mustard protein adhesive and a commercial wood adhesive. It was further
   determined that the adhesion strength of the extract and its fractions
   was strongly correlated with their protein content.}},

Abstract = {{Pad-crater fracture was characterized in terms of the critical strain
   energy release rate, J(ci), measured at various mode ratios, psi.
   Specimens were prepared from lead-free chip scale package-PCB assemblies
   and fractured at low and high loading rates in various bending
   configurations to generate a range of mode ratios. The specimens tested
   at low loading rates all failed by pad cratering, while the ones tested
   at higher loading rates fractured in the brittle intermetallic layer of
   the solder. The J(ci), of pad cratering increased with the phase angle,
   psi, but was independent of surface finish (OSP and ENIG) and reflow
   profile (time above liquidius 60 s and 120 s). The generality of the J =
   J(ci)(psi) failure criterion to predict pad-cratering fracture was then
   demonstrated by predicting the fracture loads of single lap-shear
   specimens made from the same lead-free assemblies. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective: To test the hypothesis that heightened advanced glycation
   endproducts (AGEs) content in cartilage accelerates the progression of
   spontaneous osteoarthritis (OA) in the Hartley guinea pig (HGP) model.
   Methods: Twenty-eight male, 3-month-old HGPs were used. Eight were left
   untreated as a baseline control group and sacrificed at 3 months of age
   (n = 4) and 9 months of age (n = 4; age-matched controls). The other 20
   HGPs received intra-articular knee injections in the right knee whereas
   the left knees acted as contra-lateral non-injected controls. Injections
   consisted of 100 mu l phosphate buffered saline (PBS; n = 10) or
   PBS+2.0.M D-(-)-Ribose (n = 10). Injections were given once weekly for
   24 weeks. At the end of the treatment period, the tibiae were fixed with
   formalin, scanned with microCT for subchondral bone mineral density, and
   then histological slides were prepared, stained with Safranin-O with
   Fast Green counter stain and scored using the OARSI-HISTOgp scheme.
   Cartilage pentosidine (established biomarker for AGES) content, collagen
   content (\% dry mass), glucosaminoglycan GAG-to-collagen ratio (mu g/mu
   g), GAG-to-DNA ratio and DNA-to-collagen ratio were measured.
   Results: Pentosidine content increased greatly due to PBS + Ribose
   injection (P < 0.0001) and reached levels found in cartilage from
   80-year-old humans. Surprisingly, mean OARSI-HISTOgp scores for both the
   injected and contra-lateral controls in the PBS + Ribose group were not
   detectably different, nor were they different from the mean score for
   the age-matched control group.
   Conclusion: AGEs accumulation due to intra-articular ribose-containing
   injections in the HGP model of spontaneous knee OA did not enhance
   disease progression. (C) 2012 Osteoarthritis Research Society

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider an availability maximization problem for a

   objective is to design an optimal multivariate Bayesian control chart
   that maximizes the long-run expected average availability per unit time.
   We have developed an efficient computational algorithm in the
   semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) framework and showed that the
   availability maximization problem is equivalent to solving a
   parameterized system of linear equations. A numerical example is
   presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, and a

Abstract = {{Cemented paste backfill (CPB) is accepted as the optimal backfilling
   material for many underground mines. However, the lack of in-stope
   backfill pressure data poses fundamental problems from both operational
   and research standpoints. In response to the requirement for in situ
   data, a comprehensive field instrumentation project has been conducted.
   Results are presented here for two stopes at the Cayeli Mine, where
   geotechnical instruments were installed at the barricades and throughout
   the stopes. Measurements from a large (slow rise rate) stope with high
   binder content CPB demonstrated a rapid departure from hydrostatic
   loading, resulting in relatively low barricade pressures. Conversely,
   data from a smaller (fast rise rate) stope with lower binder content CPB
   demonstrated that when cement hydration is retarded, high barricade
   pressures occur. These examples illustrate the relationship between CPB
   rise rate and the moderating effect of cement hydration on in situ
   pressures, which ultimately control barricade pressures. Once CPB gains
   shear strength, arching of pressures occurs. In situ pressures were
   reduced with proximity to stope walls and further, under stope access
   brows, demonstrating that barricade location influences barricade loads.
   The application of real-time pressure monitoring of pastefill barricades
   has been demonstrated as an important tool in optimizing operational
   backfilling efficiency.}},

Title = {{A 3D scanning confocal imaging method measures pit volume and captures

Abstract = {{Modulation of Rho GTPases Rac1 and Rac2 impacts bone development,
   remodeling, and disease. In addition, GTPases are considered treatment
   targets for dysplastic and erosive bone diseases including
   Neurofibromatosis type 1. While it is important to understand the
   effects of Rac modulation on osteoclast function, two-dimensional
   resorption pit area measurements fall short in elucidating the volume
   aspect of bone resorption activity.
   Bone marrow from wild-type. Rac1 and Rac2 null mice was isolated from
   femora. Osteoclastogenesis was induced by adding M-CSF and RANKL in
   culture plates containing dentin slices and later stained with Picro
   Sirius Red to image resorption lacunae. Osteoclasts were also plated on
   glass cover slips and stained with phalloidin and DAPI to measure their
   surface area and the number of nuclei. Volumetric images were collected
   on a laser-scanning confocal system.
   Sirius Red confocal imaging provided an unambiguous, continuous
   definition of the pit boundary compared to reflected and transmitted
   light imaging. Rac1- and Rac2-deficient osteoclasts had fewer nuclei in
   comparison to wild-type counterparts. Rac1-deficient osteoclasts showed
   reduced resorption pit volume and surface area. Lacunae made by single
   Rac2 null osteoclasts had reduced volume but surprisingly surface area
   was unaffected.
   Surface area measures are deceiving since volume changed independently
   in resorption pits made by individual Rac2 null osteoclasts. Our
   innovative confocal imaging technique allows us to derive novel
   conclusions about Rac1 and Rac2 in osteoclast function. The data and
   method can be applied to study effects of genes and drugs including Rho
   GTPase modulators on osteoclast function and to develop
   pharmacotherapeutics to treat bone lytic disorders. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Lowering blood pressure reduces cardiovascular risk, yet hypertension is
   poorly controlled in diabetic patients. In a pilot study we demonstrated
   that a home blood pressure telemonitoring system, which provided
   self-care messages on the smartphone of hypertensive diabetic patients
   immediately after each reading, improved blood pressure control.
   Messages were based on care paths defined by running averages of
   transmitted readings. The present study tests the system's effectiveness
   in a randomized, controlled trial in diabetic patients with uncontrolled
   systolic hypertension. Of 244 subjects screened for eligibility, 110
   (45\%) were randomly allocated to the intervention (n=55) or control
   (n=55) group, and 105 (95.5\%) completed the 1-year outcome visit. In
   the intention-to-treat analysis, mean daytime ambulatory systolic blood
   pressure, the primary end point, decreased significantly only in the
   intervention group by 9.1 +/- 15.6 mmHg (SD; P<0.0001), and the mean
   between-group difference was 7.1 +/- 2.3 mmHg (SE; P<0.005).
   Furthermore, 51\% of intervention subjects achieved the guideline
   recommended target of <130/80 mmHg compared with 31\% of control
   subjects (P<0.05). These improvements were obtained without the use of
   more or different antihypertensive medications or additional clinic
   visits to physicians. Providing self-care support did not affect anxiety
   but worsened depression on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
   (baseline, 4.1 +/- 3.76; exit, 5.2 +/- 4.30; P=0.014). This study
   demonstrated that home blood pressure telemonitoring combined with
   automated self-care support reduced the blood pressure of diabetic
   patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension and improved
   hypertension control. Home blood pressure monitoring alone had no effect
   on blood pressure. Promoting patient self-care may have negative
   psychological effects. (Hypertension. 2012;60:51-57.). Online Data

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider molecular communication, with information
   conveyed in the time of release of molecules. These molecules propagate
   to the transmitter through a fluid medium, propelled by a positive drift
   velocity and Brownian motion. The main contribution of this paper is the
   development of a theoretical foundation for such a communication system;
   specifically, the additive inverse Gaussian noise (AIGN) channel model.
   In such a channel, the information is corrupted by noise that follows an
   IG distribution. We show that such a channel model is appropriate for
   molecular communication in fluid media. Taking advantage of the
   available literature on the IG distribution, upper and lower bounds on
   channel capacity are developed, and a maximum likelihood receiver is
   derived. Results are presented which suggest that this channel does not
   have a single quality measure analogous to signal-to-noise ratio in the
   additive white Gaussian noise channel. It is also shown that the use of
   multiple molecules leads to reduced error rate in a manner akin to
   diversity order in wireless communications. Finally, some open problems
   are discussed that arise from the IG channel model.}},

Abstract = {{Cell cell interactions are critical to understanding functional tissues.
   A number of stem cell populations have been shown to receive key
   regulatory information from endothelial cells (ECs); however, the role
   of ECs in the retinal stem and progenitor cell (RSPC) niche has been
   largely unexplored. To gain greater insight into the role of ECs on RSPC
   fate, a three-dimensional (3D) co-culture model, incorporating cell cell
   interactions, was designed by covalently-modifying agarose hydrogels
   with growth factors and cell-adhesive peptides in defined volumes.
   Therein ECs adopted tubular-like morphologies similar to those observed
   in vivo, but not observed in two-dimensional (2D) cultures.
   Unexpectedly, ECs inhibited proliferation and differentiation of RSPCs,
   revealing, for the first time, the possible role of ECs on RSPC fate.
   This 3D hydrogel scaffold provides a simple, reproducible and versatile
   method with which to answer biological questions related to the cellular
   microenvironment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SURFACTANTS AND DETERGENTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{495-504}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{It has been confirmed that the structure of the alkyl group of an
   extended surfactant plays an important role in defining its interfacial
   properties. Alkyl groups containing a higher degree of beta-branching
   (C2-branching) produce microemulsions with a larger characteristic
   length (xi, the extent of solubilization in middle phases). This effect
   is explained on the basis that beta-branching increases the
   hydrophobicity of the surfactant and decreases the optimal salinity of
   the microemulsion. Higher salinities produce a dehydration of the
   surfactant groups that lead to shorter extent of the interactions with
   the oil and the water. Larger characteristic lengths are desirable if
   the objective of the formulation is obtaining greater solubilization of
   oil and water, and lower interfacial tensions. Large characteristic
   lengths are, in most cases, associated with high interfacial rigidities,
   which are undesirable if rapid coalescence is required. However,
   mixtures of branched and linear extended surfactants produce large
   characteristic lengths and lower interfacial rigidities. The HLD-NAC
   model is able to reflect the experimental trends in solubilization of
   oil and water. The differences between the predictions of the model for
   the solubilization of oil and water in Type I and II formulations,
   respectively, highlight the complexities in the conformation of extended
   surfactants, particularly their PO groups, at oil-water interfaces and
   the need for advanced scattering techniques to evaluate these
   conformations.}},

   folic acid, resveratrol, and 4,4'-(propane-1,3-diyl) dibenzoic acid] and
   beta-cyclodextrin is described. We couple on-line ACE with MS to combine
   the separation and kinetic capability of ACE together with the molecular
   weight and structural elucidation of MS in one system. To understand the
   full potential of ACE-MS, we compare it with two other methods: Direct
   infusion mass spectrometry (DIMS) and ACE with UV detection (ACE-UV).
   After the evaluation, DIMS provides less reliable equilibrium
   dissociation constants than separation-based ACE-UV and ACE-MS, and
   cannot be used solely for the study of noncovalent interactions. ACE-MS
   determines apparent dissociation constants for all reacting small
   molecules in a mixture, even in cases when drugs overlap with each other
   during separation. The ability of ACE-MS to interact, separate, and
   rapidly scan through m/z can facilitate the simultaneous affinity
   analysis of multiple interacting pairs, potentially leading to the
   high-throughput screening of drug candidates.}},

Abstract = {{Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal time courses in
   functional magnetic resonance imaging are estimated within the framework
   of general linear modeling by convolving an input function, that
   represents neural activity, with a canonical hemodynamic response
   function (HRF). Here we investigate the performance of different neural
   input functions and latency-optimized HRFs for modeling BOLD signals in
   response to vibrotactile somatosensory stimuli of variable durations
   (0.5, 1, 4, 7 s) in 14 young, healthy adults who were required to make
   button press responses at each stimulus cessation. Informed by
   electrophysiology and the behavioral task, three nested models with an
   increasing number of parameters were considered: a boxcar; boxcar and
   offset transient; and onset transient, boxcar and offset transient
   (TBT). The TBT model provided the best fit of the group-averaged BOLD
   time courses based on chi(2) and F statistics. Only the TBT model was
   capable of fitting the bimodal shape of the BOLD response to the 7-s
   stimulus and the relative peak amplitudes for all stimulus lengths in
   key somatosensory and motor areas. This suggests that the TBT model
   provides a more comprehensive description of brain sensorimotor
   responses in this experiment than provided by the simple boxcar model.
   Work comparing the activation maps obtained with the TBT model with
   magnetoencephalography data is under way. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Introduction: Delays in surgical repair following nerve transection
   produce progressively inferior motor nerve regeneration. Regeneration
   can be improved with delivery of exogenous growth factor. We developed a
   delivery system that could be applied at the nerve repair site to
   deliver growth factors locally to regenerating nerve. Methods:
   Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres containing glial-derived
   neurotrophic factor (GDNF) suspended within fibrin were developed into a
   delivery system for local application surrounding nerve at a repair site
   in an experimental rat model. Results: The system containing GDNF
   remained at the injury site for up to 2 weeks and improved motor nerve
   regeneration following chronic axotomy and denervation. Conclusions:
   Based on the positive outcome of the delivery system, we plan to study
   the delivery system over longer time courses of release and nerve
   regeneration. Muscle Nerve 46: 122124, 2012}},

Abstract = {{Selectively-transparent and conducting photonic crystals (STCPCs) made
   of alternating layers of sputtered indium-tin oxide (ITO) and
   spin-coated silica (SiO2) nanoparticle films exhibit Bragg-reflectance
   peaks in the visible spectrum of 95\% reflectivity and have a full width
   at half maximum that is greater than 200 nm. At the same time, their
   conductive properties are comparable to that of solid sputtered ITO
   films. Moreover, the average transmission of the STCPCs in the pass-band
   can be increased to similar to 88\%, or within 3.3\% of the bare glass
   slide they are fabricated on. Furthermore, we also show that these
   STCPCs can readily be fabricated on textured surfaces similar to those
   used for micromorph solar cells. In this context wave optics analysis
   shows that these STCPCs can be utilized as intermediate reflectors that
   boost the relative photo-current generated in textured micromorph cells
   by more than 20\% over a broad range of incident angles. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Seated postural stability has not been studied extensively in
   individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). The main purpose of this
   study was to compare the effects of upper limb (U/L) positions and U/L
   weight support roles on quasi-static postural stability between
   individuals with SCI and healthy controls. Fourteen individuals with SCI
   and 14 healthy controls sat on an instrumented seat with their feet
   resting on force plates and randomly maintained five short-sitting
   positions for 60 s with or without hand support. Center-of-pressure
   (COP) measures based on displacement and frequency series were computed.
   Individuals with SCI exhibited greater mean COP displacement and
   velocity measures compared to healthy controls, as well as lower COP
   frequency measures, irrespective of the U/L positions and weight support
   roles, confirming reduced stability and a difference in preferential
   postural regulation strategies. The use of U/L support is a compensatory
   strategy that influences seated stability in individuals with SCI. (C)

Abstract = {{The low sensitivity of the gas monitoring system, especially in low
   concentration range, can be overcome by a miniaturized-based
   preconcentrator focuser, which can be integrated at the front end of the
   system. The preconcentrator focuser accumulates, concentrates, and
   releases the concentrated target analyte upon applying a heating pulse,
   thus extensively enhancing the sensitivity of the system. Recently,
   highly strict regulations on the quality of fruits have been applied to
   deliver high quality fruits to the consumer. Therefore, precise
   monitoring of ethylene as a ripeness accelerator to the fruits is very
   important. This paper presents the design, fabrication, and
   characterization of micropreconcentrator focuser for ethylene
   monitoring. The device is based on silicon microtrenches that serve as a
   microheater and microchannels loaded with Carboxen 1000 adsorbents.
   Thick silicon microtrenches are formed using deep reactive ion etching
   process. The silicon structures are sandwiched between two Pyrex wafers
   by anodic bonding. Only clean air is used as a carrier and desorption
   gas. The enhancement of 100-ppb ethylene concentration is discussed and
   presented. The device performance for various operations parameters is
   demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion
   mass spectrometry were used to investigate the aging effects on the
   aminopropylsilane (APS) and quaternary ammonium surfactant-treated
   mineral fibers. APS-coated mineral fiber samples were treated with
   cationic surfactant and mineral oil and aged at 70?degrees C temperature
   and 95\% humidity. From quantitative XPS measurements, an increase in
   the atomic composition of oxygen, nitrogen, and silicon is observed
   after aging. An increase in the protonated amino groups in the N1s
   high-resolution spectra and CN group in the C1s high-resolution spectra
   is also observed. These results indicate that the concentration of
   hydrocarbon groups decreases after aging due to the partial removal of
   the long hydrocarbon chains of the surfactant and mineral oil and/or
   hydrolysis and segregation of APS to the fiber surface. The principal
   component analysis (PCA) was applied to the time-of-flight secondary ion
   mass spectrometry spectra, and an increase in the intensities of APS
   characteristic peaks were observed after aging. The observed increase in
   the signals of APS originates from underlying silanized fibers after the
   removal of the surfactant and mineral oil from the surface. Copyright

Abstract = {{Peer-to-peer (P2P) live video streaming systems have recently received
   substantial attention, with commercial deployment gaining increased
   popularity in the internet. It is evident from our practical experiences
   with real-world systems that, it is not uncommon for hundreds of
   thousands of users to choose to join a program in the first few minutes
   of a live broadcast. Such a severe flash crowd phenomenon in live
   streaming poses significant challenges in the system design. In this
   paper, for the first time, we develop a mathematical model to: 1)
   capture the fundamental relationship between time and scale in P2P live
   streaming systems under a flash crowd, and 2) explore the design
   principle of population control to alleviate the impact of the flash
   crowd. We carry out rigorous analysis that brings forth an in-depth
   understanding on effects of the gossip protocol and peer dynamics. In
   particular, we demonstrate that there exists an upper bound on the
   system scale with respect to a time constraint. By trading peer startup
   delays in the initial stage of a flash crowd for system scale, we design
   a simple and flexible population control framework that can alleviate
   the flash crowd without the requirement of otherwise costly server
   deployment.}},

Abstract = {{Some of today's TM systems implement the two-phase-locking (2PL)
   algorithm which aborts transactions every time a conflict occurs. 2PL is
   a simple algorithm that provides fast transactional operations. However,
   it limits concurrency in benchmarks with high contention because it
   increases the rate of aborts. We propose the use of a more relaxed
   concurrency control algorithm to provide better concurrency. This
   algorithm is based on the conflict-serializability (CS) model. Unlike
   2PL, it allows some transactions to commit successfully even when they
   make conflicting accesses. We implement this algorithm in a STM system
   and evaluate its performance on 16 cores using standard benchmarks. Our
   evaluation shows that the algorithm improves the performance of
   applications with long transactions and high abort rates. Throughput is
   improved by up to 2.99 times despite the overheads of testing for CS at
   runtime. These improvements come with little additional implementation
   complexity and require no changes to the transactional programming
   model. We also propose an adaptive approach that switches between 2PL
   and CS to mitigate the overhead in applications that have low abort
   rates.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of earthmoving equipment in construction images and videos can
   increase the automation level of many construction management tasks such

   of this paper is to develop a model for non-rigid equipment detection
   and pose estimation in construction images and videos. In this paper, we
   describe an object recognition system based on mixture of appearances of
   deformable body parts of the hydraulic excavator and compare its results
   with general Histogram of Oriented Gradient detectors in both images and
   videos. Then a spatial-temporal reasoning model is presented which uses
   time and space constraints of the excavators' moving patterns to improve
   the detection results in videos. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Ageing infrastructure and improvements to design code shear provisions
   has led to a situation in which many older structures are now considered
   structurally deficient and are in need of rehabilitation or retrofit.
   Many of these structures may be at risk of catastrophic failure if their
   shear-critical components fail in a brittle manner, which could be
   induced during an earthquake or due to overloading. An effective method
   for upgrading these shear-critical components is by applying externally
   bonded fibre reinforced polymers (FRP), which have been shown to
   significantly enhance shear strength. However, current design codes (ACI
   440.2R-08, CSA S6-06) fail to accurately predict strength improvements
   and have yet to be verified with large-scale beams or those subjected to
   cyclic loading. As such, large-scale (400 x 650 x 3600 mm)
   shear-critical reinforced concrete beams were tested under reversed
   cyclic loading to simulate a seismic event. The beams contained less
   than design code recommended transverse steel reinforcement for shear
   and were retrofitted with various FRP wrap configurations. It was found
   that the FRP retrofits greatly improved shear strength under reversed
   cyclic loading, attributed to the relatively elastic-like behaviour of
   the retrofitted specimens. In addition, retrofits with sufficient FRP
   strengthening to promote flexural yielding were found to improve
   ductility by reducing post-yield shear strength deterioration. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{In this paper, a digital adaptive slope control technique is presented
   to improve the dynamic response of a current-programmed mode (CPM) buck
   converter employing a low-cost auxiliary phase. The advantages and
   drawbacks of the existing analog and digital nonlinear control
   techniques are discussed in detail. The benefits of the proposed control
   scheme include superior voltage drop and settling time, adaptive slope
   control to accommodate a range of auxiliary phase inductor values, and
   online calibration to compensate for tolerance in the main phase and
   auxiliary phase inductance. The proposed technique is experimentally
   verified on a 500-kHz, 10-2.5 V CPM buck converter prototype. Charge
   balancing and optimal transient response are achieved for a range of
   positive and negative load steps. Operating the auxiliary phase under
   light-load condition is also demonstrated to further justify the use of
   the auxiliary phase. Compared to a representative single-phase
   converter, the proposed system not only has over two times improvement
   on the voltage drop and three times lower steady-state voltage ripple
   but also achieves approximately 2\% heavy-load and 10\% light-load
   efficiency improvement. The impact of the auxiliary phase operation on
   the converter's dynamic efficiency is also evaluated at different load
   step amplitudes and frequencies.}},

   steel was studied at temperatures of 600-950 A degrees C. The Cu-Mn
   metallic films were converted to Cu-Mn spinel coating in the temperature
   range of 600-950 A degrees C as confirmed by X-ray diffraction.
   Conversion mechanisms of metals to the spinel were investigated.
   Examination by SEM showed that negligible oxidation of the substrate
   alloy occurred in the coated samples at temperatures up to 750 A degrees
   C; a transition layer formed between the substrate and spinel coating at
   higher temperatures. Cu-Mn spinel coating can provide protection to the
   metallic substrate at temperatures up to 850 A degrees C. Formation of
   the spinel coating was due to reactions of CuO, which formed through
   outward diffusion of copper, with manganese oxides, which formed through
   inward diffusion of oxygen.}},

Abstract = {{We tackle the challenge of applying automated negotiation to
   self-interested agents with local but linked combinatorial optimization
   problems. Using a distributed production scheduling problem, we propose
   two negotiation strategies for making concessions in a joint search
   space of agreements. In the first strategy, building on Lai and Sycara
   (Group Decis Negot 18(2):169-187, 2009), an agent concedes on local
   utility in order to achieve an agreement. In the second strategy, an
   agent concedes on the distance in an attribute space while maximizing
   its local utility. Lastly, we introduce a Pareto improvement phase to
   bring the final agreement closer to the Pareto frontier. Experimental
   results show that the new attribute-space negotiation strategy
   outperforms its utility-based counterpart on the quality of the
   agreements and the Pareto improvement phase is effective in approaching
   the Pareto frontier. This article presents the first study of applying
   automated negotiation to self-interested agents each with a local, but
   linked, combinatorial optimization problem.}},

Volume = {{160}},

Abstract = {{Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) has shown promise in regenerative strategies after
   spinal cord injury; however, sustained local delivery is difficult to
   achieve by conventional methods. Controlled release from
   poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles has been studied for
   numerous proteins, yet achieving sustained release of bioactive proteins
   remains a challenge. To address these issues, we designed a composite
   drug delivery system comprised of NT-3 encapsulated in PLGA
   nanoparticles dispersed in an injectable hydrogel of hyaluronan and
   methyl cellulose (HAMC). A continuum model was used to fit the in vitro
   release kinetics of an NT-3 analog from a nanoparticle formulation.
   Interestingly, the model suggested that the linear drug release observed
   from composite HAMC was due to a diffusion-limiting layer of methyl
   cellulose on the particle surface. We then studied the effects of
   processing parameters and excipient selection on NT-3 release,
   stability, and bioactivity. Trehalose was shown to be the most effective
   additive for stabilizing NT-3 during sonication and lyophilization and
   PLGA itself was shown to stabilize NT-3 during these processes. Of four
   excipients tested, 400 g/mol poly(ethylene glycol) was the most
   effective during nanoparticle fabrication, with 74\% of NT-3 detected by
   ELISA. Conversely, co-encapsulation of magnesium carbonate with NT-3 was
   the most effective in maintaining NT-3 bioactivity over 28 days
   according to a cell-based axonal outgrowth assay. Together, the modeling
   and optimized processing parameters provide insight critical to
   designing a controlled bioactive release formulation for ultimate
   testing in vivo. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   over-the-horizon radar systems}},
Journal = {{RADIO SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{47}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{The detection performance of high frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR)
   and high frequency over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) systems is heavily
   influenced by the presence of radar clutter. In HFSWR systems, the
   clutter has its origins in vertical-incidence ionospheric reflections,
   whereas in OTHR systems, the origin is Bragg backscatter from plasma
   structures in the auroral zone. This paper models the spreading of the
   radar clutter signal in the Doppler and angle-of-arrival domains that
   arises from forward-scattering effects as the radar pulse propagates
   through regions of ionospheric plasma irregularities. The models use a
   geometric optics approach to determine the power spectrum of the radar
   signal phase. This power spectrum is then used to simulate
   three-dimensional space-time-range radar data cubes. The accuracy of the
   models is tested by comparing the simulated data to measured data cubes.
   As an application, the data are then used to evaluate the performance of
   the newly developed fast fully adaptive (FFA) space-time adaptive
   processing (STAP) scheme to improve the extraction of target echoes from
   a clutter background.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 19}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we extend recent results concerning random-pair
   Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen distillation and the operational gap between
   separable operations (SEPs) and local operations with classical
   communication (LOCC). In particular, we consider the problem of
   obtaining bipartite maximal entanglement from an N-qubit W-class state
   (i.e., that of the form root x(0)|00 ... 0 > + root x(1)|10 ... 0 > +
   ... + root x(n)|00 ... 1 >) when the target pairs are a priori
   unspecified. We show that when x(0) = 0, the optimal probabilities for
   SEPs can be computed using semidefinite programming. On the other hand,
   to bound the optimal probabilities achievable by LOCC, we introduce
   entanglement monotones defined on the N-qubit W class of states. The
   LOCC monotones we construct can be increased by SEPs, and in terms of
   transformation success probability, we are able to quantify a gap as
   large as 37\% between the two classes. Additionally, we demonstrate
   transformations rho(circle times n) -> sigma(circle times n) that are
   feasible by SEP for any n but impossible by LOCC.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a process whereby chloroboronsubphthalocyanine
   (Cl-BsubPc) and other BsubPcs are activated to reaction with oxygen,
   sulfur, and nitrogen based nucleophiles by treatment with aluminum
   chloride under mild conditions. This allows for the scope of atoms
   chemically bound to the boron atom to be expanded beyond those derived
   from the traditional oxygen and carbon based nucleophiles. The
   successful formation of thiophenoxy and phenylamino derivatives of
   BsubPc was confirmed spectroscopically and by X-ray crystallography of
   single crystals. We have proposed a detailed mechanism for this process
   based on experimental observation and NMR spectroscopy (H-1, B-11, and
   Al-27) which involves formation of a complex between a halo-BsubPc and
   AlCl3 (which we denote BsubPc(Cl)center dot Al(Cl')(3)). Our
   observations indicate that the action of phenol on BsubPc(Cl)center dot
   Al(Cl')(3) does not involve direct reaction at the boron atom; rather
   phenol first reacts at the aluminum atom along the way to the formation
   of a new intermediate complex BsubPc(OPh)center dot Al(O'Ph)(3). The
   consequence is that the rate of this process is independent of the
   nature of the starting BsubPc. Cl-BsubPc and Br-BsubPc as well as
   BsubPcs with peripheral substitutents all react to form their respective
   phenoxy derivatives at the same rate. Quenching of BsubPc(OPh)center dot
   Al(O'Ph)(3) with a Lewis base ultimately produces a new bond between the
   phenol nucleophile and the boron atom of the BsubPc.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of extensional strain and strain
   rates on the foamability of PS-talc composite. Foaming processes were
   observed in situ for PS-talc composites with different surface
   treatment, size, and weight content of talc under extensional stress.
   Talc with the largest particle size produced the highest cell densities
   despite its lower talc particle density for heterogeneous nucleation.
   Meanwhile, the surface treatment seemed to slightly improve the talc's
   dispersion, but it did not cause significant differences in their
   foaming characteristics. The enhanced cell nucleation that took place
   with the larger talc was due to the higher tensile stresses generated
   around them in the presence of other growing bubble as compared to those
   around smaller talc particles. As the level of the applied extensional
   strain and/or the strain rate increased, the cell density increased
   significantly in all cases, and the cell density differences became
   smaller, especially when the talc content was high. The extensional
   stress caused the decrease of local pressure needed to induce nucleation
   around the smaller talc particles, so the effects of talc size became
   less apparent. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   scaled-up, takes advantage of the tailored physical properties of PLA
   and the plasticizing effect of the supercritical blowing agent. Three
   grades of PLA with different molecular weight and branching topology are
   used. The processing parameters are optimized based on the
   well-characterized thermal and rheological properties of PLAs and
   diffusion properties of PLA/CO2 mixture. In general, melt strength
   governs cell morphology, with cell density, closed-cell content, and
   expansion ratio increasing as a function of both molecular weight and
   branching density. Influences of shearing and dissolved-CO2 on
   crystallization of PLA are characterized and they are believed to induce
   crystallinity in the foams. In the case of branched PLA, crystallization
   allows high-expansion-ratio microcellular foams to be stably produced
   over a wide temperature window. By controlling crystallinity, foams with
   similar cell morphology but varied mechanical properties and surface
   gloss are also produced. X-ray diffraction of the foams confirms that
   crystallization is governed by shearing in the die, and the crystallites
   are mainly of alpha-form. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Increasing Entanglement Monotones by Separable Operations}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Quantum entanglement is fundamentally related to the operational setting
   of local quantum operations and classical communication (LOCC). A more
   general class of operations known as separable operations (SEP) is often
   employed to approximate LOCC, but the exact difference between LOCC and
   SEP is unknown. In this letter, we compare the two classes in performing
   particular tripartite to bipartite entanglement conversions and report a
   gap as large as 12.5\% between SEP and LOCC, which is the first known
   appreciable gap between the classes. Our results rely on constructing a
   computable entanglement monotone with a clear operational meaning that,
   unlike all other such monotones previously studied, is not monotonic
   under SEP. Finally, we prove the curious fact that convergent sequences
   of LOCC protocols need not be LOCC feasible in the limit.}},

Title = {{Structure and activity of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa hotdog-fold
   thioesterases PA5202 and PA2801}},
Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{444}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{445-455}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{The hotdog fold is one of the basic protein folds widely present in
   bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Many of these proteins exhibit
   thioesterase activity against fatty acyl-CoAs and play important roles
   in lipid metabolism, cellular signalling and degradation of xenobiotics.
   The genome of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa contains
   over 20 genes encoding predicted hotdog-fold proteins, none of which
   have been experimentally characterized. We have found that two P
   aeruginosa hotdog proteins display high thioesterase activity against
   3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA and glutaryl-CoA (PA5202), and
   octanoyl-CoA (PA2801). Crystal structures of these proteins were solved
   (at 1.70 and 1.75 angstrom for PA5202 and PA2801 respectively) and
   revealed a hotdog fold with a potential catalytic carboxylate residue
   located on the long a-helix (Asp(57) in PA5202 and G1u(35) in PA2801).
   Alanine residue replacement mutagenesis of PA5202 identified four
   residues (Asn(42), Arg(43), Asp(57) and Thr(76)) that are critical for
   its activity and are located in the active site. A P aeruginosa PA5202
   deletion strain showed an increased secretion of the antimicrobial
   pigment pyocyanine and an increased expression of genes involved in
   pyocyanin biosynthesis, suggesting a functional link between PA5202
   activity and pyocyanin production. Thus the P aeruginosa hotdog
   thioesterases PA5202 and PA2801 have similar structures, but exhibit
   different substrate preferences and functions.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the interfacial properties of carbon
   nanotube (CNT) reinforced polymer composites by simulating a nanotube
   pull-out experiment. An atomistic description of the problem is achieved
   by implementing constitutive relations that are derived solely from
   interatomic potentials. Specifically, we adopt the Lennard-Jones (Li)
   interatomic potential to simulate a non-bonded interface, where only the
   van der Waals (vdW) interactions between the CNT and surrounding polymer
   matrix are assumed to exist. The effects of such parameters as the CNT
   embedded length, the number of vdW interactions, the thickness of the
   interface, the CNT diameter and the cut-off distance of the LJ potential
   on the interfacial shear strength (ISS) are investigated and discussed.
   The problem is formulated for both a generic thermoset polymer and a
   specific two-component epoxy based on a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A
   (DGEBA) and triethylene tetramine (TETA) formulation. The study further
   illustrates that by accounting for different CNT capping scenarios and
   polymer morphologies around the embedded end of the CNT, the qualitative
   correlation between simulation and experimental pull-out profiles can be
   improved. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Quantitative classification of pediatric swallowing through
   accelerometry}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Dysphagia or swallowing disorder negatively impacts a
   child's health and development. The gold standard of dysphagia detection
   is videofluoroscopy which exposes the child to ionizing radiation, and
   requires specialized clinical expertise and expensive
   institutionally-based equipment, precluding day-to-day and repeated
   assessment of fluctuating swallowing function. Swallowing accelerometry
   is the non-invasive measurement of cervical vibrations during swallowing
   and may provide a portable and cost-effective bedside alternative. In
   particular, dual-axis swallowing accelerometry has demonstrated
   screening potential in older persons with neurogenic dysphagia, but the
   technique has not been evaluated in the pediatric population.
   Methods: In this study, dual-axis accelerometric signals were collected
   simultaneous to videofluoroscopic records from 29 pediatric participants
   (age 6.8 +/- 4.8 years; 20 males) previously diagnosed with neurogenic
   dysphagia. Participants swallowed 3-5 sips of barium-coated boluses of
   different consistencies (normally, from thick puree to thin liquid) by
   spoon or bottle. Videofluoroscopic records were reviewed retrospectively
   by a clinical expert to extract swallow timings and ratings. The
   dual-axis acceleration signals corresponding to each identified swallow
   were pre-processed, segmented and trimmed prior to feature extraction
   from time, frequency, time-frequency and information theoretic domains.
   Feature space dimensionality was reduced via principal components.
   Results: Using 8-fold cross-validation, 16-17 dimensions and a support
   vector machine classifier with an RBF kernel, an adjusted accuracy of
   89.6\% +/- 0.9 was achieved for the discrimination between swallows with
   and with out airway entry.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that dual-axis accelerometry has merit
   in the non-invasive detection of unsafe swallows in children and

Abstract = {{FGF21 stimulates FGFR1c activity in cells that co-express Klotho beta
   (KLB); however, relatively little is known about the interaction of
   these receptors at the plasma membrane. We measured the dynamics and
   distribution of fluorescent protein-tagged KLB and FGFR1c in living
   cells using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and number and
   brightness analysis. We confirmed that fluorescent protein-tagged KLB
   translocates to the plasma membrane and is active when co-expressed with
   FGFR1c. FGF21-induced signaling was enhanced in cells treated with
   lactose, a competitive inhibitor of the galectin lattice, suggesting
   that lattice-binding modulates KLB and/or FGFR1c activity. Fluorescence
   recovery after photobleaching analysis consistently revealed that
   lactose treatment increased KLB mobility at the plasma membrane, but did
   not affect the mobility of FGFR1c. The association of endogenous KLB
   with the galectin lattice was also confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation
   with galectin-3. KLB mobility increased when co-expressed with FGFR1c,
   suggesting that the two receptors form a heterocomplex independent of
   the galectin lattice. Number and brightness analysis revealed that KLB
   and FGFR1c behave as monomers and dimers at the plasma membrane,
   respectively. Co-expression resulted in monomeric expression of KLB and
   FGFR1c consistent with formation of a 1:1 heterocomplex. Subsequent
   addition of FGF21 induced FGFR1 dimerization without changing KLB
   aggregate size, suggesting formation of a 1:2 KLB-FGFR1c signaling
   complex. Overall, these data suggest that KLB and FGFR1 form a 1:1
   heterocomplex independent of the galectin lattice that transitions to a
   1:2 complex upon the addition of FGF21.}},

Title = {{Effect of molecular weight distribution on polymer diffusion during film
   formation of two-component high-/low-molecular weight latex particles}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{2652-2663}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{We describe fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies of
   film formation by a new type of two-component latex particles. These
   particles consist of a miscible blend of two components that have a
   similar composition but very different molecular weights. In our
   approach, we used sequential seeded emulsion polymerization to generate
   (in situ) a fraction of oligomer in poly(butyl acrylate-co-methyl
   methacrylate) P(BA-MMA) seed particles that contained a relatively high
   molecular weight (high-M) dye-labeled polymer. In this way we could
   systematically change the molecular weight distribution of polymer
   inside the particles. We varied the amount and the molecular weight of
   the oligomers. For latex films cast from these two-component particles,
   we studied the diffusion rate of the high molecular weight polymer by
   FRET. These measurements revealed that oligomers promoted diffusion rate
   during latex film formation (oligoplasticization). We analyzed our
   diffusion data in terms of the Fujita-Doolittle free-volume model and
   showed that higher molecular weight oligomers are less efficient as
   plasticizers. In separate experiments, oligomers with similar molecular
   weights as those in the two-component particles were introduced via
   latex blending. We compared oligoplasticization in latex blends films
   with that in the two-component particles films. Finally, we investigated
   the rheological behavior of the two-component polymers with compositions
   adjusted to have a common T-g (2 degrees C). The higher the molecular
   weight of the oligomer, the more that had to be added to achieve T-g = 2
   degrees C. All of the oligomers were much shorter than the entanglement
   length and act as diluents of the entanglements in the high-M polymer.
   We found that incorporating larger amounts of oligomers with a higher
   molecular weight resulted in a more pronounced drop in polymer
   viscosity, associated with the decrease in the entanglement density. (c)

Title = {{Perfluoroalkyl Contaminants in Lake Ontario Lake Trout: Detailed
   Examination of Current Status and Long-Term Trends}},

Abstract = {{Perfluoroalkyl contaminants (PFCs) were determined in Lake Ontario Lake
   Trout sampled annually between 1997 and 2008 in order to assess how
   current trends are responding to recent regulatory bans and voluntary
   phase-outs. We also combined our measurements with those of a previous
   study to provide an updated assessment of long-term trends.
   Concentrations of PFCs generally increased from the late 1970s until the
   mid-1980s to mid-1990s, after which concentrations either remained
   unchanged (perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorocarboxylates)
   or declined (perfluorodecanesulfonate (PFDS)). The temporal trends were
   assessed using three models, quadratic, exponential rise to maximum, and
   two-segment linear piecewise function, and then evaluated for best fit
   using Akaike Information Criteria. For PFOS and perfluorocarboxylates,
   the exponential rise to maximum function had the best fit. This is
   particularly interesting for PFOS as it suggests that although
   concentrations in Lake Ontario Lake Trout may have stopped increasing in
   response to voluntary phase-outs in 2000-2002, declines have yet to be
   observed. This may be due to continuing input of PFOS from products
   still in use and/or slow degradation of larger precursor molecules. A
   power analysis of PFOS suggested that 15 years of data with a
   within-year sample size of 10 is required to obtain sufficient power
   (80\%) to detect a 5\% decreasing trend. However, the length of the
   monitoring program had a greater influence on the ability to detect a
   trend compared to within-year sample size. This provides evidence that
   additional sampling years are required to detect a response to bans and
   phase-outs, given the variability in the fish data. The lack of observed
   declines of perfluorocarboxylate residues in fish may be expected as
   regulations for these compounds were only recently enacted. In contrast
   to the other compounds, the quadratic model had the best fit for PFDS.
   The results of this study emphasize the importance of long-term
   monitoring for assessing the effectiveness of bans and phase-outs on
   PFCs in the environment.}},

Title = {{Implications of Driving Patterns on Well-to-Wheel Performance of Plug-in

Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{6363-6370}},

Abstract = {{This study examines how driving patterns (distance and conditions) and
   the electricity generation supply interact to impact well-to-wheel (WTW)
   energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of plug-in hybrid electric
   vehicles (PHEVs). The WTW performance of a PHEV is compared with that of
   a similar (nonplug-in) gasoline hybrid electric vehicle and internal
   combustion engine vehicle (ICEV). Driving PHEVs for short distances
   between recharging generally results in lower WTW total and fossil
   energy use and GHG emissions per kilometer compared to driving long
   distances, but the extent of the reductions depends on the electricity
   supply. For example, the shortest driving pattern in this study with
   hydroelectricity uses 81\% less fossil energy than the longest driving
   pattern. However, the shortest driving pattern with coal-based
   electricity uses only 28\% less fossil energy. Similar trends are
   observed in reductions relative to the nonplug-in vehicles. Irrespective
   of the electricity supply, PHEVs result in greater reductions in WTW
   energy use and GHG emissions relative to ICEVs for city than highway
   driving conditions. PHEVs charging from coal facilities only reduce WTW
   energy use and GHG emissions relative to ICEVs for certain favorable
   driving conditions. The study results have implications for
   environmentally beneficial PHEV adoption and usage patterns.}},

   logic-based Benders decomposition. Computational experiments demonstrate
   that the Benders model is able to find and prove optimal solutions up to
   three orders-of-magnitude faster than an existing integer programming

Title = {{Automated treatment planning for a dedicated multi-source intracranial

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this work is to develop a framework to the
   inverse problem for radiosurgery treatment planning on the Gamma Knife
   (R) Perfexion (TM) (PFX) for intracranial targets.
   Methods: The approach taken in the present study consists of two parts.
   First, a hybrid grassfire and sphere-packing algorithm is used to obtain
   shot positions (isocenters) based on the geometry of the target to be
   treated. For the selected isocenters, a sector duration optimization
   (SDO) model is used to optimize the duration of radiation delivery from
   each collimator size from each individual source bank. The SDO model is
   solved using a projected gradient algorithm. This approach has been
   retrospectively tested on seven manually planned clinical cases
   (comprising 11 lesions) including acoustic neuromas and brain
   metastases.
   Results: In terms of conformity and organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing, the
   quality of plans achieved with the inverse planning approach were, on
   average, improved compared to the manually generated plans. The mean
   difference in conformity index between inverse and forward plans was
   -0.12 (range: -0.27 to +0.03) and +0.08 (range: 0.00-0.17) for classic
   and Paddick definitions, respectively, favoring the inverse plans. The
   mean difference in volume receiving the prescribed dose (V-100) between
   forward and inverse plans was 0.2\% (range: -2.4\% to +2.0\%). After
   plan renormalization for equivalent coverage (i.e., V-100), the mean
   difference in dose to 1 mm(3) of brainstem between forward and inverse
   plans was -0.24 Gy (range: -2.40 to +2.02 Gy) favoring the inverse
   plans. Beam-on time varied with the number of isocenters but for the
   most optimal plans was on average 33 min longer than manual plans
   (range: -17 to +91 min) when normalized to a calibration dose rate of
   3.5 Gy/min. In terms of algorithm performance, the isocenter selection
   for all the presented plans was performed in less than 3 s, while the
   SDO was performed in an average of 215 min.
   Conclusions: PFX inverse planning can be performed using geometric
   isocenter selection and mathematical modeling and optimization
   techniques. The obtained treatment plans all meet or exceed clinical
   guidelines while displaying high conformity. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the effects of
   auditory and visual distractions on pedestrian ambulation. A fundamental
   temporal characteristic of ambulation is the temporal fluctuation of the
   stride interval. In this paper, we investigate the stationarity of
   stride interval time series when people are exposed to different forms
   of auditory and visual distractions. An increase in nonstationary
   behavior may be suggestive of divided attention and more frequent
   central modulation of locomotion, both of which may have ramifications
   on pedestrian vigilance and responsiveness to environmental
   perturbations. One group of fifteen able-bodied (6 females) young adult
   participants completed a music protocol (overground walking with and
   without music). A second group of fifteen (7 females) did a television
   protocol (treadmill walking while watching TV with and without sound).
   Three walking trials, each 15 min in duration, were performed at each
   participant's comfortable walking speed, with force sensitive resistors
   under the heel of each foot. Using the reverse arrangements test, the
   vast majority of time series were nonstationary, with a time-varying
   mean as the principal source of nonstationarity. Furthermore, the
   television trial with sound had the greatest number of nonstationarities
   followed by overground walking while listening to music. We discuss the
   possibility that these conditions measurably affect gait dynamics
   through a subconscious synchronization to external rhythms or a cyclic
   distraction followed by a period of increased conscious correction of
   gait timing. Our findings suggest that the regulation of stride timing
   is particularly susceptible to constant, time-evolving auditory stimuli,
   but that normal pacing can be restored quickly upon stimulus withdrawal.
   These kinds of sensory distractions should thus be carefully considered
   in studies of pedestrian ambulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Dielectric particles flowing through a microfluidic channel over a set
   of coplanar electrodes can be simultaneously capacitively detected and
   dielectrophoretically (DEP) actuated when the high (1.45 GHz) and low
   (100 kHz-20 MHz) frequency electromagnetic fields are concurrently
   applied through the same set of electrodes. Assuming a simple model in
   which the only forces acting upon the particles are apparent gravity,
   hydrodynamic lift, DEP force, and fluid drag, actuated particle
   trajectories can be obtained as numerical solutions of the equations of
   motion. Numerically calculated changes of particle elevations resulting
   from the actuation simulated in this way agree with the corresponding
   elevation changes estimated from the electronic signatures generated by
   the experimentally actuated particles. This verifies the model and
   confirms the correlation between the DEP force and the electronic
   signature profile. It follows that the electronic signatures can be used
   to quantify the actuation that the dielectric particle experiences as it
   traverses the electrode region. Using this principle, particles with
   different dielectric properties can be effectively identified based
   exclusively on their signature profile. This approach was used to
   differentiate viable from non-viable yeast cells (Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae). (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Mammalian cells reprogrammed with engineered transgenes have the
   potential to be useful therapeutic platforms because they can support
   large genetic networks, can be taken from a host or patient, and perform
   useful functions such as migration and secretion. Successful engineering
   of mammalian cells will require the development of modules that can
   perform well-defined, reliable functions, such as directed cell
   migration toward a chemical or physical signal. One inherently modular
   cellular pathway is the Ca2+ signaling pathway: protein modules that
   mobilize and respond to Ca2+ are combined across cell types to create
   complexity. We have designed a chimera of Rac1, a GTPase that controls
   cell morphology and migration, and calmodulin (CaM), a Ca2+-responsive
   protein, to control cell migration. The Rac1-CaM chimera (named RACer)
   controlled lamellipodia growth in response to Ca2+. RACer was combined
   with LOVS1K (a previously engineered light-sensitive Ca2+-mobilizing
   module) and cytokine receptors to create protein networks where blue
   light and growth factors regulated cell morphology and, thereby, cell
   migration. To show the generalizability of our design, we created a
   Cdc42-CaM chimera that controls filopodia growth in response to Ca2+.
   The insights that have been gained into Ca2+ signaling and cell
   migration will allow future work to combine engineered protein systems
   to enable reprogrammed cell sensing of relevant therapeutic targets in
   vivo.}},

Journal = {{CEMENT AND CONCRETE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{769-777}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Reactive MgO is produced at a lower kiln temperature compared to
   ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and gains its physical properties mainly
   as a result of carbonation processes. Use of reactive MgO as cement
   replacement has recently gained attention in context with precast
   concrete products subjected to carbonation curing. This study
   investigates pastes containing 0-40\% reactive MgO and the effect of
   accelerated carbonation curing on the: formation of new carbonate
   phases, microstructural development, and microhardness. Outcomes from
   this study revealed that the primary Ca and Mg-bearing carbonates formed
   are calcite, aragonite, magnesium calcite, and nesquehonite. The
   combined effect of carbonation and reactive MgO resulted in: a reduction
   in pore size and total pore volume, increase in apparent density, and
   greater microhardness compared to OPC paste. The chemical processes, and
   physical properties revealed that the dense inter-connected network
   structure consisting of Ca and Mg carbonates is a significant factor
   that influences the microhardness. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1632-1637}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Arterial geometry has long been considered as a pragmatic alternative
   for inferring arterial flow disturbances, and their impact on the
   natural history and treatment of vascular diseases. Traditionally,
   definition of geometric variables is based on convenient shape
   descriptors, with only superficial consideration of their influence on
   flow and wall shear stress patterns. In the present study we demonstrate
   that a more studied consideration of the actual (cf. nominal) local
   hemodynamics can lead to substantial improvements in the prediction of
   disturbed flow by geometry. Starting from a well-characterized
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) dataset of 50 normal carotid
   bifurcations, we observed that disturbed flow tended to be confined
   proximal to the flow divider, whereas geometric variables previously
   shown to be significant predictors of disturbed flow included features
   distal to the flow divider in their definitions. Flaring of the
   bifurcation leading to flow separation was redefined as the maximum
   relative expansion of the common carotid artery (CCA), proximal to the
   flow divider. The beneficial effect of primary curvature on flow
   inertia, via suppression of flow separation, was characterized by the
   in-plane tortuosity of CCA as it enters the flare region. Multiple
   linear regressions of these redefined geometric variables against
   various metrics of disturbed flow revealed R-2 values approaching 0.6,
   better than the roughly 0.3 achieved using the conventional shape-based
   variables, while maintaining their demonstrated real-world
   reproducibility. Such a hemodynamically-inspired approach to the
   definition of geometric variables may reap benefits for other
   applications where geometry is used as a surrogate marker of local
   hemodynamics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A comprehensive three-dimensional dynamic model of the human head and

   upper body kinematics}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL ENGINEERING \& PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Linked-segment representations of human body dynamics have been used
   extensively in biomechanics, ergonomics, and rehabilitation research to
   systemize thinking, make predictions, and suggest novel experiments. In
   the scope of upper body biomechanics, these models play an even more
   essential role as the human spine dynamics are difficult to study in
   vivo. No study exists to date, however, that specifically disseminates
   the technical details of a comprehensive three-dimensional model of the
   upper body for the purpose of estimating spinal joint torques and forces
   for a wide range of scenarios. Consequently, researchers are still bound
   to develop and implement their own models. Therefore, the objective of
   this study was to design a dynamic model of the upper body that can
   comprehensively estimate spinal joint torques and forces from upper body
   kinematics. The proposed three-dimensional model focuses on the actions
   of the lumbar and cervical vertebrae and consists of five lumbar
   segments (L1 to L5), the thorax, six cervical segments (C2 to C7), and
   the head. Additionally, the model: (1) is flexible regarding the
   kinematic nature of the spinal joints (free, constrained, or fixed); (2)
   incorporates all geometric and mass-inertia parameters from a single,
   high-resolution source; and (3) can be feasibly implemented via
   different inverse dynamics formulations. To demonstrate its
   practicality, the model was finally employed to estimate the lumbar and
   cervical joint torques during perturbed sitting using experimental
   motion data. Considering the growing importance of mathematical
   predictions, the developed model should become an important resource for
   researchers in different fields. (C) 2011 IPEM. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The breakdown failure mechanisms for a family of power AlGaN/GaN HEMTs
   were studied. These devices were fabricated using a commercially
   available MMIC/RF technology with a semi-insulating SiC substrate. After
   a 10 min thermal annealing at 425 K, the transistors were subjected to
   temperature dependent electrical characteristics measurement. Breakdown
   degradation with a negative temperature coefficient of -0.113 V/K for
   the devices without field plate was found. The breakdown voltage is also
   found to be a decreasing function of the gate length. Gate current
   increases simultaneously with the drain current during the drain-voltage
   stress test. This suggests that the probability of a direct leakage
   current path from gate to the 2-DEG region. The leakage current is
   attributed by a combination of native and generated traps/defects
   dominated gate tunneling, and hot electrons injected from the gate to
   channel. Devices with field plate show an improvement in breakdown
   voltage from 40 V (with no field plate) to 138 V and with lower negative
   temperature coefficient. A temperature coefficient of similar to 0.065
   V/K was observed for devices with a field plate length of 1.6 mu m. (C)

Title = {{Are transit users loyal? Revelations from a hazard model based on smart

Volume = {{39}},

Pages = {{610-618}},

Abstract = {{Smart card fare collection systems for public transit produce a huge
   quantity of data on a daily basis. The ability to follow the use of a
   single card throughout the months gives the opportunity of measuring the
   loyalty of the individual to the service. Then, operators can have
   quantitative knowledge of the loyalty in their network. However, it is
   also important to know what are the factors that influence the survival
   of the users. This paper presents the application of a discrete time
   hazard model to 5 years of data of a medium-size transit authority in
   Canada. The concept of the hazard model relates to the fact that the
   probability to continue the use of a smart card by user i, at time t, is
   conditional to the probability of not cancelling the card before the
   time period. Hence, its use is appropriate in this case. Results for the
   regular adult fare show that loyalty is positively influenced by
   residential density and by the transit share in the area. A younger
   population will also be retained longer in the system. However, a high
   unemployment rate has a negative impact on survival. A high share of
   transit and walk trips is also affecting the loyalty, suggesting that
   the retention is reduced when there are more mode choices available to
   the commuter.}},

Abstract = {{As high-rise buildings increase with height and slenderness, they become
   increasingly sensitive to dynamic vibrations, and therefore the natural
   frequency of vibration and damping ratio are very important design
   parameters, as they directly impact the design wind forces. Recent
   advances in sensing and computing technology have made it possible to
   monitor the dynamic behaviour of full-scale structures, which was not
   possible in the past. Full-scale validation of the dynamic properties is
   useful for high-rise designers to verify design assumptions, especially
   since recent measurements have shown that damping decreases as the
   height of the building increases, and in situ damping measurements have
   been lower than many currently assumed design values, potentially
   leading to unconservative designs. A 50-storey residential building in
   downtown Toronto, with a reinforced concrete coupled shear wall lateral
   load resisting system with outriggers was monitored using current
   state-of-the-art sensing technologies and techniques to determine, in
   situ, the dynamic properties under real wind loads. The in situ
   measurements were then compared with results obtained using current
   state-of-the-art computer modelling techniques.}},

   multiple reactant sizes in a wide range of electrolyte conditions. There
   was a clear impact of reactant size on the critical size at which

Journal = {{NANO LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3043-3049}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Multijunction devices consist of a stack of semi-conductor junctions
   having bandgaps tuned across a broad spectrum. In solar cells this
   concept is used to increase the efficiency of photovoltaic harvesting,
   while light emitters and detectors use it to achieve multicolor and
   spectrally tunable behavior. In series-connected current-matched
   multijunction devices, the recombination layers must allow the hole
   current from one cell to recombine, with high efficiency and low voltage
   loss, with the electron current from the next cell. We recently reported
   a tandem solar cell in which the recombination layer was implemented
   using a progression of n-type oxides whose doping densities and work
   functions serve to connect, with negligible resistive loss at solar
   current densities, the constituent cells. Here we present the
   generalized conditions for design of efficient graded recombination
   layer solar devices. We report the number of interlayers and the
   requirements on work function and doping of each interlayer, to bridge
   an work function difference as high as 1.6 eV. We also find solutions
   that minimize the doping required of the interlayers in order to
   minimize optical absorption due to free carriers in the graded
   recombination layer (GRL). We demonstrate a family of new GRL designs
   experimentally and highlight the benefits of the progression of dopings
   and work functions in the interlayers.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by biological communication systems, molecular communication
   has been proposed as a viable scheme to communicate between nano-sized

   communication system focusing on the release of either one or two
   molecules into a fluid medium with drift. We analyze the mutual
   information between transmitter and the receiver when information is
   encoded in the time of release of the molecule. Simplifying assumptions
   are required in order to calculate the mutual information, and
   theoretical results are provided to show that these calculations are
   upper bounds on the true mutual information. Furthermore, optimized
   degree distributions are provided, which suggest transmission strategies

Abstract = {{A thermal spray coating process was used to deposit dense 2 mm thick
   metal skins on the surfaces of square cross-section channels (300 mm x
   20 mm x 20 mm) of nickel and copper foams with 10 and 40 PPI (pores per
   inch) pore densities. A heater was wrapped around the channels to apply
   surface heat-fluxes varying from 427 to 6846 W/m(2). Compressed air was
   blown through the channels at flow rates of 5-80 l/min. Foam and fluid
   temperature distributions along the length of the channel and the
   pressure drop across it were measured. The foam was modeled as a porous
   medium and properties such as permeability K and inertial coefficient
   C-F were determined from the experimental data. Local and average
   convective heat transfer coefficients were calculated from air and foam
   temperature measurements. Nusselt numbers were calculated and correlated
   in terms of the Reynolds, Prandtl, and Darcy numbers. Heat transfer to
   air flowing through a 10 PPI foam channel was shown to have increased
   nearly seven times compared to that of hollow tube with the same
   dimensions. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006015]}},

Pages = {{302-316}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Cities and urban regions are undertaking efforts to quantify greenhouse
   (GHG) emissions from their jurisdictional boundaries. Although
   inventorying methodologies are beginning to standardize for GHG sources,
   carbon sequestration is generally not quantified. This article describes
   the methodology and quantification of gross urban carbon sinks. Sinks
   are categorized into direct and embodied sinks. Direct sinks generally
   incorporate natural process, such as humification in soils and
   photosynthetic biomass growth (in urban trees, perennial crops, and
   regional forests). Embodied sinks include activities associated with
   consumptive behavior that result in the import and/or storage of carbon,
   such as landfilling of waste, concrete construction, and utilization of
   durable wood products. Using methodologies based on the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2006 guidelines (for direct
   sinks) and peer-reviewed literature (for embodied sinks), carbon
   sequestration for 2005 is calculated for the Greater Toronto Area.
   Direct sinks are found to be 317 kilotons of carbon (kt C), and are
   dominated by regional forest biomass. Embodied sinks are calculated to
   be 234 kt C based on one year's consumption, though a complete life
   cycle accounting of emissions would likely transform this sum from a
   carbon sink to a source. There is considerable uncertainty associated
   with the methodologies used, which could be addressed with city-specific
   stock-change measurements. Further options for enhancing carbon sink
   capacity within urban environments are explored, such as urban biomass
   growth and carbon capture and storage.}},

   the new design relies on total internal reflection from the upper
   cladding and Bragg reflection from the lower periodic cladding.
   Analytical expressions for modal analysis of TE- and TM-polarized Bragg
   modes are derived. An AlxGa1-xAs second-harmonic generation device is
   theoretically examined to highlight nonlinear performance of the new
   design, and it is compared to symmetric phase-matched BRWs reported to

Abstract = {{Clinical utilization of tissue-engineered cartilage constructs has been
   limited by their inferior mechanical properties compared to native
   articular cartilage. A number of strategies have been investigated to
   increase the accumulation of major extracellular matrix components
   within in vitro-formed cartilage, including the administration of growth
   factors and mechanical stimulation. In this study, the anabolic effect
   of inorganic polyphosphates, a linear polymer of orthophosphate residues
   linked by phosphoanhydride bonds, was demonstrated in both chondrocyte
   cultures and native articular cartilage cultured ex vivo. Compared to
   untreated controls, polyphosphate treatment of three-dimensional primary
   chondrocyte cultures induced increased glycosaminoglycan and collagen
   accumulation in a concentration-and chain length-dependent manner. This
   effect was transient, because chondrocytes express exopolyphosphatases
   that hydrolyze polyphosphate. The anabolic effect of polyphosphates was
   accompanied by a lower rate of DNA increase within the chondrocyte
   cultures treated with inorganic polyphosphate. Inorganic polyphosphate
   enhances cartilage matrix accumulation and is a promising approach to
   improve the quality of tissue-engineered cartilage constructs.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless power transfer is commonly realized by means of near-field
   inductive coupling and is critical to many existing and emerging
   applications in biomedical engineering. This paper presents a closed
   form analytical solution for the optimum load that achieves the maximum
   possible power efficiency under arbitrary input impedance conditions
   based on the general two-port parameters of the network. The two-port
   approach allows one to predict the power transfer efficiency at any
   frequency, any type of coil geometry and through any type of media
   surrounding the coils. Moreover, the results are applicable to any form
   of passive power transfer such as provided by inductive or capacitive
   coupling. Our results generalize several well-known special cases. The
   formulation allows the design of an optimized wireless power transfer
   link through biological media using readily available EM simulation
   software. The proposed method effectively decouples the design of the
   inductive coupling two-port from the problem of loading and power
   amplifier design. Several case studies are provided for typical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this study a distributed maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) has been
   presented to estimate ML function of traffic flow and mean traffic speed
   in a freeway. This algorithm uses traffic measurements including volume,
   occupancy and mean speed which gathered by some inductive loop
   detectors. These traffic detectors (traffic sensors) located in certain
   distances in the freeway network such that they establish a distributed
   sensor network (DSN). The presented distributed estimator has employed a
   distributed expectation maximisation algorithm to calculate MLE. In the
   E-step of this algorithm, each sensor node independently calculates
   local sufficient statistics by using local observations. A consensus
   filter is used to diffuse local sufficient statistics to neighbours and
   estimate global sufficient statistics in each node. In the M-step of
   this algorithm, each sensor node uses the estimated global sufficient
   statistics to update model parameters of the Gaussian mixtures, which
   can maximise the log-likelihood in the same way as in the standard EM
   algorithm. As the consensus filter only requires each node to
   communicate with its neighbours, the distributed algorithm is scalable
   and robust. A set of field traffic data from Minnesota freeway network
   has been used to simulate and verify the proposed distributed estimator
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{The information on heat of oxidation-reduction reactions is important
   for the heat balance and optimization of the autoclave design in the
   hydrometallurgical industry in ore processing. Pyrite (FeS2) is a gangue
   mineral that presents with nickel-containing pentlandite, and
   copper-containing chalcopyrite minerals. The presence of pyrite impacts
   to the overall heat of leaching process. This study has been performed
   on a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC80, Setaram) with a
   commercial mixing cell to study the thermal behaviour of pure pyrite
   FeS2 (Valdenegrillos, Spain) mineral particles during oxidative pressure
   leaching at 150 A degrees C and partial oxygen pressure of 3.4 MPa. A
   calorimetric method for determining the enthalpy of leaching of sulphide
   minerals at high temperatures and oxygen pressures has been used to
   evaluate the enthalpies of oxidation of freshly ground pyrite and pyrite
   stored for a year in contact with air (stored pyrite) under conditions
   relevant to pressure oxidation operations. Ground pyrite stored over
   time has long since been known to result in greater heat evolution
   during oxidative leaching. A likely mechanism for this phenomenon was
   uncovered: formation of ferrous sulphate and sulphuric acid during
   storage in contact with air influencing greater heat evolution at the
   outset of the reaction. Two mass loss steps on TG curve of stored
   pyrite, attributed to the elimination of atmospheric moisture and H2O
   molecule from FeSO4 center dot H2O, is absent on TG curve of freshly
   ground pyrite.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to design proteins with desired properties by using protein
   structural information will allow us to create high-value therapeutic
   and diagnostic products. Using the protein structures of lambda lysozyme
   and the SH3 domain of human Crk, we designed a synthetic protein switch
   that controls the activity of lysozyme by sterically hindering its
   active cleft through the binding of SH3 to its CB1 peptide-binding
   partner. First, several fusion protein designs with lysozyme and CB1
   were modeled to determine the one with greatest steric effect in the
   presence of SH3. Next, the selected fusion protein was created and
   tested in vitro. In the absence of SH3, the lysozyme-CB1 fusion protein
   functioned normally. In the presence of SH3, the lysozyme activity was
   inhibited and with the addition of excess CB1 peptides to compete for
   SH3 binding, the lysozyme activity was restored. Lastly, this
   structure-based strategy can be used to engineer synthetic regulation by
   peptide-domain-binding interfaces into a variety of proteins.}},

Abstract = {{With the growing size of modern designs and more strict time-to-market
   constraints, design errors can unavoidably escape pre-silicon
   verification and reside in silicon prototypes. Due to those errors and
   faults in the fabrication process, silicon debug has become a necessary
   step in the digital integrated circuit design flow. Embedded hardware
   blocks, such as scan chains and trace buffers, provide a means to
   acquire data of internal signals in real time for debugging. However,
   the amount of the data is limited compared to pre-silicon debugging.
   This paper presents an automated software solution to analyze this
   sparse data to detect suspects of the failure in both the spatial and
   temporal domain. It also introduces a technique to automate the
   configuration process for trace-buffer-based hardware in order to
   acquire helpful information for debugging the failure. The technique
   takes the hardware constraints into account and identifies alternatives
   for signals not part of the traceable set so that their values can be
   restored by implications. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed software solution in terms of run-time and resolution.}},

Abstract = {{Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) comprises a heterogeneous condition
   caused by a complex array of mechanical forces that damage the spinal
   cord making each case somewhat unique. In addition to parenchymal
   injury, a subset of patients experience severe inflammation in the
   subarachnoid space or arachnoiditis, which can lead to the development
   of fluid-filled cavities/syringes, a condition called post-traumatic
   syringomyelia (PTS). Currently, there are no therapeutic means to
   address this devastating complication in patients and furthermore once
   PTS is diagnosed, treatment is often prone to failure. We hypothesized
   that reducing subarachnoid inflammation using a novel bioengineered
   strategy would improve outcome in a rodent model of PTS. A hydrogel of
   hyaluronan and methyl cellulose (HAMC) was injected into the
   subarachnoid space 24 h post PTS injury in rats. Intrathecal injection
   of HAMC reduced the extent of fibrosis and inflammation in the
   subarachnoid space. Furthermore, HAMC promoted improved neurobehavioural
   recovery, enhanced axonal conduction and reduced the extent of the
   lesion as assessed by MRI and histomorphometric assessment. These
   findings were additionally associated with a reduction in the
   post-traumatic parenchymal fibrous scar formation as evidenced by
   reduced CSPG deposition and reduced IL-1 alpha cytokine levels. Our data
   suggest that HAMC is capable of modulating inflammation and scarring
   events, leading to improved functional recovery following severe SCI
   associated with arachnoiditis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Structural coatings of nanocrystalline metal can significantly enhance
   the mechanical properties of microtruss cellular materials, creating new
   types of cellular composites. This study investigated the optimal
   architectural design under a compressive load for stretch-formed low
   carbon steel cores reinforced with similar to 20 nm grain size
   nanocrystalline Ni-35 wt\%Fe. During stretch-forming, the struts in the
   starting perforated low carbon steel sheet are elongated and thinned as
   higher internal truss angles are formed, leading to an optimal internal
   truss angle. While a nanocrystalline coating enhances the weight
   specific mechanical properties of an optimally designed conventional
   microtruss, the resulting composite microtruss becomes sub-optimal since
   the optimal internal truss angle changes with coating thickness. A strut
   design framework was therefore developed to determine the optimal truss
   angle for a given combination of starting material, reinforcing
   material, sheet geometry, and coating thickness. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper proposes and develops a new distributed slack bus (DSB)
   model, in the sequence-components frame, for power-flow analysis of an
   islanded active distribution network (ADN) dominated by electronically
   coupled distributed energy resource (DER) units. The power-flow analysis
   distributes the system slack among several participating sources since,
   unlike the grid-connected systems, the reference bus DER unit is
   anticipated to have a limited power capacity. The main application of
   the DSB model is for a fast power-flow analysis of an islanded ADN to
   enable its real-time energy management and prevent DER capacity
   violation in between two consecutive optimal power-flow runs. Unlike the
   existing DSB models, the proposed model incorporates i) the
   participation of DER units with different control strategies (PQ and PV)
   in the system real and reactive slack compensation and ii) the DER power
   capacity limits. Based on a new definition of the ``participating
   sources,{''} the power-flow equations are augmented to incorporate the
   system real and reactive power slack as state variables. The proposed
   DSB formulation is incorporated in a sequence-frame power-flow solver
   (SFPS). Case studies are conducted to evaluate the impacts of adopting
   the proposed DSB model in the SFPS tool.}},

Abstract = {{In the nanometer era of VLSI design, high power consumption is
   considered to be a ``show-stopper{''} for many applications. Voltage
   island design has emerged as a popular method for addressing this issue.
   This technique requires multiple supply voltages on the same chip with
   blocks assigned to different supply voltages. Implementation challenges
   force blocks with similar supply voltages to be placed contiguous to one
   another, thereby creating ``islands{''}. Classical floorplanners assume
   a single supply voltage in the entire chip and thus require additional
   design steps to realize voltage islands. In this paper we present a new
   multi-objective floorplanning algorithm based on the sequence pair
   representation that can floorplan blocks in the form of islands. Given
   the possible supply voltage choices for each block, the floorplanner
   simultaneously attempts to reduce power and area of the chip. Our
   floorplanner integrates the tasks of assigning blocks to different
   supply voltages and the placing of the blocks in the chip. Compared to
   previous work, the proposed floorplanner on average reduces the area
   overhead of the chip by 13.5\% with 34\% runtime improvement. As power
   and area are jointly optimized, we also explore the trade-off between
   these cost functions. Experimental results show that equal weight to
   area and power cost function do not provide the best floorplan solution.

Abstract = {{Objectives. This study evaluated catechin and chlorhexidine release from
   copolymers based on bis-GMA diluted with TEGDMA (R1), propoxylated
   bis-GMA-CH(3)bis-GMA (R2) or fluorinated bis-GMA-CF(3)bis-GMA (R3).
   Mechanical properties, degree of conversion, water sorption and
   solubility were also tested.
   Methods. Experimental comonomers (R1, R2, R3) were prepared combining
   bis-GMA with the diluents (70/30 mol\%). Each comonomer had either
   catechin or chlorhexidine incorporated in the following ratios: 0, 0.2,
   1.0, 2.0 wt\%. The degree of conversion (\% DC) of resins was evaluated
   by FT-IR spectrophotometry (n = 3). Flexural strength and elastic
   modulus were tested on a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed
   of 0.5 mm/min (n = 6). Resin disks (7 mm in diameter x 2 mm high) were
   immersed in deionized water and mass changes recorded daily. Spectral
   measurements were made to follow any changes in optical densities of
   deionized water in order to examine catechin and chlorhexidine release
   rates (n = 6). After a 28-day period, water sorption and solubility were
   calculated using appropriate equations (n = 6). Data within the tests
   were evaluated by one- and three-way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer's test
   (alpha = 0.05).
   Results. Except for R1 with 2.0\% drug none of the groups had changes in
   degree of conversion and water sorption. Solubility increased with
   increased drug ratios. Changes in flexural strength and elastic modulus
   were shown to be variable and material-dependent. All resins presented a
   similar to 24 h burst of drug release. Release rates were drug-ratio
   dependent and significantly higher for chlorhexidine than for catechin.
   Significance. Monomer type, \% DC, drug ratio and type lead to different
   interactions between resins and chlorhexidine/catechin drug particles.
   It should be possible to develop different resins based on clinical
   needs. (c) 2012 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Electrical double-layer capacitors owe their large capacitance to the
   formation of a double-layer at the electrode/electrolyte interface of
   high surface area carbon-based electrode materials. Greater electrical

   oxides/nitrides that undergo fast, reversible redox reactions at the
   electrode surface (pseudo-capacitive behavior) in addition to forming
   electrical double-layers. Solution Precursor Plasma Spray (SPPS) has
   shown promise for depositing porous, high surface area transition metal
   oxides. This investigation explored the potential of SPPS to fabricate
   alpha-MoO3 coatings with micro-structures suitable for use as

Abstract = {{Conventional hysteresis modeling of piezoelectric actuators using
   interferometers or capacitive sensors is often performed off-line.
   However, the hysteresis of the piezoelectric actuator changes as the
   load acting on it or the driving frequency of the input signal alters,
   demanding that the hysteresis of the micromanipulator be modeled on the
   fly. The employment of interferometers or capacitive sensors is a
   challenging task in micromanipulation systems due to their special
   requirements, e. g., the micropipette tip is desired to provide
   mirror-like reflection of the incoming beam if an interferometer is
   employed while a capacitive sensor might not be easily placed in the
   workspace. An automatic Prandtl-Ishlinskii hysteresis modeling method is
   proposed and implemented using vision-feedback. The method can be
   conducted on the fly in real time making it suitable for time critical
   vision-guided micromanipulation, while providing comparable accuracy
   with that of using interferometers.}},

   found meeting criteria and are included in this review which reports on
   structural, regional perfusion, metabolic and receptor binding imaging
   modalities assessing delusions as a whole, as well as persecutory and
   misidentification delusional subtypes. The majority of studies implicate
   right-sided pathology, primarily frontal lobe. Left-frontal predominance
   and release, secondary to right-sided pathology, may create a
   hyperinferential state resulting in the formation of delusions. This
   perturbation and imbalance of normal networks is associated with
   delusional phenomenology. Temporal lobe structures are also important in
   misidentification syndromes, which have a different natural history than
   paranoid delusions. Consistent with the neuropathological and genetic
   literature, neuroimaging has shown that paranoid versus
   misidentification delusions are associated with different phenomenology
   and different neural substrates. Delusional subtype is an important
   factor in understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of delusions
   in dementia. We also discuss methodological issues related to
   neuroimaging of delusions in AD. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Progress in cardiac cell replacement therapies and tissue engineering
   critically depends on our ability to isolate functional cardiomyocytes
   (CMs) from heterogeneous cell mixtures. Label-free enrichment of
   cardiomyocytes is desirable for future clinical application of cell
   based products. Taking advantage of the physical properties of CMs, a
   microfluidic system was designed to separate CMs from neonatal rat heart
   tissue digest based on size using the principles of deterministic
   lateral displacement (DLD). For the first time, we demonstrate
   enrichment of functional CMs up to 91 +/- 2.4\% directly from the
   digested heart tissue without any pre-treatment or labeling. Enriched
   cardiomyocytes remained viable after sorting and formed contractile
   cardiac patches in 3-dimensional culture. The broad significance of this
   work lies in demonstrating functional cell enrichment from the primary
   tissue digest leading directly to the creation of the engineered tissue.}},

Title = {{Fluctuating inhibitory inputs promote reliable spiking at theta
   frequencies in hippocampal interneurons}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{Theta-frequency (4-12 Hz) rhythms in the hippocampus play important
   roles in learning and memory. CA1 interneurons located at the stratum
   lacunosum-moleculare and radiatum junction (LM/RAD) are thought to
   contribute to hippocampal theta population activities by rhythmically
   pacing pyramidal cells with inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. This
   implies that LM/RAD cells need to fire reliably at theta frequencies in
   vivo. To determine whether this could occur, we use biophysically based
   LM/RAD model cells and apply different cholinergic and synaptic inputs
   to simulate in vivo-like network environments. We assess spike
   reliabilities and spiking frequencies, identifying biophysical
   properties and network conditions that best promote reliable theta
   spiking. We find that synaptic background activities that feature large
   inhibitory, but not excitatory, fluctuations are essential. This
   suggests that strong inhibitory input to these cells is vital for them
   to be able to contribute to population theta activities. Furthermore, we
   find that Type I-like oscillator models produced by augmented persistent
   sodium currents (I-NaP) or diminished A-type potassium currents (I-A)
   enhance reliable spiking at lower theta frequencies. These Type I-like
   models are also the most responsive to large inhibitory fluctuations and
   can fire more reliably under such conditions. In previous work, we
   showed that I-NaP and I-A are largely responsible for establishing
   LM/RAD cells' subthreshold activities. Taken together with this study,
   we see what while both these currents are important for subthreshold
   theta fluctuations and reliable theta spiking, they contribute in
   different ways - I-NaP to reliable theta spiking and subthreshold
   activity generation, and I-A to subthreshold activities at theta
   frequencies. This suggests that linking subthreshold and suprathreshold
   activities should be done with consideration of both in vivo contexts
   and biophysical specifics.}},

Abstract = {{Tunneling junctions having the structure
   Ag-TS-S(CH2)(n-1)CH3//Ga2O3/EGaIn allow physical-organic studies of
   charge transport across self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). In ambient
   conditions, the surface of the liquid metal electrode (EGaIn, 75.5 wt \%
   Ga, 24.5 wt \% In, mp 15.7 degrees C) oxidizes and adsorbs-like other
   high-energy surfaces-adventitious contaminants. The interface between
   the EGaIn and the SAM thus includes a film of metal oxide, and probably
   also organic material adsorbed on this film; this interface will
   influence the properties and operation of the junctions. A combination
   of structural, chemical, and electrical characterizations leads to four
   conclusions about Ag-TS-S(CH2)(n-1)CH3//Ga2O3/EGaIn junctions. (i) The
   oxide is similar to 0.7 nm thick on average, is composed mostly of
   Ga2O3, and appears to be self-limiting in its growth. (ii) The structure
   and composition (but not necessarily the contact area) of the junctions
   are conserved from junction to junction. (iii) The transport of charge
   through the junctions is dominated by the alkanethiolate SAM and not by
   the oxide or by the contaminants. (iv) The interface between the oxide
   and the eutectic alloy is rough at the micrometer scale.}},

Title = {{Genomic determinants of organohalide-respiration in Geobacter lovleyi,
   an unusual member of the Geobacteraceae}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{MAY 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Geobacter lovleyi is a unique member of the Geobacteraceae
   because strains of this species share the ability to couple
   tetrachloroethene (PCE) reductive dechlorination to
   cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) with energy conservation and growth
   (i.e., organohalide respiration). Strain SZ also reduces U(VI) to U(IV)
   and contributes to uranium immobilization, making G. lovleyi relevant
   for bioremediation at sites impacted with chlorinated ethenes and
   radionuclides. G. lovleyi is the only fully sequenced representative of
   this distinct Geobacter clade, and comparative genome analyses
   identified genetic elements associated with organohalide respiration and
   elucidated genome features that distinguish strain SZ from other members
   of the Geobacteraceae.
   Results: Sequencing the G. lovleyi strain SZ genome revealed a 3.9 Mbp
   chromosome with 54.7\% GC content (i.e., the percent of the total
   guanines (Gs) and cytosines (Cs) among the four bases within the
   genome), and average amino acid identities of 53-56\% compared to other
   sequenced Geobacter spp. Sequencing also revealed the presence of a 77
   kbp plasmid, pSZ77 (53.0\% GC), with nearly half of its encoded genes
   corresponding to chromosomal homologs in other Geobacteraceae genomes.
   Among these chromosome-derived features, pSZ77 encodes 15 out of the 24
   genes required for de novo cobalamin biosynthesis, a required cofactor
   for organohalide respiration. A plasmid with 99\% sequence identity to
   pSZ77 was subsequently detected in the PCE-dechlorinating G. lovleyi
   strain KB-1 present in the PCE-to-ethene-dechlorinating consortium KB-1.
   Additional PCE-to-cis-DCE-dechlorinating G. lovleyi strains obtained
   from the PCE-contaminated Fort Lewis, WA, site did not carry a plasmid
   indicating that pSZ77 is not a requirement (marker) for PCE respiration
   within this species. Chromosomal genomic islands found within the G.
   lovleyi strain SZ genome encode two reductive dehalogenase (RDase)
   homologs and a putative conjugative pilus system. Despite the loss of
   many c-type cytochrome and oxidative-stress-responsive genes, strain SZ
   retained the majority of Geobacter core metabolic capabilities,
   including U(VI) respiration.
   Conclusions: Gene acquisitions have expanded strain SZ's respiratory
   capabilities to include PCE and TCE as electron acceptors. Respiratory
   processes core to the Geobacter genus, such as metal reduction, were
   retained despite a substantially reduced number of c-type cytochrome
   genes. pSZ77 is stably maintained within its host strains SZ and KB-1,
   likely because the replicon carries essential genes including genes
   involved in cobalamin biosynthesis and possibly corrinoid transport.
   Lateral acquisition of the plasmid replicon and the RDase genomic island
   represent unique genome features of the PCE-respiring G. lovleyi strains
   SZ and KB-1, and at least the latter signifies adaptation to PCE
   contamination.}},

Abstract = {{A quantum random number generator (QRNG) can generate true randomness by
   exploiting the fundamental indeterminism of quantum mechanics. Most
   approaches to QRNG employ single-photon detection technologies and are
   limited in speed. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an ultrafast QRNG
   at a rate over 6 Gbits/s based on the quantum phase fluctuations of a
   laser operating near threshold. Moreover, we consider a potential
   adversary who has partial knowledge on the raw data and discuss how one
   can rigorously remove such partial knowledge with post-processing. We
   quantify the quantum randomness through min-entropy by modeling our
   system and employ two randomness extractors - Trevisan's extractor and
   Toeplitz-hashing - to distill the randomness, which is
   information-theoretically provable. The simplicity and high-speed of our
   experimental setup show the feasibility of a robust, low-cost,
   high-speed QRNG. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally demonstrate the direct generation of
   polarization-entangled photon pairs in an optical fiber at room
   temperature by exploiting type-II phase-matched spontaneous parametric
   down-conversion. A second-order nonlinearity is artificially induced in
   the 17-cm-long weakly birefringent step-index fiber through the process
   of thermal poling, and quasi-phase-matching allows for the generation of
   entangled photons in the 1.5-micron telecom band when the fiber is
   pumped at 775 nm. A greater-than 80: 1 coincidence-to-accidental ratio
   is achieved, limited mainly by multiphoton pair generation. Without the
   need to subtract accidentals or to compensate for walk-off, the raw
   two-photon interference visibility is found to be better than 95\%, and
   violation of Bell's inequality is observed by more than 18 standard
   deviations. This makes for a truly alignment-free, plug-and-play source
   of polarization-entangled photon pairs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the multi-pulse global bifurcations and chaotic
   dynamics for the nonlinear, non-planar oscillations of the
   parametrically excited viscoelastic moving belt using an extended
   Melnikov method in the resonant case. Using the Kelvin-type viscoelastic
   constitutive law and Hamilton's principle, the equations of motion are
   derived for the viscoelastic moving belt with the external damping and
   parametric excitation. Applying the method of multiple scales and
   Galerkin's approach to the partial differential governing equation, the
   four-dimensional averaged equation is obtained for the case of 1:1
   internal resonance and primary parametric resonance. From the averaged
   equations obtained, the theory of normal form is used to derive the
   explicit expressions of normal form with a double zero and a pair of
   pure imaginary eigenvalues. Based on the explicit expressions of normal
   form, the extended Melnikov method is used for the first time to
   investigate the Shilnikov-type multi-pulse homoclinic bifurcations and
   chaotic dynamics. The paper demonstrates how to employ the extended
   Melnikov method to analyze the Shilnikov-type multi-pulse homoclinic
   bifurcations and chaotic dynamics of high-dimensional nonlinear systems
   in engineering applications. Numerical simulations show that for the
   nonlinear non-planar oscillations of the viscoelastic moving belt, the
   Shilnikov-type multi-pulse chaotic motions can occur. Overall, both
   theoretical and numerical studies suggest that the chaos for the Smale
   horseshoe sense in motion exists. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, the catalytic activity and hydrogen selectivity of
   Ni/alpha-Al2O3, Ni/hydrotalcite, Raney nickel, Ru/C and Ru/gamma-Al2O3
   catalysts for hydrothermal hydrogen production from lignocellulosic
   biomass have been evaluated. The feedstocks included glucose, cellulose,
   fructose, xylan, pulp, lignin and bark The experiments were carried out
   at 380 degrees C in a batch reactor with 2 wt\% feed concentration. It
   was found that the gasification of glucose, fructose, cellulose, xylan
   and pulp resulted in comparable gas yields (+/- 10\% at 60 min), whereas
   lignin was substantially harder to gasify. Interestingly, gasification
   yield of bark which has a high lignin content was comparable to those of
   carbohydrates after 60 min reaction time. For a given feedstock,
   catalyst type affected both the gasification yield and the product
   distribution. Ni/alpha-Al2O3 and Ni/hydrotalcite catalysts were not only
   highly active for the gasification of carbohydrates, but also had better
   hydrogen selectivity when compared to Raney nickel, Ru/C and
   Ru/gamma-Al2O3. In particular, gasification of bark in the presence of
   these catalysts resulted in negligible amounts of alkanes. (c) 2012

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{84}},

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Time-of-flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) is a surface
   analysis technique that is herein demonstrated to be a viable tool for
   the detection of enzyme activity on solid substrates. Proof-of-principle
   experiments are presented that utilize commercial cellulase and laccase
   enzymes, which are known to modify major polymeric components of wood
   (i.e., cellulose and lignin, respectively). Enzyme activity is assessed
   through principle component analysis (PCA) as well as through peak
   ratios intended to measure selective enzymatic wood degradation.
   Spectral reproducibility of the complex wood substrates is found to be
   within 5\% relative standard deviation (RSD), allowing for relative
   quantification of changes in wood composition. Procedures are also
   presented to identify and avoid the influence of mass interferences from
   protein adsorption by the enzyme solutions. The activity of a cellulase
   cocktail is clearly evident through the TOF-SIMS spectra and is
   supported by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements of
   sugar release and by complementary X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS) measurements of the wood surfaces. Laccase activity, which is
   mediated through small organic molecules, can be detected in the
   TOF-SIMS spectra through a decrease in G and S lignin peaks. This work
   has positive implications for the development of qualitative,
   high-throughput screening assays for enzyme activity on industrially
   relevant, lignocellulosic substrates.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effect of copper corrosion products,
   including Cu(II), Cu2O, CuO and Cu-2(OH)(2)CO3, on chlorine degradation,
   HAA formation, and HAA speciation under controlled experimental
   conditions. Chlorine decay and HAA formation were significantly enhanced
   in the presence of copper with the extent of copper catalysis being
   affected by the solution pH and the concentration of copper corrosion
   products. Accelerated chlorine decay and increased HAA formation were
   observed at pH 8.6 in the presence of 1.0 mg/L Cu(II) compared with that
   observed at pH 6.6 and pH 7.6. Further investigation of chlorine decay
   in the presence of both Suwannee River NOM and Cu(II) indicated that an
   increased reactivity of NOM with dissolved and/or solid
   surface-associated Cu(II), rather than chlorine auto-decomposition, was
   a primary reason for the observed rapid chlorine decay. Copper corrosion
   solids {[}Cu2O, CuO, Cu-2(OH)(2)CO3] exhibited catalytic effects on both
   chlorine decay and HAA formation. Contrary to the results observed when
   in the absence of copper corrosion products, DCAA formation was
   consistently predominant over other HAA species in the presence of
   copper corrosion products, especially at neutral and high pH. This study
   improves the understanding for water utilities and households regarding
   chlorine residuals and HAA concentrations in distribution systems, in
   particular once the water reaches domestic plumbing where copper is
   widely used. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Boronsubphthalocyanine (BsubPc) derivatives are materials that have
   recently seen an increase in attention, particularly for application as

   However, the solubilities of most BsubPc derivatives are too low to
   utilize solution-based processing techniques. Where there are
   derivatives that are soluble, they rely on the addition of large alkyl
   chains for solubilization the result of which is an increase in the
   molecular weight and a decrease of the specific absorptivity of the
   BsubPc. In this paper we disclose the identity of two mass-efficient,
   highly soluble BsubPc derivatives: 3-methylphenoxy-BsubPc and
   3,4-dimethylphenoxy-BsubPc. We compare their solubilities and crystal
   packing structures to previously known BsubPc derivatives. We put
   forward a symmetry-based argument for the reason for their surprisingly
   high solubility wherein we treat the molecules as two separate
   fragments: the phenoxy group and the BsubPc group. The symmetry-based
   argument suggests that by ignoring the BsubPc fragment common to each
   derivative a better estimate of the relative solubilities can be
   estimated through previously established empirical formulas.}},

Abstract = {{Few data address the role of human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in
   the management of chronic ischaemic heart failure. We assessed their
   effect in immune-deficient animals. MSCs were cultured from bone marrow
   of human volunteers. Non-obese diabetes severe combined immunodeficiency
   (NOD/SCID) gamma null mice were randomly assigned to intramyocardial
   injection of human MSCs or phosphate-buffered saline 4 weeks after
   induction of acute myocardial infarction (MI). Echocardiography was
   performed 4 weeks after MI and 1 and 4 weeks after injection. Donor cell
   chimerism was assessed by DNA for human Alu sequences 2 and 4 weeks
   after injection. Histological assessment and quantification of
   neovascularization were determined 4 weeks after treatment. Donor MSCs
   at frequencies of 0.006 and 0.001\% were present 2 and 4 weeks after
   cell injection, respectively. The infarcted ventricular wall was
   significantly thicker in the cohort receiving MSCs compared with control
   mice. There was no difference in fractional shortening, left ventricular
   dimensions or scar area between the groups. Small vessel density was
   also similar between the groups. Human MSCs increased the thickness of
   the infarcted ventricular wall without improving cardiac function in
   this chronic ischaemic heart failure model. Further studies are required
   to assess the benefit of MSCs in this setting.}},

Title = {{Design of an mHealth App for the Self-management of Adolescent Type 1
   Diabetes: A Pilot Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{171-183}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: The use of mHealth apps has shown improved health outcomes
   in adult populations with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, this has
   not been shown in the adolescent type 1 population, despite their
   predisposition to the use of technology. We hypothesized that a more
   tailored approach and a strong adherence mechanism is needed for this
   group.
   Objective: To design, develop, and pilot an mHealth intervention for the
   management of type 1 diabetes in adolescents.
   Methods: We interviewed adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their
   family caregivers. Design principles were derived from a thematic
   analysis of the interviews. User-centered design was then used to
   develop the mobile app bant. In the 12-week evaluation phase, a pilot
   group of 20 adolescents aged 12-16 years, with a glycated hemoglobin
   (HbA(1c)) of between 8\% and 10\% was sampled. Each participant was
   supplied with the bant app running on an iPhone or iPod Touch and a
   LifeScan glucometer with a Bluetooth adapter for automated transfers to
   the app. The outcome measure was the average daily frequency of blood
   glucose measurement during the pilot compared with the preceding 12
   weeks.
   Results: Thematic analysis findings were the role of data collecting
   rather than decision making; the need for fast, discrete transactions;
   overcoming decision inertia; and the need for ad hoc information
   sharing. Design aspects of the resultant app emerged through the
   user-centered design process, including simple, automated transfer of
   glucometer readings; the use of a social community; and the concept of
   gamification, whereby routine behaviors and actions are rewarded in the
   form of iTunes music and apps. Blood glucose trend analysis was provided
   with immediate prompting of the participant to suggest both the cause
   and remedy of the adverse trend. The pilot evaluation showed that the
   daily average frequency of blood glucose measurement increased 50\%
   (from 2.4 to 3.6 per day, P = .006, n = 12). A total of 161 rewards
   (average of 8 rewards each) were distributed to participants.
   Satisfaction was high, with 88\% (14/16 participants) stating that they
   would continue to use the system. Demonstrating improvements in HbA(1c)
   will require a properly powered study of sufficient duration.
   Conclusions: This mHealth diabetes app with the use of gamification
   incentives showed an improvement in the frequency of blood glucose
   monitoring in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Extending this to
   improved health outcomes will require the incentives to be tied not only
   to frequency of blood glucose monitoring but also to patient actions and
   decision making based on those readings such that glycemic control can
   be improved.}},

Abstract = {{Carotid angioplasty and stenting is a minimally invasive endovascular
   procedure that may benefit from in vivo high resolution imaging for
   monitoring the physical placement of the stent and potential
   complications. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the
   ability of optical coherence tomography to construct high resolution 2D
   and 3D images of stenting in porcine carotid artery. Four Yorkshire pigs
   were anaesthetized and catheterized. A state-of-the-art optical
   coherence tomography (OCT) system and an automated injector were used to
   obtain both healthy and stented porcine carotid artery images. Data
   obtained were then processed for visualization. The state-of-the-art OCT
   system was able to capture high resolution images of both healthy and
   stented carotid arteries. High quality 3D images of healthy and stented
   carotid arteries were constructed, clearly depicting vessel wall
   morphological features, stent apposition and thrombus formation over the
   inserted stent. The results demonstrate that OCT can be used to generate
   high quality 3D images of carotid arterial stents for accurate diagnosis

Abstract = {{An aqueous extraction process (AEP) was developed for dehulled yellow
   mustard flour with the aim of producing yellow mustard oil for
   industrial applications, as a by-product of food protein production.
   During AEP, most of the oil extracted was bound in a stable oil-in-water
   emulsion that must be destabilized to recover free oil. The oil
   distribution after aqueous extraction and the composition of the
   emulsion produced were determined. The emulsion was solubilized in
   organic solvents including tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 1,4-dioxane to
   fully recover the oil in a single-phase oil-solvent-water miscella. Over
   97 and 95\% of the oil in the emulsion was successfully recovered using
   4:1 THF:oil and 9:1 dioxane:oil weight ratios, respectively. The oil
   recovery from the emulsion was optimized, based on experimentally
   prepared ternary phase diagrams of THF/oil/water and dioxane/oil/water.

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamic forces generated by an orifice plate under low pressure
   were examined as a means of disrupting flocs, in order to improve
   disinfection of treated wastewater effluents. Changes in cavitation
   conditions were found to have little impact on the extent of particle
   breakage in this experimental setup. The rate of strain (flow rate
   divided by the hole radius cubed), however, was found to be the best
   predictor of floc breakage. Floc breakage was not affected by changes in
   floc concentration, but was very sensitive to differences between flocs
   collected from different sources. Larger flocs (90 to 106 mm) were
   broken apart to a greater extent than smaller ones (53 to 63 mm).
   Hydrodynamic treatment decreased the viability of bacteria associated
   with large flocs, and also increased the ultraviolet dose response by up
   to one log unit (i.e., a factor of ten). Subjecting final effluent
   wastewaters to hydrodynamic treatment, therefore, provides a treatment
   strategy for conditions in which the presence of flocs limits the level
   of disinfection that can be achieved. Water Environ. Res., 84, 387

Abstract = {{A broader activation of auditory nerve fibres than normal using a
   cochlear implant contributes to poor frequency discrimination. As
   cochlear implants also deliver a restricted dynamic range, this hinders
   the ability to segregate sound sources. Better frequency coding and
   control over amplitude may be achieved by limiting current spread during
   electrical stimulation of the cochlea and positioning electrodes closer
   to the modiolus. Thin-film high density microelectrode arrays and
   conventional platinum ring electrode arrays were used to stimulate the
   cochlea of urethane-anaesthetized rats and responses compared.
   Neurophysiological recordings were taken at 197 multi-unit clusters in
   the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CIC), a site that
   receives direct monaural innervation from the cochlear nucleus. CIC
   responses to both the platinum ring and high density electrodes were
   recorded and differences in activity to changes in stimulation
   intensity, thresholds and frequency coding of neural activation were
   examined. The high density electrode array elicited less CIC activity at
   nonspecific frequency regions than the platinum ring electrode array.
   The high density electrode array produced significantly lower thresholds
   and larger dynamic ranges than the platinum ring electrode array when
   positioned close to the modiolus. These results suggest that a higher
   density of stimulation sites on electrodes that effectively `aim'
   current, combined with placement closer to the modiolus would permit
   finer control over charge delivery. This may equate to improved
   frequency specific perception and control over amplitude when using
   future cochlear implant devices. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The complex configurations of dynamic friction patterns, regarding
   real-time contact areas, are transformed into appropriate networks. In
   this letter, we analyze the dynamics of static friction, i.e. nucleation
   processes, with respect to friction networks. We show that networks can
   successfully capture the crack-like shear ruptures and possible
   corresponding acoustic features. We found that the fraction of triangles
   scales remarkably with the detachment fronts. There is a universal power
   law between nodes' degrees and motifs' frequencies (for triangles, it
   reads T(k) k proportional to k(beta) (beta approximate to 2 +/- 0.4)).
   In particular, the evolutions of loops are scaled with power law,
   indicating the aggregation of cycles around hub nodes. Furthermore, the
   motif distributions and modularity space of networks -in terms of
   within-module degrees and participation coefficients- show universal
   trends, indicating a common aspect of energy flow in shear ruptures.
   Moreover, we confirmed that slow ruptures generally hold small
   localization, while regular ruptures carry a high level of energy
   localization. We proposed that assortativity, as an index to correlation
   of a node's degree, can uncover acoustic features of the interfaces.

Title = {{Non-linear vibration of hyperelastic axisymmetric solids by a mixed

Abstract = {{This paper presents finite amplitude transient vibration analysis of
   nearly incompressible hyperelastic axisymmetric solids by a mixed p-type
   method. In this method, displacement and pressure fields are separately
   defined using high degree polynomials and the solution is obtained with
   one or a few elements depending upon the nature of the problem. Geometry
   of the element is defined by polynomials of degrees much lower than that
   of displacement fields. The degrees of polynomials for pressure fields
   are lower than those used for displacement fields.
   Hyperelastic material is modelled by the Mooney-Rivlin material
   description. The total Lagrangian formulation is utilized to describe
   the deformations of axisymmetric solids subjected to pressure loads.
   Equations of motion are derived using the principle of virtual work and
   solved by the Newmark's method along with the Newton-Raphson iterative
   technique. The present formulation also includes the asymmetric tangent
   load matrix, resulting in linearization of deformation dependent load,
   which greatly reduces the number of equilibrium iterations to get the
   convergence of results at large strains.
   A convergence study of the results is presented with respect to the
   degrees of polynomials for displacement and pressure fields. The present
   method is verified by successfully comparing the results with those from
   finite element method using the commercial software ANSYS. The numerical
   simulations are conducted on circular plate, solid cylinder and
   spherical shells subjected to time dependent pressure loads and the
   highly non-linear behaviour of hyperelastic solids undergoing finite
   amplitude vibrations is studied. The method, presented herein, is very
   efficient, locking free, and accurate, which does not require a large
   number of elements or the total degrees of freedom as it is required in
   conventional finite element method for the convergence of results. (C)

   to hand-arm vibrations, which over time lead to numerous health
   complications. The objective of this study was to evaluate protective
   equipment and working techniques for the reduction of vibration
   exposure. Methods: Vibration transmissions were recorded during
   different work techniques: with one- and two-handed grip, while wearing
   protective gloves (standard, air and anti-vibration gloves) and while
   holding a foam-covered tool handle. The effect was examined by analyzing
   the reduction of transmitted vibrations at the wrist. The vibration
   transmission was recorded with a portable device using a triaxial
   accelerometer. Results: The results suggest large and significant
   reductions of vibration with appropriate safety equipment. Reductions of
   85.6\% were achieved when anti-vibration gloves were used. Conclusions:
   Our results indicated that transmitted vibrations were affected by
   several factors and could be measured and significantly reduced. (J

Abstract = {{Upper limb robotic rehabilitation devices can collect quantitative data
   about the user's movements. Identifying relationships between robotic
   sensor data and manual clinical assessment scores would enable more
   precise tracking of the time course of recovery after injury and reduce
   the need for time-consuming manual assessments by skilled personnel.
   This study used measurements from robotic rehabilitation sessions to
   predict clinical scores in a traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (SCI)
   population. A retrospective analysis was conducted on data collected
   from subjects using the Armeo Spring (Hocoma, AG) in three
   rehabilitation centers. Fourteen predictive variables were explored,
   relating to range-of-motion, movement smoothness, and grip ability.
   Regression models using up to four predictors were developed to describe
   the following clinical scores: the GRASSP (consisting of four
   sub-scores), the ARAT, and the SCIM. The resulting adjusted R-2 value
   was highest for the GRASSP ``Quantitative Prehension{''} component
   (0.78), and lowest for the GRASSP ``Sensibility{''} component (0.54). In
   contrast to comparable studies in stroke survivors, movement smoothness
   was least beneficial for predicting clinical scores in SCI. Prediction
   of upper-limb clinical scores in SCI is feasible using measurements from
   a robotic rehabilitation device, without the need for dedicated
   assessment procedures.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we examined the effect of electron tunneling upon the
   electrical conductivity of carbon nanotube (CNT) polymer nanocomposites.
   A CNT percolating network model was developed to account for the random
   distribution of the CNT network using Monte Carlo simulations, where the
   tunneling resistance between CNTs was established based on the electron
   transport theory. Our work shows several novel features that result from
   this tunneling resistance: (i) direct contact resistance is the result
   of one-dimensional electron ballistic tunneling between two adjacent
   CNTs, (ii) the nanoscale CNT-CNT contact resistance should be
   represented by the Landauer-Buttiker (L-B) formula, which accounts for
   both tunneling and direct contact resistances, and (iii) the difference
   in contact resistance between single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) and
   multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) can be modeled by the channel number in the
   L-B model. The model predictions reveal that the contact resistance due
   to electron tunneling effects in nanocomposites with dispersed SWCNTs
   plays a more dominant role than those with MWCNTs. These results compare
   favorably with existing experimental data and demonstrate that the
   proposed model can properly estimate the electrical conductivity of
   nanocomposites containing homogeneously dispersed percolating CNT
   network. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Temporal phase shifting interferometry is the most common method for
   characterization of surface, profile and displacement properties of
   micro devices. Common methods of phase shifting require piezoelectric
   material based devices that have inherent errors due to non-linearity.
   To avoid these errors during phase shifting, a new phase shifting
   technique is presented in this work. This technique utilizes the
   advantage of stroboscopic interferometry to create phase shifted images
   without requiring any additional component for phase shifting. The
   proposed method was used for surface profiling and static
   characterization of the microstructures. Static characterization was
   performed to identify the tip deflection and profile variation of the
   microcantilever in response to various DC voltages. A capacitor-based
   cantilever was tested under varied electrostatic loads and the
   deflection of the cantilever was extracted using the proposed method.
   The deflection of the cantilever was predicted using energy method.
   Static characterization results from the proposed technique were found
   to be in good agreement with the predicted results.}},

Abstract = {{Proteolytic digestion is an essential step in proteomic sample
   processing. While this step has traditionally been implemented in
   homogeneous (solution) format, there is a growing trend to use
   heterogeneous systems in which the enzyme is immobilized on hydrogels or
   other solid supports. Here, we introduce the use of immobilized enzymes
   in hydrogels for proteomic sample processing in digital microfluidic
   (DMF) systems. In this technique, preformed cylindrical agarose discs
   bearing immobilized trypsin or pepsin were integrated into DMF devices.
   A fluorogenic assay was used to optimize the covalent modification
   procedure for enzymatic digestion efficiency, with maximum efficiency
   observed at 31 mu g trypsin in 2-mm diameter agarose gel discs. Gel
   discs prepared in this manner were used in an integrated method in which
   proteomic samples were sequentially reduced, alkylated, and digested,
   with all sample and reagent handling controlled by DMF droplet
   operation. Mass spectrometry analysis of the products revealed that
   digestion using the trypsin gel discs resulted in higher sequence
   coverage in model analytes relative to conventional homogenous
   processing. Proof-of-principle was demonstrated for a parallel digestion
   system in which a single sample was simultaneously digested on multiple
   gel discs bearing different enzymes. We propose that these methods
   represent a useful new tool for the growing trend toward miniaturization
   and automation in proteomic sample processing.}},

Abstract = {{In formulating the stability problem for an infinite chain of cars,
   state space is traditionally taken to be the Hilbert space l(2), wherein
   the displacements of cars from their equilibria, or the velocities from

   displacements or velocity perturbations of cars that are far down the

Abstract = {{The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a hydrogel-like structure comprised of
   several different biopolymers, encompassing a wide range of biological,
   chemical, and mechanical properties. The composition, organization, and
   assembly of the ECM play a critical role in cell function. Cellular
   behavior is guided by interactions that occur between cells and their
   local microenvironment, and this interrelationship plays a significant
   role in determining physiological functions. Bioengineering approaches
   have been developed to mimic native tissue microenvironments by
   fabricating novel bioactive hydrogel scaffolds. This review explores
   material designs and fabrication approaches that are guiding the design
   of hydrogels as tissue engineered scaffolds. As the fundamental biology
   of the cellular microenvironment is often the inspiration for material
   design, the review focuses on modifications to control bioactive cues
   such as adhesion molecules and growth factors, and summarizes the
   current applications of biomimetic scaffolds that have been used in

Abstract = {{Electrokinetics (EK) has been used extensively to remove heavy metals
   from low permeability porous media. Electrokinetics (EK) or more
   specifically electrophoresis (EP) has also been proposed to enhance
   transport of nanoscale zero valent iron (NZVI) in fine grained porous
   media in the subsurface. However, increased dissolved oxygen and lower
   pH, due to electrolysis of water at the anode oxidizes NZVI particles
   and thus affects the remediation potential of EP with NZVI. This study
   focuses on minimization of NZVI oxidation and quantification of NZVI
   migration enhancement through the application of EP. Application of 50
   and 100 mA currents under constant current conditions with an oxygen
   scavenger enhanced NZVI transport from the cathode to the anode. The
   enhancement in transport compared to diffusion was proportional to the
   applied current. Predictions of a numerical model, based on traditional
   colloidal filtration theory (CFT), were consistent with experimental
   results. In developing the model, the traditional CFT based mass balance
   equation was modified for the case of no advection. This study suggests
   that EP has the potential to deliver NZVI in low permeability porous
   media and that the numerical simulator can be used to predict NZVI
   mobility with EP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Reaching to recover balance in unpredictable circumstances: Is online
   visual control of the reach-to-grasp reaction necessary or sufficient?}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{218}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{589-599}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Reaching to grasp an object for support is a common and functionally
   important response to sudden balance perturbation. The need to react
   very rapidly (to prevent falling) imposes temporal constraints on
   acquisition and processing of the visuospatial information (VSI) needed
   to guide the reaching movement. Previous results suggested that the CNS
   may deal with these constraints by using VSI stored in memory
   proactively, prior to perturbation onset; however, the extent to which
   online visual control is necessary or sufficient to guide these
   reactions has not been established. This study examined the speed,
   accuracy, and effectiveness of perturbation-evoked reach-to-grasp
   reactions when forced to rely entirely on either online- or stored-VSI
   by using liquid-crystal goggles to occlude vision either before or after
   perturbation onset. The reactions were evoked, in twelve healthy young
   adults, via sudden unpredictable antero-posterior platform translation
   (barriers deterred stepping reactions). Prior to perturbation onset, a
   small cylindrical handhold was positioned unpredictably (by a
   motor-driven device) at one of four locations in front of the subject.
   Results indicated that equilibrium could be recovered successfully by
   grasping the handhold using either online-VSI or stored-VSI to guide the
   arm reaction; however, both sources of VSI were required for optimal
   performance. Reach initiation and arm movement were slowed when
   dependent on online-VSI, whereas reach accuracy and grip formation were
   impaired when dependent on stored-VSI. Comparison with normal-VSI trials
   suggests that both sources of VSI are utilized when grasping a small
   handhold for support under normal visual conditions, with stored-VSI
   predominating during initiation/transport and online-VSI contributing
   primarily to final target acquisition/prehension.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a practical optical probe configuration capable of
   two-dimensional subdiffraction imaging beyond the conventionally used
   near-field range. The probe consists of a planar array of plasmonic
   monopoles radiating with different amplitudes and phases, such that the
   near-field interaction of the array elements produces a subdiffraction
   spot size 40\% smaller than the diffraction limit at a
   quarter-wavelength away from the probe. Although designed to operate in
   the visible, this topology is scalable to other spectra as well. Our
   proposed configuration could alleviate the ``working distance{''} issue
   between the object and imaging apparatus since it enables
   superresolution focusing at relatively long distances while being
   compatible with existing near-field imaging setups, such as scanning
   near-field optical microscopes. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{We describe derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from
   terminally differentiated mouse cells in serum- and feeder-free stirred
   suspension cultures. Temporal analysis of global gene expression
   revealed high correlations between cells reprogrammed in suspension and
   cells reprogrammed in adhesion-dependent conditions. Suspension
   culturere-programmed iPSCs (SiPSCs) could be differentiated into all
   three germ layers in vitro and contributed to chimeric embryos in vivo.
   SiPSC generation allowed for efficient selection of reprogramming
   factor-expressing cells based on their differential survival and
   proliferation in suspension culture. Seamless integration of SiPSC
   reprogramming and directed differentiation enabled scalable production
   of beating cardiac cells in a continuous single cell- and small
   aggregate-based process. This method is an important step toward the

Abstract = {{Elevations of cytosolic Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
   regulate a diverse range of cellular processes. When these luminal
   stores become depleted, the transmembrane ER protein Stim1 oligomerizes
   and translocates within the ER membrane to puncta junctions to couple
   with Orai1 channels, activating store-operated calcium entry (SOcE).
   Stim1 oligomerization and puncta formation have generally been
   associated with its luminal domains, however, studies have implicated
   that the cytoplasmic domains may contribute to this oligomerization.
   Studies have also suggested that intermediate or regulating elements may
   be required to fine-tune puncta formation and activation of SOCE. Here
   we made fusion proteins of Stim1 and Orai1 with FRB and FKBP12 domains
   that associate in the presence of rapamycin. Rapamycin-induced coupling
   of Stim1 to Stim1, Orai1 to Orai1 and Stim1 to Orai1 was found to be
   insufficient for puncta formation. Rapamycin was then used to recruit
   the cytosolic Ca2+ buffer protein parvalbumin (Pay) to stim1 in order to
   buffer the local cytosolic Ca2+ near the ER membrane. Interestingly. Pay
   buffering near the ER caused puncta formation that was indistinguishable
   from those caused by thapsigargin. Our results suggest that Stim1
   oligomerization and puncta formation may be additionally regulated
   either by local Ca2+ levels near the ER membrane or by as yet
   unidentified Ca2+-dependent proteins interacting with the cytoplasmic
   domains of Stim1. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A thin film coats impervious urban surfaces that can act as a source or
   sink of organic pollutants to the greater environment. We review recent
   developments in the understanding of film and film-associated pollutant
   behavior and incorporate them into an unsteady-state version of the
   fugacity based Multimedia Urban Model (MUM), focusing on detailed
   considerations of surface film dynamics. The model is used to explore
   the conditions under which these atmospherically-derived films act as a
   temporary source of chemicals to the air and/or storm water. Assuming
   film growth of 2.1 nm d(-1) (Wu et al., 2008a), PCB congeners 28 and 180
   reach air-film equilibrium within hours and days, respectively. The
   model results suggest that the film acts as a temporary sink of
   chemicals from air during dry and cool weather, as a source to air in
   warmer weather, and as a source to storm water and soil during rain
   events. Using the downtown area of the City of Toronto Canada, as a case
   study, the model estimates that nearly 1 g d(-1) of Sigma(5)PCBs are
   transferred from air to film to storm water. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death and
   hospitalization worldwide. The need for small caliber vessels (< 6mm) to
   treat CVD patients has grown; however the availability of autologous
   vessels in cardiac and peripheral bypass candidates is limited. The
   search for an alternative vessel source is widespread with both natural
   and synthetic tissue engineered materials being investigated as
   scaffolds. Despite decades of exhaustive studies with decellularized
   extracellular matrices (ECM) and synthetic graft materials, the field
   remains in search of a commercially viable biomaterial construct
   substitute. While the previous materials have been assessed by
   evaluating their compatibility with fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells and
   endothelial cells, current materials are being conceived based on their
   interactions with stem cells, progenitor cells and monocytes, as the
   latter may hold the key to repair and regeneration. The graft's ability
   to recruit and maintain these cells has become a major research focus.
   The successful tissue engineering of a small caliber vessel graft
   requires the use of optimal material chemistry and biological function
   to promote cell recruitment into the graft while maintaining each
   functional phenotype during vessel tissue maturation. The discussion of
   these significant research challenges constitutes the focus of this
   review.}},

Abstract = {{An AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) with a novel
   source-connected air-bridge field plate (AFP) is proposed. The device
   features a metal field plate (FP) that jumps from the source over the
   gate region and lands between the gate and drain. The fabrication
   process is based on a commercially available radio-frequency GaN-on-SiC
   technology. Device characteristics for this work were optimized via
   layout changes only. When compared to a similar-sized HEMT device with a
   conventional FP structure, the AFP not only minimizes the parasitic
   gate-to-source capacitance but also exhibits a higher OFF-state
   breakdown voltage and one order of magnitude lower drain leakage
   current. In a device with a gate-to-drain distance of 6 mu m and a gate
   length of 0.8 mu m, a three-times-higher forward blocking voltage of 375
   V was obtained at V-GS = -5 V. In contrast, a similar-sized HEMT with a
   conventional FP can only achieve a breakdown voltage no higher than 125
   V using this process, regardless of device dimensions. The specific
   on-resistance for the device with the proposed AFP is 0.58 m Omega .
   cm(2) at V-GS = 0 V, which compares favorably with 0.79 m Omega . cm(2)
   for the best device with a conventional FP.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the feasibility of producing microcellular foam by using
   homopolymer linear polypropylene with an melt flow index of 18 g/10 min,
   a high melt flow index coupling agent (G3003, melt flow index of 380
   g/min), and different nanoclay (Cloisite 20A) content was investigated.
   A twin-screw extruder was used to prepare the nanocomposite compounds,
   and an X-ray diffraction machine was used to characterize the
   intercalation and exfoliation of nanoclay within the matrix. A rheology
   test was undertaken to investigate the melt shear viscosity of the
   samples. A single-screw extruder was employed to produce foam by using
   5\% supercritical CO2 at various die temperatures. Scanning electron
   microscopy was used to explore the morphology of the foamed samples, and
   cell density was calculated by scanning electron microscopy images.
   Density measurement data was used to calculate the expansion ratio of
   the foamed samples. Extrusion foaming produced foams with high expansion
   ratios of about 20 and a high cell density of about 10(8-9) cells/cm(3).
   The crystallinity behavior of the foamed and unfoamed linear
   polypropylene and linear polypropylene nanocomposites was also
   investigated. A high-pressure differential scanning calorimetry was used
   to investigate the dependency of crystallization behavior on high
   pressure CO2.}},

Abstract = {{The science of quantum information has arisen over the last two decades
   centered on the manipulation of individual quanta of information, known
   as quantum bits or qubits. Quantum computers, quantum cryptography, and
   quantum teleportation are among the most celebrated ideas that have
   emerged from this new field. It was realized later on that using
   continuous-variable quantum information carriers, instead of qubits,
   constitutes an extremely powerful alternative approach to quantum
   information processing. This review focuses on continuous-variable
   quantum information processes that rely on any combination of Gaussian
   states, Gaussian operations, and Gaussian measurements. Interestingly,
   such a restriction to the Gaussian realm comes with various benefits,
   since on the theoretical side, simple analytical tools are available
   and, on the experimental side, optical components effecting Gaussian
   processes are readily available in the laboratory. Yet, Gaussian quantum
   information processing opens the way to a wide variety of tasks and
   applications, including quantum communication, quantum cryptography,
   quantum computation, quantum teleportation, and quantum state and
   channel discrimination. This review reports on the state of the art in
   this field, ranging from the basic theoretical tools and landmark
   experimental realizations to the most recent successful developments.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the environmental performance and discounted costs
   of the incineration and landfilling of municipal solid waste that is
   ready for the final disposal while accounting for existing waste
   diversion initiatives, using the life cycle assessment (LCA)
   methodology. Parameters such as changing waste generation quantities,
   diversion rates and waste composition were also considered. Two
   scenarios were assessed in this study on how to treat the waste that
   remains after diversion. The first scenario is the status quo, where the
   entire residual waste was landfilled whereas in the second scenario
   approximately 50\% of the residual waste was incinerated while the
   remainder is landfilled. Electricity was produced in each scenario. Data
   from the City of Toronto was used to undertake this study. Results
   showed that the waste diversion initiatives were more effective in
   reducing the organic portion of the waste, in turn, reducing the net
   electricity production of the landfill while increasing the net
   electricity production of the incinerator. Therefore, the scenario that
   incorporated incineration performed better environmentally and
   contributed overall to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas
   emissions because of the displacement of power plant emissions; however,
   at a noticeably higher cost. Although landfilling proves to be the
   better financial option, it is for the shorter term. The landfill option
   would require the need of a replacement landfill much sooner. The
   financial and environmental effects of this expenditure have yet to be
   considered. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, we describe an experimental and computational approach to
   perform quantitative carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester
   (CFSE) cell-division tracking in cultures of primary colony-forming
   unit-erythroid (CFU-E) cells, a hematopoietic progenitor cell type,
   which is an important target for the treatment of blood disorders and
   for the manufacture of red blood cells. CFSE labeling of CFU-Es isolated
   from mouse fetal livers was performed to examine the effects of stem
   cell factor (SCF) and erythropoietin (EPO) in culture. We used a dynamic
   model of proliferation based on the Smith-Martin representation of the
   cell cycle to extract proliferation rates and death rates from CFSE
   time-series. However, we found that to accurately represent the cell
   population dynamics in differentiation cultures of CFU-Es, it was
   necessary to develop a model with generation-specific rate parameters.
   The generation-specific rates of proliferation and death were extracted
   for six generations (G0G5) and they revealed that, although SCF alone or
   EPO alone supported similar total cell outputs in culture, stimulation
   with EPO resulted in significantly higher proliferation rates from G2 to
   G5 and higher death rates in G2, G3, and G5 compared with SCF. In
   addition, proliferation rates tended to increase from G1 to G5 in
   cultures supplemented with EPO and EPO + SCF, while they remained lower
   and more constant across generations with SCF. The results are
   consistent with the notion that SCF promotes CFU-E self-renewal while
   EPO promotes CFU-E differentiation in culture. (c) 2012 International

Abstract = {{The dynamic tensile strength properties of the rock interface and its
   host rocks sampled from the Baihetan Hydropower Station from Western
   China were measured using a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). The
   results were compared with those for its two host rocks. The dynamic
   tensile strengths of the two host rocks, tuff and basalt have typical
   loading rate dependence. However, the dynamic response of the rock
   interface is much more complicated and at a given loading rate, varies
   between those of tuff and basalt. To explain the observation, numerical
   simulation using the discrete element method (DEM) was conducted to
   determine the detailed tensile failure process of the rock interface.
   The numerical simulation verifies that the variation of the dynamic
   tensile strength of the rock interface is a result of the variation of
   the interface geometry.}},

Abstract = {{An electromagnetic valvetrain for an internal combustion engine can
   improve the engine thermal efficiency but requires soft landing control
   to avoid excessive wear and acoustic noise. To simplify the soft landing
   problem, the valve control algorithm is partitioned into approach and
   landing controllers. The landing control is responsible for the last
   part of the 8 mm valve travel while the approach control is responsible
   for the rest. This paper focuses on the approach control. The goal of
   the approach control is to achieve an end state that sets constant
   initial conditions for the landing control. In addition to an identified
   system model, information based on previous valve events is utilized to
   take advantage of the repetitive nature of the valve opening/closing.
   Nonlinear iterative learning, terminal iterative learning, and Nelder
   Mead direct search algorithms are three cyclic adaptive feedforward
   approach controllers that are tested in simulation for automotive
   electromagnetic valves. These results are compared but the emphasis of
   this paper is on the Nelder Mead approach which works well both in
   simulation and experiment for disturbances that are slow compared to the
   valve travel time.}},

Abstract = {{This brief addresses the problem of adaptive regulation in retinal
   imaging adaptive optics systems against the unknown and time-varying
   aberrations present in the eye. The proposed controller design approach
   relies on two steps. The first step is to construct a Q-parameterized
   set of stabilizing controllers for the multi-input multi-output system
   under consideration and to derive conditions on the Q parameter in the
   controller expression to achieve regulation. Partial diagonal decoupling
   of the closed-loop system dynamics is performed to facilitate the
   development of the adaptive regulator. Since the eye's aberrations are
   unknown and time-varying, the second step is to derive an online tuning
   algorithm for the Q parameter in the expression for the parameterized
   stabilizing controller. The online tuning of the Q parameter allows the
   controller to converge to the controller needed to achieve regulation,
   hence compensating for the lack of information on the eye's aberrations.
   The partial decoupling introduced in the closed loop system allows the
   tuning to be performed using decentralized adaptation algorithms.
   Experimental results are presented to validate the proposed regulation
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{A point-to-multipoint system consisting of an optical transmitter (known
   as the central node) equipped with K apertures, and K users
   communicating over free-space optical (FSO) channels is considered. It
   is assumed that each link suffers from weak-turbulence conditions. The
   main goal of this paper is to analyze the performance of the system for
   various multiuser diversity scheduling schemes in terms of the
   turbulence strength, from the throughput and the latency perspectives.
   It is demonstrated that for the proposed system with low turbulence
   strength, the greedy scheduling scheme (i.e., the central node serves at
   each time slot the user with the best channel characteristics) achieves
   the maximum system throughput among various scheduling algorithms at the
   cost of a large latency. We extend the well-known RF concepts of
   multiuser diversity to FSO communications. In particular, we show that
   the Proportional Fair Scheduling with Exponential Rule (PFS/ER) scheme
   achieves the minimum latency. In addition, the results demonstrate that
   for point-to-multipoint FSO systems with low turbulence strengths, using
   the proportional fair scheduling (PFS) has no diversity gain over other
   schemes. Finally, two new scheduling algorithms are introduced to
   achieve a tradeoff between the throughput and the latency in FSO-based
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Upon infesting the hermit crab Pagurus proximus the parasitic barnacle
   Peltogaster reticulatus typically forms a single externa on each host.
   In vivo, histological and histochemical study revealed that most P.
   reticulatus with a single mature externa also exhibited three or four
   primordial externae and several buds of earlier developmental stages. It
   is shown that stolon buds and primordial externae in P. reticulatus
   internae intensively express alkaline phosphatase activity, the
   classical histochemical marker for mammalian embryonic stem and primary
   germ cells. Ovaries of the most developed primordial externae were
   filled with growing oocytes, so the process of oogenesis begins in the
   externa rudiments of P. reticulatus before the externae appear on the
   surface of the host body. Since the interna, which is connected to the
   mature externa, also integrated three or four additional primordial
   externae and several earlier buds, P. reticulatus, a non-colonial
   species based on the common presence of a single externa in each host,
   appears to have a hidden colonial organization at the parasitic stage of
   its life cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies offered theories to explain shear-induced bubble
   nucleation and growth phenomena in plastic foaming processes, but
   empirical verification was limited due to difficulty in observing these
   processes in situ under an easily adjustable and uniform shear flow.
   This study presents a novel visualization system that successfully
   achieved this goal. The system allows easy control of the critical
   experimental parameters: applied shear strain, shear strain rate,
   temperature, pressure, pressure drop rate, plastic material and blowing
   agent. From a foaming visualization study of polystyrene, it was
   observed that cell nucleation rate and maximum cell density increased
   with the applied shear strain, which was due to the decreased local
   system pressure, detachment and growth of microvoids, and elongation of
   bubbles. This foaming visualization system provides a direct and
   effective way to investigate the mechanisms of bubble nucleation and
   growth under dynamic conditions that simulates industrial plastic
   foaming processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the influence of welding parameters, including tool
   rotational speed, plunge rate and dwell time, on the overlap tensile
   shear properties of AZ31 friction stir spot welds was investigated. The
   microstructures in stir zones and fracture surfaces were observed using
   optical microscope and scanning electron microscope respectively. The
   bonded width and h value (the distance from the tip of the partially
   bonded region to the top of the weld surface) were measured. The results
   indicated that larger bonded width and higher h value of the AZ31 weld
   result in better mechanical property. It is proposed that high tensile
   shear loads are produced when the tool rotational speed range of
   1500-2250 rev min(-1) and 1 s dwell time are applied during the friction
   stir spot welding of AZ31. The plunge rate range from 2.5 to 10 mm s(-1)
   has insignificant influence on the tensile shear load of AZ31 joints
   under the present conditions. The failure mode changes from interfacial
   to pullout when the tool rotational speed is >2250 rev min(-1). The
   fracture feature of AZ31 welds is brittle fracture.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a generalized time-domain transfer-matrix (TDTM) method,
   the only method to our knowledge that is capable of modeling
   high-index-contrast layered structures with dispersion and slow resonant
   nonlinearities. In this method transfer matrix is implemented in the
   time domain, either by switching between time and frequency domains
   using Fourier transform and its inverse operation, or by replacing the
   frequency variable (.) with its temporal operator (-i (d/dt)). This
   approach allows us to implement the transfer matrix method (which can
   easily incorporate dispersion, is analytical in nature, and requires
   less computation time) in the time domain, where we can incorporate
   nonlinearity of various kinds, instantaneous (such as Kerr
   nonlinearity), or slow resonant nonlinearity (such as carrier-induced
   nonlinearity). This generalized TDTM method is capable of incorporate
   non-analytical forms of dispersion and of nonlinearity, making it a
   versatile tool for modeling optical devices where dispersion and
   nonlinearities are obtained phenomenologically. We also provide a few
   numerical examples to compare our method with the standard
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, as well as to examine the
   range of validity of our method. For pico-second and longer pulses, our
   results agree with the FDTD simulation results to within 1\% and the
   computation time of our method is more than 100 fold reduced compared to
   that of FDTD for the longest pulse we used.}},

Abstract = {{Engineered myocardial tissues can be used to elucidate fundamental
   features of myocardial biology, develop organotypic in vitro model
   systems, and as engineered tissue constructs for replacing damaged heart
   tissue in vivo. However, a key limitation is an inability to test the
   wide range of parameters (cell source, mechanical, soluble and
   electrical stimuli) that might impact the engineered tissue in a
   high-throughput manner and in an environment that mimics native heart
   tissue. Here we used microelectromechanical systems technology to
   generate arrays of cardiac microtissues (CMTs) embedded within
   three-dimensional micropatterned matrices. Microcantilevers
   simultaneously constrain CMT contraction and report forces generated by
   the CMTs in real time. We demonstrate the ability to routinely produce
   similar to 200 CMTs per million cardiac cells (<1 neonatal rat heart)
   whose spontaneous contraction frequency, duration, and forces can be
   tracked. Independently varying the mechanical stiffness of the
   cantilevers and collagen matrix revealed that both the dynamic force of
   cardiac contraction as well as the basal static tension within the CMT
   increased with boundary or matrix rigidity. Cell alignment is, however,
   reduced within a stiff collagen matrix; therefore, despite producing
   higher force, CMTs constructed from higher density collagen have a lower
   cross-sectional stress than those constructed from lower density
   collagen. We also study the effect of electrical stimulation on cell
   alignment and force generation within CMTs and we show that the
   combination of electrical stimulation and auxotonic load strongly
   improves both the structure and the function of the CMTs. Finally, we
   demonstrate the suitability of our technique for high-throughput
   monitoring of drug-induced changes in spontaneous frequency or
   contractility in CMTs as well as high-speed imaging of calcium dynamics
   using fluorescent dyes. Together, these results highlight the potential
   for this approach to quantitatively demonstrate the impact of physical
   parameters on the maturation, structure, and function of cardiac tissue
   and open the possibility to use high-throughput, low volume screening
   for studies on engineered myocardium.}},

   resulted in significantly lower back loads than floor lifts. Two

   the primary caregiver compared to the single-caregiver case. In
   contrast, two-caregiver operation of an overhead lift did result in
   reduced loads compared to the single-caregiver case. Therefore, overhead
   lifts should be used whenever possible to reduce the risk of back injury

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized
   pathologically by amyloid-beta (A beta) aggregates in the brain.
   Notwithstanding many promising therapeutics that are under development,
   early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is limited. By targeting the A
   beta aggregates, diagnosis can be improved and disease progression
   reduced. Molecular imaging using monoclonal antibodies to target
   specific isoforms of A beta aggregates offer increased specificity in
   comparison to conventional imaging tracers; however, antibodies that are
   widely used in histology do not necessarily show similar binding in a
   dynamic in vivo environment. In this study, the diffusion and binding
   were studied of a classical monoclonal antibody, 6E10, in the brain of
   the TgCRND8 mouse model of AD. After intracranial injection of
   fluorescent 6E10, we observed broad and rapid labelling of A beta
   deposits in the cortex and corpus callosum within 4 h. A beta plaques
   were detected up to 2.5 mm away from the injection site in TgCRND8 mice
   and not in wild type mice at all, demonstrating specificity of binding.
   The apparent diffusivity and elimination constant of the anti-A beta
   antibody were found to be independent of both the age of the animal and
   the accumulation of A beta in the extracellular space, suggesting broad
   applicability of this targeting molecule. Mathematical modelling of the
   diffusion profiles of the anti-A beta antibody in the brain parenchyma
   provides insights into the utility of antibodies as molecular imaging
   tools and targeted therapeutics. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Transcript quantification is a long-standing problem in genomics and
   estimating the relative abundance of alternatively-spliced isoforms from
   the same transcript is an important special case. Both problems have
   recently been illuminated by high-throughput RNA sequencing experiments
   which are quickly generating large amounts of data. However, much of the
   signal present in this data is corrupted or obscured by biases resulting
   in non-uniform and non-proportional representation of sequences from
   different transcripts. Many existing analyses attempt to deal with these
   and other biases with various task-specific approaches, which makes
   direct comparison between them difficult. However, two popular tools for
   isoform quantification, MISO and Cufflinks, have adopted a general
   probabilistic framework to model and mitigate these biases in a more
   general fashion. These advances motivate the need to investigate the
   effects of RNA-seq biases on the accuracy of different approaches for
   isoform quantification. We conduct the investigation by building models
   of increasing sophistication to account for noise introduced by the
   biases and compare their accuracy to the established approaches.
   We focus on methods that estimate the expression of
   alternatively-spliced isoforms with the percent-spliced-in (PSI) metric
   for each exon skipping event. To improve their estimates, many methods
   use evidence from RNA-seq reads that align to exon bodies. However, the
   methods we propose focus on reads that span only exon-exon junctions. As
   a result, our approaches are simpler and less sensitive to exon
   definitions than existing methods, which enables us to distinguish their
   strengths and weaknesses more easily. We present several probabilistic
   models of of position-specific read counts with increasing complexity
   and compare them to each other and to the current state-of-the-art
   methods in isoform quantification, MISO and Cufflinks. On a validation
   set with RT-PCR measurements for 26 cassette events, some of our methods
   are more accurate and some are significantly more consistent than these
   two popular tools. This comparison demonstrates the challenges in
   estimating the percent inclusion of alternatively spliced junctions and
   illuminates the tradeoffs between different approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The first detailed study of charge transport through a liquid organic
   semiconductor (LOS) is reported with the goal of elucidating the effects
   of molecular motion on charge transport through molecular liquids. Using
   a liquid, silyl ether-substituted triarylamine, hole transport
   mobilities were obtained over a wide range of temperatures above the
   glass transition temperature of the material. Analysis of this data
   reveals that molecular motion(s) have a negligible effect on macroscopic
   charge transport through a molecular liquid. The results strongly
   resemble transport behavior found in conventional, disordered solids and
   suggest that silyl ether-substituted LOSs may be good candidates for
   integration into electronic devices, by those who are familiar with the
   application of traditional triarylamines, where their unique physical
   state can or could be exploited.}},

Journal = {{ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{3731-3738}},
Month = {{APR 17}},
Abstract = {{Dried blood spot (DBS) samples on filter paper are surging in popularity
   as a sampling and storage vehicle for a wide range of clinical and
   pharmaceutical applications. For example, a DBS sample is collected from
   every baby born in the province of Ontario, Canada, for quantification
   of approximately one hundred analytes that are used to screen for 28
   conditions, including succinylacetone (SA), a marker for hepatorenal
   tyrosinemia. Unfortunately, the conventional methods used to evaluate
   DBS samples for newborn screening and other applications are tedious and
   slow, with limited options for automated analysis. In response to this
   challenge, we have developed a method to couple digital microfluidics
   (DMF) to nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nESI-MS) for SA
   quantification in DBS samples. The new system is formed by sandwiching a
   pulled glass capillary emitter between the two DMF substrates such that
   the capillary emitter is immobilized without external seals or gaskets.
   Moreover, we introduce a new feedback control system that enables
   high-fidelity droplet manipulation across DBS samples without manual
   intervention. The system was validated by application to on-chip
   extraction, derivatization, and analysis of SA and other analytes from
   DBS samples, with comparable performance to gold-standard methods. We
   propose that the new methods described here can potentially contribute
   to a new generation of analytical techniques for quantifying analytes in
   DBS samples for a wide range of applications.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of reprogramming and its impact on stem cell biology has
   renewed interest in lineage restriction in mammalian embryos, the source

   cell types during stem cell differentiation and reprogramming, and also
   directly from embryos, is a major technical challenge because few
   cell-surface proteins are known that can distinguish each cell type. We
   provide a large-scale proteomic resource of cell-surface proteins for
   the four embryo-derived stem cell lines. We validated 27 antibodies
   against lineage-specific cell-surface markers, which enabled
   investigation of specific cell populations during ES-EpiSC reprogramming
   and ES-to-XEN differentiation. Identified markers also allowed
   prospective isolation and characterization of viable lineage progenitors
   from blastocysts by flow cytometry. These results provide a
   comprehensive stem cell proteomic resource and enable new approaches to
   interrogate the mechanisms that regulate cell fate specification.}},

Title = {{Daily Rhythmic Behaviors and Thermoregulatory Patterns Are Disrupted in
   Adult Female MeCP2-Deficient Mice}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{Mutations in the X-linked gene encoding Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2
   (MECP2) have been associated with neurodevelopmental and
   neuropsychiatric disorders including Rett Syndrome, X-linked mental
   retardation syndrome, severe neonatal encephalopathy, and Angelman
   syndrome. Although alterations in the performance of MeCP2-deficient
   mice in specific behavioral tasks have been documented, it remains
   unclear whether or not MeCP2 dysfunction affects patterns of periodic
   behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. The aim of the
   current study was therefore to determine whether a deficiency in MeCP2
   is sufficient to alter the normal daily rhythmic patterns of core body
   temperature, gross motor activity and cortical delta power. To address
   this, we monitored individual wild-type and MeCP2-deficient mice in
   their home cage environment via telemetric recording over 24 hour
   cycles. Our results show that the normal daily rhythmic behavioral
   patterning of cortical delta wave activity, core body temperature and
   mobility are disrupted in one-year old female MeCP2-deficient mice.
   Moreover, female MeCP2-deficient mice display diminished overall motor
   activity, lower average core body temperature, and significantly greater
   body temperature fluctuation than wild-type mice in their home-cage
   environment. Finally, we show that the epileptiform discharge activity
   in female MeCP2-deficient mice is more predominant during times of
   behavioral activity compared to inactivity. Collectively, these results
   indicate that MeCP2 deficiency is sufficient to disrupt the normal
   patterning of daily biological rhythmic activities.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-NogoA is a promising anti-inhibitory molecule that has been shown
   to enhance functional recovery after spinal cord injury when delivered
   in rat and primate models over the span of weeks. To achieve this
   sustained release, anti-NogoA is typically delivered by osmotic
   minipumps; however, external minipumps are susceptible to infection. To
   address this issue, we developed a drug delivery system that consists of
   anti-NogoA-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles dispersed
   in a hydrogel of hyaluronan and methylcellulose (composite HAMC). To
   optimize in vitro release, we screened formulations for improved
   anti-NogoA bioactivity and sustained release based on combinations of
   co-encapsulated trehalose, hyaluronan, MgCO3, and CaCO3. Co-encapsulated
   MgCO3 and CaCO3 slowed the rate of anti-NogoA release and did not
   influence anti-NogoA bioactivity. Co-encapsulated trehalose
   significantly improved anti-NogoA bioactivity at early release time
   points by stabilizing the protein during lyophilization. Co-encapsulated
   trehalose with hyaluronan improved bioactivity up to 28d and
   dramatically increased the rate and duration of sustained delivery. The
   sustained release of bioactive anti-NogoA from composite HAMC is a
   compelling formulation for in vivo evaluation in a model of spinal cord
   injury. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The creation of monolithically integratable sources of single and
   entangled photons is a top research priority with formidable challenges:
   The production, manipulation, and measurement of the photons should all
   occur in the same material platform, thereby fostering stability and
   scalability. Here we demonstrate efficient photon pair production in a
   semiconductor platform, gallium arsenide. Our results show type-I
   spontaneous parametric down-conversion of laser light from a 2.2 mm long
   Bragg-reflection waveguide, and we estimate its internal pair production
   efficiency to be 2.0 X 10(-8) (pairs/pump photon). This is the first
   time that significant pair production has been demonstrated in a
   structure that can be electrically self-pumped and which can form the
   basis for passive optical circuitry, bringing us markedly closer to
   complete integration of quantum optical technologies.}},

Volume = {{533}},

Month = {{APR 10}},
Abstract = {{The oxidation mechanism of nickel concentrate from ambient up to 1000
   degrees C was investigated by thermogravimetric (TG) and differential
   thermal analysis (DTA) to improve the understanding of the oxidation
   behavior of the nickel concentrate during industrial roasting. The
   reaction products at intermediate temperatures were analyzed by X-ray
   powder diffraction (XRD). SEM/EDS, electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA),
   and chemical analysis. A reaction scheme was deduced, in which the
   preferential oxidation of iron sulfide species took place in the
   temperature range of 350-700 degrees C, forming Ni1-xS and Fe2O3.
   Subsequently, the resulting Ni1-xS was transformed into Ni3 +/- xS2, Ni3
   +/- xS2 core melted at 813 degrees C and accelerated its oxidation
   forming NiO and NiSO4. At 942 degrees C, NiSO4 decomposed and the
   complete oxidation of the remaining nickel sulfide took place due to the
   absence of the protective sulfate shell. The kinetic results indicate
   that the diffusion of O-2 through the sample bed controls the reaction
   rate if the bed depth is larger than approximately 125 mu m. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Mimicking natural tissue structure is crucial for engineered tissues
   with intended applications ranging from regenerative medicine to
   biorobotics. Native tissues are highly organized at the microscale, thus
   making these natural characteristics an integral part of creating
   effective biomimetic tissue structures. There exists a growing
   appreciation that the incorporation of similar highly organized
   microscale structures in tissue engineering may yield a remedy for
   problems ranging from vascularization to cell function
   control/determination. In this review, we highlight the recent progress
   in the field of microscale tissue engineering and discuss the use of
   various biomaterials for generating engineered tissue structures with
   microscale features. In particular, we will discuss the use of
   microscale approaches to engineer the architecture of scaffolds,
   generate artificial vasculature, and control cellular orientation and
   differentiation. In addition, the emergence of microfabricated tissue
   units and the modular assembly to emulate hierarchical tissues will be
   discussed.}},

   distribution with basis-dependent flaw}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 6}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the unconditional security of the so-called
   measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDIQKD) with
   the basis-dependent flaw in the context of phase encoding schemes. We
   propose two schemes for the phase encoding: The first one employs a
   phase locking technique with the use of non-phase-randomized coherent
   pulses, and the second one uses conversion of standard Bennett-Brassard
   1984 (BB84) phase encoding pulses into polarization modes. We prove the
   unconditional security of these schemes and we also simulate the key
   generation rate based on simple device models that accommodate
   imperfections. Our simulation results show the feasibility of these
   schemes with current technologies and highlight the importance of the
   state preparation with good fidelity between the density matrices in the
   two bases. Since the basis-dependent flaw is a problem not only for
   MDIQKD but also for standard quantum key distribution (QKD), our work
   highlights the importance of an accurate signal source in practical QKD
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Liquids spread anisotropically on grooved surfaces; potential
   applications include self-cleaning surfaces and digital microfluiclics.
   However, the wetting of grooved surfaces is generally only qualitatively
   understood. We simulate equilibrium drop shapes in the Cassie
   (suspended) state on grooved surfaces. It is shown that while inertia is
   required for drops to advance from one groove to the next, drops recede
   to near-circular shapes under the influence of surface energy alone.
   Given the number of grooves on which an advancing drop resides, its
   shape can be quantitatively predicted and matched to experiment. Such
   drops spread parallel to the grooves as if on a one-dimensional Cassie
   surface, which can be used to infer the intrinsic contact angle from the
   drop shape and groove dimensions. Tapered grooves allow self-propelled
   unidirectional motion. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The solid particle erosion of 12 metals using magnetite erodent}},
Journal = {{WEAR}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{282}},
Pages = {{40-51}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{To aid in the materials selection for sales gas control valves, the
   solid particle erosion behavior of 12 metals was investigated using
   impinging jets of magnetite particles. The erosion rates were measured
   for two different particle sizes, two different velocities, and six
   different impingement angles. In most cases, the dependencies of erosion
   rate on impingement angle were fit to a published semi-empirical erosion
   model so that they can be used in future computational fluid dynamics
   models of the erosion of control valves and other pipeline components.
   The most erosion resistant materials were found to be tungsten carbide
   (WC) and Stellite 12, and the least erosion resistant materials were
   nickel plated A1018 carbon steel and A240 type 410 stainless steel
   plates. There was no measurable erosion for the WC samples, even for
   very long exposure times. Scanning electron microscopy was used to
   investigate the erosion mechanisms. For the nickel plated steel, under
   some of the studied conditions, the plating was found to delaminate,
   resulting in a brittle erosive response. For all other tested materials,
   the measured erosion rates and scanning electron micrographs indicated a
   ductile erosion mechanism under all the considered conditions. With all
   other conditions being equal, the erosion rate was found to increase
   with decreasing particle size. This counter intuitive result was
   demonstrated to be primarily due to the formation of a thicker hardened
   layer which also led to a higher degree of particle fragmentation, when
   utilizing the larger particles as the erodent. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

   (PLA) and PLA-clay nanocomposites have been investigated by temperature
   modulated differential scanning calorimeter (TMDSC), X-ray diffraction,
   scanning electron microscopy, and tensile properties. CO2-induced
   crystallization in PLA and PLA-clay nanocomposites and the crystallinity
   increased with an increase in saturation time. The present of clay acted
   as nucleation site to facilitate the crystallization process of PLA thus
   resulted in smaller crystallites and lower crystallinity. Unique
   skin-core foam morphologies in PLA and PLA-clay nanocomposites were
   obtained by controlling the crystallinity. Clay nanoparticles served as
   nucleation sites to generate foam morphology in PLA-clay sample with
   high crystallinity. The introduction of the cellular structure improved
   the mechanical strength of the material and the specific strength of PLA
   foams were increased in the presence of a small amount of MMT. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Efficient lignin depolymerization is unique to the wood decay
   basidiomycetes, collectively referred to as white rot fungi.
   Phanerochaete chrysosporium simultaneously degrades lignin and
   cellulose, whereas the closely related species, Ceriporiopsis
   subvermispora, also depolymerizes lignin but may do so with relatively
   little cellulose degradation. To investigate the basis for selective
   ligninolysis, we conducted comparative genome analysis of C.
   subvermispora and P. chrysosporium. Genes encoding manganese peroxidase
   numbered 13 and five in C. subvermispora and P. chrysosporium,
   respectively. In addition, the C. subvermispora genome contains at least
   seven genes predicted to encode laccases, whereas the P. chrysosporium
   genome contains none. We also observed expansion of the number of C.
   subvermispora desaturase-encoding genes putatively involved in lipid
   metabolism. Microarray-based transcriptome analysis showed substantial
   up-regulation of several desaturase and MnP genes in wood-containing
   medium. MS identified MnP proteins in C. subvermispora culture
   filtrates, but none in P. chrysosporium cultures. These results support
   the importance of MnP and a lignin degradation mechanism whereby
   cleavage of the dominant nonphenolic structures is mediated by lipid
   peroxidation products. Two C. subvermispora genes were predicted to
   encode peroxidases structurally similar to P. chrysosporium lignin
   peroxidase and, following heterologous expression in Escherichia coli,
   the enzymes were shown to oxidize high redox potential substrates, but
   not Mn2+. Apart from oxidative lignin degradation, we also examined
   cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic systems in both fungi. In summary, the
   C. subvermispora genetic inventory and expression patterns exhibit
   increased oxidoreductase potential and diminished cellulolytic
   capability relative to P. chrysosporium.}},

Abstract = {{The validity of the constant propagation fracture energy postulation for
   dynamic fracture is discussed. As shown from existing direct and
   indirect experimental results, this assumption may not represent the
   physical reality. For spontaneous fractures, the fracture energy was
   shown to increase linearly with the crack length, and for dynamic
   fractures driven by known amplitude impulsive loading (generated by
   planar impact), the fracture energy was not a constant either. Despite
   of its phenomenogical origin, the Broberg's theory developed for
   self-similar crack growth works well for both spontaneous fractures and
   dynamic fractures produced by well defined dynamic loading. In this
   theory, the fracture energy is not a constant. Furthermore, with given
   far-field loading or equivalent far-field loading, the crack speed is
   uniquely determined by a strength-like material parameter. This
   parameter is related to the cohesive strength as proposed by H. J. Gao
   for hyper-elastic materials in the crack-tip process zone. It is
   proposed in this work that the strength-like parameter (or equivalently
   the constant fracture speed) is a better material parameter to describe
   the dynamic fracture propagation process for most dynamic fractures.}},

Abstract = {{Object-oriented programming has been promoted as a programming style
   that brings reusability, extensibility, and maintainability to codes.
   Software design patterns are solutions that address recurring design
   problems, and are generally considered the most appropriate practice of
   object-oriented programming. Developing computational electromagnetic
   software is not devoid of these design problems. This paper identifies
   three design problems and their corresponding solutions, namely,
   strategy pattern, observer pattern, and bridge pattern. These design
   patterns incur computational cost associated with the implementation of
   objects in the programming languages. They should be judiciously avoided
   in the solver, and more liberally applied in less computationally
   demanding components of electromagnetic software.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Surface topography and electrical field stimulation are
   important guidance cues that aid the organization and contractility of
   cardiomyocytes in vivo. We report here on the use of these biomimetic
   cues in vitro to engineer an implantable contractile cardiac tissue.
   Methods: Photocrosslinkable collagen-chitosan hydrogels with
   microgrooves of 10 mu m, 20 mu m and 100 mu m in width were fabricated
   using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) molds. The hydrogels were seeded with
   cardiomyocytes, placed into a bioreactor array with the micro grooves
   aligned with the electrical field lines, and stimulated with biphasic
   square pulses at 1 Hz and 2.5 V/cm.
   Results: At Day 6, cardiomyocytes were aligned in the direction of the
   microgrooves. When cultivated without electrical stimulation, the
   excitation threshold of engineered cardiac tissues using micropatterned
   hydrogels was significantly lower than using smooth hydrogels, thus
   showing the importance of cell alignment to cardiac function. The
   success rate of achieving beating constructs was higher with the
   application of electrical stimulation. In addition, formation of dense
   contractile cardiac organoids was observed in groups with both
   biomimetic cues. The cultivation of cardiomyocytes on hydro gels with 10
   mu m grooves yielded 100\% beating tissues with or without electrical
   stimulation, thus suggesting a smaller groove width is necessary for
   cells to communicate and form proper gap junctions. However, electrical
   field stimulation further increased cell density and enhanced tissue
   morphology which may be essential for the integration of the tissue
   construct to the native heart tissue upon implantation.
   Conclusions: The biodegradability of the hydrogel substrate allows for
   the rapid translation of the engineered, oriented cardiac tissue to
   clinical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Transmembrane proteins span cellular membranes such as the plasma
   membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to mediate inter- and
   intracellular interactions. An N-terminal signal peptide and
   transmembrane helices facilitate recruitment to the ER and integration
   into the membrane, respectively. Using a parts-based assembly approach
   in this study, we confirm that the minimum requirement to create a
   tansmembrane protein is indeed only a transmembrane helix (TM). When
   transfected in mammalian cells, our fusion proteins in the schematic
   form X-TM-Y were localized to vesicles, the golgi apparatus, the nuclear
   envelope, or the endoplasmic reticulum, consistent with ER targeting.
   Further studies to determine orientation showed that X was facing the
   cytoplasm, and Y the lumen. Lastly, in our fusion proteins with an
   N-terminal TM, the TM effectively reversed the orientation of X and Y.
   This knowledge can be applied to the arts based engineering of synthetic
   transmembrane proteins with varied functions and bid logical
   applications.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Diseases and injuries of the central nervous system (CNS) including
   those in the brain, spinal cord and retina are devastating because the
   CNS has limited intrinsic regenerative capacity and currently available
   therapies are unable to provide significant functional recovery. Several
   promising therapies have been identified with the goal of restoring at
   least some of this lost function and include neuroprotective agents to
   stop or slow cellular degeneration, neurotrophic factors to stimulate
   cellular growth, neutralizing molecules to overcome the inhibitory
   environment at the site of injury, and stem cell transplant strategies
   to replace lost tissue. The delivery of these therapies to the CNS is a
   challenge because the blood-brain barrier limits the diffusion of
   molecules into the brain by traditional oral or intravenous routes.
   Injectable hydrogels have the capacity to overcome the challenges
   associated with drug delivery to the CNS, by providing a minimally
   invasive, localized, void-filling platform for therapeutic use. Small
   molecule or protein drugs can be distributed throughout the hydrogel
   which then acts as a depot for their sustained release at the injury
   site. For cell delivery, the hydrogel can reduce cell aggregation and
   provide an adhesive matrix for improved cell survival and integration.
   Additionally, by choosing a biodegradable or bioresorbable hydrogel
   material, the system will eventually be eliminated from the body. This
   review discusses both natural and synthetic injectable hydrogel
   materials that have been used for drug or cell delivery to the CNS
   including hyaluronan, methylcellulose, chitosan,
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and Matrigel.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: Rigorous usability testing of e-learning
   resources is an important prerequisite to their widespread use among
   clinicians. This study demonstrates the application of an evidence-based
   approach to usability testing of two stroke-related e-learning resources
   (StrokEngine).
   Methods: 14 stroke rehabilitation clinicians (occupational therapists
   and physiotherapists) from Ontario, Canada participated in a 1.5 h
   in-person testing session. Clinicians navigated StrokEngine in search of
   information to answer questions on stroke assessment/intervention. Their
   search patterns were observed and clinicians provided verbal/written
   feedback about StrokEngine. Content analysis was used to generate themes
   and categorize them under two broad categories: facilitators and
   barriers to use.
   Results: Five key facilitators and three key barriers to StrokEngine use
   were identified and related to screen format, layout/organization, ease
   of navigation, quality of content, likelihood of using StrokEngine in
   the future, and system dysfunctions. All 14 clinicians were very or
   extremely satisfied with the layout/organization, quality and clinical
   relevance of the content, stating that they were likely to use
   StrokEngine in the future.
   Conclusion: All identified barriers from this study were addressed with
   website modifications in order to maximize the usability and
   navigability of StrokEngine. This rigorous methodology for usability
   testing can be applied during the design process of any e-learning
   resource.}},

Journal = {{HYDROMETALLURGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{71-78}},

Abstract = {{The ongoing development of new, advanced technologies created increasing
   demands for rare earth elements (REE) in the international markets, with
   emphasis on identifying new resources to ensure adequate supply and
   access. The present study investigates the use of clay minerals as a
   source for extracting rare earth metals by leaching with sulfate and
   chloride salts. It was found that REE adsorbed on clays can be easily
   recovered via an ion-exchange mechanism during leaching with monovalent
   salt solutions under ambient conditions. The leaching efficiency of
   various salts at 0.5 M and 25 degrees C was investigated as a function
   of monovalent cation type (i.e. Li+, Na+, Cs+ and NH4+) and salt system
   (sulfates vs. chlorides). The initial concentration was based on a 3:1
   stoichiometric ratio between all trivalent lanthanides in the clay and
   the exchange monovalent cation. Leaching efficiency (in terms of \% REE
   extracted) decreased in the order Cs+ > NH4+ > - > Li+, from 90\% to
   similar to 60\%, respectively, with sulfates exhibiting similar to 10\%
   better extraction behavior than chlorides. Differences in rare earth
   metal desorption capability were explained in terms of differences in
   cation hydration energies: species with low hydration energy extract to
   a lesser degree compared to species with high hydration energy (i.e.
   higher affinity for water). Based on these findings, (NH4)(2)SO4 was
   identified as the lixiviant of choice for further studies. (C) 2012

Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A complementary cellophane optic gate was fabricated using a
   birefringent cellophane sheet. Previous versions of the optic gate
   required the retardance of the cellophane to be as close to 180 degrees
   as possible throughout the entire visible wavelength range, which meant
   it was often difficult to find a cellophane sheet with the right
   thickness and dispersion characteristics to meet this requirement. The
   complementary optic gate reported in this paper has no restriction on
   the thickness, composition, or wavelength range of the cellophane sheet
   except that the cellophane must have some birefringence. Even with an
   arbitrary retardance, an extinction ratio of 5 x 10(-3) was achieved at
   lambda = 0.63 mu m. The optic gate was used to convert an iPad into a 3D
   display without the need for the observer to wear glasses. The high
   extinction ratio of the optic gate resulted in a 3D display of supreme
   quality. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Multipulse pulse position modulation (MPPM) has been widely proposed to
   improve data rate over traditional pulse position modulation (PPM) in
   free-space optical communication systems. Encoders for MPPM are
   typically lookup-table-based, thus restricting the practical size of
   MPPM codebooks. Power-of-two-sized MPPM codebooks typically do not have
   an efficient soft-in soft-out decoder, making them poorly suited for
   concatenation with an outer code under iterative decoding. In this
   paper, a new coding technique based on constrained coding is introduced
   that allows construction of codes which have an efficient encoding
   algorithm. More importantly, these new codes are suitable for iterative
   soft-decision decoding in concatenation with an outer error-correcting
   code. Simulation results for both the Gaussian and Poisson channels show
   that a serial concatenation with an outer low-density parity-check code
   (LDPC) can achieve between 2 to 3 dB coding gain over comparable
   Reed-Solomon and LDPC-coded MPPM systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive time-domain model of the coupling
   capacitor voltage transformer (CCVT) to investigate the effect of CCVT
   subsidence transients on the distance relay. The studies show that
   voltage-zero subsidence transients can adversely impact the performance
   of the distance relay and result in the overreach problem. This paper
   also introduces a new approach to mitigate the effect of CCVT
   voltage-zero subsidence transients on the distance relay. The method is
   based on improving the degree of accuracy of the voltage phasor
   estimation during the CCVT subsidence transients. The proposed method is
   not affected by harmonics and high-frequency transient distortions of
   the voltage, and prevents the relay overreach problem even under high
   source impedance ratio (SIR). Moreover, the proposed method noticeably
   decreases the close-in fault clearance time under low SIR conditions,
   based on a fast current phasor estimation approach. The reported studies
   are conducted in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Transmission-line models for electromagnetic transient simulation are
   usually based on the traveling-wave method. While recent developments
   have focused on phase-domain formulations with an emphasis on accuracy
   and passivity enforcement, no consideration has been given to ensure the
   symmetry of the model. In this paper, we introduce the symmetry
   preserving property (SPP) of the propagation matrix H as a way of
   enforcing a symmetrical model. This property is enforced by replacing
   the (unsymmetrical) propagation matrix H with the (symmetrical)
   propagated characteristic admittance matrix Y-p during the process of
   rational fitting. The propagation matrix H is recovered analytically for
   use in the final line model. We show a procedure for enforcement of SPP
   and the resulting model is implemented in an Electromagnetic Transients
   Program-like simulation environment. Although the computational
   efficiency decreases somewhat with the new approach, the symmetry of the
   model offers significant advantages. Besides being physically correct,
   it avoids confusion when performing sanity checking of complex network
   models.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Asthma action plans improve asthma outcomes and are
   recommended in guidelines. However, delivery by physicians and usage by
   patients remain low. This may be because of variability in existing
   plans and a failure to consider visual design and usability factors in
   plan development.
   Objective: To characterize the variability in both the content and the
   format of existing plans, and the extent to which their format conforms
   to evidence-based visual design recommendations.
   Methods: We collected plans from the internet, Canadian experts and
   associations, guidelines, and published trials. We inductively developed
   analytic criteria for format and content analyses.
   Results: We collected 69 unique English or French-language adult
   outpatient plans from around the world. We found large variability in
   format, and plans fulfilled a mean of only 3.5 out of 8 evidence-based
   visual design recommendations. Content was also variable, including
   different descriptions of the baseline clinical state and descriptions
   and instructions at each ``action point{''} (point recommending a change
   in treatment).
   Conclusion: Existing plans vary widely in content and format.
   Accordingly, studies evaluating the effectiveness of action plans may
   not be directly comparable. Also, visual design may affect usability,
   uptake, and effectiveness. Our results suggest that this has not been
   adequately addressed in most plans, and design evidence and experts
   should be included in future development. (C) 2012 American College of

Abstract = {{Imaging blood flow or oxygenation changes using optical techniques is
   useful for monitoring cortical activity in healthy subjects as well as
   in diseased states such as stroke or epilepsy. However, in order to gain
   a better understanding of hemodynamics in conscious, freely moving
   animals, these techniques must be implemented in a small scale, portable
   design that is adaptable to a wearable format. We demonstrate a novel
   system which combines the two techniques of laser speckle contrast
   imaging and intrinsic optical signal imaging simultaneously, using
   compact laser sources, to monitor induced cortical ischemia in a full
   field format with high temporal acquisition rates. We further
   demonstrate the advantages of using combined measurements of speckle
   contrast and oxygenation to establish absolute flow velocities, as well
   as to statistically distinguish between veins and arteries. We
   accomplish this system using coherence reduction techniques applied to
   Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) operating at 680, 795
   and 850 nm. This system uses minimal optical components and can easily
   be adapted into a portable format for continuous monitoring of cortical

Abstract = {{In order for the results of timing analysis to be useful, they must
   provide insight and guidance on how the circuit may be improved so as to
   fix any reported timing problems. A limitation of many recent
   variability-aware timing analysis techniques is that, while they report
   delay distributions, or verify multiple corners, they do not provide the
   required guidance for re-design. We propose an efficient block-based
   parameterized timing analysis technique that can accurately capture
   circuit delay at every point in the parameter space, by reporting all
   paths that can become critical. Using an efficient pruning algorithm,
   only those potentially critical paths are carried forward, while all
   other paths are discarded during propagation. This allows one to examine
   local robustness to parameters in different regions of the parameter
   space, not by considering differential sensitivity at a point ( that
   would be useless in this context) but by knowledge of the paths that can
   become critical at nearby points in parameter space. We give a formal
   definition of this problem and propose a technique for solving it, which
   improves on the state of the art, both in terms of theoretical
   computational complexity and in terms of runtime on various test
   circuits.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel face descriptor based on color information,
   i.e., so-called local color vector binary patterns (LCVBPs), for face
   recognition (FR). The proposed LCVBP consists of two discriminative
   patterns: color norm patterns and color angular patterns. In particular,
   we have designed a method for extracting color angular patterns, which
   enables to encode the discriminating texture patterns derived from
   spatial interactions among different spectral-band images. In order to
   perform FR tasks, the proposed LCVBP feature is generated by combining
   multiple features extracted from both color norm patterns and color
   angular patterns. Extensive and comparative experiments have been
   conducted to evaluate the proposed LCVBP feature on five public
   databases. Experimental results show that the proposed LCVBP feature is
   able to yield excellent FR performance for challenging face images. In
   addition, the effectiveness of the proposed LCVBP feature has
   successfully been tested by comparing other state-of-the-art face
   descriptors.}},

Title = {{Blood-Brain Barrier: Real-time Feedback-controlled Focused Ultrasound
   Disruption by Using an Acoustic Emissions-based Controller}},
Journal = {{RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{263}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{96-106}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine if focused ultrasound disruption of the
   blood-brain barrier (BBB) can be safely controlled by using real-time
   modulation of treatment pressures on the basis of acoustic emissions
   from the exposed microbubbles.
   Materials and Methods: All experiments were performed with the approval
   of the institutional animal care committee. Transcranial focused
   ultrasound (551.5 kHz, 10-msec bursts, 2-Hz pulse repetition frequency,
   2 minute sonication) in conjunction with circulating microbubbles was
   applied in 86 locations in 27 rats to disrupt the BBB. Acoustic
   emissions captured during each burst by using a wideband polyvinylidene
   fluoride hydrophone were analyzed for spectral content and used to
   adjust treatment pressures. Pressures were increased incrementally after
   each burst until ultraharmonic emissions were detected, at which point
   the pressure was reduced to a percentage of the pressure required to
   induce the ultraharmonics and was maintained for the remainder of the
   sonication. Disruption was evaluated at contrast material-enhanced
   T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Mean enhancement was
   calculated by averaging the signal intensity at the focus over a 3 x
   3-pixel region of interest and comparing it with that in nonsonicated
   tissue. Histologic analysis was performed to determine the extent of
   damage to the tissue. Statistical analysis was performed by using
   Student t tests.
   Results: For sonications resulting in BBB disruption, the mean peak
   pressure was 0.28 MPa +/- 0.05 (standard deviation) (range, 0.18-0.40
   MPa). By using the control algorithm, a linear relationship was found
   between the scaling level and the mean enhancement on T1-weighted MR
   images after contrast agent injection. At a 50\% scaling level, mean
   enhancement of 19.6\% +/- 1.7 (standard error of the mean) was achieved
   without inducing damage. At higher scaling levels, histologic analysis
   revealed gross tissue damage, while at a 50\% scaling level, no damage
   was observed at high-field-strength MR imaging or histologic examination
   8 days after treatment.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that acoustic emissions can be used
   to actively control focused ultrasound exposures for the safe induction
   of BBB disruption. (C) RSNA, 2012}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY}},

Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2413-2426}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies a Gaussian Z-interference channel with a rate-limited
   digital relay link from one receiver to another. Achievable rate regions
   are derived based on a combination of a Han-Kobayashi common-private
   power-splitting technique and either a compress-and-forward relay
   strategy or a decode-and-forward strategy for interference subtraction
   at the other end. For the Gaussian Z-interference channel with a digital
   link from the interference-free receiver to the interfered receiver, the
   capacity region is established in the strong interference regime; an
   achievable rate region is established in the weak interference regime.
   In the weak interference regime, the decode-and-forward strategy is
   shown to be asymptotically sum-capacity achieving in the high
   signal-to-noise ratio and high interference-to-noise ratio limit. In
   this case, each relay bit asymptotically improves the sum capacity by
   one bit. For the Gaussian Z-interference channel with a digital link
   from the interfered receiver to the interference-free receiver, the
   capacity region is established in the strong interference regime;
   achievable rate regions are established in the moderately strong and
   weak interference regimes. In addition, the asymptotic sum capacity is
   established in the limit of a large relay link rate. In this case, the
   sum capacity improvement due to the digital link is bounded by half a
   bit when the interference link is weaker than a certain threshold, but
   the sum capacity improvement becomes unbounded when the interference
   link is strong.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{975-982}},

Abstract = {{Aims. To characterise the nursing practices of vital signs collection
   and documentation in a general internal medicine environment to inform
   strategies for improving workflow design.
   Background. Clinical workflow analysis is critical to identify barriers
   and opportunities in current processes. Analysis can guide the design
   and development of novel technological solutions to produce greater
   efficiencies and effectiveness in healthcare delivery. Research
   surrounding vital signs documentation workflow in general internal
   medicine environments has received very little attention making it
   difficult to compare the effectiveness of new technologies.
   Design. Qualitative ethnographic analyses and quantitative time- motion
   study were conducted.
   Methods. Workflows of 24 nurses at three hospitals in five general
   internal medicine environments were captured, and timeliness of vital
   signs assessment and documentation was measured.
   Results. Clinical assessment of vital signs was consistent, but the
   documentation process was highly variable within groups and between
   hospitals. Two themes characterised workflow barriers surrounding point-
   of- care documentation. First, a lack of standardised documentation
   methods for vital signs resulted in higher rates of transcription,
   increasing not only the likelihood of errors but delays in recording and
   accessibility of information. Second, despite advancements in electronic
   documentation systems, the observed system was not conducive to point-
   of- care documentation. Average electronic documentation was
   significantly longer than paper documentation. Nurses developed ad hoc
   workarounds that were inefficient and undermined the intent of
   electronic documentation.
   Conclusion. We have identified barriers and opportunities to improve the
   efficiency of nursing vital signs documentation. Changes in technology,
   workflows and environmental design allow for significant improvements
   and deserve further exploration.}},

Title = {{Automatic detection of a prefrontal cortical response to emotionally
   rated music using multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Emotional responses can be induced by external sensory stimuli. For
   severely disabled nonverbal individuals who have no means of
   communication, the decoding of emotion may offer insight into an
   individual's state of mind and his/her response to events taking place
   in the surrounding environment. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
   provides an opportunity for bed-side monitoring of emotions via
   measurement of hemodynamic activity in the prefrontal cortex, a brain
   region known to be involved in emotion processing. In this paper,
   prefrontal cortex activity of ten able-bodied participants was monitored
   using NIRS as they listened to 78 music excerpts with different
   emotional content and a control acoustic stimuli consisting of the Brown
   noise. The participants rated their emotional state after listening to
   each excerpt along the dimensions of valence (positive versus negative)
   and arousal (intense versus neutral). These ratings were used to label
   the NIRS trial data. Using a linear discriminant analysis-based
   classifier and a two-dimensional time-domain feature set, trials with
   positive and negative emotions were discriminated with an average
   accuracy of 71.94\% +/- 8.19\%. Trials with audible Brown noise
   representing a neutral response were differentiated from high arousal
   trials with an average accuracy of 71.93\% +/- 9.09\% using a
   two-dimensional feature set. In nine out of the ten participants,
   response to the neutral Brown noise was differentiated from high arousal
   trials with accuracies exceeding chance level, and positive versus
   negative emotional differentiation accuracies exceeded the chance level
   in seven out of the ten participants. These results illustrate that NIRS
   recordings of the prefrontal cortex during presentation of music with
   emotional content can be automatically decoded in terms of both valence
   and arousal encouraging future investigation of NIRS-based emotion
   detection in individuals with severe disabilities.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{94}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{As white-rot basidiomycetes, Phanerochaete species are critical to the
   cycling of carbon sequestered as woody biomass, and are predicted to
   encode many enzymes that can be harnessed to promote the conversion of
   lignocellulose to sugars for fermentation to fuels and chemicals.
   Advances in genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic technologies have
   enabled detailed analyses of different Phanerochaete species and have
   revealed numerous enzyme families required for lignocellulose
   utilization, as well as insight into the regulation of corresponding
   genes. Recent studies of Phanerochaete are also exemplified by molecular
   analyses following cultivation on different wood preparations, and show
   substrate-dependent responses that were difficult to predict using model
   compounds or isolated plant polysaccharides. The aim of this mini-review
   is to synthesize results from studies that have applied recent advances
   in molecular tools to evaluate the expression and regulation of proteins
   that contribute to lignocellulose conversion in Phanerochaete species.
   The identification of proteins with as yet unknown function are also
   highlighted and noted as important targets for future investigation of
   white-rot decay.}},

Abstract = {{A high-capacity method for silicon refining is investigated. The biggest
   obstacle in Si refining using the alloying technique is the amount of
   solute element. In the current work, Cu is removed from two Cu-Si
   hypereutectic alloys by the heavy liquid media separation technique. The
   results indicated 86.0 pct silicon recovered, which is close to the
   theoretical limit. The chemical analysis showed a Cu concentration of
   0.68 wt pct in the 50 Cu-Si alloy for a 75-mu m average particle size
   after heavy liquid media separation. The optimal particle size was found
   in the range of 75 to 125 mu m. Heavy liquid media separation is an
   efficient technique in the process of liberating Si dendrites that can
   be used as feedstock in solar cell applications.}},

Abstract = {{Nanosized conductive polypyrrole (PPy) powders were prepared using
   emulsion polymerization with aid of high speed agitation. Different
   agitation speeds from 650 to 24,000 rpm were used with different
   anionic, cationic, and non-ionic surfactants. Then, the effects of the
   agitation speed and surfactant species were examined in terms of their
   physical and electrical properties of conductivity and powder size.
   Prepared PPy nanopowders exhibited high conductivity values of 10 S/cm
   regions, when sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) and sodium
   dodecylsulfate (SDS) were used. The powder dispersion of the resultant
   PPy was also observed to be dependent on the agitation speed and
   surfactant type. The morphology shown by SEM and TEM revealed that the
   anionic SDBS surfactant could effectively disperse into nanosized
   aggregates of the PPy. The results showed that the combination of the
   anionic surfactants and high agitation in the emulsion polymerization
   could produce nanosized PPy powders with higher conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Minor maintenance actions can affect condition-monitoring measurements,
   which may in turn affect the accuracy of diagnostic and prognostic
   techniques used in condition-based maintenance (CBM). Outputs of a CBM
   model include the calculation of optimal maintenance decisions,
   conditional reliability, and the calculation of remaining useful life,
   among other measures. It is necessary to have a model for the manner in
   which the condition monitoring data changes over time to produce these
   output measures; many models have been developed to do so. It is also
   common to record minor maintenance actions carried out on critical
   assets, with lubricant changes being one of the most common, but it is
   unusual for models to consider the impact of such maintenance actions
   that affect the condition monitoring data. In this paper we discuss the
   impact of minor maintenance on CBM models. A dataset on a collection of
   gearboxes, consisting of reliability and oil analysis information,
   including data on oil changes and oil additions, is used to illustrate
   the benefit of modelling minor maintenance actions.}},

Abstract = {{In condition based maintenance (CBM) optimization, the main optimization
   objectives include maximizing reliability and minimizing maintenance
   costs, which are often times conflicting to each other. In this work, we
   develop a physical programming based approach to deal with the
   multi-objective condition based maintenance optimization problem.
   Physical programming presents two major advantages: (1) it is an
   efficient approach to capture the decision makers' preferences on the
   objectives by eliminating the iterative process of adjusting the weights
   of the objectives, and (2) it is easy to use in that decision makers
   just need to specify physically meaningful boundaries for the
   objectives. The maintenance cost and reliability objectives are
   calculated based on proportional hazards model and a control limit CBM
   replacement policy. With the proposed approach, the decision maker can
   systematically and efficiently make good tradeoff between the cost
   objective and reliability objective. An example is used to illustrate
   the proposed approach.}},

Title = {{Ergodicity of forward times of the renewal process in a block-based
   inspection model using the delay time concept}},
Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The delay time concept and the techniques developed for modelling and
   optimising plant inspection practice have been reported in many papers
   and case studies. For a system subject to a few major failure modes,
   component based delay time models have been developed under the
   assumptions of an age-based inspection policy. An age-based inspection
   assumes that an inspection is scheduled according to the age of the
   component, and if there is a failure renewal, the next inspection is
   always, say T times, from the time of the failure renewal. This applies
   to certain cases, particularly important plant items where the time
   since the last renewal or inspection is a key to schedule the next
   inspection service. However, in most cases, the inspection service is
   not scheduled according to the need of a particular component, rather it
   is scheduled according to a fixed calendar time regardless whether the
   component being inspected was just renewed or not. This policy is called
   a block-based inspection which has the advantage of easy planning and is
   particularly useful for plant items which are part of a larger system to
   be inspected. If a block-based inspection policy is used, the time to
   failure since the last inspection prior to the failure for a particular
   item is a random variable. This time is called the forward time in this
   paper. To optimise the inspection interval for block-based inspections,
   the usual criterion functions such as expected cost or down time per
   unit time depend on the distribution of this forward time. We report in
   this paper the development of a theoretical proof that a limiting
   distribution for such a forward time exists if certain conditions are
   met. We also propose a recursive algorithm for determining such a
   limiting distribution. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate
   the existence of the limiting distribution. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Measures of emotion should accurately characterize the nature of an
   emotional experience and determine whether that experience is universal
   or unique to a subgroup or culture. We investigated the value of
   assessing emotion through skin conductance (an easy-to-interpret
   physiological measure) and sliders (frequently used and direct measures
   of perceived emotion). This paper describes findings from two
   experiments. The first evaluated various slider configurations and found
   that measured emotions successfully characterized the emotional nature
   of short videos. The second experiment collected the slider and skin
   conductance measures of emotion while one sample of Japanese
   participants and another sample of Canadian participants viewed longer
   videos. The measures were sensitive enough to identify cultural
   differences consistent with existing literature and were also able to
   identify parts of the experience where members from different cultures
   reacted consistently, pinpointing content that provoked a universal
   experience. We offer a toolkit of data interpretation techniques to gain
   more insight into the implicit and explicit emotion data: analyses for
   expressiveness and agreement that can infer states such as engagement
   and fatigue. We summarize the aspects of our measurement approach and
   toolkit in a model: the ability to distinguish the emotional nature of
   stimuli, individuals, and affective interaction.}},

Abstract = {{An in vitro tissue construct amenable to perfusion was formed by
   randomly packing mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-embedded, endothelial
   cell (EC)-coated collagen cylinders (modules) into a microfluidic
   chamber. The interstices created by the random packing of the
   submillimeter-sized modules created EC-lined channels. Flow caused a
   greater than expected amount of contraction and remodeling in the
   modular constructs. Flow influenced the MSC to develop smooth muscle
   cell markers (smooth muscle actin-positive, desmin-positive, and von
   Willebrand factor-negative) and migrate toward the surface of the
   modules. When modules were coated with EC, the extent of MSC
   differentiation and migration increased, suggesting that the MSC were
   becoming smooth muscle cell-or pericyte-like in their location and
   phenotype. The MSC also proliferated, resulting in a substantial
   increase in the number of differentiated MSC. These effects were
   markedly less for static controls not experiencing flow. As the MSC
   migrated, they created new matrix that included the deposition of
   proteoglycans. Collectively, these results suggest that MSC-embedded
   modules may be useful for the formation of functional vasculature in
   tissue engineered constructs. Moreover, these flow-conditioned tissue
   engineered constructs may be of interest as three-dimensional cell-laden
   platforms for drug testing and biological assays.}},

   across both fuel mixture compositions and various equivalence ratios.
   Correspondingly, heat release rate (HRR) curves showed good matching as
   well. Calibration settings from one engine operating point for a given
   fuel mixture were readily transferable to other operating points and the
   second fuel mixture. However, there were some discrepancies in
   predicting pressure traces when operating the model near the misfire
   limit of the engine due to cyclic variability, which exceeds the
   limitations of the model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless beamforming systems may potentially be
   implemented digitally at multi-gigahertz clock frequencies using
   low-precision systolic array realizations of two-dimensional (2D)
   infinite impulse response (IIR) beam plane-wave filters. The finite
   precision performance of such filters is analyzed in terms of
   quantization noise. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are performed
   using test vectors that are derived from 2D finite-difference
   time-domain (FDTD) computational electromagnetic models of the UWB
   channels. The bit error rate (BER) is determined as a function of
   signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), with and without beamforming, and
   for various practical combinations of finite internal wordlengths and
   A/D converter precisions. It is established that 3-bit A/D converters
   with 3- to 6-bit internal wordlengths are adequate for good performance
   and that 4-bit A/D converters with 4- to 7-bit internal wordlengths
   achieve excellent performance.}},

Abstract = {{We present a predictive bioprocess design strategy employing cell- and
   molecular-level analysis of rate-limiting steps in human pluripotent
   stem cell (hPSC) expansion and differentiation, and apply it to produce
   definitive endoderm (DE) progenitors using a scalable
   directed-differentiation technology. We define a bioprocess optimization
   parameter (L; targeted cell Loss) and, with quantitative cell division
   tracking and fate monitoring, identify and overcome key suspension
   bioprocess bottlenecks. Adapting process operating conditions to pivotal
   parameters (single cell survival and growth rate) in a
   cell-line-specific manner enabled adherent-equivalent expansion of hPSCs
   in feeder- and matrix-free defined-medium suspension culture.
   Predominantly instructive differentiation mechanisms were found to
   underlie a subsequent 18-fold expansion, during directed
   differentiation, to high-purity DE competent for further commitment
   along pancreatic and hepatic lineages. This study demonstrates that iPSC
   expansion and differentiation conditions can be prospectively specified

Abstract = {{Mechanomyography (MMG) is an important kinesiological tool and potential
   communication pathway for individuals with disabilities. However, MMG is
   highly susceptible to contamination by motion artifact due to limb
   movement. A better understanding of the nature of this contamination and
   its effects on different sensing methods is required to inform robust
   MMG sensor design. Therefore, in this study, we recorded MMG from the
   extensor carpi ulnaris of six able-bodied participants using three
   different co-located condenser microphone and accelerometer pairings.
   Contractions at 30\% MVC were recorded with and without a shaker-induced
   single-frequency forearm motion artifact delivered via a custom test
   rig. Using a signal-to-signal-plus-noise-ratio and the adaptive Neyman
   curve-based statistic, we found that microphone-derived MMG spectra were
   significantly less influenced by motion artifact than corresponding
   accelerometer-derived spectra (p <= 0.05). However, non-vanishing motion
   artifact harmonics were present in both spectra, suggesting that simple
   bandpass filtering may not remove artifact influences permeating into
   typical MMG bands of interest. Our results suggest that condenser
   microphones are preferred for MMG recordings when the mitigation of
   motion artifact effects is important. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{It has sometimes been assumed that the phased-array plane piston
   transducer and the spherically-shaped concave piston transducer are
   equivalent structures when both have the same aperture and focal point.
   This assumption has not been previously examined, nor has an expression
   for the on-axis impulse response of the focused, phased-array plane
   piston transducer been derived. It is shown in this paper how such an
   expression can be obtained. Comparisons of the impulse response for both
   structures show similarities, as well as some differences that could be
   significant as the observation point approaches the focal point.
   Comparisons are also performed for wide-band pulses close to the focus
   as well as for sinusoidal excitation. A physical explanation for the
   cause of the impulse response discrepancy is shown to be due to the
   nature of the piston focusing delay and its effect on the Rayleigh
   integral. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we introduce a novel and inexpensive template-based structuring

   create a negative reproduction of the aspen leaf surface structure.
   These nanocrystalline nickel samples were then employed as re-useable
   templates and pressed against various polymers at elevated temperatures,
   transferring the desired superhydrophobic structure to their surfaces.
   This structuring process resulted in water contact angles above 150A
   degrees and tilt angles below 5A degrees for polyethylene, polypropylene
   and polytetrafluoroethylene samples. In addition, the effects of
   temperature, water drop size and surfactant concentration on these

   increase with the concentration of alkaline phosphatase and chemical
   reactions could be positively identified in mixtures made both on and

   electrode electrowetting on dielectric mixer were also taken. In these

Abstract = {{How to remove detector side channel attacks has been a notoriously hard
   problem in quantum cryptography. Here, we propose a simple solution to
   this problem-measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution
   (QKD). It not only removes all detector side channels, but also doubles
   the secure distance with conventional lasers. Our proposal can be
   implemented with standard optical components with low detection
   efficiency and highly lossy channels. In contrast to the previous
   solution of full device independent QKD, the realization of our idea
   does not require detectors of near unity detection efficiency in
   combination with a qubit amplifier (based on teleportation) or a quantum
   nondemolition measurement of the number of photons in a pulse.
   Furthermore, its key generation rate is many orders of magnitude higher
   than that based on full device independent QKD. The results show that
   long-distance quantum cryptography over say 200 km will remain secure

Title = {{A Method for Removal of Low Frequency Components Associated with Head
   Movements from Dual-Axis Swallowing Accelerometry Signals}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Head movements can greatly affect swallowing accelerometry signals. In
   this paper, we implement a spline-based approach to remove low frequency
   components associated with these motions. Our approach was tested using
   both synthetic and real data. Synthetic signals were used to perform a
   comparative analysis of the spline-based approach with other similar
   techniques. Real data, obtained data from 408 healthy participants
   during various swallowing tasks, was used to analyze the processing
   accuracy with and without the spline-based head motions removal scheme.
   Specifically, we analyzed the segmentation accuracy and the effects of
   the scheme on statistical properties of these signals, as measured by
   the scaling analysis. The results of the numerical analysis showed that
   the spline-based technique achieves a superior performance in comparison
   to other existing techniques. Additionally, when applied to real data,
   we improved the accuracy of the segmentation process by achieving a 27\%
   drop in the number of false negatives and a 30\% drop in the number of
   false positives. Furthermore, the anthropometric trends in the
   statistical properties of these signals remained unaltered as shown by
   the scaling analysis, but the strength of statistical persistence was
   significantly reduced. These results clearly indicate that any future
   medical devices based on swallowing accelerometry signals should remove
   head motions from these signals in order to increase segmentation
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The current study characterizes the impact of docetaxel (DTX)
   distribution on efficacy following sustained intraperitoneal (IP)
   chemotherapy in murine models of ovarian cancer. A polymer-lipid
   biodegradable depot (PoLigel) was used to deliver DTX in a sustained
   manner over 21-days following IP administration. Distribution and
   efficacy studies were carried out in SCID mice bearing SKOV3 IP solid
   tumors or C57BL/ 6 mice with ID8 IP ascites fluid. In addition, a
   subcutaneous (SC) SKOV3 model was used to determine whether systemic
   drug levels that result from IP administration of the PoLigel influence
   antitumor efficacy. Immunostained IP and SC SKOV3 tumor sections were
   used to study cell death, intratumoral drug distribution and tumor
   penetration. Sustained concentrations of DTX were observed in plasma,
   tissue, tumor and ascites over the entire study period. Drug
   accumulation was several fold greater in tumors and ascites when
   compared to plasma levels. Sustained chemotherapy resulted in
   significant reduction in tumor burden and ascites volume. IP tumors
   showed greater cell death compared to the SC tumors as seen by higher
   TUNEL and caspase-3 expression. At the intratumoral level, DTX
   distributed more towards the core of IP tumors compared to the SC
   tumors. Tumor penetration of drug from nearest blood vessel was 1.5 fold
   greater in the IP tumors than the SC tumors. Overall, favorable drug
   distribution at the whole-body, peritoneal and intratumoral levels in
   combination with local and systemic sustained drug exposure contribute
   to the high efficacy observed. These results encourage the clinical use
   of IP sustained chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

Abstract = {{We analyze an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) in which cascaded
   down-conversion occurs inside a cavity resonant for all modes but the
   initial pump. Due to the resonant cascade design, the OPO presents two
   chi((2))-level oscillation thresholds that are therefore much lower than
   for a chi((3)) OPO. This is promising for reaching the regime of an
   effective third-order nonlinearity well above both thresholds. Such a
   chi((2)) cascaded device also has potential applications in frequency
   conversion to far-infrared regimes. But, most importantly, it can
   generate novel multipartite quantum correlations in the output
   radiation, which represent a step beyond squeezed or entangled light.
   The output can be highly non-Gaussian and therefore not describable by
   any semiclassical model. In this paper, we derive quantum stochastic
   equations in the positive-P representation and undertake an analysis of
   steady-state and dynamical properties of this system.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing evidence indicates that the progression of calcific aortic
   valve disease (CAVD) is influenced by the mechanical forces experienced
   by valvular interstitial cells (VICs) embedded within the valve matrix.
   The ability of VICs to sense and respond to tissue-level mechanical
   stimuli depends in part on cellular-level biomechanical properties,
   which may change with disease. In this study, we used micropipette
   aspiration to measure the instantaneous elastic modulus of normal VICs
   and of VICs induced to undergo pathological differentiation in vitro to
   osteoblast or myofibroblast lineages on compliant and stiff collagen
   gels, respectively. We found that VIC elastic modulus increased after
   subculturing on stiff tissue culture-treated polystyrene and with
   pathological differentiation on the collagen gels. Fibroblast,
   osteoblast, and myofibroblast VICs had distinct cellular-level elastic
   properties that were not fully explained by substrate stiffness, but
   were correlated with a-smooth muscle actin expression levels. C-type
   natriuretic peptide, a peptide expressed in aortic valves in vivo,
   prevented VIC stiffening in vitro, consistent with its ability to
   inhibit a-smooth muscle actin expression and VIC pathological
   differentiation. These data demonstrate that VIC phenotypic plasticity
   and mechanical adaptability are linked and regulated both
   biomechanically and biochemically, with the potential to influence the
   progression of CAVD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new type-2 fuzzy c-regression clustering algorithm
   for the structure identification phase of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) systems.
   We present uncertainties with fuzzifier parameter ``m'. In order to
   identify the parameters of interval type-2 fuzzy sets, two fuzzifiers
   `m(1){''} and ``m(2){''} are used. Then, by utilizing these two
   fuzzifiers in a fuzzy c-regression clustering algorithm, the interval
   type-2 fuzzy membership functions are generated. The proposed model in
   this paper is an extended version of a type-1 FCRM algorithm {[}25],
   which is extended to an interval type-2 fuzzy model. The Gaussian
   Mixture model is used to create the partition matrix of the fuzzy
   c-regression clustering algorithm. Finally, in order to validate the
   proposed model, several numerical examples are presented. The model is
   tested on a real data set from a steel company in Canada. Our
   computational results show that our model is more effective for
   robustness and error reduction than type-1 NFCRM and the
   multiple-regression. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Privacy amplification (PA) is an essential postprocessing step in
   quantum key distribution (QKD) for removing any information an
   eavesdropper may have on the final secret key. In this paper, we
   consider delaying PA of the final key after its use in one-time pad
   encryption and prove its security. We prove that the security and the
   key generation rate are not affected by delaying PA. Delaying PA has two
   applications: it serves as a tool for significantly simplifying the
   security proof of QKD with a two-way quantum channel, and also it is
   useful in QKD networks with trusted relays. To illustrate the power of
   the delayed PA idea, we use it to prove the security of a qubit-based
   two-way deterministic QKD protocol which uses four states and four
   encoding operations.}},

Volume = {{287}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAPs) occur as important innate
   immunity agents in many organisms, including humans, and offer a viable
   alternative to conventional antibiotics, as they physically disrupt the
   bacterial membranes, leading to membrane lysis and eventually cell
   death. In this work, we studied the biophysical and microbiological
   characteristics of designed CAPs varying in hydrophobicity levels and
   charge distributions by a variety of biophysical and biochemical
   approaches, including in-tandem atomic force microscopy, attenuated
   total reflection-FTIR, CD spectroscopy, and SDS-PAGE. Peptide structural
   properties were correlated with their membrane-disruptive abilities and
   antimicrobial activities. In bacterial lipid model membranes, a
   time-dependent increase in aggregated beta-strand-type structure in CAPs
   with relatively high hydrophobicity (such as KKKKKKALFALW-LAFLA-NH2) was
   essentially absent in CAPs with lower hydrophobicity (such as
   KKKKKKAAFAAWAAFAA-NH2). Redistribution of positive charges by placing
   three Lys residues at both termini while maintaining identical sequences
   minimized self-aggregation above the dimer level. Peptides containing
   four Leu residues were destructive to mammalian model membranes, whereas
   those with corresponding Ala residues were not. This finding was
   mirrored in hemolysis studies in human erythrocytes, where Ala-only
   peptides displayed virtually no hemolysis up to 320 mu M, but the
   four-Leu peptides induced 40-80\% hemolysis at the same concentration
   range. All peptides studied displayed strong antimicrobial activity
   against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (minimum inhibitory concentrations of
   4-32 mu M). The overall findings suggest optimum routes to balancing
   peptide hydrophobicity and charge distribution that allow efficient
   penetration and disruption of the bacterial membranes without damage to
   mammalian (host) membranes.}},

Abstract = {{Apoptosis is a cell death program involved in the development of
   multicellular organisms, immunity, and pathologies ranging from cancer
   to HIV/AIDS. We present an engineered protein that causes rapid
   apoptosis of targeted cells in monolayer culture after stimulation with
   blue light. Cells transfected with the protein switch L57V, a tandem
   fusion of the light-sensing LOV2 domain and the apoptosis-executing
   domain from caspase-7, rapidly undergo apoptosis within 60 min after
   light stimulation. Constant illumination of under S min or oscillating
   with 1 min exposure had no effect, suggesting that cells have natural
   tolerance to a short duration of caspase-7 activity. Furthermore, the
   overexpression of Bcl-2 prevented L57V-mediated apoptosis, suggesting
   that although caspase-7 activation is sufficient to start apoptosis, it
   requires mitochondrial contribution to fully commit.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1049-1054}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This letter introduces a converter and a complementary digital
   controller that, compared to conventional buck, have a smaller output
   filter volume, improved dynamic response, and lower switching losses. To
   reduce the volume and switching losses, the input-to-output voltage
   difference is decreased with a capacitive attenuator that replaces the
   input filter capacitor and has approximately the same volume. Both the
   attenuator and the downstream buck converter share the same set of
   switches, minimizing conduction losses. A single digital controller
   governs operation of the both stages. The controller utilizes the
   inductor current to regulate the center tap voltage, through a
   charge-control algorithm. During transients, the attenuator is bypassed,
   so the inductor current slew rate is improved. Experiments with a
   5-1.5-V, 2.5-A, 1-MHz prototype show that, compared to the conventional
   buck, the merged topology has 43\% smaller inductor, 36\% smaller output
   capacitor, up to 30\% lower power losses, and a 25\% faster transient
   response.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a methodology for setting long-term care capacity
   levels over a multiyear planning horizon to achieve target wait time
   service levels. Our approach integrates demographic and survival
   analysis, discrete event simulation, and optimization. Based on this
   methodology, we developed a decision support system for use in practice.
   We illustrate this approach through two case studies; one for a regional
   health authority in British Columbia, Canada, and the other for a
   long-term care facility. We also compare our approach to the fixed ratio
   approach used in practice and the SIPP (stationary, independent, period
   by period) and MOL (modified offered load) approaches developed in the
   call center literature. Our results suggest that our approach is
   preferable. The fixed ratio approach lacks a rigorous foundation, and
   the SIPP and MOL approaches do not perform reliably mainly because of
   long service times. We conclude the paper with policy recommendations.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of public transit modes has been remarkable, fueled by the
   need for different transit modes to handle different demand levels,
   urban environment patterns, and natural constraints and barriers. One of
   these needs is the desire to overcome geographical and topographical
   barriers such as mountains, valleys, and bodies of water, which cannot
   be conquered by conventional transit modes without very large
   investments and changes made to the natural topography. Aerial ropeway
   transit (ART), a type of aerial transportation mode in which passengers
   are transported in a cabin that is suspended and pulled by cables, is
   one of the solutions to such cases. ART has its origins in aerial lifts
   that have been used for decades in Alpine ski resorts to transport
   skiers and tourists in cable-suspended cabins. The use of aerial
   transportation in the urban environment, which was once considered an
   unlikely possibility, has gained more attention worldwide, and it is now
   used as a public transit mode in several terrain-constrained urban areas
   around the world. This article describes the origins of aerial
   transportation and its advantages, components, service characteristics,
   available technologies, and applications around the world. The paper
   concludes with a fair assessment of the existing ART technologies. DOI:

   development cost and short life span for FPGA designs have limited their
   adoption by the scientific computing community. FPGA-based scientific
   computing and many kinds of embedded computing could become more
   practical if there were hardware libraries that were portable to any
   FPGA-based system with performance that scaled with the size of the
   FPGA. To illustrate this idea we have implemented one common
   super-computing library function: the LU factorization method for
   solving systems of linear equations. This paper describes a method for
   making the design both portable and scalable that should be illustrative
   if such libraries are to be built in the future. The design is a
   software-based generator that leverages both the flexibility of a
   software programming language and the parameters inherent in an hardware
   description language. The generator accepts parameters that describe the
   FPGA capacity and external memory capabilities. We compare the
   performance of our engine executing on the largest FPGA available at the
   time of this work (an Altera Stratix III 3S340) to a single processor
   core fabricated in the same 65nm IC process running a highly optimized
   software implementation from the processor vendor. For single precision
   matrices on the order of 10,000 x 10,000 elements, the FPGA
   implementation is 2.2 times faster and the energy dissipated per useful
   GFLOP operation is a factor of 5 times less. For double precision, the
   FPGA implementation is 1.7 times faster and 3.5 times more energy
   efficient.}},

Abstract = {{Application of speckle variance optical coherence tomography (OCT) to
   endovascular imaging faces difficulty of extensive motion artifacts
   inherently associated with arterial pulsations in addition to other
   physiological movements. In this study, we employed a technique
   involving a fourth order statistical method, kurtosis, operating on the
   endovascular OCT intensity images to visualize the vasa vasorum of
   carotid artery in vivo and identify its flow dynamic in a porcine model.
   The intensity kurtosis technique can distinguish vasa vasorum from the
   surrounding tissues in the presence of extensive time varying noises and
   dynamic motions of the arterial wall. Imaging of vasa vasorum and its
   proliferation, may compliment the growing knowledge of structural
   endovascular OCT in assessment and treatment of atherosclerosis in
   coronary and carotid arteries. (c) 2012 Optical Society of America}},
