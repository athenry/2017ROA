Abstract = {{The practical finite-analytic (PFA) method was applied to the solution
   of the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation (ADE) for solute
   transport in porous media under advection-dominated (high Peclet number,
   Pe) conditions. Several PFA spatial-temporal computational molecules
   were developed for Cauchy and pulse loading boundary conditions. The PFA
   solutions were compared with solutions from the upwind method and
   quadratic upwind differencing (QUICK) scheme. For all boundary
   conditions the trapezoidal explicit PFA (EPFA) computational molecule
   gave the most accurate results at very high Pe number as long as the
   Courant number (Cr) was close to one. Stability analysis shows that the
   PFA molecules are always stable for high Pe number. ResumeLa methode
   analytique finie pratique (AFP) a ete appliquee a la solution de
   l'equation unidimensionnelle d'advection-dispersion (EAD) pour le

Abstract = {{Inorganic semiconductor nanowires are of interest in nano- and
   microscale photonic and electronic applications. Here we report the
   formation of PbSe nanowires based on directional quantum dot alignment
   and fusion regulated by hybrid organic inorganic perovskite surface
   ligands. All material synthesis is carried out at mild temperatures.
   Passivation of PbSe quantum dots was achieved via a new perovskite
   ligand exchange. Subsequent in situ ammonium/amine substitution by
   butylamine enables quantum dots to be capped by butylammonium lead
   iodide, and this further drives the formation of a PbSe nanowire
   superlattice in a two-dimensional (2D) perovskite matrix. The average
   spacing between two adjacent nanowires agrees well with the thickness of
   single atomic layer of 2D perovskite, consistent with the formation of a
   new self-assembled semiconductor nano-wire:perovskite heterocrystal
   hybrid.}},

Title = {{Towards a ternary NIRS-BCI: single-trial classification of verbal
   fluency task, Stroop task and unconstrained rest}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. The majority of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
   brain-computer interface (BCI) studies have investigated binary
   classification problems. Limited work has considered differentiation of
   more than two mental states, or multi-class differentiation of
   higher-level cognitive tasks using measurements outside of the anterior
   prefrontal cortex. Improvements in accuracies are needed to deliver
   effective communication with a multi-class NIRS system. We investigated
   the feasibility of a ternary NIRS-BCI that supports mental states
   corresponding to verbal fluency task (VFT) performance, Stroop task
   performance, and unconstrained rest using prefrontal and parietal
   measurements. Approach. Prefrontal and parietal NIRS signals were
   acquired from 11 able-bodied adults during rest and performance of the
   VFT or Stroop task. Classification was performed offline using bagging
   with a linear discriminant base classifier trained on a 10 dimensional
   feature set. Main results. VFT, Stroop task and rest were classified at
   an average accuracy of 71.7\%. +/- .7.9\%. The ternary classification
   system provided a statistically significant improvement in information
   transfer rate relative to a binary system controlled by either mental
   task (0.87. +/- .0.35 bits/min versus 0.73. +/- .0.24 bits/min).
   Significance. These results suggest that effective communication can be
   achieved with a ternary NIRS-BCI that supports VFT, Stroop task and rest
   via measurements from the frontal and parietal cortices. Further
   development of such a system is warranted. Accurate ternary
   classification can enhance communication rates offered by NIRS-BCIs,
   improving the practicality of this technology.}},

Abstract = {{Erosion of concrete surfaces in major civil structures is a common
   problem, which in certain circumstances can undermine the structural and

Abstract = {{State-dependent parallel networks with a common state-cognitive helper
   is studied, in which K transmitters wish to send K messages to their
   corresponding receivers over K state-corrupted parallel channels, and a
   helper who knows the state information noncausally wishes to assist
   these receivers to cancel state interference. Furthermore, the helper
   also has its own message to be sent simultaneously to its corresponding
   receiver. Since the state information is known only to the helper, but
   not to other transmitters, transmitter-side state cognition and
   receiver-side state interference are mismatched. Our focus is on the
   high state power regime, i.e., the state power goes to infinity. Three
   (sub) models are studied. Model I serves as a basic model, which
   consists of only one transmitter-receiver (with state corruption) pair
   in addition to a helper that assists the receiver to cancel state in
   addition to transmitting its own message. Model II consists of two
   transmitter-receiver pairs in addition to a helper, and only one
   receiver is interfered by a state sequence. Model III generalizes model
   I to include multiple transmitter-receiver pairs with each receiver
   corrupted by independent state. For all models, the inner and outer
   bounds on the capacity region are derived, and comparison of the two
   bounds yields characterization of either full or partial boundary of the
   capacity region under various channel parameters.}},

Abstract = {{When lying supine, fluid shifts rostrally from the legs and accumulates
   in the neck, which is a risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea. The
   objective of this study was to model neck fluid accumulation using
   one-time baseline measurements of body fluid, demographics, and
   anthropometrics. Using bioelectrical impedance, leg and neck fluid
   volumes (LFV and NFV) were measured continuously and simultaneously.
   Thirty non-obese adults (13 men) stood quietly for 5 minutes, and then
   lay supine for 90 minutes while fluid volumes were measured. Neck
   circumference (NC) was measured before and after the supine period.
   Results demonstrated that, compared to women, men experienced a greater
   increase in NC after lying supine. Furthermore, baseline LFV at the
   onset of lying supine was significantly correlated with Delta LFV (r =
   0.44, p = 0.014) and Delta NC (r = 0.51, p = 0.008) after 90 minutes
   supine. The findings identify that sex and baseline LFV predict both the

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatibility and force feedback during
   surgical procedures are crucial for developing MRI-guided needle
   insertion system. A new MRI-compatible needle insertion system was
   presented to provide force feedback and image guide for the safety
   during surgeries. An ultrasonic motor (USM) based needle insertion
   system was presented to explore the feasibility of USM as an actuator in
   MRI scanner. The MRI compatibility and performance of the needle
   insertion system have been tested in closed-bore MRI scanner.
   Performance evaluation of system operation includes three main elements:
   (1) safety of the developed system in the MRI room; (2) MRI
   compatibility; and (3) reliability and accuracy of needle insertion
   system. The evaluation of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values shows
   encouraging MRI compatibility of force feedback system and needle
   insertion system. A position deviation of +/- 1 mm was calculated by
   measuring the distance between needle tip and target point. The
   solutions for noise and electromagnetic interference were proven
   effective for the presented system. The MRI compatibility and safety
   were satisfied by calculating the MR images and the position accuracy
   during the insertion system.}},

Title = {{Custom-designed Laser-based Heating Apparatus for Triggered Release of
   Cisplatin from Thermosensitive Liposomes with Magnetic Resonance Image
   Guidance}},

Abstract = {{Liposomes have been employed as drug delivery systems to target solid
   tumors through exploitation of the enhanced permeability and retention
   (EPR) effect resulting in significant reductions in systemic toxicity.
   Nonetheless, insufficient release of encapsulated drug from liposomes
   has limited their clinical efficacy. Temperature-sensitive liposomes
   have been engineered to provide site-specific release of drug in order
   to overcome the problem of limited tumor drug bioavailability. Our lab
   has designed and developed a heat-activated thermosensitive liposome
   formulation of cisplatin (CDDP), known as HTLC, to provide triggered
   release of CDDP at solid tumors. Heat-activated delivery in vivo was
   achieved in murine models using a custom-built laser-based heating
   apparatus that provides a conformal heating pattern at the tumor site as
   confirmed by MR thermometry (MRT). A fiber optic temperature monitoring
   device was used to measure the temperature in real-time during the
   entire heating period with online adjustment of heat delivery by
   alternating the laser power. Drug delivery was optimized under magnetic
   resonance (MR) image guidance by co-encapsulation of an MR contrast
   agent (i.e., gadoteridol) along with CDDP into the thermosensitive
   liposomes as a means to validate the heating protocol and to assess
   tumor accumulation. The heating protocol consisted of a preheating
   period of 5 min prior to administration of HTLC and 20 min heating
   post-injection. This heating protocol resulted in effective release of
   the encapsulated agents with the highest MR signal change observed in
   the heated tumor in comparison to the unheated tumor and muscle. This
   study demonstrated the successful application of the laser-based heating
   apparatus for preclinical thermosensitive liposome development and the
   importance of MR-guided validation of the heating protocol for
   optimization of drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to develop a computational model to
   simulate the dynamics of intraocular gas behavior in pneumatic
   retinopexy (PR) procedure. The presented model predicted intraocular gas
   volume at any time and determined the tolerance angle within which a
   patient can maneuver and still gas completely covers the tear(s).
   Computational fluid dynamics calculations were conducted to describe PR
   procedure. The geometrical model was constructed based on the rabbit and
   human eye dimensions. SF6 in the form of pure and diluted with air was
   considered as the injected gas. The presented results indicated that the
   composition of the injected gas affected the gas absorption rate and gas
   volume. After injection of pure SF6, the bubble expanded to 2.3 times of
   its initial volume during the first 23 h, but when diluted SF6 was used,
   no significant expansion was observed. Also, head positioning for the
   treatment of retinal tear influenced the rate of gas absorption.
   Moreover, the determined tolerance angle depended on the bubble and tear
   size. More bubble expansion and smaller retinal tear caused greater
   tolerance angle. For example, after 23 h, for the tear size of 2 mm the
   tolerance angle of using pure SF6 is 1.4 times more than that of using
   diluted SF6 with 80\% air. Composition of the injected gas and
   conditions of the tear in PR may dramatically affect the gas absorption
   rate and gas volume. Quantifying these effects helps to predict the
   tolerance angle and improve treatment efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Legionella pneumophila, the intracellular pathogen that can cause severe
   pneumonia known as Legionnaire's disease, translocates close to 300
   effectors inside the host cell using Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system.
   The structure and function for the majority of these effector proteins
   remains unknown. Here, we present the crystal structure of the L.
   pneumophila effector Lem10. The structure reveals a multidomain
   organization with the largest C-terminal domain showing strong
   structural similarity to the HD protein superfamily representatives.
   However, Lem10 lacks the catalytic His-Asp residue pair and does not
   show any in vitro phosphohydrolase enzymatic activity, typical for HD
   proteins. While the biological function of Lem10 remains elusive, our
   analysis shows that similar distinct features are shared by a
   significant number of HD domains found in Legionella proteins, including
   the SidE family of effectors known to play an important role during
   infection. Taken together our data point to the presence of a specific
   group of non-catalytic Legionella HD domains, dubbed LHDs, which are
   involved in pathogenesis. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

   30 and 55 degrees C, and the ferric concentration was in a range
   0.02-0.3 M. The results showed that both temperature and ferric sulfate
   concentration had significant effects on the nickel extraction kinetics.
   The shrinking core model (SCM) was applied to the nickel extraction
   data. The rate controlling step was found to be product layer diffusion.
   The Arrhenius plot yielded an activation energy of Ea = 62.12 kJ/mol
   based on apparent reaction rates obtained by the SCM. The reaction order
   with respect to ferric ion was found to be 1 at the high concentration
   range. SEM images of partially leached tailings confirmed the presence
   of elemental sulfur around the pyrrhotite particles, which was
   responsible for the observed non-linear leaching kinetics (diffusion
   control).}},

Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{418-429}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Algae is recognized as a potentially valuable source of biofuels and
   biochemicals; however, a major limitation to commercialization is in the
   high cost of harvesting, de-watering, and downstream processing of
   dilute algae biomass when it is grown planktonically. Growing algae as a
   biofilm offers potential advantages for biomass processing because
   biofilms are immobilized and orders of magnitude more concentrated. For
   these reasons there has been an emerging interest in algae biofilm
   biofuel research over the past several years. Additionally, there has
   been a considerable amount of work on understanding algae biofilms in
   nature, and on using algae biofilm for tertiary wastewater treatment.
   This review paper draws from all of this literature to describe algae
   biofilm composition, and their growth responses to the key environmental
   factors affecting growth and internal lipid concentrations; the emphasis
   being on optimizing biomass and lipid productivity. Additionally, the
   paper summarizes key things known about planktonic algae growth and
   bacterial biofilm growth in order to make inferences about the potential
   growth of algae biofilms. The paper identifies many key knowledge gaps
   in the potential for producing biomass and lipids from algae biofilm
   growth systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Environmental and financial implications of ethanol as a bioethylene
   feedstock versus as a transportation fuel}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Bulk chemicals production from biomass may compete with biofuels for
   low-cost and sustainable biomass sources. Understanding how alternative
   uses of biomass compare in terms of financial and environmental
   parameters is therefore necessary to help ensure that efficient uses of
   resources are encouraged by policy and undertaken by industry. In this
   paper, we compare the environmental and financial performance of using
   ethanol as a feedstock for bioethylene production or as a transport fuel
   in the US life cycle-based models are developed to isolate the relative
   impacts of these two ethanol uses and generate results that are
   applicable irrespective of ethanol production pathway. Ethanol use as a
   feedstock for bioethylene production or as a transport fuel leads to
   comparable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fossil energy consumption
   reductions relative to their counterparts produced from fossil sources.
   By displacing gasoline use in vehicles, use of ethanol as a transport
   fuel is six times more effective in reducing petroleum energy use on a
   life cycle basis. In contrast, bioethylene predominately avoids
   consumption of natural gas. Considering 2013 US ethanol and ethylene
   market prices, our analysis shows that bioethylene is financially viable
   only if significant price premiums are realized over conventional
   ethylene, from 35\% to 65\% depending on the scale of bioethylene
   production considered (80 000 t yr(-1) to 240 000 t yr(-1)). Ethanol use
   as a transportation fuel is therefore the preferred pathway considering
   financial, GHG emissions, and petroleum energy use metrics, although
   bioethylene production could have strategic value if demand-side
   limitations of ethanol transport fuel markets are reached.}},

Abstract = {{We establish upper and lower bounds on the secrecy capacity of the
   degraded Gaussian diamond-wiretap channel, and identify several ranges
   of channel parameters where these bounds coincide with useful
   intuitions. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of the presence of an
   eavesdropper on the capacity. We consider the following two scenarios:
   1) common randomness is available at the source and the two relays and
   2) randomness is available only at the source, and there is no
   randomness at the relays. Our upper bounds are established by taking
   into account the correlation between the two relay signals and the
   available randomness at the encoders, which generalize the techniques
   recently developed for the case without secrecy constraint. For the
   lower bounds, we propose two types of coding schemes: 1)
   decode-and-forward schemes where the relays cooperatively transmit the
   message and the fictitious message and 2) partial decode-and-forward
   schemes incorporated with multicoding in which each relay sends an
   independent partial message and the whole or partial fictitious message
   using dependent codewords.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Assuming a network of infinite extent, several researchers have analyzed
   small-cell networks using a Poisson point process (PPP) location model,
   leading to simple analytic expressions. The general assumption has been
   that these results apply to finite-area networks as well. However, do
   the results of infinite-area networks apply to finite-area networks? In
   this paper, we answer this question by obtaining an accurate
   approximation for the achievable signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
   (SINR) and user capacity in the downlink of a finite-area network with a
   fixed number of access points (APs). The APs are uniformly distributed
   within the area of interest. Our analysis shows that, crucially, the
   results of infinite-area networks are very different from those for
   finite-area networks of low-to-medium AP density. Comprehensive
   simulations are used to illustrate the accuracy of our analysis. For
   practical values of signal transmit powers and AP densities, the
   analytic expressions capture the behavior of the system well. As an
   added benefit, the formulations developed here can be used in parametric
   studies for network design. Here, the analysis is used to obtain the
   required number of APs to guarantee a desired target capacity in a
   finite-area network.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate why holding times on 2
   different tests of isometric trunk flexor endurance capacity (prone
   plank and v-sit) are weakly correlated. Body position and ground
   reaction force data from 10 men and 10 women were used to conduct static
   biomechanical analyses of both test postures, and bilateral activations
   of the rectus abdominis, internal and external obliques, latissimus
   dorsi, and lumbar and thoracic erector spinae were measured in a second
   sample of 15 men and 15 women while holding the test postures. No
   between-posture differences in net low back flexor moments were found (P
   = .111), but the lumbar spine was 28 more flexed in the v-sit than in
   the plank (P < .001). No between-posture differences were detected in
   the rectus abdominis (P = .397), external obliques (P = .204), internal
   obliques (P = .226), or lumbar erector spinae (P = .116) activation
   levels, but those of the thoracic erector spinae (P = .0253) and
   latissimus dorsi (P < .001) were greater in the plank than in the v-sit.
   Altogether, the findings suggest that differences between plank and
   v-sit holding times are most likely related to between-test differences
   in lumbar spine postures and shoulder demands.}},

Title = {{The Effect of Acoustic Impedance on Subsurface Absorber Geometry
   Reconstruction using 1D Frequency-Domain Photoacoustics}},
Journal = {{PHOTOACOUSTICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{132-142}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers the effect of an impedance mismatch between the
   absorber and its surroundings on the aborber reconstructions from the
   photoacoustic signal profile, in particular when a non-delta input pulse
   is used. A transfer function approach is taken, demonstrating in the
   case of impedance mismatch how the total response can be modeled using
   the sum of the mismatch-free response and its time-delayed,
   time-reversed replicas, which may or may not overlap. It is shown how
   this approach can be exploited to accommodate the effects of non-delta
   pulses and/or pulse-equivalent waveforms such as
   linear-frequency-modulated (LFM) chirps, and impedance mismatches in any
   inversion algorithms, even in the presence of large reflection
   coefficients. As a consequence, for simple-absorber reconstruction
   algorithms that assume impulses or `short enough' pulses, the
   compressive portion of the measured response may be used in
   reconstruction formulas that do not model the impedance mismatch,
   regardless of the size of the mismatch. For longer-duration input
   waveforms, it is demonstrated how existing reconstruction methods can be
   successfully adapted to include the effect of the impedance mismatch.
   Simulations are used to illustrate these ideas. The gained physical
   insight into how components of the generated pressure wave carry
   absorber information is then exploited for signal inversion and absorber
   reconstruction in the frequency domain when multi-frequency modulation
   chirps are used for photoacoustic radar pressure measurements. The

Abstract = {{Melt blending is one of the most promising techniques for eliminating
   poly(lactic acid)'s (PLA) numerous drawbacks. However, success in a
   typical melt blending process is usually achieved through the inclusion
   of high concentrations of a second polymeric phase which can compromise
   PLA's green nature. In a pioneering study, we introduce the production
   of in situ microfibrillar PLA/polyamide-6 (PA6) blends as a
   cost-effective and efficient technique for improving PLA's properties
   while minimizing the required PA6 content. Predominantly biobased
   products, with only 3 wt \% of in situ generated PA6 microfibrils
   (diameter approximate to 200 nm), were shown to have dramatically
   improved crystallization kinetics, mechanical properties, melt
   elasticity and strength, and foaming-ability compared with PLA.
   Crucially, the microfibrillar blends were produced using an
   environmentally friendly and cost-effective process. Both of these
   qualities are essential in guarantying the viability of the proposed
   technique for overcoming the obstacles associated with the vast
   commercialization of PLA.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of independent water clusters within the gas diffusion
   layer (GDL) is an important, yet poorly understood, characteristic of
   polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. A better understanding of these

   the literature. Synchrotron based X-ray radiography was employed
   visualize liquid water emerging from the polymer electrolyte membrane
   fuel cell GDL. Droplet formations, entitled ``breakthrough{''} events
   originated from either the channel or landing regions of the GDL. The
   number of breakthrough events in a given area (breakthrough density)
   provides insight into the size and number of independent water clusters
   evolving within the GDL. Water clusters were found under the flow field
   landings more frequently than under the gas channels. Each 1 mm(2) of
   projected GDL area was found to have 1-2 individual water clusters
   during most conditions studied, regardless of the GDL substrate or MPL
   type. The existence of percolating water clusters under flow field
   channels depended on the combination of GDL type and operating
   conditions employed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Linear and long chain branched (LCB) polylactide (PLA) clay
   nanocomposites were prepared via melt compounding using a twin-screw
   extruder. An organo-modified clay, Cloisite 30B, and a chain extender,
   Joncryl, were employed in this study. The resulting systems were also
   foamed in a conventional injection molding machine using a chemical
   blowing agent, namely activated azodicarbonamide. The PLA crystallinity,
   clay dispersion, and foam cellular morphology were characterized. Unlike
   the linear PLA, the addition of nanoclay markedly reduced the
   crystallinity of the LCB-PLA The clay inclusion as well as the LCB
   structure generally decreased the cell size and foam density, while
   increasing the cell density. The mechanical properties of the unfoamed
   and foamed linear and LCB-PLA samples and their corresponding
   nanocomposites were also characterized by tensile and Izod impact
   testing. The corresponding results revealed that the LCB-PLA
   nanocomposite with 0.5 wt\% clay loading exhibited a significantly
   improved cellular structure in comparison with other foamed samples,
   leading to increased values of the specific modulus, tensile and impact
   strength. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{HYDROMETALLURGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{158}},
Pages = {{180-185}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The present research evaluated lanthanide desorption levels from
   ion-adsorption clays subjected to thermal pretreatment at various
   temperatures in the range 100-900 degrees C. The authors identified
   macro- and micro-structural changes occurring in the clays during
   heating and related the observed trends to the water content and rare
   earth elements (REE) desorption behavior during subsequent ion exchange
   leaching, in order to gain a better understanding of how temperature and
   moisture may affect the overall REE recovery, hence impacting the ore
   processing route.
   It was found that the total lanthanide extraction from clays pre-heated
   in the range 100-300 degrees C increased with the temperature, then
   decreased drastically, reaching near-zero levels for the range 700-900
   degrees C. This trend was explained in terms of improved clay
   permeability achieved upon elimination of pore and adsorbed water
   molecules in the interval 100-300 degrees C, which facilitated better
   lixiviant access to the REE adsorption sites. The subsequent decrease in
   REE extraction in the interval 300-900 degrees C was related to the loss
   of hydroxyl groups from the aluminosilicate matrix (dehydroxylation),
   resulting in irreversible REE fixation to the surface and major
   structural changes such as layer collapse, loss of crystal structure and
   vitrification, with the ultimate result of completely blocking lixiviant
   access to the adsorbed cations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{nZVI injection into variably saturated soils: Field and modeling study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{183}},
Pages = {{16-28}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Nano-scale zero valent iron (nZVI) has been used at a number of
   contaminated sites over the last decade. At most of these sites,
   significant decreases in contaminant concentrations have resulted from
   the application of nZVI. However, limited work has been completed
   investigating nZVI field-scale mobility. In this study, a field test was
   combined with numerical modeling to examine nZVI reactivity along with
   transport properties in variably saturated soils. The field test
   consisted of 142 L of carboxymethyle cellulose (CMC) stabilized
   monometallic nZVI synthesized onsite and injected into a variably
   saturated zone. Periodic groundwater samples were collected from the
   injection well; as well as, from two monitoring wells to analyze for
   chlorinated solvents and other geochemistry indicators. This study
   showed that CMC stabilized monometallic nZVI was able to decrease
   tricholorethene (TCE) concentrations in groundwater by more than 99\%
   from the historical TCE concentrations. A three dimensional, three
   phase, finite difference numerical simulator, (CompSim) was used to
   further investigate nZVI and polymer transport at the variably saturated
   site. The model was able to accurately predict the field observed head
   data without parameter fitting. In addition, the numerical simulator
   estimated the mass of nZVI delivered to the saturated and unsaturated
   zones and distinguished the nZVI phase (i.e. aqueous or attached). The
   simulation results showed that the injected slurry migrated radially
   outward from the injection well, and therefore nZVI transport was
   governed by injection velocity and viscosity of the injected solution. A
   suite of sensitivity analyses was performed to investigate the impact of
   different injection scenarios (e.g. different volume and injection rate)
   on nZVI migration. Simulation results showed that injection of a higher
   nZVI volume delivered more iron particles at a given distance; however,
   the travel distance was not proportional to the increase in volume.
   Moreover, simulation results showed that using a 1D transport equation
   to simulate nZVI migration in the subsurface may overestimate the travel
   distance. This is because the 1D transport equation assumes a constant
   velocity while pore water velocity radially detreases from the well
   during injection. This study suggests that on-site synthesized nZVI
   particles are mobile in the subsurface and that a numerical simulator
   can be a valuable tool for optimal design of nZVI field applications.

Abstract = {{With the advances in electronics and information technology, China has
   gradually become the largest consumer of household appliances (HAs).
   Increasingly, end-of-life (EOL) HAs are generated in China. EOL
   recycling is a promising strategy to reduce dependence on virgin
   production, and indium is one of the recycled substances. The potential
   yield of indium recycling has not been systematically evaluated in China
   thus far. This paper estimates the potential yield of recycled indium
   from waste liquid crystal displays (LCDs) in China during the period
   from 2015 to 2030. The quantities of indium that will be used to produce
   LCDs are also predicted. The estimates focus on the following three key
   LCD waste sources: LCD TVs, desktop computers and portable computers.
   The results show that the demand for indium will be increasing in the
   near future. It is expected that 350 tonnes of indium will be needed to
   produce LCDs in China in 2035. The indium recycled from EOL LCDs,
   however, is much less than the demand and only accounts for
   approximately 48\% of the indium demand. The sustainable index of indium
   is always less than 0.5. Therefore, future indium recycling efforts
   should focus on the development of recycling technology and the
   improvement of the relevant policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The reactivity of surface-adsorbed species present on copper catalysts
   during methanol synthesis at low temperatures was studied by
   simultaneous infrared spectroscopy (IR) and mass spectroscopy (MS)
   measurements during ``titration{''} (transient surface reaction)
   experiments with isotopic tracing. The results show that adsorbed
   formate is a major bystander species present on the surface under
   steady-state methanol synthesis reaction conditions, but it cannot be
   converted to methanol by reaction with pure H-2 or with H2 plus added
   water. Formate-containing surface adlayers for these experiments were
   produced during steady-state catalysis in (a) H-2:CO2 (with substantial
   formate coverage) and (b) moist H2:CO (with no IR visible formate
   species). These reaction conditions both produce methanol at steady
   state with relatively high rates. Adlayers containing formate were also
   produced by (c) formic acid adsorption. Various ``titration{''} gases
   were used to probe these adlayers at modest temperatures (T = 410-450 K)
   and 6 bar total pressure. Methanol gas (up to 1\% monolayer equivalent)
   was produced in ``titration{''} from the H-2:CO2 catalytic adlayers by
   H-2 plus water, but not by dry hydrogen. The decay in the formate IR
   features accelerated in the presence of added water vapor. The
   H-2:CO:H2O catalytic adlayer produced similar methanol titration yields
   in H-2 plus water but showed no surface formate features in IR (less
   than 0.2\% monolayer coverage). Finally, formate from formic acid
   chemisorption produced no methanol under any titration conditions. Even
   under H-2:CO2 catalytic reaction conditions, isotope tracing showed that
   preadsorbed formate from formic acid did not contribute to the methanol
   produced. Although non-formate species exist during low-temperature
   methanol synthesis on copper which can be converted to methanol gas by
   titration with pure H-2 plus water in sufficient quantities for that
   intermediate to be observable by IR., formate itself is only a
   ``spectator{''} in this reaction and gives no observable methanol upon
   any titration we performed with H-2 or H-2 plus water.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a superiority-inferiority full-infinite mixed-integer
   programming (SFMP) method is developed for analyzing the effect of
   energy conversion efficiency under uncertainty. SFMP can effectively
   tackle uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets, crisp intervals and
   functional intervals, it also can directly reflect relationships among
   multiple fuzzy sets through varying superiority and inferiority degrees
   with a high computational efficiency. Then the developed SFMP is applied
   to a real case of planning energy system for Bayingolin Mongol
   Autonomous Prefecture, where multiple scenarios related to different
   energy-conversion efficiency are concerned. Results for energy
   processing, energy conversion, capacity expansion, pollutant emission
   and system cost have been generated. It is proved that SFMP is an
   effective approach to deal with the uncertainties in energy systems with
   interactive and uncertain characteristics. A variety of uncertainties
   existed in energy conversion processes and impact factors could affect
   the modeling result. Results show that improvement of energy-conversion
   efficiency can effectively facilitate reducing energy resources
   consumption, optimizing energy generation pattern, decreasing capacity
   expansion, as well as mitigating pollutant emissions. Results also
   reveal that, for the study area, electric power has a highest energy
   saving potential among heating, oil processing, coal washing and
   refining. Results can help decision makers to generate desired
   alternatives that can facilitate policy enactment of conversion
   efficiency improvement and adjustment of regional energy structure under
   uncertainty. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{166-174}},

Abstract = {{Object handling has been a challenging operation at the microscale
   level. In order to manipulate these micro-objects within a confined
   workspace, it is inevitably imperative for the handling tool to be
   manipulated along an unobstructed trajectory or path. In addition, the
   presence of undesirable adhesion force can cause the object to adhere to
   the tool, making the release process problematic. This work presents the
   development of an automated dual-arm micromanipulation process to
   overcome these challenges in micro-object handling. The two probes of
   the dual-arm micromanipulation system were individually controlled to
   manipulate a micro-sphere lying on top of a glass substrate. A potential
   field path-planning algorithm was employed to evaluate the paths for
   positioning of the two probes and prevent the probes from undergoing
   collisions. To release the grasped micro-sphere after manipulation with
   minimal adhesion force, the orientations of two probes were reconfigured
   to reduce the contact area with the sphere. Vision images obtained from
   a top-view CCD camera were utilized to evaluate the contour of the
   sphere for automatic reconfiguration of the two probes. Experimental
   results confirmed that the two probes can be manipulated to grasp the
   targeted micro-sphere from arbitrary positions and the incorporation of
   the probe reconfiguration scheme yields a higher success rate for sphere
   release. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{What is the effectiveness of printed educational materials on primary
   care physician knowledge, behaviour, and patient outcomes: a systematic
   review and meta-analyses}},
Journal = {{IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Printed educational materials (PEMs) are commonly used
   simple interventions that can be used alone or with other interventions
   to disseminate clinical evidence. They have been shown to have a small
   effect on health professional behaviour. However, we do not know whether
   they are effective in primary care. We investigated whether PEMs improve
   primary care physician (PCP) knowledge, behaviour, and patient outcomes.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of PEMs developed for PCPs.
   Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials,
   quasi randomized controlled trials, controlled before and after studies,
   and interrupted time series. We combined studies using meta-analyses
   when possible. Statistical heterogeneity was examined, and meta-analysis
   was performed using a random effects model when significant statistical
   heterogeneity was present and a fixed effects model otherwise. The
   template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR) checklist
   was used to assess the quality of intervention description.
   Results: Our search identified 12,439 studies and 40 studies met our
   inclusion criteria. We combined outcomes from 26 studies in eight
   meta-analyses. No significant effect was found on clinically important
   patient outcomes, physician behaviour, or physician cognition when PEMs
   were compared to usual care. In the 14 studies that could not be
   included in the meta-analyses, 14 of 71 outcomes were significantly
   improved following receipt of PEMs compared to usual care. Most studies
   lacked details needed to replicate the intervention.
   Conclusions: PEMs were not effective at improving patient outcomes,
   knowledge, or behaviour of PCPs. Further trials should explore ways to
   optimize the intervention and provide detailed information on the design
   of the materials.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A modified split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system is utilized to
   load Brazilian disc (BD) samples statically, and then exert dynamic load
   to the sample generated by impact. The pulse shaper technique is used to
   generate a slowly rising stress wave to facilitate the dynamic force
   balance in dynamic tests. Five groups of Laurentian granite BD samples
   (with static tensile strength of 12.8 MPa) under the pre-tension of 0
   MPa, 2 MPa, 4 MPa, 8 MPa, and 10 MPa were tested under different loading
   rates. The results show that the rock dynamic tensile strength decreases
   with the increase of the pre-tension. It is also observed that under the
   same pre-tension stress, the dynamic tensile strength increases with the
   loading rate. However, the total tensile strength of the rock is roughly
   independent of the pre-tension. The failure patterns of the samples also
   reveal the rate dependence of the dynamic tensile strength of rocks. (C)

Abstract = {{Adaptive optical systems incorporate active components that compensate
   for wavefront aberrations introduced by optical defects. The quality of
   optical compensation is largely determined by the stroke of the adaptive
   component's underlying actuating mechanism. Development of compact
   polypyrrole trilayer actuator arrays may deliver superior performance
   over conventional active technologies such as electrostatic electrodes
   or piezoelectric actuators. This study introduces a novel piston-tilt
   mirror apparatus that utilizes low-voltage electroactive polymer
   actuators to reorient a plane mirror. The design of the mirror and its
   ancillary systems are first reported, followed by the polymer synthesis
   procedure and actuator fabrication method. Finally, laser beam steering
   results are provided in the context of an experimental retinal imaging
   system. The outcomes indicate a promising future for electroactive
   polymer-enabled devices in adaptive optical systems with technological
   implications ranging from more powerful astronomical telescopes to

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},

Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{560-575}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) is concerned with the application of
   photovoltaic diodes to harvest electricity from thermal radiation. This
   is achieved through the use of appropriately designed thermal emitters
   which are typically heated to temperatures of more than 800 degrees C.
   Merits of thermophotovoltaics include the prospect of delivering high
   power density compared to solar photovoltaics, fuel versatility,
   portability and capability of around-the-clock operation. The key
   challenges en route to commercialization of TPV technology include low
   heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency, mechanical and
   thermostructural reliability at high temperatures, and cost. Recent
   advances which include the development of photonic crystal emitters,
   miniaturization of TPV systems, and improvement of rare earth oxide
   emitters have contributed to enhancing the performance of TPV systems.
   Further, current research on ultra-low bandgap photovoltaic materials,
   thin film monolithic system design, and global system optimization
   promise additional advances. This article presents an overview of the
   fundamental principles of thermophotovoltaics followed by a review of
   the development of all the main components comprising combustion
   thermophotovoltaic systems. This review also scrutinizes
   state-of-the-art developments, discusses the fundamental and technical
   challenges facing commercial adoption of TPV, and prospects of TPV. (C)

Abstract = {{A metagenomic fosmid expression library established from environmental
   DNA (eDNA) from the shallow hot vent sediment sample collected from the
   Levante Bay, Vulcano Island (Aeolian archipelago) was established in
   Escherichia coli. Using activity-based screening assays, we have
   assessed 9600 fosmid clones corresponding to approximately 350 Mbp of
   the cloned eDNA, for the lipases/esterases/lactamases, haloalkane and
   haloacid dehalogenases, and glycoside hydrolases. Thirty-four positive
   fosmid clones were selected from the total of 120 positive hits and
   sequenced to yield ca. 1360 kbp of high-quality assemblies. Fosmid
   inserts were attributed to the members of ten bacterial phyla, including
   Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Acidobateria, Firmicutes,
   Verrucomicrobia, Chloroflexi, Spirochaetes, Thermotogae,
   Armatimonadetes, and Planctomycetes. Of ca. 200 proteins with high
   biotechnological potential identified therein, we have characterized in
   detail three distinct alpha/beta-hydrolases (LIPESV12\_9, LIPESV12\_24,
   LIPESV12\_26) and one new alpha-arabinopyranosidase (GLV12\_5). All
   LIPESV12 enzymes revealed distinct substrate specificities tested
   against 43 structurally diverse esters and 4 p-nitrophenol carboxyl
   esters. Of 16 different glycosides tested, the GLV12\_5 hydrolysed only
   p-nitrophenol-alpha-(l)-arabinopyranose with a high specific activity of
   about 2.7 kU/mg protein. Most of the alpha/beta-hydrolases were
   thermophilic and revealed a high tolerance to, and high activities in
   the presence of, numerous heavy metal ions. Among them, the LIPESV12\_24
   was the best temperature-adapted, retaining its activity after 40 min of
   incubation at 90 A degrees C. Furthermore, enzymes were active in
   organic solvents (e.g., > 30 \% methanol). Both LIPESV12\_24 and
   LIPESV12\_26 had the GXSXG pentapeptides and the catalytic triads
   Ser-Asp-His typical to the representatives of carboxylesterases of EC
   3.1.1.1.}},

Title = {{Bone's responses to mechanical loading are impaired in type 1 diabetes}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Diabetes adversely impacts many organ systems including the skeleton.
   Clinical trials have revealed a startling elevation in fracture risk in
   diabetic patients. Bone fractures can be life threatening: nearly 1 in 6
   hip fracture patients die within one year. Because physical exercise is
   proven to improve bone properties and reduce fracture risk in
   non-diabetic subjects, we tested its efficacy in type 1 diabetes. We
   hypothesized that diabetic bone's response to anabolic mechanical
   loading would be attenuated, partially due to impaired mechanosensing of
   osteocytes under hyperglycemia. Heterozygous C57BL/6-Ins2(Akita)/J
   (Akita) male and female diabetic mice and their age- and gender-matched
   wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J controls (7-month-old, N = 5-7 mice/group) were
   subjected to unilateral axial ulnar loading with a peak strain of 3500
   mu epsilon at 2 Hz and 3 min/day for 5 days. The Akita female mice,
   which exhibited a relatively normal body weight and a mild 40\%
   elevation of blood glucose level, responded with increased bone
   formation (+6.5\% in Ct.B.Ar, and 4 to 36-fold increase in Ec.BFR/BS and
   Ps.BFR/BS), and the loading effects, in terms of changes of static and
   dynamic indices, did not differ between Akita and WT females (p >= 0.1).
   However, loading-induced anabolic effects were greatly diminished in
   Akita males, which exhibited reduced body weight, severe hyperglycemia
   (+230\%), diminished bone formation (Delta Ct.B.Ar: 0.003 vs. 0.030
   mm(2), p = 0.005), and suppressed periosteal bone appositions (Delta
   Ps.BFR/BS, p = 0.02). Hyperglycemia (25 mM glucose) was further found to
   impair the flow-induced intracellular calcium signaling in MLO-Y4
   osteocytes, and significantly inhibited the flow-induced downstream
   responses including reduction in apoptosis and sRANKL secretion and
   PGE(2) release. These results, along with previous findings showing
   adverse effects of hyperglycemia on osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem
   cells, suggest that failure to maintain normal glucose levels may impair
   bone's responses to mechanical loading in diabetics. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The distribution of biofilm thickness on individual sand grains in a
   two-dimensional sand-filled cell maintained under anaerobic conditions
   was investigated. The cell was inoculated with a mixed microbial culture
   fed with methanol. Concentrations of biomass attached to the sand and
   suspended in the water in the cell were determined by protein analysis.
   The biofilm thickness on individual sand grains was investigated with
   confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and was found to follow a
   normal distribution with a mean range of 59-316 mu and standard
   deviations of 30-77 mu. The bulk average permeability reduction factor
   is 8. To investigate the implications of the variability of biofilm
   thicknesses, four models were used to calculate reductions in porous
   media permeability. Taylor's model predicted a reduction by a factor
   ranging from 14 to 5,000 (from minimum to maximum mean biofilm
   thickness). Vandevivere's model predicted a reduction in permeability by
   a factor ranging from 769 to 3,846 (from minimum to maximum mean biofilm
   thickness). Seki's model did not give physically meaningful results in
   this study. Clement's model predicted reduction by a factor ranging from
   1 to 1.14 over the range of biomass levels observed in the cell. Data on
   the statistical and normal distributions of biofilm thickness in porous
   media, and assessment of their implications with respect to different
   permeability models, could lead to better understanding of the extent of
   bioclogging associated with field implementation of bioremediation of
   contaminants in aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{Modern field-programmable gate array (FPGA) circuit designs often
   contain multiple clocks and complex timing constraints, and achieving
   these constraints requires timing optimization at all stages of the
   computer-aided design (CAD) flow. To our knowledge, no prior published
   work has either described or quantitatively evaluated how to compute
   connection timing criticalities for circuits with multiple timing
   constraints in order to best guide CAD optimization algorithms. While
   single-clock techniques have a simple extension to multi-clock circuits,
   this formulation is not robust for circuits with multiple constraints of
   different magnitudes, or impossible constraints. We describe a robust
   method of timing optimization for circuits with multiple timing
   constraints, implemented in the open-source versatile place and route
   FPGA CAD tool. Our formulation can optimize multiple constraints well,
   even in the case where some constraints are impossible, and achieves
   over 20\% greater clock speed with aggressive constraints than a
   straight-forward extension of single-clock work.}},

Abstract = {{A novel architecture for efficient time and frequency synchronization,
   applied to the long-term evolution (LTE) standard, is proposed. For
   symbol timing, we propose applying a symbol-folding method on top of the
   sign-bit reduction technique, leading to a novel algorithm for the
   cyclic prefix-type recognition in LTE. Following the symbol timing, the
   fractional carrier frequency offset is estimated and compensated using
   an adaptive gain loop, which allows for a high-accuracy compensation in
   a short interval. In the frequency domain, for cell search, we propose a
   sign-bit reduction technique on top of the matched filter method for the
   primary synchronization signal detection. In addition, we propose the
   sign-bit maximum-likelihood sequence detection algorithm for the
   secondary synchronization signal analysis. These methods result in >90\%
   hardware reduction in the cell search compared with the state-of-the-art
   design. Moreover, possible structures for the frequency tracking in LTE
   are investigated leading to an experimental comparison, used to choose
   the best hardware-efficient structure. The proposed architecture is
   fabricated in a 130-nm CMOS technology occupying 0.68 mm(2) of silicon
   area. At 25 degrees C and 1.2 V supply voltage, the fabricated chip
   consumes 34.4 mW at 42 MHz in the time domain and 34.6 mW at 188 MHz in
   the frequency domain. The fabricated and tested synchronizer core proves
   to have an outstanding performance for all defined communication modes
   in LTE.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure for nonlinear analysis of RC slabs and shell structures is
   presented. Cracked RC is treated as an orthotropic material governed by
   a smeared rotating crack procedure and the constitutive formulations of
   the disturbed stress field model. The analysis procedure is implemented
   within the framework of a finite-element program employing layered
   thick-shell elements that consider out-of-plane (through-thickness)
   shear deformations. A simple modification method employing an effective
   shear strain concept is introduced to improve the out-of-plane
   performance of the layered shell element for RC applications. The
   adequacy of the procedure is verified using test data of RC members
   controlled by out-of-plane shear failure mechanisms and elements under
   combined in-plane and out-of-plane loading scenarios. The nonlinear
   finite-element program is shown to be suitable for elements exhibiting
   ductile or brittle responses, and the shear modification method
   introduced is found to be capable of capturing out-of-plane shear

Abstract = {{A number of methods have been proposed that utilize the time-domain

   method is verified with three independent recursive parameter models.

Abstract = {{Greater plant defence is predicted to evolve at lower latitudes in
   response to increased herbivore pressure. However, recent studies
   question the generality of this pattern. In this study, we tested for
   genetically based latitudinal clines in resistance to herbivores and
   underlying defence traits of Oenothera biennis. We grew plants from 137
   populations from across the entire native range of O. biennis.
   Populations from lower latitudes showed greater resistance to multiple
   specialist and generalist herbivores. These patterns were associated
   with an increase in total phenolics at lower latitudes. A significant
   proportion of the phenolics were driven by the concentrations of two
   major ellagitannins, which exhibited opposing latitudinal clines. Our
   analyses suggest that these findings are unlikely to be explained by
   local adaptation of herbivore populations or genetic variation in
   phenology. Rather greater herbivory at high latitudes can be explained
   by latitudinal clines in the evolution of plant defences.}},

Abstract = {{Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) clouds offer diverse instance
   purchasing options. A user can either run instances on demand and pay
   only for what it uses, or it can prepay to reserve instances for a long
   period, during which a usage discount is entitled. An important problem
   facing a user is how these two instance options can be dynamically
   combined to serve time-varying demands at minimum cost. Existing
   strategies in the literature, however, require either exact knowledge or
   the distribution of demands in the long-term future, which significantly
   limits their use in practice. Unlike existing works, we propose two
   practical online algorithms, one deterministic and another randomized,
   that dynamically combine the two instance options online without any
   knowledge of the future. We show that the proposed deterministic (resp.,
   randomized) algorithm incurs no more than 2 - alpha (resp., e/(e - 1 +
   alpha) times the minimum cost obtained by an optimal offline algorithm
   that knows the exact future a priori, where alpha is the entitled
   discount after reservation. Our online algorithms achieve the best
   possible competitive ratios in both the deterministic and randomized
   cases, and can be easily extended to cases when short-term predictions
   are reliable. Simulations driven by a large volume of real-world traces
   show that significant cost savings can be achieved with prevalent IaaS
   prices.}},

   understanding of research findings. The aim of this paper is to carry
   out a sample survey of statistical reporting practices in two journals
   with the highest h5-index scores in the areas of developmental
   disability and rehabilitation. Using a checklist that includes critical
   recommendations by American Psychological Association, we examined 100
   randomly selected articles out of 456 articles reporting inferential
   statistics in the year 2013 in the Journal of Autism and Developmental
   Disorders (JADD) and Research in Developmental Disabilities (RDD). The
   results showed that for both journals, ES were reported only half the
   time (JADD 59.3\%; RDD 55.87\%). These findings are similar to
   psychology journals, but are in stark contrast to ES reporting in
   educational journals (73\%). Furthermore, a priori power and sample size
   determination (JADD 10\%; RDD 6\%), along with reporting and
   interpreting precision measures (CI: JADD 13.33\%; RDD 16.67\%), were
   the least reported metrics in these journals, but not dissimilar to
   journals in other disciplines. To advance the science in developmental
   disability and rehabilitation and to bridge the research-to-practice
   divide, reforms in statistical reporting, such as providing supplemental
   measures to NHST, are clearly needed. Copyright (C) 2015 Wolters Kluwer

Abstract = {{Globally, test methods and requirements in portland cement
   specifications are very similar and, while suitable as manufacturing
   standards, in many respects they do not address the needs of the
   concrete producer. Cement is only one ingredient in the cement paste
   matrix that binds concrete, and all paste matrix components (such as
   pozzolans, slags, ground limestone and chemical admixtures), influence
   concrete performance. Recent developments in standards for cementitious
   materials are reviewed. In addition, new types of binders are being
   developed and used for making concrete, and current test methods cited
   in specifications are not often directly suitable for use in their
   evaluation. Thus, modified or completely new test methods may be needed.
   Due to limited experience with field performance, new specifications for
   novel materials also need to address more than the limits on setting
   time and strength development found in current cement standards. Issues
   related to developing new standards are discussed. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{With the growing awareness of the damage sustained by environment, and
   the nearly-ubiquitous impulse to minimize and counteract this damage,
   the use of renewable (green) resources is becoming increasingly popular.
   Electronic industry continues to produce millions of electronic devices
   daily and the rapid growth of modern technology reduces these devices'
   useable life spans. As a result, it has become increasingly imperative
   to find solutions for recycling these devices. Furthermore, since
   electronic devices are constantly becoming smaller and more powerful,
   accumulating heat concentration further reduces efficiency. Therefore,
   heat dissipation plays a very important role in modern electronic
   packaging applications. Bio-based high thermally conductive Polymeric
   composites seem to be potentially suitable replacements for current
   electronic packaging. These composites promise improved thermal
   management of electronics as well as protection from non-recyclable
   oil-based products in the environment. In this research, parametric
   study on partially bio-based polyamide (PA) in composite with micron
   size hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) platelets were performed. High
   viscosity PA90 and low viscosity PA30, both in composites with high
   thermally conductive hBN, were compared to determine the effect of
   matrix viscosity on mobility and arrangement of hBN particles, as well
   as effective thermal conductivity of the composite. Low viscosity PA30
   consistently maintained higher values of thermal conductivity than the
   PA90. However PA90 shows higher mechanical properties. Furthermore, by
   narrowing down the filler content difference of the sample an
   interesting nonlinear trend between filler content and effective thermal
   conductivity of the composite is observed.}},

Abstract = {{The study of Lignin and Tannin as filler materials in PIA-based
   polymeric systems has been uncommon in literature. Composites of
   PLA-Lignin with 5, 10, 15 wt\% Lignin and PEA-Tannin with 5, 10, 15 wt\%
   Tannin were fabricated using injection moulding. SEM morphology reveals
   Lignin forms droplet like dispersions within the PLA matrix in contrast
   to Tannin. The particle size of Lignin within the matrix is also 10-150
   times smaller than Tannin. Isothermal frequency sweeps on the composites
   show that storage modulus of PEA-Tannin composites starts to degrade at
   15 wt\% filler concentration and damping rises. PLA-Lignin composites do
   not show such degradation in storage modulus. The tensile strength of
   both PLA-Lignin and PEA-Tannin composites falls with increase in filler
   content. Lignin has a more inhibitory effect on PEA crystallization than
   Tannin. The onset of thermal degradation of PLA-Lignin and PLA-Tannin
   composites occurs at slightly lower temperatures than pure PEA. (C) 2015

   maintenance}},
Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{144}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a decision policy for condition-based
   maintenance that schedules inspections according to the current health
   of the system, optimized myopically over the next inspection interval.
   In traditional condition-based maintenance practices, regular
   inspections are considered a given requirement. Most measurements,
   however, confirm that the machine in question is in good working order
   and that no maintenance is necessary. We consider the possibility that
   there are savings to be had in the number of inspections that are
   undertaken. As such, we use a proportional hazards model for risk of
   failure and a Markovian process to model the system covariates. The cost
   and time of inspections are incorporated into our model, and an optimal
   decision for one interval is made. This process can be repeated for each
   decision point, resulting in a decision policy that produces an
   inspect-or-replace result and an optimal time for the next inspection.
   Applied over the life of an asset, this policy can be used as a complete
   condition monitoring program supporting evidence based asset management.

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{256-266}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this work, the binding between sodium oleate (SO), sodium laurate
   (SL), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and sodium dodecylphosphonate (SDP)
   and iron oxide nanoparticles was systematically investigated using
   isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Comparing the heat exchanged
   during the isothermal titration with the corresponding surfactant
   adsorption isotherm, in the cases of SO and SDP, a strong binding takes
   place at low surfactant concentrations. The binding enthalpy at this low
   surfactant concentrations depends on the type of surfactant anionic head
   group. For C12 surfactants, the phosphonate group produced the strongest
   endothermic binding, followed by the exothermic binding with the
   carboxylate group, followed by weak exothermic interaction with the
   sulfate group. For carboxylate surfactants, longer surfactant tails
   result in larger exothermic binding. Surfactants that exhibited large
   binding enthalpies also produced more stable suspensions. The Langmuir
   (L), Freundlich (F), and Langmuir-Freundlich (L-F) adsorption models
   were used to interpret the adsorption isotherms during the titration
   with sodium oleate. The L-F adsorption isotherm model was selected to
   calculate the heat of the formation of the SO monolayer and bilayer on
   the iron oxide nanoparticles. The L-F model reflects the finite or
   limited adsorption of the Langmuir model, but accounts for
   non-homogeneous adsorption of the Freundlich model that help account for
   surfactant self-assembly before and after adsorption. Coupling the
   adsorption model with the titration data is possible to calculate the
   real heat of adsorption of the surfactants on the metal oxide. (C) 2015

   problems: 1- One-dimensional advection-dispersion equation with reaction
   under advection-dominated conditions, and 2- One-dimensional pure
   advection equation with reaction. A triangular explicit PFA (EPFA)
   spatial-temporal computational molecule was developed. The EPFA
   solutions were compared with solutions from the quadratic upwind
   differencing (QUICK) scheme. For both cases, the EPFA solution gives
   accurate results as long as the Courant (Cr) was close to one. Stability
   analysis shows that the EPFA molecule is always stable for high Pe
   number.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate interrogation of a large-capacity sensor array with
   nearly identical weak fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) based on
   frequency-shifted interferometry (FSI). In contrast to time-division
   multiplexing, FSI uses continuous-wave light and therefore requires no
   pulse modulation or high-speed detection/acquisition. FSI utilizes a
   frequency shifter in the Sagnac interferometer to encode sensor location
   information into the relative phase between the clock-wise and
   counter-clockwise propagating lightwaves. Sixty-five weak FBGs with
   reflectivities in the range of -31 similar to-34 dB and with near
   identical peak reflection wavelengths around 1555 nm at room temperature
   were interrogated simultaneously. Temperature sensing was conducted and
   the average measurement accuracy of the peak wavelengths was +/- 3.9 pm,
   corresponding to a temperature resolution of +/- 0.4 degrees C. Our
   theoretical analysis taking into account of detector noise, fiber loss,
   and sensor cross-talk noise shows that there exists an optimal
   reflectivity that maximizes multiplexing capacity. The multiplexing
   capacity can reach 3000 with the corresponding sensing range of 30 km,
   when the peak reflectivity of each grating is -40 dB, the sensor
   separation 10 m and the source power 14 mW. Experimental results and
   theoretical analysis reveal that FSI has distinct cost and speed
   advantages in multiplexing large-scale FBG networks. (C) 2015 Optical

Abstract = {{The growing technology industry has led to the steady enhancement of
   expert systems, often at the cost of increased complexity for the
   systems' end users. Efforts to improve the prescriptive elements of
   systems, however, often prove unsuccessful, since the nature of complex
   and high-dimensional decision problems is difficult to capture precisely
   by models and algorithms. To rectify this deficiency, complementary
   softwares may be used to accept decision-making input from users. In
   this paper, we introduce a graphical interface-based multi-criteria
   decision support system for designing radiation therapy treatment plans.
   While many automated strategies for treatment plan generation exist in
   the literature, they often require a large amount of iteration and a
   priori decision-making in practice, so much of the planning is done
   manually. Our interface, morDiRECT (the Medical Operations Research
   Laboratory's Display for Ranking and Evaluating Customized Treatments)
   uses the variability associated with the planning parameters to generate
   diverse plan sets automatically, creating a comprehensive and visible
   decision space for users. We demonstrate morDiRECT's generation process,
   built-in analytical tooling and graphical display using four clinical
   case studies. In three cases, we find plans that fully dominate the
   benchmark forward plans, as well as additional plans that possess
   potentially desirable tradeoffs for all cases. Our results demonstrate
   that with relatively little upfront effort, users can pre-generate and
   choose from a diverse set of clinically acceptable plans, leading to
   reliable treatments for head-and-neck patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The work hardening behavior of electrodeposited nanocrystalline nickel
   (29 and 19 nm) was investigated under multiaxial loading and compared
   with coarse-grained nickel. Plastic strain gradients were introduced
   into the materials using large Rockwell D hardness indentations, and
   measured through cross-sectional hardness profiles. The results showed
   that the coarse-grained material exhibited substantial hardening up to
   twice the hardness of the deformation-free area due to dislocation
   mediated deformation, while the nanocrystalline materials displayed
   small hardness variations along the strain gradient, indicative of
   considerably reduced dislocation interactions. Moreover, the grain
   structure analysis (cumulative volume fraction and size distribution)
   for the nanocrystalline materials suggested the operation of both
   dislocation mediated and grain boundary controlled deformation
   mechanisms, the latter becoming more significant with increasing
   cumulative sample volume of very small grains. The plastic deformation
   zone sizes under Rockwell indentation of the 29 nm Ni are similar to
   those conventional materials with reduced strain hardening.
   Microhardness-indentation size effects were negligible in both the
   nanocrystalline and coarse-grained materials.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the relationship between modal accessibility and
   the home-work spatial configuration of two-commuter households in an
   urban area. The home-work spatial configuration is captured by: (a)
   total commuting distance of the two commuters (from home to work) and
   (b) the angle between the two work locations (as measured from the
   common home location). The household travel survey data of 2011 of the
   National Capital Region is used for the empirical investigation. The
   empirical investigation reveals that higher modal accessibility
   increases the angle and reduces the total commuting distance. This
   investigation also reveals that certain two-commuter households are not
   able to optimise their home location in terms of widening the angles and
   reducing total distances. A correlation between total commuting distance
   and angle between work locations is observed such that angle decreases
   as the distance between home location and the Central Business District
   (CBD) increases. We infer that two-commuter households located far from
   the CBD live in predominantly residential areas that lack employment
   centres. As such, land use policies should guide development in areas
   far from the CBD towards mixed land uses. These findings are useful for
   urban transportation and land use planning since the proportion of
   two-commuter households is increasing in many urban areas.}},

Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Flow of soft matter objects through one-dimensional environments is
   important in industrial, biological and biomedical systems. Establishing
   the underlying principles of the behavior of soft matter in confinement
   can shed light on its performance in many man-made and biological
   systems. Here, we report an experimental and theoretical study of
   translocation of micrometer-size hydrogels (microgels) through
   microfluidic channels with a diameter smaller than an unperturbed
   microgel size. For microgels with different dimensions and mechanical
   properties, under a range of applied pressures, we established the
   universal principles of microgel entrance and passage through
   microchannels with different geometries, as well as the reduction in
   microgel volume in confinement. We also show a non-monotonic change in
   the flow rate of liquid through the constrained microgel, governed by
   its progressive confinement. The experimental results were in agreement
   with the theory developed for non-linear biaxial deformation of
   unentangled polymer gels. Our work has implications for a broad range of
   phenomena, including occlusion of blood vessels by thrombi and
   needle-assisted hydrogel injection in tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{In diabetic patients the development of chronic non-healing wounds is a
   common complication. A methacrylic acid-based biomaterial is a vascular
   regenerative material that enhances diabetic healing without the use of
   cells or growth factors. The bioactive nature of this material is
   thought to be associated with its anionic charge or surface chemistry.
   Contact between the methacrylic acid-based biomaterial and tissue begins
   with protein (including complement) adsorption and is followed by
   interaction of the biomaterial with resident and infi ltrating cells in
   the wound bed (e.g., macrophages and endothelial cells). This results in
   changes to their surface receptors to activate phosphorylation cascades
   that lead to differential activation of signalling pathways such as
   those involving osteopontin and sonic hedgehog. These changes modulate
   the phenotype of the cells in the wound bed, eventually improving vessel
   formation and wound healing. Understanding the molecular and cellular
   mechanisms will have broad implications for biomaterials, not just the
   methacrylic acid-based material, and will facilitate the advancement of
   regenerative biomaterials for diverse applications.}},

Abstract = {{Throttling water pressure transforms useful mechanical energy into heat
   via a thermodynamically irreversible process. Alternatively, energy
   recovery hydro turbines or pumps as turbines can be used to generate
   power from excess water pressure. This study investigates the influence
   of water system and turbine characteristics on the economic feasibility
   of energy recovery turbines and develops general design principles that
   benefit infrastructure planners who may consider energy recovery within
   water systems. Results indicate economic feasibility is predictably
   influenced by a variety of factors. For instance, service reservoirs can
   decrease the levelized cost of electricity in the range of 10\% and
   provide some generation dispatchability. Smaller turbines decrease the
   levelized cost of electricity in the range of 30\%, but sacrifices
   energy recovery potential. Although challenges exist, energy recovery
   turbines can be an economical, flexible, and renewable option for
   controlling pressure and deserve serious consideration within some water

Abstract = {{The critical strain energy release rate for the solder joint fracture
   was measured as a function of the strain rate and the mode ratio of
   loading. These data are useful in predicting the fracture of solder
   joints loaded under arbitrary combinations of tension and shear during
   the impact conditions typical of falling portable electronic devices. In
   this study, strain rates from quasi-static (close to 0 s(-1)) to 61
   s(-1) were investigated at phase angles from 0 to 60 degrees, typical of
   the range found in microelectronic devices. Copper-solder-copper double
   cantilever beam (DCB) model specimens were prepared using SAC305 solder
   at cooling rates and times above liquidus typical of actual ball grid
   arrays (BGAs). A drop tester was designed and built to achieve different
   strain rates at various mode ratios. The critical initiation strain
   energy release rate, Jci, increased about 70\% from quasi-static to
   intermediate strain rates, before decreasing by more than 67\% from
   intermediate strain rates to 42 s(-1). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new framework for the design of transmit and
   receive beamformers for interference alignment (IA) without symbol
   extensions in multi-antenna cellular networks. We consider IA in a cell
   network with users/cell, antennas at each base station (BS) and antennas
   at each user. The proposed framework is developed by recasting the
   conditions for IA as two sets of rank constraints, one on the rank of
   interference matrices, and the other on the transmit beamformers in the
   uplink. The interference matrix consists of all the interfering vectors
   received at a BS from the out-of-cell users in the uplink. Using these
   conditions and the crucial observation that the rank of interference
   matrices under alignment can be determined beforehand, this paper
   develops two sets of algorithms for IA. The first part of this paper
   develops rank minimization algorithms for IA by iteratively minimizing a
   weighted matrix norm of the interference matrix. Different choices of
   matrix norms lead to reweighted nuclear norm minimization (RNNM) or
   reweighted Frobenius norm minimization (RFNM) algorithms with
   significantly different per-iteration complexities. Alternately, the
   second part of this paper devises an alternating minimization (AM)
   algorithm where the rank-deficient interference matrices are expressed
   as a product of two lower-dimensional matrices that are then alternately
   optimized. Simulation results indicate that RNNM, which has a
   per-iteration complexity of a semidefinite program, is effective in
   designing aligned beamformers for proper-feasible systems with or
   without redundant antennas, while RFNM and AM, which have a
   per-iteration complexity of a quadratic program, are better suited for
   systems with redundant antennas.}},

Abstract = {{Transcranial Doppler Ultrasonography (TCD) is an emerging brain-computer
   interface (BCI) modality. Previous offline studies have demonstrated
   algorithmic differentiation between two mental tasks with accuracies in
   excess of chance, but have used computationally sophisticated features
   and classifiers. A preferred approach for eventual online implementation
   has not yet been identified. In this study, we conducted an offline
   analysis of TCD recordings to investigate the potential for increasing
   accuracy in a TCD-based BCI while adhering to features and classifiers
   computationally conducive to online implementation. We re-examined blood
   flow velocities from Lu et al. (2014), recorded from the left and right
   middle cerebral arteries of 10 able-bodied participants during the
   performance of two different mental activities (mental spelling and
   visual tracking). Invoking a signal processing and pattern
   classification method from previous offline TCD studies, we obtained an
   average accuracy of 73.32 +/- 4.09\%. We subsequently compared
   systematic feature selection approaches (Fisher criterion, sequential
   forward selection, weighted sequential forward selection) and three
   classifiers, namely, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Naive Bayes
   (NB), and support vector machine (SVM). With the combination of weighted
   sequential forward selection (WSFS), which yielded less than a handful
   of time domain features, and a SVM classifier, a maximum accuracy of
   87.60 +/- 3.27\% was attained. Similar results were achieved with
   sequential forward selection and a SVM classifier. Our findings support
   the development of highly accurate online TCD-BCIs with computationally
   simple features. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work was dedicated to the investigation of the strengthening
   effects of soy-based rigid polyurethane (PU) foam cores, neat and
   composite foams containing wood fiber, on the performance of small-scale
   wooden wall panels under monotonic and static cyclic shear loads. Adding
   wood fiber resulted in a reduction in the density (23\%) and compressive
   strength (63\%) of the foam while specific tensile modulus, ratio of
   tensile modulus to density of foam, increased about 39\%. Both monotonic
   and static cyclic shear tests showed that inclusion of the composite
   foam core increased the maximum strength of panels significantly. Panels
   containing composite foam cores had an average shear strength of 12.0 kN
   compared to 10.7 kN and 8.0 kN for panels with neat foam and empty
   panels, respectively. The results of this research demonstrated for the
   first time that, in addition to their thermal insulation capabilities,
   soy-based rigid PU foams significantly contribute to the shear strength
   of wooden wall panels. This characteristic is important especially in
   the construction of residential and low-rise commercial buildings. (C)

Abstract = {{The hydrophobicity of surfactants has been described through different
   concepts used to guide the formulation of surfactant-water (SW) and
   surfactant-oil-water (SOW) systems. An integrated framework of
   hydrophobicity indicators could provide a complete tool for surfactant
   characterization, and insights on how their relationship may influence
   the overall phase behavior of the system. The hydrophilic-lipophilic
   difference (HLD) and the characteristic curvature (Cc) parameter,
   included in the HLD, have been shown to correlate with different
   hydrophobicity indicators including the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance
   (HLB), packing factor (Pf), phase inversion temperature (PIT),
   spontaneous curvature (Ho), surfactant partition (Ko-w), and the
   critical micelle concentration (CMC). This work aims to investigate
   whether the HLD can further describe a concomitant hydrophobicity
   parameter, the cloud point (CP) of alkyl ethoxylates. After applying
   group contribution models to calculate the Cc of monodisperse (pure)
   nonionic alkyl ethoxylates, a linear correlation between the calculated
   Cc and the CP was observed for pure surfactants with 8 ethylene oxide
   (EO) units or less. Furthermore, using an apparent equivalent alkane
   carbon number (EACN) to represent the hydrophobicity of the micelle
   core, the HLD equation was capable of predicting cloud point
   temperatures of pure alkyl ethoxylates, typically within 5 degrees C.
   Polydisperse surfactants did not follow the linear CP-Cc correlation
   found for pure surfactants. After treating polydisperse samples using a
   liquid-liquid extraction procedure used to remove the most hydrophobic
   components in the mixture, the resulting treated surfactants fell in the
   correlation line of pure alkyl ethoxylates. A closer look at the
   partition behavior of these treated surfactants showed that their
   partition, Cc and cloud point are dominated by the most abundant
   ethoxymers in the treated surfactant. The HLD also predicted the cloud
   point depression of treated surfactants with increasing sodium chloride
   concentration. This work shows how the HLD framework could be extended
   to predict the behavior of SW systems.}},

Title = {{Trunk muscle co-activation using functional electrical stimulation
   modifies center of pressure fluctuations during quiet sitting by
   increasing trunk stiffness}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},

Abstract = {{Background: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of
   functional electrical stimulation (FES) induced co-activation of trunk
   muscles during quiet sitting. We hypothesized that FES applied to the
   trunk muscles will increase trunk stiffness. The objectives of this
   study were to: 1) compare the center of pressure (COP) fluctuations
   during unsupported and FES-assisted quiet sitting - an experimental
   study and; 2) investigate how FES influences sitting balance - an
   analytical (simulation) study.
   Methods: The experimental study involved 15 able-bodied individuals who
   were seated on an instrumented chair. During the experiment, COP of the
   body projected on the seating surface was calculated to compare sitting
   stability of participants during unsupported and FES-assisted quiet
   sitting. The analytical (simulation) study examined dynamics of quiet
   sitting using an inverted pendulum model, representing the body, and a
   proportional-derivative (PD) controller, representing the central
   nervous system control. This model was used to analyze the relationship
   between increased trunk stiffness and COP fluctuations.
   Results: In the experimental study, the COP fluctuations showed that: i)
   the mean velocity, mean frequency and the power frequency were higher
   during FES-assisted sitting; ii) the frequency dispersion for
   anterior-posterior fluctuations was smaller during FES-assisted sitting;
   and iii) the mean distance, range and centroidal frequency did not
   change during FES-assisted sitting. The analytical (simulation) study
   showed that increased mechanical stiffness of the trunk had the same
   effect on COP fluctuations as the FES.
   Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that FES applied to the
   key trunk muscles increases the speed of the COP fluctuations by
   increasing the trunk stiffness during quiet sitting.}},

Abstract = {{DNA analysis is essential for diagnosis and monitoring of many diseases.
   Conventional DNA testing is generally limited to the laboratory.
   Increasing access to relevant technologies can improve patient care and

   direct DNA analysis in paper-based devices, uniquely enabled by ion
   concentration polarization at the interface of patterned nanoporous
   membranes in paper (paper-based ICP). Hepatitis B virus DNA targets in
   human serum are simultaneously preconcentrated, separated, and detected
   in a single 10 mm operation. A limit of detection of 150 copies/mL is
   achieved without prior viral load amplification, sufficient for early
   diagnosis of hepatitis B. We clinically assess the DNA integrity of
   sperm cells in raw human semen samples. The percent DNA fragmentation
   results from the paper-based ICP devices strongly correlate (R-2 = 0.98)
   with the sperm chromatin structure assay. In all cases, agreement was
   100\% with respect to the clinical decision. Paper-based ICP can provide

Abstract = {{Lack of clean water in small remote communities in the developing world
   is a major health problem. Water purification and desalination systems
   powered by solar energy, such as photovoltaic powered reverse osmosis
   systems (PVRO), are potential solutions to the clean water problems in
   these small communities. PVRO systems have been proposed for various
   locations. However, small PVRO systems with production on the order of 1
   m(3)/day for remote communities present some unique technical, cost and
   operational problems. This paper reports on a project in which a PVRO
   system is designed, fabricated and deployed in remote village in the
   Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The community residents are indigenous
   people who are subsistence farmers and beekeepers. Technical and
   economic models used to configure the system for the community are
   presented. A plan is developed in cooperation with the community aimed
   at making the system self-sustaining in the long term. Methods and
   materials are developed to permit the community members to operate and
   maintain the system themselves. The results provide insights for the
   design and deployment of small community-scale PVRO systems in remote

Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{18-28}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Knowing the efficiency of a hydraulic turbine has important operational
   and financial benefits to those who operate a plant. Historical
   efficiency and other data on turbine performance are essential for the
   informed selection and use of turbines. So having such a database from
   different manufactures is attractive. However, at present it is almost
   impossible to get a universal database to reflect the turbine
   characteristics. This paper reviewed a set of empirical equations to
   replacefull database which defines the peak efficiency and shape of the
   efficiency curve as a function of the commissioning date for the unit,
   rated head, rated flow and other main design parameters. Since the
   design theories, methods and tools of turbines are relatively mature,
   and the majority of turbine manufacturers have reached a level of know
   how which enables them to carry out hydraulically and structurally
   correct units to product high-performance turbines. This paper paid more
   attention to the design factors, which could influence the value of the
   practically attainable overall turbine efficiency. To quantify the
   effects of these factors, this paper investigated the influence of
   roughness and gap clearances on the internal leakage flow rate. Testing
   and CFD are the most two important tools in different design stages.
   This paper reviewed some key ideas and issues on the efficiency research
   in both. At last, improvement measures based on these above mentioned
   design factors were provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Pages = {{529-538}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Algal film photobioreactors have the potential to reduce dewatering
   costs and have a comparable productivity to raceway ponds. Current
   designs have focused on maximizing productivity and nutrient removal
   through material selection and design. However, fewer studies have
   focused on analyzing the effects of illumination and carbon dioxide
   (CO2) concentration on algal film growth. The transport of light in
   suspended photobioreactors is considered a serious problem due to cell
   shading, light scattering and non-uniform optical absorption. To enhance
   light delivery to algal biofilms, five different waveguide designs were
   developed Light emitting waveguides are capable of distributing a bright
   light source over a larger surface area. The light emission from these
   waveguide designs was characterized and the algal biofilm growth on
   waveguides was characterized in a parallel plate airlift reactor (17 L).
   The light intensity and CO2 concentration were varied in a 32 factorial
   design experiment to determine if there were any interaction effects.
   Light emission from the waveguides could be altered by changing the
   tapper angle or by notching the surfaces. Algal film growth kinetics on
   the waveguides were overall non-linear, but had linear regions of
   growth. The waveguides achieved an algal biofilm surface area
   productivity of 2.8 g/m(2) day and an aerial productivity of 33.6 g/m(2)
   day. Algal film productivity displayed saturation kinetics with respect
   to light intensity and CO2 concentration, but the interaction effect of
   light and CO2 on productivity is likely non-linear. Algal film biomass
   per photon consumed decreased with increasing light intensity when the
   reactor was not CO2 limited. The results indicate the potential for
   algal biofilms to be grown on light emitting waveguides which opens up
   the opportunity to explore new algal film photobioreactor
   configurations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{High-resolution In Vivo Manual Segmentation Protocol for Human
   Hippocampal Subfields Using 3T Magnetic Resonance Imaging}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{105}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The human hippocampus has been broadly studied in the context of memory
   and normal brain function and its role in different neuropsychiatric
   disorders has been heavily studied. While many imaging studies treat the
   hippocampus as a single unitary neuroanatomical structure, it is, in
   fact, composed of several subfields that have a complex
   three-dimensional geometry. As such, it is known that these subfields
   perform specialized functions and are differentially affected through
   the course of different disease states. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging
   can be used as a powerful tool to interrogate the morphology of the
   hippocampus and its subfields. Many groups use advanced imaging software
   and hardware (>3T) to image the subfields; however this type of
   technology may not be readily available in most research and clinical
   imaging centers. To address this need, this manuscript provides a
   detailed step-by-step protocol for segmenting the full
   anterior-posterior length of the hippocampus and its subfields: cornu
   ammonis (CA) 1, CA2/CA3, CA4/dentate gyrus (DG), strata
   radiatum/lacunosum/moleculare (SR/SL/SM), and subiculum. This protocol
   has been applied to five subjects (3F, 2M; age 29-57, avg. 37). Protocol
   reliability is assessed by resegmenting either the right or left
   hippocampus of each subject and computing the overlap using the Dice's
   kappa metric. Mean Dice's kappa (range) across the five subjects are:
   whole hippocampus, 0.91 (0.90-0.92); CA1, 0.78 (0.77-0.79); CA2/CA3,
   0.64 (0.56-0.73); CA4/dentate gyrus, 0.83 (0.81-0.85); strata
   radiatum/lacunosum/moleculare, 0.71 (0.68-0.73); and subiculum 0.75
   (0.72-0.78). The segmentation protocol presented here provides other
   laboratories with a reliable method to study the hippocampus and
   hippocampal subfields in vivo using commonly available MR tools.}},

Abstract = {{The Conventional Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm
   has been widely used in many applications, particularly in Direct
   Digital Frequency Synthesizers (DDS) and Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).
   However, CORDIC is constrained by the excessive number of iterations,
   angle data path, and scaling factor compensation. In this article, an
   enhanced adaptive recoding CORDIC (EARC) is proposed. It uses the
   enhanced adaptive recoding method to reduce the required iterations and
   adopts the trigonometric transformation scheme to scale up the rotation
   angles. Computing sine and cosine is used first to compare the core
   functionality of EARC with basic CORDIC; then a 16-bit DDS and a
   1,024-point FFT based on EARC are evaluated to demonstrate the benefits
   of EARC in larger applications. All the proposed architectures are
   validated on a Virtex 5 FPGA development platform. Compared with a
   commercial implementation of CORDIC, EARC requires 33.3\% less hardware
   resources, provides a twofold speedup, dissipates 70.4\% less power, and
   improves accuracy in terms of the Bit Error Position (BEP). Compared to
   the state-of-the-art Hybrid CORDIC, EARC reduces latency by 11.1\% and
   consumes 17\% less power. Compared with a commercial implementation of
   DDS, the dissipated power of the proposed DDS is reduced by 27.2\%. The
   proposed DDS improves Spurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) by nearly 7 dBc
   and dissipates 21.8\% less power when compared with a recently published
   DDS circuit. The FFT based on EARC dissipates a factor of 2.05 less
   power than the commercial FFT even when choosing the 100\% toggle rate
   for the FFT based on EARC and the 12.5\% toggle rate for the commercial
   FFT. Compared with a recently published FFT, the FFT based on EARC
   improves Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) by 8.9 dB and consumes 7.78\% less
   power.}},

Title = {{Deep Brain Stimulation Modulates Gamma Oscillations and Theta-Gamma

Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{1033-1042}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subcallosal cingulate
   gyrus (SCG) is becoming an effective therapeutic option for treatment
   resistant depression (TRD).
   Objective/hypothesis: Identifying the neurophysiological mechanisms
   altered by DBS may lead to more tailored treatment parameters and
   enhanced efficacy.
   Methods: Twenty TRD patients with implanted DBS in the SCG were
   recruited. Patients participated in three EEG recording sessions, one
   with DBS ON, one with DBS randomized to ON or OFF, and one with DBS OFF.
   During each session, subjects performed N-back working memory tasks,
   namely the 0-back and 3-back. Fourteen subjects with valid EEG were
   included in the analysis. Changes in frontal gamma oscillations (30-50
   Hz) and coupling between theta (4-7 Hz) and gamma oscillations as a
   result of DBS stimulation were quantified and correlated with depressive
   symptoms.
   Results: DBS stimulation resulted in suppression of frontal oscillations
   in the ON state relative to the OFF state during the N-back tasks.
   Greatest suppression was demonstrated in beta and gamma oscillations and
   most pronounced during the 3-back. Suppression of gamma oscillations in
   the 3-back correlated with a reduction in depressive symptoms. DBS ON
   relative to OFF in the 3-back also resulted in an increase in
   theta-gamma coupling that correlated with a reduction in depressive
   symptoms.
   Conclusion: Suppression of gamma oscillations and increased theta-gamma
   coupling through DBS is likely mediated by both SCG activation of
   inhibitory circuits and an enhancement of plasticity in the frontal
   cortex. Activation of both pathways may explain the therapeutic
   properties of DBS in TRD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{266-279}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of how city indicators and their
   supporting data are to be published on the Semantic Web so that
   automated analysis can be performed. With the publishing of ISO 37120,
   cities have a standard set of indicators that can be used to compare
   their performance. The problem is that no standards exist for publishing
   indicators on the Semantic Web. In this paper we introduce the Global
   City Indicator Ontology (GCIO). The GCIO addresses five issues: 1) how
   is meta-data associated with a single indicator value represented? 2)
   how are indicator definitions represented? 3) how is the data used to
   derive an indicator value represented? 4) how is indicator theme
   specific knowledge represented, and 5) how is city specific knowledge
   represented? The GCIO has been implemented and validated using the City
   of Toronto ISO 37120 indicators reported for 2013. Research continues in
   developing ontologies specifically for each of the indicator themes such
   as: Education, Shelter, Health, Transportation and Innovation. Crown

Abstract = {{The design of micro-optical resonator arrays are introduced and tailored
   towards refractive index sensing applications, building on the
   previously unexplored benefits of open dielectric stacks. The resonant
   coupling of identical hollow cavities present strong and narrow spectral
   resonance bands beyond that available with a single Fabry Perot
   interferometer. Femtosecond laser irradiation with selective chemical
   etching is applied to precisely fabricate stacked and waveguide-coupled
   open resonators into fused silica, taking advantage of small 12 nm rms
   surface roughness made available by the self-alignment of nanograting
   planes. Refractive index sensing of methanol-water solutions confirm a
   very attractive sensing resolution of 6.5 x 10(-5) RIU. Such high
   finesse optical elements open a new realm of optofluidic sensing and

Abstract = {{As one of the most widely used scarce metals located at the column of
   IIIA in the periodic table, indium has drawn more and more attention due
   to its semiconductor and optoelectronic performance. While the reduction
   of indium minerals, as one of secondary resources, the amount of waste
   liquid crystal display (LCD) has been accumulated considerably. Indium
   tin oxide (ITO) film which is the main functional fraction of LCD has
   consumed more than 70\% of the indium production worldwide. Therefore,
   it is necessary to recycle indium from waste LCDs. Some researches have
   been done for proper treatment to recycle indium from waste LCD which is
   a primary part of waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE).
   In this paper, the main characteristics of indium and the waste
   management status of end-of-life LCDs are introduced. And we mainly
   focus on the highly developed single recycling and reusing techniques.
   In addition, several combined recycling processes are evaluated.
   Furthermore, on the foundation of techniques and processes mentioned
   above, the promising related single techniques and the improvements on
   whole treatment process of waste LCDs are suggested. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The successful fabrication of bulk metallic glasses (BMG) through
   suction casting based on the existing literature is a difficult task due
   to the sensitivity of glass-forming ability (GFA) to small changes in
   processing variables. We report processing challenges and process
   modifications required in the successful and consistent production of
   Zr-Cu-Al-Ni BMGs by arc melting and suction casting. Focus was placed on
   homogenization methods, elemental yields, and the effect of argon purge
   gas and Zr purity on GFA. A ``cut and re-cast{''} homogenization method
   used to reduce oxidation produced good overall homogeneity but resulted
   in the entrainment of an oxide-rich surface layer into the bulk of the
   alloy. Homogenization by multiple melting iterations and prolonged
   melting times was ultimately found to be the most effective method. Zr
   loss was observed in the bulk of the samples post-production. This has
   been attributed to the formation of a Zr/ZrO2 surface layer during
   melting. Using X-ray diffraction and isochronal DSC, both argon gas
   purity and Zr purity were shown to markedly affect GFA. GFA was
   optimized within a specific oxygen concentration range. The highest GFA
   was obtained when using high purity argon (Grade 6.0) and low Zr purity
   (99.5\%). The optimization of GFA in Zr-based BMGs at a critical oxygen
   concentration has not been shown in previous work.}},

Abstract = {{The study of acoustic emissions (AEs) is of paramount importance to
   understand rock deformation processes. AE recorded during laboratory
   experiments mimics, in a controlled geometry and environment, natural
   and induced seismicity. However, these experiments are destructive, time
   consuming and require a significant amount of resources. Lately,
   significant progresses have been made in numerical simulations of rock
   failure processes, providing detailed insights into AE. We utilized the
   2-D combined finite-discrete element method to simulate the deformation
   of Stanstead Granite under varying confining pressure (P-c) and
   demonstrated that the increase of confining pressure, P-c, (i) shifts
   failures from tensile towards shear dominated and (ii) enhance the
   macroscopic ductility. We quantitatively describe the AE activity
   associated with the fracturing process by assessing the spatial fractal
   dimension (D-value), the temporal distribution (AE rate) and the slope
   of the frequency-magnitude distribution (b-value). Based on the
   evaluation of D-value and AE rate, we defined two distinct deformation
   phases: Phase I and Phase II. The influence of Pc on the spatial
   distribution of AE varies according to the deformation phase: for
   increasing P-c, D-value decreases and increases during Phases I and II,
   respectively. In addition, b-value decreases with increasing P-c during
   the entire experiment. Our numerical results show for the first time
   that variations of D- and b-values as a function of in situ stress can
   be simulated using the combined finite-discrete element approach. We
   demonstrate that the examination of seismicity should be carried out
   carefully, taking into consideration the deformation phase and in situ
   stress conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We study joint spectrum allocation and user association in heterogeneous

   spectrum allocation and user association, which is of a non-convex
   programming in nature. A computationally efficient structured spectrum
   allocation and user association (SSAUA) approach is proposed, solving
   the problem optimally and asymptotically optimally in two regions
   divided by a parameter specific threshold. A surcharge pricing scheme
   (SPS) is also presented, such that the designed association bias values
   can be achieved in Nash equilibrium. Simulations and numerical studies
   are conducted to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed

Abstract = {{The corneal nipple structures on the eyes of two nymphalid butterfly
   species (Nymphalis antiopa and Polygonia interrogationis) are analyzed
   in terms of nipple arrangements and associated defects. The nipple
   arrays in both species have close-packed hexagonal lattices with lattice
   parameters of about 200 nm. The most abundant defects observed are 5-7
   coordination defects that generate dislocations, dislocation-type low
   angle and structural unit-like high angle grain boundaries, as well as
   closed-loop defects. These disordered structures are compared with
   imperfections found in other 2D and 3D crystal structures, and it is
   concluded that the defects in the nipple arrays are likely not due to
   random growth accidents. Instead, they could be the result of geometric
   constraints due to eye curvature or serve a yet undiscovered purpose in
   the optical properties of these eyes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Sperm motion near surfaces plays a crucial role in fertilization, but
   the nature of this motion has not been resolved. Using total internal
   reflection fluorescence microscopy, we selectively imaged motile human
   and bull sperm located within one micron of a surface, revealing a
   distinct two-dimensional (2D) `slither' swimming mode whereby the full
   cell length (50-80 mu m) is confined within 1 mu m of a surface. This
   behaviour is distinct from bulk and near-wall swimming modes where the
   flagellar wave is helical and the head continuously rotates. The slither
   mode is intermittent (similar to 1s, similar to 70 mu m), and in human
   sperm, is observed only for viscosities over 20 mPa.s. Bull sperm are
   slower in this surface-confined swimming mode, owing to a decrease in
   their flagellar wave amplitude. In contrast, human sperm are similar to
   50\% faster-suggesting a strategy that is well suited to the highly
   viscous and confined lumen within the human fallopian tube.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid perovskites are promising semiconductors for optoelectronic
   applications. However, they suffer from morphological disorder that
   limits their optoelectronic properties and, ultimately, device
   performance. Recently, perovskite single crystals have been shown to
   overcome this problem and exhibit impressive improvements: low trap
   density, low intrinsic carrier concentration, high mobility, and long
   diffusion length that outperform perovskite-based thin films. These
   characteristics make the material ideal for realizing photodetection
   that is simultaneously fast and sensitive; unfortunately, these
   macroscopic single crystals cannot be grown on a planar substrate,
   curtailing their potential for optoelectronic integration. Here we
   produce large-area planar-integrated films made up of large perovskite
   single crystals. These crystalline films exhibit mobility and diffusion
   length comparable with those of single crystals. Using this technique,
   we produced a high-performance light detector showing high gain (above
   10(4) electrons per photon) and high gain-bandwidth product (above 10(8)
   Hz) relative to other perovskite-based optical sensors.}},

Abstract = {{The electrode performance of three types of selected electrically
   conductive polymers (ECPs), namely polyaniline, polypyrrole (PPy) and
   poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) PEDOT (PSS:PEDOT) composite with
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were investigated in this study.
   The capacitor electrode performance has been examined in both three
   electrodes half-cell and two electrodes device setups. The
   nano-composites were fabricated via polymerization of pseudocapacitive
   conductive monomer onto the MWCNT surface through the in situ chemical
   polymerization approach. Stainless steel thin foils were used as a
   current collector as well as a flexible backbone. Graphite conductive
   ink was used as the binder with the composite powder to form a
   conductive electrode layer. Half-cell electrochemical study was
   conducted to optimize the weight proportion between MWCNT and ECP in
   this parametric study. Two-electrode cell electrochemical study assessed
   the potential performance for the device. MWCNT was found to serve as
   the framework for polymerization of the ECP into a tubular structure.
   Among the three composites, it was discovered that the PPy/MWCNT
   composite has superior capacitor performance up to scan rate of 500 mV

Abstract = {{Routine nerve conduction studies are normal in patients with small fiber
   neuropathy (SFN), and a definitive diagnosis is based on skin biopsy
   revealing reduced intra-epidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD). In large
   fiber polyneuropathy, ultrasound (US) parameters indicate enlargement in
   cross-sectional area (CSA). This study was aimed at determining if
   similar changes in large fibers on US are apparent in patients with SFN.
   Twenty-five patients with SFN diagnosed by reduced IENFD and 25 age-and
   body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy controls underwent US studies of
   sural and superficial peroneal sensory nerves. The mean CSA of the sural
   nerve in SFN patients was 3.2 +/- 0.8 mm(2), and in controls, 2.7 +/-
   0.6 mm(2) (p < 0.0070), and this was independent of sex. There was no
   difference in the thickness-to-width ratio or echogenicity of the
   nerves. US of the sural nerve in patients diagnosed with small fiber
   neuropathy reveals an enlarged cross-sectional area similar to that in
   large fiber polyneuropathy. (E-mail: vera.bril@utoronto.ca) (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The next generation of deformable and shape-conformable electronics
   devices will need to be powered by batteries that are not only flexible
   but also foldable. Here we report a foldable lithium-sulfur (Li-S)
   rechargeable battery, with the highest areal capacity (similar to 3 mAh
   cm(-2)) reported to date among all types of foldable energy-storage
   devices. The key to this result lies in the use of fully foldable and
   superelastic carbon nanotube current-collector films and impregnation of
   the active materials (S and Li) into the current-collectors in a
   checkerboard pattern, enabling the battery to be folded along two
   mutually orthogonal directions. The carbon nanotube films also serve as
   the sulfur entrapment layer in the Li-S battery. The foldable battery
   showed <12\% loss in specific capacity over 100 continuous folding and
   unfolding cycles. Such shape-conformable Li-S batteries with
   significantly greater energy density than traditional lithium-ion
   batteries could power the flexible and foldable devices of the future
   including laptops, cell phones, tablet computers, surgical tools, and
   implantable biomedical devices.}},

Abstract = {{Potassium-catalyzed steam gasification experiments of ash-free,coal were
   conducted in a drop-down reactor to Study the influence of the catalyst
   loading, temperature, H2O/H-2 ratio, and heating protocol. The higher
   the catalyst loading, the faster the,carbon conversion; however, at an
   initial K/C ratio of 0.1, a saturation effect (decrease in reactivity
   per potassium atom) was observed. At higher gasification temperatures,
   this saturation, effect was more pronounced and likely caused by
   increased potassium mobility. The catalyst accelerated predominately the
   oxygen transfer reactions and not the methane formation. Methane is
   produced Via direct hydrogenation of the carbon surface. The selectivity
   to methane and carbon monoxide was increased by reducing the H2O/H-2
   ratio, which would represent conditions in a gasifier away from the gas
   inlet. Lastly, the heating protocol influenced mainly the initial rate
   of gasification, up to 20\% carbon conversion beyond that, the rates
   were similar.}},

Abstract = {{An in-depth investigation was carried-out on five Chinese coals using a
   range of :advanced analytical techniques focused specifically on
   extracting structural parameters. Detailed investigations were carried
   out using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman
   spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction followed by peak deconvolution and
   data analysis. Correlations were established for parameters determined
   from different techniques. The FTIR data Showed good linear
   relationships between the apparent aromaticity (f(a(FTIR))) and (R/C)(u)
   with the H/C atomic ratio for all coals under investigation. These
   results indicate that FTIR: spectroscopy coupled with appropriate,data
   analysis can be successfully used to determine aromaticity and the coal
   : rank Raman spectroscopy data showed a negative linear relationship
   between the CL fraction and H/C ratio; no well-defined relationship was
   observed between other band fractions and the H/C ratio. The decrease of
   A(D)/A(G) with increasing H/C ratio indicates the growth of aromatic
   rings; i.e., the structure of the,sample was closer to that :of
   graphite. This result is in good agreement with the decrease of apparent
   aromaticity (f(a(FTIR))) as by the FTIR spectroscopy. A good linear
   relationship Was observed, between the structural parameters
   (f(a(X-ray)), and RX-ray) determined with X-ray and coal rank
   (represented by the H/C ratio): Even though the correlations among
   parameters derived from three techniques showed a similar trend and were
   consistent with each FUR, and X-ray diffraction techniques were found to
   be better than Raman spectra to Characterize coal maturity.,These
   findings have led to a simplified coal model based On the complementary
   information. from different techniques on various aspects Of the coal

Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The effect of thermal treatment on several physical properties and the
   tensile strength of Laurentian granite (LG) are measured in this study.
   Brazilian disc LG specimens are treated at temperatures of up to 850 A
   degrees C. The physical properties such as grain density, relative
   volume change per degree, and P-wave velocity are investigated under the
   effect of heat treatment. The results indicate that both the density and
   the P-wave velocity decrease with the increase in heating temperature.
   However, the relative volume change per degree is not sensitive below
   450 A degrees C, while a remarkable increase appears from 450 to 850 A
   degrees C. All cases are explained by the increase in both number and
   width of the thermally induced microcracks with the heating temperature.
   Brazilian tests are carried out statically with an MTS hydraulic
   servo-control testing system and dynamically with a modified split
   Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system to measure both static and dynamic
   tensile strength of LG. The relationship between the tensile strength
   and treatment temperatures shows that static tensile strength decreases
   with temperature while the dynamic tensile strength first increases and
   then decreases with a linear increase in the loading rate. However, the
   increase in dynamic tensile strength with treatment temperatures from 25
   to 100 A degrees C is due to slight dilation of the grain boundaries as
   the initial thermal action, which leads to compaction of rock. When the
   treatment temperature rises above 450 A degrees C, the quartz phase
   transition results in increased size of microcracks due to the
   differential expansion between the quartz grains and other minerals,
   which is the main cause of the sharp reduction in tensile strength.}},

Abstract = {{Active and passive ultrasonic methods were used to study the evolution
   of attenuation properties in a sample of Fontainebleau sandstone during
   true-triaxial deformation. A cubic sample of Fontainebleau sandstone (80
   mm 80 mm 80 mm) was deformed under true-triaxial stresses until failure.
   From the stress state: MPa and MPa, was increased at a constant
   displacement rate until the specimen failed. Acoustic emission (AE)
   activity was monitored by 18 piezoelectric sensors and bandpass filtered
   between 100 kHz and 1 MHz. A source location analysis was performed on
   discrete AE data harvested from the continuous record where 48,502
   events were locatable inside the sample volume. AE sensors were
   sequentially pulsed during periodic P-wave surveys among 135 raypaths.
   Analytical solutions for Biot, squirt flow, viscous shear, and
   scattering attenuation were used to discuss to observed attenuation at
   various stages of the experiment. We concluded that initial attenuation
   anisotropy was stress induced and resulted from friction and squirt
   flow. Later attenuation of the high-frequency spectrum was attributed to
   scattering as a result of the formation of large macroscopic vertical
   fractures. Passive (AE) ultrasonic data produced similar information to
   that from active data but with enhanced temporal and spacial resolution.}},

Abstract = {{Diamond channels can model modern wireless communication infrastructure
   that use relays to increase network capacity. This letter investigates
   the effect of conferencing between the relays in a particular class of
   diamond networks with source-to-relay and conferencing channels modeled
   as noiseless bit-pipes of given capacities. A lower bound to the
   capacity for this network and an upper bound that is tighter than the
   cut-set bound are presented. Such networks with specific multiple access
   channel (MAC) types are studied and the minimum conferencing link
   capacity needed to achieve full cooperation for each MAC is ascertained.
   It is found that such minimum conferencing link capacity for the
   Gaussian MAC must be equal to the difference between the full
   cooperation capacity and the backhaul capacity. However, such a result
   does not hold in general as the binary adder MAC illustrates a
   counterexample.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we presented a novel miniature shaftless motor using the
   impact drive mechanism (IDM) that takes advantage of the friction and
   the inertia force to achieve the self-propelling motion. The proposed
   motor uses two U-shaped iron-gallium alloy (Galfenol) rods as the
   driving elements. Besides Galfenol, the motor consists of one permanent
   magnet that provides a bias magnetic field within Galfenol. This bias
   magnetic field helps the motor to generate the swing motion that can
   amplify the inertia force of the IDM motor. By controlling swing
   directions of two motor arms through the driving current, the consistent
   rotation of the motor is accomplished. The experimental result indicates
   that the proposed motor is able to achieve an angular velocity of 12.74
   degrees/s at 230 Hz. Because of the unique design of the motor, the
   motor can achieve a linear movement, and the result is briefly reported.
   The objective of future work is to realize an in-plane
   three-degree-of-freedom motor that can follow a designated trajectory.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence suggests that the cerebral blood flow patterns accompanying
   cognitive activity are retained in many locked-in patients. These
   patterns can be monitored using transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), a
   medical imaging technique that measures bilateral cerebral blood flow
   velocities. Recently, TCD has been proposed as an alternative imaging
   modality for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, most previous
   TCD-BCI studies have performed offline analyses with impractically
   lengthy tasks. In this study, we designed a BCI that automatically
   differentiates between counting and verbal fluency tasks using
   sequential hypothesis testing to make decisions as quickly as possible.
   Ten able-bodied participants silently alternated between counting and
   verbal fluency tasks within the paradigm of a simulated onscreen
   keyboard. During this experiment, blood flow velocities were recorded
   within the left and right middle cerebral arteries using bilateral TCD.
   Twelve features were used to characterize TCD signals. In a simulated
   online analysis, sequential hypothesis testing was used to update
   estimates of class probability every 250 ms as TCD data were processed.
   Classification was terminated once a threshold level of certainty was
   reached. Mean classification accuracy across all participants was 72\%
   after an average of 23 s, compared to an offline analysis which obtained
   a classification accuracy of 80\% after 45 s. This represents a
   substantial gain in data transmission rate, while maintaining
   classification accuracies exceeding 70\%. Furthermore, a range of
   decision times between 19 and 28s was observed, suggesting that the
   ability of sequential hypothesis testing to adapt the task duration for
   each individual participant is critical to achieving consistent
   performance across participants. These results indicate that sequential
   hypothesis testing is a promising alternative for online TCD-BCIs. (C)

Abstract = {{Typical steel moment-resisting frames (MRF) of six-storey buildings in
   Vancouver and Montreal were designed for three different provisions of
   the National Building Code of Canada (1960s, 1980s, and 2010). Numerical
   models were developed in OpenSees to understand the seismic performance
   of the structures. These models accounted for strength and stiffness
   degradation through appropriate representations of the beam-column
   connection behaviours, which were calibrated against experimental
   results available in the literature. The behaviour of the buildings was
   evaluated through pushover and nonlinear time history analyses. The
   pushover analysis results showed that the 1960s and 2010 steel MRFs of
   both cities exhibited strong-column-weak-beam failure mode. The 1980s
   steel MRFs of both cities showed soft-storey mechanism. Fragility curves
   were developed for the steel MRFs based on the seismic demands evaluated
   using nonlinear time history analyses, which can be used for regional
   seismic impact assessment studies in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Main objective of this paper is investigating the role of transit
   station accessibility on intercity travel mode choices in contexts of a
   proposed High Speed Rail. The study area is the Quebec-Windsor corridor,
   which is the most important corridor in Canada and one of the most
   important corridors in North America. A web-based joint revealed
   preference - stated preference survey is used to collect data for
   empirical investigation. To contribute further to travel survey methods,
   an innovative social media based data collection approach is taken. As
   opposed to explicit sample frame-based sample selection approach, it
   applies a reverse procedure of open sample frame-based data collection.
   The web-based survey is spread through social media groups (that are
   open in sense that information of all individuals are not known
   explicitly) and the collected responses are screened to match with
   population distributions. Results prove the potential of such data
   collection approach in extracting representative samples of the
   population of concern. The collected dataset, which has close
   representation of the population, is used to estimate discrete mode
   choice model (Nested Logit model) of intercity mode choices. Empirical
   model reveals that intercity travellers are more concerned about access
   to and egress from transit stations than the main in-vehicle travel
   while selecting intercity travel modes. The result of this investigate
   imply that transit station accessibility should be given careful
   consideration for the success of any innovative travel mode, e.g., high
   speed rail.}},

Abstract = {{Chromosome 22q11.2 microdeletions impart a high but incomplete risk for
   schizophrenia. Possible mechanisms include genome-wide effects of DGCR8
   haploinsufficiency. In a proof-of-principle study to assess the power of
   this model, we used high-quality, whole-genome sequencing of nine
   individuals with 22q11.2 deletions and extreme phenotypes
   (schizophrenia, or no psychotic disorder at age >50 years). The
   schizophrenia group had a greater burden of rare, damaging variants
   impacting protein-coding neurofunctional genes, including genes involved
   in neuron projection (nominal P = 0.02, joint burden of three variant
   types). Variants in the intact 22q11.2 region were not major
   contributors. Restricting to genes affected by a DGCR8 mechanism tended
   to amplify between-group differences. Damaging variants in highly
   conserved long intergenic noncoding RNA genes also were enriched in the
   schizophrenia group (nominal P = 0.04). The findings support the 22q11.2
   deletion model as a threshold-lowering first hit for schizophrenia risk.
   If applied to a larger and thus better-powered cohort, this appears to
   be a promising approach to identify genome-wide rare variants in coding
   and noncoding sequence that perturb gene networks relevant to idiopathic
   schizophrenia. Similarly designed studies exploiting genetic models may
   prove useful to help delineate the genetic architecture of other complex
   phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Modular cardiac tissues developed both vascular and cardiac structuresin
   vivo, provided that the host response was attenuated by omitting
   xenoproteins from the modules. Collagen gel modules (with
   Matrigel((TM))) containing cardiomyocytes (CMs) alone or CMs with
   surface-seeded endothelial cells (ECs; CM/EC modules) were injected into
   the peri-infarct zone of the heart in syngeneic Lewis rats. After 3
   weeks, donor ECs developed into blood vessel-like structures that also
   contained erythrocytes. However, no donor CMs were found within the
   implant sites, presumably because host cells including macrophages and T
   cells infiltrated extensively into the injection sites. To lessen the
   host response, Matrigel was omitted from the matrix and the modules were
   rinsed with serum-free medium prior to implantation. Host cell
   infiltration was attenuated, resulting in a higher degree of
   vascularization with CM/EC modules than with CM modules without ECs.
   Most importantly, donor CMs matured into striated muscle-like structures
   in Matrigel-free implants. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   the reduced exposure to potentially harmful monomers and NPs. This work

   perovskite shells in solid-state films. Passivation using the perovskite
   was achieved using a facile solution ligand exchange followed by
   postannealing. The resulting hybrid nanostructure created a more
   intrinsic CQD film, which, when incorporated into a photovoltaic device
   with graded bandstructure, achieved a record solar cell performance for
   single-step-deposited CQD films, exhibiting an AM1.5 solar power
   conversion efficiency of 8.95\%.}},

Abstract = {{The optoelectronic tunability offered by colloidal quantum dots (CQDs)
   is attractive for photovoltaic applications but demands proper band
   alignment at electrodes for efficient charge extraction at minimal cost
   to voltage. With this goal in mind, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) can
   be used to modify interface energy levels locally. However, to be
   effective SAMs must be made robust to treatment using the various
   solvents and ligands required for to fabricate high quality CQD solids.
   We report robust self-assembled monolayers (R-SAMs) that enable us to
   increase the efficiency of CQD photovoltaics. Only by developing a
   process for secure anchoring of aromatic SAMs, aided by deposition of
   the SAMs in a water-free deposition environment, were we able to provide
   an interface modification that was robust against the ensuing chemical
   treatments needed in the fabrication of CQD solids. The energy alignment
   at the rectifying interface was tailored by tuning the R-SAM for optimal
   alignment relative to the CQD quantum-confined electron energy levels.
   This resulted in a CQD PV record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of
   10.7\% with enhanced reproducibility relative to controls.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of CRISPR-cas loci, which encode adaptive immune systems
   in archaea and bacteria, involves rapid changes, in particular numerous
   rearrangements of the locus architecture and horizontal transfer of
   complete loci or individual modules. These dynamics complicate
   straightforward phylogenetic classification, but here we present an
   approach combining the analysis of signature protein families and
   features of the architecture of cas loci that unambiguously partitions
   most CRISPR-cas loci into distinct classes, types and subtypes. The new
   classification retains the overall structure of the previous version but
   is expanded to now encompass two classes, five types and 16 subtypes.
   The relative stability of the classification suggests that the most
   prevalent variants of CRISPR-Cas systems are already known. However, the
   existence of rare, currently unclassifiable variants implies that
   additional types and subtypes remain to be characterized.}},

Title = {{DNAPL accumulation in wells and DNAPL recovery from wells: Model
   development and application to a laboratory study}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{109-119}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) accumulation and recovery from
   wells cannot be accurately modeled through typical pressure or flux
   boundary conditions due to gravity segregation of water and DNAPL in the
   wellbore, the effects of wellbore storage, and variations of wellbore
   inflow and outflow rates with depth, particularly in heterogeneous
   formations. A discrete wellbore formulation is presented for numerical
   modeling of DNAPL accumulation in observation wells and DNAPL removal
   from recovery wells. The formulation includes fluid segregation,
   changing water and DNAPL levels in the well and the corresponding
   changes in fluid storage in the wellbore. The method was added to a
   three-dimensional finite difference model (Comp-Sim) for three phase
   (water, gas, DNAPL) flow. The model predictions are compared to
   three-dimensional pilot scale experiments of DNAPL (benzyl alcohol)
   infiltration, redistribution, recovery, and water flushing. Model
   predictions match experimental results well, indicating the
   appropriateness of the model formulation. Characterization of mixing in
   the extraction well is important for predicting removal of highly
   soluble organic compounds like benzyl alcohol. A sensitivity analysis
   shows that the incorporation of hysteresis is critical for accurate
   prediction. Among the multiphase flow and transport parameters required
   for modeling, results are most sensitive to soil intrinsic permeability.

Title = {{Sawdust as an effective binder for making torrefied pellets}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{491-498}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study, torrefied sawdust produced from pine sawdust in a fixed
   bed reactor was mixed with different binders in a ratio of 5-30 wt.\%,
   and then compressed into pellets in a single die press to explore the
   feasibility of making torrefied pellets from torrefied powders. The
   quality of torrefied pellets was examined based on pellet density,
   higher heating value, hardness, saturated moisture uptake, and energy
   density. Results showed that torrefied sawdust particles prepared under
   typical torrefaction conditions (280-300 degrees C for 10-30 min) could
   be made into strong pellets by compression at a die temperature higher
   than 220 degrees C or by introducing biomass binders such as untreated
   sawdust, starch or lignin at a lower die temperature. The pellets
   density and bulk density made at a low die temperature with binders were
   slightly lower than those made at a die temperature of 220 degrees C or
   higher without the binder, and the energy density of torrefied pellets
   was similar to the control pellets made from untreated sawdust. Since
   the raw sawdust is abundantly available and much cheaper than lignin and
   starch, it is recommended as a low-cost and effective binder for
   densifying torrefied sawdust into torrefied pellets. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{293}},
Pages = {{403-412}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The preferred method for disposal of used nuclear fuel is underground
   emplacement in a Deep Geological Repository (DGR). Many countries have
   light water reactor fuels which require large Used Fuel Container or
   Canister (UFC) designs weighing up to 25 ton for containment. In
   contrast, Canada exclusively uses heavy water reactor fuel, which is
   substantially smaller. This has led the Nuclear Waste Management
   Organization (NWMO) to create a novel UFC, which uses standard pressure
   vessel grade steel for structural containment and a thick, integrally
   bonded copper coating applied to the exterior surface for corrosion
   protection. Currently, the coating is applied using two different
   methods: electrodeposition and gas dynamic cold spray. This novel copper
   coating needs to be fully validated to ensure adequate mechanical
   strength and chemical resistance for use under repository conditions.
   Detailed mechanical and corrosion testing programs were undertaken.
   Mechanical tests indicated that adhesion strengths exceeded 45 MPa and
   tensile properties were comparable to wrought copper. A Finite Element
   Model (FEM) of the copper-steel composite was created and validated
   using three point bend tests. This model accurately predicts the
   response of the composite, including large deformation and debonding
   failure mechanisms. Now validated, this model will be used to assess the
   performance of the coating on the full-scale UFC under simulated DGR
   loading conditions. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A system for wireless power transfer and data communication of
   implantable bio-monitoring systems is presented. The proposed solution
   uses a servo-controlled power transmitter moved under the animal moving
   space. An x-y movable magnetic coil transmits the required power with a
   level able to keep constant the received energy by the bio-sensor
   system. The power is transferred via the optimized remote powering link
   at 13.56 MHz. The received ac signal is converted to dc voltage with a
   passive full-wave integrated rectifier and the voltage regulator
   supplies 1.8 V for the implantable sensor system. The sensor control and
   readout circuit measures the current on the bio-sensors and transmit the
   data to the transmitter. The sensor data are transmitted to an external
   reader by a low-power OOK transmitter and received by a custom designed
   receiver at 869 MHz. The results are shown in a tablet computer in real
   time continuously. The long-term characterization of the implantable
   system is verified by a fully bio-compatible packaged implant with 30
   days measurement. A complete prototype is also presented to prove the
   overall system performance with the experimental in vitro measurement.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the joint optimization of economic
   manufacturing quantity (EMQ) and preventive maintenance (PM) policy for
   a production facility subject to deterioration and condition monitoring
   (CM). Unlike the previous joint models of EMQ and maintenance policy
   which used traditional maintenance approaches, we propose the
   proportional hazards model (PHM) to consider CM information as well as
   the age of the production facility. The deterioration process is
   determined by the age and covariate values and the covariate process is
   modeled as a continuous-time Markov process. The condition information
   is available at each inspection epoch, which is the end of each
   production run. The hazard rate is estimated after obtaining the new
   information through CM. The problem is formulated and solved in the
   semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) framework. The objective is to
   minimize the long-run expected average cost per unit time. Also, the
   mean residual life (MRL) of the production facility is calculated as an
   important statistic for practical applications. A numerical example is
   provided and a comparison with the age-based policy shows an outstanding
   performance of the new model and the control policy proposed in this

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Descriptive energy metrics, calculated for each component, represent how
   the hydraulic state of a network evolves and how energy flows vary
   temporally and spatially. More specifically, these metrics describe how
   the energy supplied is partitioned between the energy that is
   dissipated, lost, and delivered throughout the system. The metrics are
   meant to support planning, from local (e.g., pump or pipe renewal) to
   system-wide (e.g., leakage or pressure management) decisions. Whereas
   aggregate results are indicators of system capacity, efficiency,
   greenhouse gas emissions, and costs, the comparison of component metrics
   allows for the identification of specific pipes, tanks, or pumps for
   which changes would be most beneficial. Furthermore, analysis of the
   temporal variation of energy flows facilitates the assessment of
   operation under multiple scenarios. The metrics are applied to a case
   study of the Toronto water distribution system and show, based on two
   scenarios provided by Toronto Water, that on average, less than 27\% of
   the energy supplied is actually delivered to users. This system
   inefficiency has important economic and environmental repercussions.
   Nevertheless, changes to operations, such as improved pump maintenance
   or scheduling, have significant potential to lower costs and exploit
   lower greenhouse gas emission factors. (C) 2015 American Society of

   were imaged over a 4-month period.RESULTS:Denervated Schwann cells
   dedifferentiated to a proliferative, nonmyelinating phenotype within the
   bridges and the recipient denervated CP nerve stump. As donor TIB axons
   grew across the 3 side-to-side nerve bridges and into the denervated CP
   nerve, the Schwann cells redifferentiated to the myelinating phenotype.
   Bridge placement led to an increased mass of hind limb anterior
   compartment muscles after 4 months of denervation compared with muscles
   whose CP nerve was not protected by bridges.CONCLUSION:This study
   describes patterns of donor axon regeneration and myelination in the
   denervated recipient nerve stump and supports a mechanism where these
   donor axons sustain a proregenerative state to prevent deterioration in
   the face of chronic denervation.ABBREVIATIONS:CP, common peronealTA,

Abstract = {{A stem cell in its microenvironment is subjected to a myriad of soluble
   chemical cues and mechanical forces that act in concert to orchestrate
   cell fate. Intuitively, many of these soluble and biophysical factors
   have been the focus of intense study to successfully influence and
   direct cell differentiation in vitro. Human pluripotent stem cells
   (hPSCs) have been of considerable interest in these studies due to their
   great promise for regenerative medicine. Culturing and directing
   differentiation of hPSCs, however, is currently extremely
   labor-intensive and lacks the efficiency required to generate large
   populations of clinical-grade cells. Improved efficiency may come from
   efforts to understand how the cell biophysical signals can complement
   biochemical signals to regulate cell pluripotency and direct
   differentiation. In this concise review, we explore hPSC mechanobiology
   and how the hPSC biophysical microenvironment can be manipulated to
   maintain and differentiate hPSCs into functional cell types for
   regenerative medicine and tissue engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of a halide (Br, I) onto MgO leads to obtaining
   catalysts whose catalytic activity in transfer hydrogenation of acrolein
   with ethanol is significantly higher than that of unmodified MgO. In
   data found in literature, there is no concise view on how the
   modification of the surface of MgO with a halide affects its surface
   properties. Although most of the literature studies indicate a
   dependence of activity on the initial halide-containing compound and
   type of halide, no study comprising both these aspects has been
   performed. The aim of the present study was to conduct measurements of
   MgO modified with two halides and with two types of initial
   halide-containing compounds with surface-sensitive techniques to
   determine how each of these factors influences the surface properties of
   the catalyst. Titration experiments showed that all of the modified
   catalysts have a smaller diversity of basic site strengths than
   unmodified MgO. They also revealed that for all studied systems, the
   modification of the surface leads to the formation of BrOnsted acidic
   sites, which MgO does not possess. XPS spectra indicate that
   bromine-modified catalysts give a broader range of surface species than
   the appropriate iodine-modified ones. Moreover, they showed that in the
   case of both iodine-modified and bromine-modified catalysts, the one
   that exhibited the higher concentration of the appropriate halogen on
   the surface showed a lower activity in catalytic transfer hydrogenation
   of acrolein with ethanol. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive design of wavefront-splitting interferometers (WSIs) is
   introduced for integration into wafer light circuits and optical fiber
   systems. The WSI detects the coherent interference of two wavefronts
   after being equally split by a single buried resonator and collected
   into a single mode waveguide. WSIs present a desirable compact sensor as
   possible with Fabry Perot interferometers (FPIs), with the additional
   benefits of strong visibility contrast and high sensitivity to external
   parameters as expected with Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Theoretical
   models and finite-difference time-domain simulations show the WSI
   spectral responses to be 2x to 120x more sensitive to changes in
   refractive index, temperature, and strain over comparable Bragg grating
   waveguides and FPIs. Femtosecond laser irradiation with selective
   chemical etching provided the flexible means for 3-D geometric
   structuring and waveguide integration below the surface, delivering
   precise WSIs with a small similar to 12-nm rms surface roughness.
   Temperature and vacuum sensing were demonstrated with high sensing
   resolution (0.8 degrees C and 1.8 x 10(-5) RIU) and sensitivity (60.6
   pm/degrees C and 2800 nm/RIU) to match theoretically anticipated values.
   Such high finesse optical elements open a new realm of optical sensing
   and integrated optical circuit concepts without relying on tedious
   nanoprecision assembly methods or the use of large optical components.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive impairments are prevalent following clinical stroke; however,
   preclinical research has focused almost exclusively on motor deficits.
   In order to conduct systematic evaluations into the nature of
   post-stroke cognitive dysfunction and recovery, it is crucial to develop
   focal stroke models that predominantly affect cognition while leaving
   motor function intact. Herein, we evaluated a range of cognitive
   functions 1-4 months following focal medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
   stroke using a battery of tests. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent
   focal ischemia induced in the mPFC using bilateral intracerebral
   injections of endothelin-1, or sham surgery. Cognitive function was
   assessed using an open field, several object recognition tests,
   attentional set-shifting, light-dark box, spontaneous alternation,
   Barnes maze, and win-shift/win-stay tests. Prefrontal cortex damage
   resulted in significant changes in object recognition function,
   behavioural flexibility, and anxiety-like behaviour, while spontaneous
   alternation and locomotor function remained intact. These deficits are
   similar to the cognitive deficits following stroke in humans. Our
   results suggest that this model may be useful for identifying and
   developing potential therapies for improving post-stroke cognitive
   dysfunction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The current study investigates the potential to increase the activity of
   a family 1 carbohydrate esterase on cellulose acetate through fusion to
   a family 3 carbohydrate binding module (CBM). Specifically, CtCBM3 from
   Clostridium thermocellum was fused to the carboxyl terminus of the
   acetyl xylan esterase (AnAXE) from Aspergillus nidulans, and active
   forms of both AnAXE and AnAXE-CtCBM3 were produced in Pichia pastoris.
   CtCBM3 fusion had negligible impact on the thermostability or
   regioselectivity of AnAXE; activities towards acetylated corncob xylan,
   4-methylumbelliferyl acetate,p-nitrophenyl acetate, and cellobiose
   octaacetate were also unchanged. By contrast, the activity of
   AnAXE-CtCBM3 on cellulose acetate increased by two to four times over 24
   h, with greater differences observed at earlier time points. Binding
   studies using microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) and a commercial
   source of cellulose acetate confirmed functional production of the
   CtCBM3 domain; affinity gel electrophoresis using acetylated xylan also
   verified the selectivity of CtCBM3 binding to cellulose. Notably, gains
   in enzyme activity on cellulose acetate appeared to exceed gains in
   substrate binding, suggesting that fusion to CtCBM3 increases functional
   associations between the enzyme and insoluble, high molecular weight
   cellulosic substrates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the simplicity of energy detector and capability of higher
   order and fractional lower order statistics in non-Gaussian signal
   processing, this paper proposes a new spectrum sensing method based on
   kernel theory, referred to as Kerenlized Energy Detector (KED), which
   exhibits a moderate complexity, it is easy to implement, and it compares
   favourably against competing solutions in the case of various Gaussian
   and non-Gaussian impulsive noises. The incorporation of the nonlinear
   kernel function in the KED test statistic allows for the development of
   a nonlinear algorithm capable of considering both higher order and
   fractional lower order moments (FLOMs) in the sensing task. We show that
   the proposed KED detector can serve as an optimal spectrum sensing
   method under both Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise scenarios. In
   addition, the detection performance of the proposed KED scheme is
   analyzed by employing U-statistics theory. The Kernel parameter
   selection for the KED method has been discussed in both theoretical and
   practical points of view. Potential of considering the KED scheme in
   either single user multi-antennas or cooperative spectrum sensing is
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{We used magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained in same-sex and
   opposite-sex dizygotic twins (n = 119, 8 years of age) to study possible
   effects of prenatal androgens on craniofacial features. Using a
   principal component analysis of 19 craniofacial landmarks placed on the
   MR images, we identified a principal component capturing craniofacial
   features that distinguished females with a presumed differential
   exposure to prenatal androgens by virtue of having a male (vs. a female)
   co-twin (Cohen's d = 0.76). Subsequently, we tested the possibility that
   this craniofacial ``signature{''} of prenatal exposure to androgens
   predicts brain size, a known sexually dimorphic trait. In an independent
   sample of female adolescents (singletons; n = 462), we found that the
   facial signature predicts up to 8 \% of variance in brain size. These
   findings are consistent with the organizational effects of androgens on
   brain development and suggest that the facial signature derived in this
   study could complement other indirect measures of prenatal exposure to
   androgens.}},

Title = {{Study on the critical amount of liquid for bed material agglomeration in
   a bubbling fluidized bed}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{284}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Agglomeration of bed materials at a high temperature is one of the most
   important and challenging problems for fluidized-bed biomass boilers for
   thermal/power generation. Inorganic alkali compounds derived from the
   biomass ash, mainly potassium (K) and sodium (Na) can be problematic as
   they form low-melting alkali compounds and may also react with the bed
   material (silica sand) forming low-melting alkali silicates. These
   low-melting alkali compounds, if surpassing a critical amount, could
   coat the sand particles to form agglomerates, eventually leading to
   partial or complete de-fluidization of the reactor. In the present
   study, the critical amount of liquid (molten ash in real biomass boiler
   operations) that would result in severe bed agglomeration and
   defluidization was studied a small pilot-scale cold bubbling fluidized
   bed (BFB) test rig filled with silica sand particles as bed materials
   equipped with non-invasive capacitance sensors and differential pressure
   transducers. In the cold BFB test rig, a solution of glycerol-water
   (30\% v/v), employed to simulate molten ash in real biomass boiler
   operations, was injected to the bed at different quantities during the
   tests. It was found that in the present fluidization system the critical
   liquid amount causing bed agglomeration is likely 0.2 wt\% (in relation
   to the weight of bed material loaded) and 0.7 wt\% would cause severe
   channeling and de-fluidization conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We report the heat-transfer characteristics of polystyrene
   (PS)/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanocomposite foams with a
   large expansion ratio (18-fold) and a microcellular cell size (5 mu m)
   that have never been achieved before. These PS/MWCNT foams exhibited
   excellent thermal insulation performance even without insulation gas.
   The 5 mu m-sized cells in these PS/MWCNT foams are small enough to
   induce Knudsen effect, and also lead to a distinct radiation behavior
   that has never been reported; that is, because of the unique synergy of
   the small cells and the MWCNTs, the short wavelength radiation below the
   cell size is 100\% blocked while the long wavelength radiation over the
   cell size is strongly attenuated. We made an in-depth analysis of the
   heat transfer through the PS/MWCNT foams using models. Adding 2 wt\%
   MWCNTs into the PS matrix, 86\% of the radiative thermal conductivity
   was effectively blocked, and the radiative contribution was reduced to
   3.5\% of the total thermal conductivity. However, the MWCNTs increased
   the solid conductivity of the PS/MWCNT foams due to their inherently
   high thermal conductivity. So, a compromised content of 1 wt\% MWCNTs
   was added to optimize solid conduction and radiation, and thereby to
   minimize the total thermal conductivity to 32.8 mW/m K. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate the interfacial and mechanical properties
   of carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforced epoxy composite. The work carried
   out in two stages. In the first, we conducted molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations to determine the atomic-level interfacial and mechanical
   properties of the transversely isotropic representative volume element
   (RVE) comprised of CNT-epoxy composite. In the second, the Mod-Tanaka
   micromechanics scheme was used to scale up the mechanical properties of
   the atomic structure to the microscale level. The work was further
   extended and used atomistic-based continuum (ABC) multiscale modeling
   technique, which makes use of constitutive relations derived solely from
   interatomic potentials to model the same system. Interestingly, the
   results of our comparative investigation reveals that (i) the ABC
   technique and MD simulation provide almost identical predictions for the
   atomic-level interfacial and mechanical properties of the nanocomposite,
   (ii) both models predict comparable bulk mechanical properties of the
   nanocomposite containing randomly dispersed CNTs, and (iii) they also
   reveal that a higher degree of orthotropy of the nanoscale

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel computational model for quantifying the
   perceptual quality of color images consistently with subjective
   evaluations. The proposed full-reference color metric, namely, a
   directional statistics-based color similarity index, is designed to
   consistently perform well over commonly encountered chromatic and
   achromatic distortions. In order to accurately predict the visual
   quality of color images, we make use of local color descriptors
   extracted from three perceptual color channels: 1) hue; 2) chroma; and
   3) lightness. In particular, directional statistical tools are employed
   to properly process hue data by considering their periodicities.
   Moreover, two weighting mechanisms are exploited to accurately combine
   locally measured comparison scores into a final score. Extensive
   experimentation performed on large-scale databases indicates that the
   proposed metric is effective across a wide range of chromatic and
   achromatic distortions, making it better suited for the evaluation and
   optimization of color image processing algorithms.}},

   electrochemical detection in microfluidic lab-on-a-chip applications.
   Its capability to identify and discern between surface and bulk
   processes in solid-liquid systems finds particular use for the detection
   of biorecognition events or conductivity measurements. The
   electrochemical transducer can be in the form of interdigitated
   electrode structures to increase sensitivity. Experimental work was
   performed to characterize two different transducer designs. Applications
   included the monitoring of protein films on contact-less interdigitated
   electrode structures and conductivity detection of droplets on insulated
   two-electrode structures. The use of electrode passivation eliminated
   electrode degradation. Experimental results were compared to theoretical
   analytical models, and were found to closely correlate with one another.
   The analytical models were used to design the transducer for optimal
   conductivity detection. The results inform the current research efforts
   for the development of in-line impedance spectroscopy in digital
   microfluidics and confirm the use of simple analytical models for the
   first-order estimation of the frequency response of interdigitated

Title = {{Exploring methodological frameworks for a mental task-based

Abstract = {{Background: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) brain-computer interfaces
   (BCIs) enable users to interact with their environment using only
   cognitive activities. This paper presents the results of a comparison of
   four methodological frameworks used to select a pair of tasks to control
   a binary NIRS-BCI; specifically, three novel personalized task paradigms
   and the state-of-the-art prescribed task framework were explored.
   New methods: Three types of personalized task selection approaches were
   compared, including: user-selected mental tasks using weighted slope
   scores (WS-scores), user-selected mental tasks using pairwise accuracy
   rankings (PWAR), and researcher-selected mental tasks using PWAR. These
   paradigms, along with the state-of-the-art prescribed mental task
   framework, where mental tasks are selected based on the most commonly
   used tasks in literature, were tested by ten able-bodied participants
   who took part in five NIRS-BCI sessions.
   Results: The frameworks were compared in terms of their accuracy,
   perceived ease-of-use, computational time, user preference, and length
   of training. Most notably, researcher-selected personalized tasks
   resulted in significantly higher accuracies, while user-selected
   personalized tasks resulted in significantly higher perceived
   ease-of-use. It was also concluded that PWAR minimized the amount of
   data that needed to be collected; while, WS-scores maximized user
   satisfaction and minimized computational time.
   Comparison with existing method: In comparison to the state-of-the-art
   prescribed mental tasks, our findings show that overall, personalized
   tasks appear to be superior to prescribed tasks with respect to accuracy
   and perceived ease-of-use.
   Conclusions: The deployment of personalized rather than prescribed
   mental tasks ought to be considered and further investigated in future
   NIRS-BCI studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{DStat: A Versatile, Open-Source Potentiostat for Electroanalysis and
   Integration}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Most electroanalytical techniques require the precise control of the
   potentials in an electrochemical cell using a potentiostat. Commercial
   potentiostats function as ``black boxes,{''}giving limited information
   about their circuitry and behaviour which can make development of new
   measurement techniques and integration with other instruments
   challenging. Recently, a number of lab-built potentiostats have emerged
   with various design goals including low manufacturing cost and
   field-portability, but notably lacking is an accessible potentiostat
   designed for general lab use, focusing on measurement quality combined
   with ease of use and versatility. To fill this gap, we introduce DStat
   (http://microfluidics.utoronto.ca/dstat), an open-source,
   general-purpose potentiostat for use alone or integrated with other
   instruments. DStat offers picoampere current measurement capabilities, a
   compact USB-powered design, and user-friendly cross-platform software.
   DStat is easy and inexpensive to build, may be modified freely, and
   achieves good performance at low current levels not accessible to other
   lab-built instruments. In head-to-head tests, DStat's voltammetric
   measurements are much more sensitive than those of ``CheapStat{''} (a
   popular open-source potentiostat described previously), and are
   comparable to those of a compact commercial ``black box{''}
   potentiostat. Likewise, in head-to-head tests, DStat's potentiometric
   precision is similar to that of a commercial pH meter. Most importantly,
   the versatility of DStat was demonstrated through integration with the
   open-source DropBot digital microfluidics platform. In sum, we propose
   that DStat is a valuable contribution to the ``open source{''} movement
   in analytical science, which is allowing users to adapt their tools to
   their experiments rather than alter their experiments to be compatible
   with their tools.}},

Abstract = {{It is highlighted in the past that the soil-structure interaction
   phenomenon can produce a significant alteration on the response of a
   bridge structure. A variety of approaches has been developed in the
   past, which is capable of tackling the soil-structure interaction
   problem from different perspectives. The popular approach of a
   discretized truncated finite element model of the soil domain is not
   always a numerically viable solution, especially for computationally
   demanding simulations such as the probabilistic fragility analysis of a
   bridge structure or the real time hybrid simulation. This paper aims to
   develop a complete modeling procedure that is capable of coping with the
   soil-structure interaction problem of inelastic bridge structures
   through the use of a frequency dependent lumped parameter assembly. The
   proposed procedure encounters accuracy and global stability issues
   observed on past methods while maintaining the broad applicability of
   the method by any commercial FEM software. A case study of an overpass
   bridge structure under earthquake excitations is illustrated in order to
   verify the proposed method. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Journal = {{COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{483}},
Pages = {{25-35}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted of the low-Reynolds number breakup and
   separation of oil-particle clusters characterized by a high volume
   fraction of relatively large solid particles, under simple shear in an
   aqueous solution. The breakup of such oil-particle clusters, and the
   separation of particles from the clusters, are evaluated as a function
   of viscosity ratio of the oil phase to the aqueous solution, interfacial
   tension, and shearing time. When the viscosity ratio is high, clusters
   are more difficult to breakup, a longer shear time is needed, and few
   particles detach. At low viscosity ratios, clusters are easily deformed
   and break up into smaller clusters, and more clean particles detach.
   Lowering the interfacial tension also facilitates the liberation of oil
   droplets from particles.
   The results show that the breakup of oil-particle clusters with a high
   volume fraction of large particles can be characterized as simple
   droplet breakup, meaning that the viscosity of the oil governs the
   dynamics of the cluster, rather than an effective viscosity that is a
   function of the solid volume fraction. The degree of cluster breakup and
   the separation of particles from the primary cluster is related to a
   cluster-based capillary number and the viscosity ratio. There is a
   critical capillary number required to obtain clean particles. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In the present work, novel thioether xylans were synthesized via a
   simple procedure using water as solvent. First, allyl groups were
   introduced on the backbone of xylan by etherification of allyl chloride
   in aqueous alkaline conditions at 40 degrees C, providing degree of
   substitution (DS) values up to 0.49. On the second step, the allyl
   groups were reacted with thioacetic acid, cysteamine hydrochloride or
   cysteine providing novel thiol-, amine- or amino acid functionalized
   xylans. The presented modular approach offers broad possibilities for
   developing new polysaccharide based materials. The thioacetic acid - ene
   reaction is reported for the first time for polysaccharide modification,
   yielding a protected thiol that can be stored at atmospheric conditions
   and can be deprotected by simple hydrolysis just prior to use, providing
   a versatile water soluble polythiol. The free thiol-groups were utilized
   for hydrogel formation through thiol-thiol oxidative coupling, allowing
   good control over the hydrogel shape, such as 3D hydrogel scaffolds and
   cross-linked foams. Further, the thiol-containing xylan was used to
   modify filter paper surface by a simple dipping method, which provides a
   novel and convenient way for introducing thiol-functionality on paper
   surface. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{293}},

Abstract = {{Battery capacity estimation is a significant recent challenge given the
   complex physical and chemical processes that occur within batteries and
   the restrictions on the accessibility of capacity degradation data. In
   this study, we describe an approach called dynamic spatial time warping,
   which is used to determine the similarities of two arbitrary curves.
   Unlike classical dynamic time warping methods, this approach can
   maintain the invariance of curve similarity to the rotations and
   translations of curves, which is vital in curve similarity search.
   Moreover, it utilizes the online charging or discharging data that are
   easily collected and do not require special assumptions. The accuracy of

Abstract = {{Background: Non-invasive measurement of tumor hypoxia has demonstrated
   potential for the evaluation of disease progression, as well as
   prediction and assessment of treatment outcome. {[}F-18]fluoroazomycin
   arabinoside (FAZA) positron emission tomography (PET) has been
   identified as a robust method for quantification of hypoxia both
   preclinically and clinically. The goal of this investigation was to
   evaluate the feasibility and value of repeated FAZA-PET imaging to
   quantify hypoxia in tumors that received multi-dose chemotherapy.
   Methods: FAZA-PET imaging was conducted over a 21-day period in a mouse
   xenograft model of HT-29 human colorectal carcinoma, following
   multi-dose chemotherapy treatment with irinotecan (CPT-11) or
   nanoliposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI, MM-398).
   Results: Tumors treated with 10 mg/kg nal-IRI maintained significantly
   lower levels of hypoxia and smaller hypoxic fractions compared to tumors
   that received 50 mg/kg CPT-11. Specifically, differences in FAZA uptake
   were detectable 9 days before any significant differences in tumor
   volume were observed between the treatment groups.
   Conclusions: These findings highlight the potential use of FAZA-PET as
   an early marker of treatment response following multi-dose chemotherapy.}},

Title = {{Factors influencing the repair costs of soft-story RC frame buildings
   and implications for their seismic retrofit}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{233-245}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the factors affecting the repair costs following
   major earthquakes, of reinforced concrete (RC) frame buildings with
   non-ductile detailing typical of construction practices in Italy and
   other parts of the world during the 1950s and 1960s. Two configurations
   of a RC frame structure, one with full infills and the other with
   partial infills, are numerically studied. Results of incremental dynamic
   analyses confirm that the partial infill RC structures, in which
   soft-story mechanisms form in the open story, are more likely to
   collapse. However, by undertaking a loss estimation study for different
   scenarios it is shown that the lower losses that are expected due to the
   reduced damage of non-structural components in upper levels could be an
   advantage of soft-story buildings provided that the collapse propensity
   is reduced at the first level. It is further shown that losses in
   soft-story buildings will be strongly affected by the repair value of
   the structural and non-structural components at the soft-story level
   relative to other levels and the magnitude of P-Delta effects. These
   observations indicate that an effective retrofit strategy, that would
   reduce both monetary losses and the probability of collapse, could be
   achieved by increasing the deformation capacity at the soft-story level
   without altering the isolating effect that the soft-story mechanism
   provides to the levels above and without any further intervention in the
   stories above. The changes in losses resulting from such a conceptual
   retrofit solution are presented in order to illustrate the merits of
   such an approach, that should therefore become the focus of future
   research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{134-141}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the current research is to create multifunctional metal
   matrix composite coatings that are able to provide high strength as well
   as high water repellency by electrodeposition of nanocrystalline nickel
   matrix with embedded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) particles. The study
   of the co-deposition process demonstrated that the amount of PTFE
   co-deposited is highly dependent on the concentration of PTFE particles
   in the electroplating bath. A very high fraction of co-deposited PTFE
   was achieved (69 vol.\%) using a concentration of 30 g/L of PTFE
   particles in the plating bath. The contact angle of the surface greatly
   increased when the PTFE content increased over 50 vol.\%. At 69 vol.\%
   PTFE the coatings had a contact angle of 152 degrees. Saccharin was
   added to the electroplating bath in an attempt to refine grain size.
   Using transmission electron microscopy, the average grain size of the
   nickel matrix without saccharin was determined to be 27 nm for the
   coating containing 69 vol.\% PTFE. However, no nickel grain size
   reduction was observed when saccharin was added as it was found that the
   composite samples already had a very fine grain structure likely due to
   the use of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a PTFE particle
   dispersant. The addition of saccharin provided no additional hardening
   of the composite while the wetting angle was greatly decreased at
   concentrations greater than 0.1 g/L. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{171-183}},

Abstract = {{The increasing frequency and intensity of taste and odour (T\&O)
   producing cyanobacteria in water sources is a growing global issue.
   Geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) are the main cyanobacterial T\&O
   compounds and can cause complaints from consumers at levels as low as 10
   ng/L. However, literature concerning the performance of full-scale
   treatment processes for geosmin and MIB removal is rare. Hence, the
   objectives of this study were to: 1) estimate the accumulation and
   breakthrough of geosmin and MIB inside full-scale water treatment
   plants; 2) verify the potential impact of sludge recycling practice on
   performance of plants; and, 3) assess the effectiveness of aged GAC for
   the removal of these compounds. Sampling after full-scale treatment
   processes and GAC pilot assays were conducted to achieve these goals.
   Geosmin and MIB monitoring in full-scale plants provided the opportunity
   to rank the performance of studied treatment processes with filtration
   and granular activated carbon providing the best barriers for removal of
   total and extracellular compounds, correspondingly. Geosmin was removed
   to a greater extent than MIB using GAC. Geosmin and MIB residuals in
   water post GAC contactors after two years of operation was 20\% and 40\%
   of initial concentrations, correspondingly. Biological activity on the
   GAC surface enhanced the removal of T\&O compounds. These observations
   demonstrated that a multi-barrier treatment approach is required to
   ensure cyanobacteria and their T\&O compounds are effectively removed
   from drinking water. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{413-421}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Bead foaming technology with double crystal melting peak structure has
   been recognized as a promising method to produce high-performance
   low-density foams with complex geometries. Polylactide (PLA) bead
   foaming has been of the great interest of researchers due to its origin
   from renewal resources and biodegradability. However, due to the PLA's
   low melt strength and slow crystallization kinetics, the attempts have
   been limited to the manufacturing methods used for expanded polystyrene
   (EPS). In this study, we developed microcellular PLA bead foams with
   double crystal melting peak structure in a large content using a
   lab-scale autoclave system followed by molding of the beads. PLA bead
   foams were produced with expansion ratios and average cell sizes ranging
   from 6 to 31-fold and 6 to 50 mu m, respectively. The high-melting point
   crystals generated during gas-saturation significantly affected the
   expansion ratio and cell density of the PLA bead foams by enhancing the
   PLA's melt strength and promoting cell nucleation around the crystals.
   The tensile properties of the molded EPLA bead foams showed that EPLA
   bead foams with double crystal melting peak can be a promising
   substitute not only for EPS but also for expanded polypropylene (EPP)
   bead foams. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a label-free and real-time piezoelectric aptasensor
   for the detection of cocaine. The acoustic wave sensing platform is a
   quartz substrate functionalized with an adlayer of
   S-(11-trichlorosilyl-undecanyl)-benzenethiosulfonate (BTS) cross-linker
   onto which the anti-cocaine MN4 DNA aptamer is next immobilized.
   Preparation of the sensor surface was monitored using X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), while the binding of cocaine to
   surface-attached MN4 was evaluated using the electromagnetic
   piezoelectric acoustic sensor (EMPAS). The MN4 aptamer, unlike other
   cocaine aptamer variants, has its secondary structure preformed in the
   unbound state with only tertiary structure changes occurring during
   target binding. It is postulated that the highly sensitive EMPAS
   detected the binding of cocaine through target mass loading coupled to
   aptamer tertiary structure folding. The sensor achieved an apparent K-d
   of 45 +/- 12 mu M, and a limit of detection of 0.9 mu M. Repeated
   regenerability of the sensor platform was also demonstrated. This work
   constitutes the first application of EMPAS technology in the field of
   aptasensors. Furthermore, it is so far one of the very few examples of a
   bulk acoustic wave aptasensor that is able to directly detect the
   binding interaction between an aptamer and a small molecule in a facile
   one-step protocol without the use of a complex assay or signal
   amplification step. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies of road dust composition have sampled a very wide range of
   particle sizes, but from the perspective of respiratory exposure to
   resuspended dusts, it is the PM10 fraction which is of most importance.
   The PM10 fraction of road dust samples was collected at two sites in
   Birmingham, UK (major highway and road tunnel) and one site in New
   Delhi, India. Dust loadings were found to be much higher for New Delhi
   compared to Birmingham, while concentrations of several species were
   much higher in the case of Birmingham. Detailed chemical source profiles
   were prepared for both cities and previously generated empirical factors
   for source attribution to brake wear, tyre wear, and crustal dust were
   successfully applied to the UK sites. However, 100\% of the mass for the
   Indian site could not be accounted for using these factors. This study
   highlights the need for generation of local empirical estimation factors
   for non-exhaust vehicle emissions. A limited number of bulk road dust
   and brake pad samples were also characterized. Oxidative potential (OP)
   was also determined for a limited number of PM10 and bulk road dust
   samples, and Cu was found to be a factor significantly associated with
   OP in PM10 and bulk road dust. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A method for the prediction of the thermal transport properties of
   macroscopic and isotropic oxides systems, above the standard temperature
   of T = 298: 15 K, is presented. This method combines: (i) the kinetic
   theory, (ii) a thermodynamically self consistent method for the density
   of the lattice vibration energy, and (iii) the three-phonon umklapp
   processes for the description of the phonon-phonon scattering. The
   proposed approach is purely predictive, as no experimental data are
   required for the model parameterization; they are derived from ground
   sate electronic structure calculations. Case studies on Li2O and K2O are
   presented and discussed. The predicted thermal transport properties are
   found to be in excellent agreement with available experimental data. The
   thermal conductivity of K2O is found to differ from the thermal
   conductivity of Li2O by an order of magnitude. This difference is
   explained in terms of electron localization within the crystal. (C) VC

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{This article reports on the effects of aging and light induced
   degradation of the passivation quality of the interface formed by the
   crystalline silicon surface and facile grown oxide-SiNx bilayer. Stable
   passivation quality against aging and light soaking require thicker
   oxide layers grown at room temperature, suggesting that thicker oxide
   layers mitigate the migration of hydrogen from the interface and hence
   the defect density under light soaking. In addition, the stoichiometry
   of the PECVD SiNx influences the stability of the passivation quality.
   Specifically, the rate of degradation in passivation quality is observed
   to correlate with the optical absorption properties of SiNx; the higher
   the optical absorption the greater the degradation in passivation. This
   result is attributed to neutralization of the K+ centers in SiNx.
   Passivation layers with SiNx deposited with 5\% silane in nitrogen to
   ammonia gas ratio of 7 and facile grown native oxide thickness of
   similar to 1 nm resulted in the most stable passivation scheme within
   the scope of the reported experiments. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD), prized for its high-quality thin-film
   formation in the absence of high temperature or high vacuum, has become
   an industry standard for the large-area deposition of a wide array of
   oxide materials. Recently, it has shown promise in the formation of
   nanocrystalline sulfide films. Here, we demonstrate the viability of ALD
   lead sulfide for photodetection. Leveraging the conformal capabilities
   of ALD, we enhance the absorption without compromising the extraction
   efficiency in the absorbing layer by utilizing a ZnO nanowire electrode.
   The nanowires are first coated with a thin shunt-preventing TiO2 layer,
   followed by an infrared-active ALD PbS layer for photosensing. The ALD
   PbS photodetector exhibits a peak responsivity of 10(-2) AW(-1) and a
   shot-derived specific detectivity of 3 x 10(9) Jones at 1530 nm

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{215}},
Pages = {{1-11}},

Abstract = {{Drug delivery to the central nervous systemis limited by the blood-brain
   barrier, which can be circumvented by local delivery. In applications of
   stroke therapy, for example, stimulation of endogenous neural
   stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) by cyclosporin A (CsA) is promising.
   However, current strategies rely on high systemic drug doses to achieve
   small amounts of CsA in the brain tissue, resulting in systemic toxicity
   and undesirable global immunosuppression. Herein we describe the
   efficacy of local CsA delivery to the stroke-injured rat brain using an
   epicortically injected hydrogel composed of hyaluronan and
   methylcellulose (HAMC). CsA was encapsulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic
   acid) microparticles dispersed in HAMC, allowing for its sustained
   release over 14 days in vivo. Tissue penetration was sufficient to
   provide sustained CsA delivery to the sub-cortical NSPC niche. In
   comparison to systemic delivery using an osmotic minipump, HAMC achieved
   higher CsA concentrations in the brain while significantly reducing drug
   exposure in other organs. HAMC alone was beneficial in the
   stroke-injured rat brain, significantly reducing the stroke infarct
   volume relative to untreated stroke-injured controls. The combination of
   HAMC and local CsA release increased the number of proliferating cells
   in the lateral ventricles- theNSPC niche in the adult brain. Thus, we
   demonstrate a superiormethod of drug delivery to the rat brain that
   provides dual benefits of tissue protection and endogenous NSPC
   stimulation after stroke. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Strigolactones are naturally occurring signaling molecules that affect
   plant development, fungi-plant interactions, and parasitic plant
   infestations. We characterized the function of 11 strigolactone
   receptors from the parasitic plant Striga hermonthica using chemical and
   structural biology. We found a clade of polyspecific receptors,
   including one that is sensitive to picomolar concentrations of
   strigolactone. A crystal structure of a highly sensitive strigolactone
   receptor from Striga revealed a larger binding pocket than that of the
   Arabidopsis receptor, which could explain the increased range of
   strigolactone sensitivity. Thus, the sensitivity of Striga to
   strigolactones from host plants is driven by receptor sensitivity. By
   expressing strigolactone receptors in Arabidopsis, we developed a
   bioassay that can be used to identify chemicals and crops with altered
   strigolactone levels.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the adaptive output consensus tracking of a
   class of nonlinear systems in their higherorder strict-feedback form

   whose output is available to partial agents in the network. The proposed
   approach features in a design procedure including distributed estimation
   of group reference and backstepping-based robust consensus tracking
   control. In the proposed consensus tracking design, each agent estimates
   the consensus reference through local communications with its
   neighbours, and makes distributed control decision based on the
   estimated consensus reference. The proposed approach allows robust
   consensus tracking in the presence of mismatched model uncertainties,
   and the tracking performance is characterised by an

Abstract = {{Objective: Clinical protocols for basal rate testing and adjustment are
   needed for effective insulin pump therapy. We evaluated the effects of a
   continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-based semiautomated basal algorithm
   on glycemia.
   Methods: We developed and piloted a basal rate analyzer that interpreted
   CGM data from overnight fasts and recommended dose changes for
   subsequent nights. Subjects uploaded data online using sensor-augmented
   pumps for evaluation by the analyzer after each of 5 overnight fasts
   conducted over 2 to 8 weeks. It was designed to be conservative and
   iterative, making changes that did not exceed 10\% at each iteration.
   The standard deviation and interquartile range of CGM values from
   midnight to 7 AM (SD12-7am and IQR(12-7am)) over 3 baseline and 3
   postintervention nights, hypoglycemia incidence (CGM values <4.0
   mmol/L), and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) were compared.
   Results: Twenty subjects with mean ages of 38 +/- 13 years and A1C 7.6\%
   +/- 0.8\% (60 +/- 8.7 mmol/mol) underwent the 5 iterations of basal
   assessments over 5 +/- 3 weeks. SD12-7am and IQR12-7am did not change
   from baseline to postintervention (1.57 +/- 0.8 to 1.63 +/- 0.8 mmol/L;
   p = 0.35; 3.66 +/- 2.07 to 3.47 +/- 2.26 mmol/L; p = 0.90). However,
   mean glucose values were lower between 2 to 3 AM at baseline compared to
   postintervention; 3-night hypoglycemia incidence declined from 1.6 +/-
   1.8 to 0.5 +/- 0.7 episodes (p = 0.01), and A1C improved from 7.6\% +/-
   0.8\% to 7.4\% +/- 0.9\% (60\% +/- 8.7\% to 57\% +/- 9.8\% mmol/mol; p =
   0.03).
   Conclusions: The use of a basal rate analyzer was associated with
   reduced hypoglycemia and improved A1C. However, overnight glycemic
   stability was not improved. Further research into the efficacy of the
   CGM-based semiautomated algorithm is warranted. (C) 2015 Canadian

Abstract = {{In order to facilitate the development of CaO-Al2O3 based mould flux for
   casting high aluminium, non-magnetic steel, the effect of CaO/Al2O3
   ratios from 0.6 to 3.2 on viscosity and crystallisation characteristics
   were investigated with the aid of a rotational viscometer, Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy, a single hot thermocouple technique and
   X-ray diffraction analysis. The results showed that, at temperatures
   above 1543 K (1270 degrees C), the viscosity first decreased and then
   became stable with increase in the CaO/Al2O3 ratio. At temperatures
   below 1543 K (1270 degrees C), the viscosity again first decreased but
   then increased, with the CaO/Al2O3 ratio. This viscosity behaviour can
   be attributed to changes in the network structure characteristics and
   the precipitation of solid particles within the liquid flux. Increase in
   the CaO/Al2O3 ratio also first inhibited and then enhanced
   crystallisation as demonstrated by the changes in initial
   crystallisation temperatures and incubation times. The X-ray diffraction
   results confirmed that, at both low and high CaO/Al2O3 ratios, the
   dominant precipitates were compounds with high melting points. On the
   other hand, with CaO/Al2O3 ratios in the midrange, the dominant
   precipitates were compounds with relatively low melting temperatures. It
   is concluded that mould flux with a CaO/Al2O3 ratio in the range 1.1-1.6
   is the most appropriate for casting high aluminium, non-magnetic steels.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe analytically the propagation of Airy-type
   pulses truncated by a finite-time aperture when second-and third-order
   dispersion effects are considered. The mathematical method presented
   here, which is based on the superposition of exponentially truncated
   Airy pulses, is very effective and allows us to avoid the use of
   time-consuming numerical simulations. We analyze the behavior of the
   time-truncated ideal Airy pulse and also the interesting case of a
   time-truncated Airy pulse with a ``defect{''} in its initial profile,
   which reveals the self-healing property of this kind of pulse solution.

Abstract = {{We investigate hybrid tandem solar cells that rely on the combination of
   solution-processed depleted-heterojunction colloidal quantum dot (CQD)
   and bulk heterojunction polymer:fullerene subcells. The hybrid tandem
   solar cell is monolithically integrated and electrically connected in
   series with a suitable p-n recombination layer that includes metal
   oxides and a conjugated polyelectrolyte. We discuss the monolithic
   integration of the subcells, taking into account solvent interactions
   with underlayers and associated constraints on the tandem architecture,
   and show that an adequate device configuration consists of a low bandgap
   CQD bottom cell and a high bandgap polymer:fullerene top cell. Once we
   optimize the recombination layer and individual subcells, the hybrid
   tandem device reaches a V-OC of 1.3 V, approaching the sum of the
   individual subcell voltages. An impressive fill factor of 70\% is
   achieved, further confirming that the subcells are efficiently connected
   via an appropriate recombination layer. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be used as markers for the detection,
   characterization, and targeted therapeutic management of cancer. We
   recently developed a nanoparticle-mediated approach for capture and
   sorting of CTCs based on their specific epithelial phenotype. In the
   current study, we investigate the phenotypic transition of tumor cells
   in an animal model and show the correlation of this transition with
   tumor progression. VX2 tumor cells were injected into rabbits, and CTCs
   were evaluated during tumor progression and correlated with computerized
   tomography (CT) measurements of tumor volume. The results showed a
   dramatic increase of CTCs during the four weeks of tumor growth.
   Following resection, CTC levels dropped but then rebounded, likely due
   to lymph node metastases. Additionally, CTCs showed a marked loss of the
   epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) relative to precursor cells.
   In conclusion, the device accurately traces disease progression and CTC
   phenotypic shift in an animal model.
   From the Clinical Editor: The detection of circulating tumor cells
   (CTCs) has been used to predict disease prognosis. In this study, the
   authors developed a nanoparticle-mediated platform based on
   microfluidics to analyze the differential expressions of epithelial cell
   adhesion molecule (EpCAM) on CTCs in an animal model. It was found that
   the loss of EpCAM correlated with disease progression. Hence, the use of
   this platform may be further applied in other cancer models in the
   future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   improved by over 10 times across a range of electric-field strengths. In
   addition, the temperature dependence of the quality factor is also

Title = {{Microsecond-sustained lasing from colloidal quantum dot solids}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dots have grown in interest as materials for light
   amplification and lasing in view of their bright photoluminescence,
   convenient solution processing and size-controlled spectral tunability.
   To date, lasing in colloidal quantum dot solids has been limited to the
   nanosecond temporal regime, curtailing their application in systems that
   require more sustained emission. Here we find that the chief cause of
   nanosecond-only operation has been thermal runaway: the combination of
   rapid heat injection from the pump source, poor heat removal and a
   highly temperature-dependent threshold. We show microsecond-sustained
   lasing, achieved by placing ultra-compact colloidal quantum dot films on
   a thermally conductive substrate, the combination of which minimizes
   heat accumulation. Specifically, we employ inorganic-halide-capped
   quantum dots that exhibit high modal gain (1,200 cm(-1)) and an ultralow
   amplified spontaneous emission threshold (average peak power of similar
   to 50 kWcm (-2)) and rely on an optical structure that dissipates heat
   while offering minimal modal loss.}},

   the Pressure Acid Leach thickener tank) below the solubility limit of
   calcium sulphate at 140 degrees C (conditions in the medium pressure
   slurry pre-heater) were investigated. Reagents known to form insoluble
   products with calcium such as: Na2CO3, H2C2O4, Na2C2O4 and Na3PO4, were
   investigated and the kinetics and selectivity of the precipitation
   process were evaluated as well. Both Na2CO3 and Na2C2O4 successfully and
   selectively lowered aqueous calcium concentration below the solubility
   limit at 80 degrees C at 1:1 stoichiometric ratios with respect to
   calcium, while excess of H2C2O4 was required in order to achieve
   advanced calcium removal; Na2CO3 in a 2:1 ratio reached even lower
   values, below the solubility limit at 140 degrees C. Na3PO4 in a 1:1
   ratio proved highly inefficient, removing only 67\% of the total

   networks. For example, the study of quantum communication complexity has
   shown that quantum communication allows exponential reductions in the
   information that must be transmitted to solve distributed computational
   tasks. Recently, protocols that realize this advantage using optical
   implementations have been proposed. Here we report a proof-of-concept
   experimental demonstration of a quantum fingerprinting system that is
   capable of transmitting less information than the best-known classical
   protocol. Our implementation is based on a modified version of a
   commercial quantum key distribution system using off-the-shelf optical
   components over telecom wavelengths, and is practical for messages as
   large as 100 Mbits, even in the presence of experimental imperfections.
   Our results provide a first step in the development of experimental
   quantum communication complexity.}},

Title = {{Residual lifetime prediction for lithium-ion battery based on functional

Volume = {{90}},

Abstract = {{Existing methods for predicting lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery residual
   lifetime mostly depend on a priori knowledge on aging mechanism, the use
   of chemical or physical formulation and analytical battery models. This
   dependence is usually difficult to determine in practice, which
   restricts the application of these methods. In this study, we propose a
   new prediction method for Li-ion battery residual lifetime evaluation
   based on FPCA (functional principal component analysis) and Bayesian
   approach. The proposed method utilizes FPCA to construct a nonparametric
   degradation model for Li-ion battery, based on which the residual
   lifetime and the corresponding confidence interval can be evaluated.
   Furthermore, an empirical Bayes approach is utilized to achieve
   real-time updating of the degradation model and concurrently determine
   residual lifetime distribution. Based on Bayesian updating, a more
   accurate prediction result and a more precise confidence interval are
   obtained. Experiments are implemented based on data provided by the NASA
   Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence. Results confirm that the proposed
   prediction method performs well in real-time battery residual lifetime
   prediction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the search for induced chiral plasmonic activity, cholesteric films
   formed by cellulose nanocrystals have attracted great interest as
   potential hosts for plasmonic nanoparticles. Circular dichroism (CD)
   spectra of the composite films exhibit two peaks, one of which is
   ascribed to the cholesteric host and the other one to plasmonic
   chiroptical activity of the plasmonic nanoparticles. Here we report the
   results of comprehensive studies of extinction and CD properties of
   composite films formed by different types of cellulose nanocrystals and
   different types of plasmonic nanoparticles. We show that the second peak
   in the CD spectra acquired using CD spectrometers appears as the result
   of the local reduction of the CD signal of the host material, due to
   excessive absorption by the nanoparticles, and thus it cannot be
   interpreted as induced plasmonic chiroptical activity. Instead, we
   propose an alternative way to measure CD spectra of plasmonic
   cholesteric films by using Mueller matrix transmission ellipsometry. The
   results of this study are important for ongoing research in the field of
   chiral plasmonics and for the optical characterization of a broad range

Title = {{Movement decoding using neural synchronization and inter-hemispheric
   connectivity from deep brain local field potentials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Correlating electrical activity within the human brain to
   movement is essential for developing and refining interventions (e.g.
   deep brain stimulation (DBS)) to treat central nervous system disorders.
   It also serves as a basis for next generation brain-machine interfaces
   (BMIs). This study highlights a new decoding strategy for capturing
   movement and its corresponding laterality from deep brain local field
   potentials (LFPs). Approach. LFPs were recorded with surgically
   implanted electrodes from the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus
   interna in twelve patients with Parkinson's disease or dystonia during a
   visually cued finger-clicking task. We introduce a method to extract
   frequency dependent neural synchronization and inter-hemispheric
   connectivity features based upon wavelet packet transform (WPT) and
   Granger causality approaches. A novel weighted sequential feature
   selection algorithm has been developed to select optimal feature subsets
   through a feature contribution measure. This is particularly useful when
   faced with limited trials of high dimensionality data as it enables
   estimation of feature importance during the decoding process. Main
   results. This novel approach was able to accurately and informatively
   decode movement related behaviours from the recorded LFP activity. An
   average accuracy of 99.8\% was achieved for movement identification,
   whilst subsequent laterality classification was 81.5\%. Feature
   contribution analysis highlighted stronger contralateral causal driving
   between the basal ganglia hemispheres compared to ipsilateral driving,
   with causality measures considerably improving laterality
   discrimination. Significance. These findings demonstrate optimally
   selected neural synchronization alongside causality measures related to
   inter-hemispheric connectivity can provide an effective control signal
   for augmenting adaptive BMIs. In the case of DBS patients, acquiring
   such signals requires no additional surgery whilst providing a
   relatively stable and computationally inexpensive control signal. This
   has the potential to extend invasive BMI, based on recordings within the
   motor cortex, by providing additional information from subcortical
   regions.}},

Abstract = {{Burning feedstock with high and constantly varying moisture content is a
   challenge in the operation of the stoker-grate type biomass boilers in
   pulp and paper mills. A fundamental study was performed, using a
   thermogravimetric combustor controlled at different temperatures, to
   systematically investigate the effect of moisture content on the
   combustion behavior of several woody biomasses. The results show that
   combustion occurred through three stages: drying, devolatilization, and
   char burning. Increasing the moisture content of the sample above 30\%
   significantly increased the drying time and the time to ignition of the
   sample. Moisture content, however, had only a small effect on the
   devolatilization rate and virtually no effect on the char burning rate.
   Furnace temperature had a great effect on combustion. Samples containing
   40\% moisture could still ignite and burn readily at 800 degrees C, but
   they took a much longer time to ignite at 500 degrees C and did not
   ignite at 400 degrees C. These results imply that in biomass boiler
   operation, the high moisture content in feedstock delays combustion and
   causes the furnace temperature to decrease. The low temperature, in
   turn, suppresses combustion, further decreasing the furnace temperature
   and causing more delay in combustion. This downward spiral will
   eventually lead to a boiler blackout unless the biomass feed rate is
   significantly reduced or the auxiliary fuel (natural gas and fuel oil)
   flow rate cofired in the boiler is increased to keep the furnace
   temperature high.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the completion
   delay for instantly decodable network coding (IDNC) in wireless
   multicast and broadcast scenarios. We are interested in this class of
   network coding due to its numerous benefits, such as low decoding delay,
   low coding and decoding complexities, and simple receiver requirements.
   We first extend the IDNC graph, which represents all feasible IDNC
   coding opportunities, to efficiently operate in both multicast and
   broadcast scenarios. We then formulate the minimum completion delay
   problem for IDNC as a stochastic shortest path (SSP) problem. Although
   finding the optimal policy using SSP is intractable, we use this
   formulation to draw the theoretical guidelines for the policies that can
   minimize the completion delay in IDNC. Based on these guidelines, we
   design a maximum weight clique selection algorithm, which can
   efficiently reduce the IDNC completion delay in polynomial time. We also
   design a quadratic-time heuristic clique selection algorithm, which can
   operate in real-time applications. Simulation results show that our
   proposed algorithms significantly reduce the IDNC completion delay
   compared to the random and maximum-rate algorithms, and almost achieve
   the global optimal completion delay performance over all network codes
   in broadcast scenarios.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{116}},

Abstract = {{The telltale mirror, a smooth inclined surface raised over 1 m above the
   deck of the Phoenix Mars Lander, was observed by the Surface Stereo
   Imager (SSI) several times per sol during the Phoenix Mars Lander
   mission. These observations were combined with a radiative transfer
   model to determine the thickness of dust on the wind telltale mirror as
   a function of time. 239 telltale sequences were analyzed and dustiness
   was determined on a diurnal and seasonal basis. The thickness of
   accumulated dust did not follow any particular diurnal or seasonal
   trend. The dust thickness on the mirror over the mission was 0.82 +/-
   039 mu m, which suggests a similar thickness to the modal scattering
   particle diameter. This suggests that inclining a surface beyond the
   angle of repose and polishing it to remove surface imperfections is an
   effective way to mitigate the accumulation of dust to less than a micron
   over a wide range of meteorological conditions and could be beneficial
   for surfaces which can tolerate some dust but not thick accumulations,
   such as solar panels. However, such a surface will not remain completely
   dust free through this action alone and mechanical or electrical
   clearing must be employed to remove adhered dust if a pristine surface
   is required. The single-scattering phase function of the dust on the
   mirror was consistent with the single-scattering phase function of
   martian aerosol dust at 450 nm, suggesting that this result is
   inconsistent with models of the atmosphere which require vertically or
   horizontally separated components or broad size distributions to explain
   the scattering behavior of these aerosols in the blue. The
   single-scattering behavior of the dust on the mirror is also consistent
   with Hapke modeling of spherical particles. The presence of a monolayer
   of particles would tend to support the spherical conclusion: such
   particles would be most strongly adhered electrostatically. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Immobilization of enzymes on solid supports has been widely used to
   improve enzyme recycling, enzyme stability, and performance. We are
   interested in using aqueous microgels (colloidal hydrogels) as carriers
   for enzymes used in high-temperature reactions. These microgels should
   maintain their volume and colloidal stability in aqueous media up to 100
   degrees C to serve as thermo-stable supports for enzymes. For this
   purpose, we prepared poly(N-hydroxyethyl acrylamide) (PHEAA) microgels
   via a two-step synthesis. First, we used precipitation polymerization in
   water to synthesize colloidal poly(diethylene glycol-ethyl ether
   acrylate) (PDEGAC) particles as a precursor. PDEGAC forms solvent
   swollen microgels in organic solvents such as methanol and dioxane and
   in water at temperatures below 15 degrees C. In the second step, these
   PDEGAC particles were transformed to PHEAA microgels through aminolysis
   in dioxane with ethanolamine and a small amount of ethylenediamine.
   Dynamic laser scattering studies confirmed that the colloidal stability
   of microgels was maintained during the aminolysis in dioxane and
   subsequent transfer to water. Characterization of the PHEAA microgels
   indicated about 9 mol \% of primary amino groups. These provide
   functionality for bioconjugation. As proof-of-concept experiments, we
   attached the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to these aqueous
   microgels through (i) N-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide
   hydrochloride (EDC) coupling to the carboxylated microgels or (ii)
   bis-aryl hydrazone (BAH) coupling to microgels functionalized with
   6-hydrazinonicotinate acetone (PHEAA-HyNic). Our results showed that HRP
   maintained its catalytic activity after covalent attachment (87\% for
   EDC coupling, 96\% for BAH coupling). The microgel enhanced the
   stability of the enzyme to thermal denaturation. For example, the
   residual activity of the microgel-supported enzyme was 76\% after 330
   min of annealing at 50 degrees C, compared to only 20\% for the free
   enzyme under these conditions. PHEAA microgels in water show great
   promise as hosts for enzymatic reaction, especially at elevated
   temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{We study the multi-resource allocation problem in cloud computing
   systems where the resource pool is constructed from a large number of
   heterogeneous servers, representing different points in the
   configuration space of resources such as processing, memory, and
   storage. We design a multi-resource allocation mechanism, called DRFH,
   that generalizes the notion of Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF) from a
   single server to multiple heterogeneous servers. DRFH provides a number
   of highly desirable properties. With DRFH, no user prefers the
   allocation of another user; no one can improve its allocation without
   decreasing that of the others; and more importantly, no coalition
   behavior of misreporting resource demands can benefit all its members.
   DRFH also ensures some level of service isolation among the users. As a
   direct application, we design a simple heuristic that implements DRFH in
   real-world systems. Large-scale simulations driven by Google cluster
   traces show that DRFH significantly outperforms the traditional
   slot-based scheduler, leading to much higher resource utilization with
   substantially shorter job completion times.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene oxide (GO) is a layered material comprised of hierarchical
   features which possess vastly differing characteristic dimensions. GO
   nanosheets represent the critical hierarchical structure which bridges
   the length-scale of monolayer and bulk material architectures. In this
   study, the strength and fracture behavior of GO nanosheets were
   examined. Under uniaxial loading, the tensile strength of the nanosheets
   was measured to be as high as 12 +/- 4 GPa, which approaches the
   intrinsic strength of monolayer GO and is orders of magnitude higher
   than that of bulk GO materials. During mechanical failure, brittle
   fracture was observed in a highly localized region through the
   cross-section of the nanosheets without interlayer pull-out. This
   transition in the failure behavior from interplanar fracture, common for
   bulk GO, to intraplanar fracture, which dominates failure in monolayer
   GO, is responsible for the high strength measured in the nanosheets.
   Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the elastic release from
   the propagation of intraplanar cracks initiates global fracture due to
   interlayer load transmission through hydrogen bond networks within the
   gallery space of the GO nanosheets. Furthermore, the GO nanosheet
   strength and stiffness were found to be strongly correlated to the
   effective volume and thickness of the samples, respectively. These
   findings help to bridge the understanding of the mechanical behavior of
   hierarchical GO materials and will ultimately guide the application of
   this intermediate scale material.}},

Abstract = {{In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), gene regulatory networks (GRNs)
   coordinate gene expression to maintain ESC identity; however, the
   complete repertoire of factors regulating the ESC state is not fully
   understood. Our previous temporal microarray analysis of ESC commitment
   identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase protein Makorin-1 (MKRN1) as a
   potential novel component of the ESC GRN. Here, using multilayered
   systems-level analyses, we compiled a MKRN1-centered interactome in
   undifferentiated ESCs at the proteomic and ribonomic level. Proteomic
   analyses in undifferentiated ESCs revealed that MKRN1 associates with
   RNA-binding proteins, and ensuing RIP-chip analysis determined that
   MKRN1 associates with mRNAs encoding functionally related proteins
   including proteins that function during cellular stress. Subsequent
   biological validation identified MKRN1 as a novel stress
   granule-resident protein, although MKRN1 is not required for stress
   granule formation, or survival of unstressed ESCs. Thus, our unbiased
   systems-level analyses support a role for the E3 ligase MKRN1 as a
   ribonucleoprotein within the ESC GRN.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{The effects of cellulose nanofiber (CNF) on the non-isothermal
   crystallization behaviors of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) at atmospheric
   pressure and at various CO2 pressures were investigated using a regular
   differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and a high-pressure DSC at
   different cooling rates of 1, 2, 3, and 5 degrees C/min. The POM images
   revealed that the CNFs acted as crystal nucleating agents, increasing
   the number of crystals and decreasing the crystal sizes. The
   non-isothermal crystallization showed that PLA's crystallization rate
   increased with cooling rates and the incorporation of CNFs accelerated
   the overall crystallization kinetics by providing more nuclei, thereby
   decreasing the crystallization half-time. The degree of crystallinity
   was not proportional to the CO2 pressure. The highest crystallinity was
   obtained at a higher pressure with increased cooling rates. The
   activation energy analysis showed that the incorporation of CNFs
   restricted the movement of PLA molecular chains, thereby hindering
   crystallization. By comparing the Avrami analysis, Mo analysis, and
   activation energy results, it was speculated that heterogeneous crystal
   nucleation with the presence of CNFs might be the dominant factor in
   determining the overall non-isothermal crystallization rate of the
   PLA/CNF composites. Wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) diffractograms
   showed that CNFs and CO2 pressure had no influence on the crystalline
   structure of PLA. The effects of CNF content, CO2 pressure, and cooling
   rate on T-c, T-m, and T-g were also investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Introduction: Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), chelating agents, and
   chlorhexidine (CHX), which are commonly used irrigants during endodontic
   treatment, have the potential to alter the physical and chemical
   properties of the dentin structure. The aim of this study was to use
   time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry to qualitatively evaluate
   the chemical characteristics of dentin surface and compare it with
   dentin exposed to NaOCl, EDTA, or CHX. Methods: Four blocks of dentin
   from a root of a human maxillary molar were embedded in resin and
   trimmed with a microtome to expose the dentin. Samples were randomly
   assigned to 4 treatment groups: (1) no irrigation treatment (sample A),
   (2) 2.5\% NaOCl (sample B), (3) 17\% EDTA (sample C), and (4) 2\% CHX
   (sample D). Dentin surfaces were analyzed by time-of-flight secondary
   ion mass `spectrometry, which allowed characterization of dentin surface
   chemistry by both imaging and mass spectroscopic analysis obtained in
   high mass and spatial resolution modes. Results: Sample A revealed
   intense peaks characteristics of hydroxyapatite in addition to Na+, K+,
   CH4N+, CN-, CNO-, Mg+, F-, and HCO2- peaks. Sample B showed severely
   decreased CH4N+ and increased intensity of Cl-. Sample C lacked Ca+ and
   Mg+ and showed decreased PO2- and PO3-. Sample D exhibited a distinct
   presence of CHX. The spectral image of sample A displayed even
   distribution of Na+ and Ca+ on a smeared surface. The surfaces of
   samples B and D had patent dentinal tubules, whereas sample D showed an
   intense CHX signal: Sample C had some patent dentinal tubules and lacked
   Ca+. Conclusions: NaOCl removed protein components from the dentin
   matrix, EDTA removed calcium and magnesium ions from the dentin, and CHX
   formed an adsorbed layer on the dentin surface.}},

Title = {{Controlled release of bioactive PDGF-AA from a hydrogel/nanoparticle
   composite}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Pages = {{35-42}},

Abstract = {{Polymer excipients, such as low molar mass poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG),
   have shown contradictory effects on protein stability when
   co-encapsulated in polymeric nanoparticles. To gain further insight into
   these effects, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-AA) was encapsulated
   in polymeric nanoparticles with vs. without PEG. PDGF-AA is a
   particularly compelling protein, as it has been demonstrated to promote
   cell survival and induce the oligodendrocyte differentiation of neural
   stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) both in vitro and in vivo. Here we show,
   for the first time, the controlled release of bioactive PDGF-AA from an
   injectable nanoparticle/hydrogel drug delivery system (DDS). PDGF-AA was
   encapsulated, with high efficiency, in poly(lactide-co-glycolide)
   nanoparticles, and its release from the drug delivery system was
   followed over 21 d. Interestingly, the co-encapsulation of low molecular
   weight poly(ethylene glycol) increased the PDGF-AA loading but,
   unexpectedly, accelerated the aggregation of PDGF-AA, resulting in
   reduced activity and detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA). In the absence of PEG, released PDGF-AA remained bioactive as
   demonstrated with NSPC oligodendrocyte differentiation, similar to
   positive controls, and significantly different from untreated controls.
   This work presents a novel delivery method for differentiation factors,
   such as PDGF-AA, and provides insights into the contradictory effects
   reported in the literature of excipients, such as PEG, on the loading
   and release of proteins from polymeric nanoparticles.
   Statement of Significance
   Previously, the polymer poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has been used in
   many biomaterials applications, from surface coatings to the
   encapsulation of proteins. In this work, we demonstrate that,
   unexpectedly, low molecular weight PEG has a deleterious effect on the
   release of the encapsulated protein platelet-derived growth factor AA
   (PDGF-AA). We also demonstrate release of bioactive PDGF-AA (in the
   absence of PEG). Specifically, we demonstrate the differentiation of
   neural stem and progenitor cells to oligodendrocytes, similar to what is
   observed with the addition of fresh PDGFAA. A differentiated
   oligodendrocyte population is a key strategy in central nervous system
   regeneration. This work is the first demonstration of controlled PDGF-AA
   release, and also brings new insights to the broader field of protein
   encapsulation. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper reports the experimental and numerical results of soot
   formation in laminar coflow diffusion flames of vaporized
   gasoline/ethanol blends at atmospheric pressure to gain improved
   understanding of ethanol addition to gasoline on soot formation. Four
   gasoline/ethanol blends of different ethanol mole fractions in the fuel
   stream ranging from 0\% up to 85\%, E0, E20, E50, and E85, were
   investigated to quantify how soot loading varies with the amount of
   ethanol blending in the fuel. The laminar coflow diffusion flames were
   generated using a burner system designed for vaporized liquid fuels. The
   fuel stream was heavily diluted with nitrogen to lower the boiling
   points and to prevent the flames from smoking. The soot volume fraction
   distributions were measured using a 2D line-of-sight attenuation
   technique. These flames were also modeled numerically using the
   extensively validated CoFlame code and a recently developed reaction
   mechanism for gasoline surrogates including PAH formation. The results
   of experiment and numerical modeling agree quite well in terms of the
   levels of soot volume fraction and they both show a decrease in the soot
   loading as more ethanol is added in the fuel stream. The measured peak
   soot volume fraction occurs in the flame centerline region. The soot
   model used in this study is unable to capture this experimental feature
   and predicts the peak soot volume fraction in the co-annular region.
   Ethanol addition reduces the soot loading primarily by lowering soot
   inception and PAH condensation rates through decreasing the
   concentrations of aromatics. Additional measurements in gasoline
   surrogate/ethanol blend flames indicate that the gasoline surrogate
   model emulates well the sooting propensity of the real gasoline fuel.

Abstract = {{The availability of accurate and broadband models for underground and
   submarine cable systems is of paramount importance for the correct
   prediction of electromagnetic transients in power grids. Recently, we
   proposed the MoM-SO method for extracting the series impedance of power
   cables while accounting for the skin and proximity effects in the
   conductors. In this paper, we extend the method to include ground return
   effects and to handle cables placed inside a tunnel. Numerical tests
   show that the proposed method is more accurate than widely used analytic
   formulas, and is much faster than existing proximity-aware approaches,
   such as finite elements. For a three-phase cable system in a tunnel, the
   proposed method requires only 0.3 s of CPU time per frequency point,
   against the 8.3 min taken by finite elements, for a speed up beyond 1000
   X.}},

Title = {{A biomechanical model for cell polarization and intercalation during
   Drosophila germband extension}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Germband extension during Drosophila development features the merging of
   cells along the dorsal-ventral (DV) axis and their separation along the
   anterior-posterior (AP) axis. This intercalation process involves planar
   cell polarity, anisotropic contractile forces along cell edges, and
   concerted cell deformation and movement. Although prior experiments have
   probed each of these factors separately, the connection among them
   remains unclear. This paper presents a chemo-mechanical model that
   integrates the three factors into a coherent framework. The model
   predicts the polarization of Rho-kinase, myosin and Bazooka downstream
   of an anisotropic Shroom distribution. In particular, myosin accumulates
   on cell edges along the DV axis, causing them to contract into a vertex.
   Subsequently, medial myosin in the cells anterior and posterior to the
   vertex helps to elongate it into a new edge parallel to the body axis.
   Thus, the tissue extends along the AP axis and narrows in the transverse
   direction through neighbor exchange. Model predictions of the polarity
   of the proteins and cell and tissue deformation are in good agreement
   with experimental observations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine whether depression predicts less improvement in
   fear of falling and falls efficacy in older adults attending a falls
   prevention program (FPP). Methods: Using a prospective observational
   design in an academic medical center, the authors studied 69 nondemented
   adults aged 55 years or older (mean age: 77.8 +/- 8.9 years) who had
   experienced at least one fall in the previous year and who attended the
   FPP. The primary outcome variable was change in severity of fear of
   falling during the FPP. Secondary outcome variables were change in falls
   efficacy and fear-related restriction of activities during the FPP.
   Independent variables were baseline depressive disorders and depressive
   symptom severity. Results: Twenty-one of 69 study participants (30.4\%)
   had a depressive disorder at baseline. Depressive disorder and
   depressive symptoms were not associated with change in severity of fear
   of falling or restriction of activity. On the other hand, depressive
   disorder was associated with improvement in falls efficacy, although
   this finding was not significant in multivariate analysis. Among
   participants with a depressive disorder, improvement in falls efficacy
   was significantly correlated with improvement in depressive symptoms.
   Conclusion: There was no association between baseline depression and
   change in fear of falling in this FPP. The correlation between
   improvement in depressive symptoms and improvement in falls efficacy
   raises the question as to whether a cognitive-behavioral intervention
   that simultaneously targets both depression and falls efficacy would be
   a useful component of a FPP.}},

Abstract = {{Horizontal and vertical handoffs are important ramifications of user
   mobility in multitier heterogeneous wireless networks. They directly
   impact the signaling overhead and quality of calls. However, they are
   difficult to analyze due to the irregularly shaped network topologies
   introduced by multiple tiers of cells. In this paper, a stochastic
   geometric analysis framework on user mobility is proposed, to capture
   the spatial randomness and various scales of cell sizes in different
   tiers. We derive theoretical expressions for the rates of all handoff
   types experienced by an active user with arbitrary movement trajectory.
   Furthermore, noting that the data rate of a user depends on the set of
   cell tiers that it is willing to use, we provide guidelines for optimal
   tier selection under various user velocities, taking both the handoff
   rates and the data rate into consideration. Empirical studies using user
   mobility trace data and extensive simulation are conducted,
   demonstrating the correctness and usefulness of our analysis.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{One role of grid operators is to identify potential problems before they
   occur and, if necessary, take preemptive actions. As wind generation
   becomes increasingly widespread, there is the potential for credible,
   simultaneous fluctuations of output at different locations to result in
   limit violations. Existing analysis methods that consider forecast
   errors either inadequately model the control responses available to
   system operators (e.g., using participation factors) or ignore network
   constraints, which limits their utility in identifying situations that
   would require operator action. An alternative method of handling
   forecast errors, utilizing bilevel programming, is proposed here to
   identify situations that may result in branch overloads. What
   distinguishes this method from prior approaches is that it only
   identifies overloads that can occur despite optimal operator reaction to
   forecast errors-i.e., when the overload is unavoidable, given current
   control capabilities. Studies conducted on 37- and 118-bus test systems
   demonstrate both the utility and feasibility of using this method for
   online operations.}},

Abstract = {{Radiation oncology has long required quantitative imaging approaches for
   the safe and effective delivery of radiation therapy. The past 10 years
   has seen a remarkable expansion in the variety of novel imaging signals
   and analyses that are starting to contribute to the prescription and
   design of the radiation treatment plan. These include a rapid increase
   in the use of magnetic resonance imaging, development of
   contrast-enhanced imaging techniques, integration of fluorinated
   deoxyglucose positron emission tomography, evaluation of hypoxia imaging
   techniques, and numerous others. These are reviewed with an effort to
   highlight challenges related to quantification and reproducibility. In
   addition, several of the emerging applications of these imaging
   approaches are also highlighted. Finally, the growing community of
   support for establishing quantitative imaging approaches as we move
   toward clinical evaluation is summarized and the need for a clinical
   service in support of the clinical science and delivery of care is
   proposed. Semin Radiat Oncol 25:292-304 (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, the impact of dead-ended anode (DEA) operation on the
   liquid water management of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells
   (PEMPCs) was investigated using X-ray synchrotron radiography. The fuel
   cell voltage and concurrent through-plane liquid water saturations in
   anode and cathode gas diffusion layers (GDLs) were measured during DEA
   and open anode operation. It was observed that DEA operation led to
   significant increases in liquid water content in both anode and cathode
   GDLs, along with fuel cell power output degradation. A strong
   correlation was observed between the buildup of the liquid water in the
   anode and the cathode, and as a result, the liquid water transport in
   the cathode was also significantly impacted by this DEA operation. (C)

Abstract = {{We study a form of unequal error protection that we term unequal message
   protection (UMP). The message set of a UMP code is a union of m disjoint
   message classes. Each class has its own error protection requirement,
   with some classes needing better error protection than others. We
   analyze the tradeoff between rates of message classes and the levels of
   error protection; our analysis reveals new tradeoffs, which were not
   captured by prior works on UMP codes. To obtain our results, we
   generalize finite block length achievability and converse bounds due to
   Polyanskiy-Poor-Verdu. We evaluate our bounds for the binary symmetric
   and binary erasure channels, and analyze the asymptotic characteristic
   of the bounds in the fixed error and moderate deviations regimes. In
   addition, we consider two questions related to the practical
   construction of UMP codes. First, we study a header construction that
   prefixes the message class into a header followed by data protection
   using a standard homogeneous (classical) code. We show that, in general,
   this construction is not optimal at finite block lengths. We further
   demonstrate that our main UMP achievability bound can be obtained using
   coset codes, which suggests a path to implementation of tractable UMP
   codes.}},

Title = {{The Challenge of Air Valves: A Selective Critical Literature Review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{One key alternative for removing, preventing, and effectively coping
   with the often vexing presence of air in water pipelines is the
   combination air-vacuum valve. Despite their often effective role, such
   valves can be highly problematic if not well designed and maintained.
   This paper critically reviews the current design, application,
   functionality, and simulation of air valves and the associated
   shortcomings, with a primary focus on air/vacuum valves (AVVs). It is
   argued that the efficient number of air valves along undulating
   pipelines is yet to be fully articulated. Air-valve simulations should
   expressively consider their dynamic behavior, the physical behavior of
   any air pockets that might form below an air valve, and the varying
   character of the water surface at the air valve location. There is a
   pressing need for a comprehensive and systematic study on the proper
   sizing and location of AVVs for the transient protection of systems.
   Overall, the efficient application of AVVs requires broad research and
   development theoretically (i.e., their physical behavior and improved
   numerical simulations) and experimentally, as well as field studies to
   document their in situ dynamic behavior and operational efficiency. (C)

Abstract = {{A theoretical analysis is provided of the extent to which doses from
   ultraviolet (UV) reactors in series are additive. It is shown that UV
   reactors' reduction equivalent dose (RED) depends on the sensitivity of
   the microbe, the limits of which are the minimum and average of the dose
   distribution for infinitely sensitive and infinitely resistant microbes.
   For complete interbank mixing between two reactors in series, the
   additivity of RED is preserved. For systems where there is a negative
   correlation between dose paths, the RED is greater than or equal to
   twice that of a single reactor. The converse occurs for positive
   correlation. It is proven that when a single reactor is validated with a
   microbe whose sensitivity is at least twice that of the target microbe,
   it is assured that two identical UV reactors in series will deliver a
   RED at least two times that of the single reactor. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{Intraoperative imaging technologies including computed tomography and
   fluorescence optical imaging are becoming routine tools in the cancer
   surgery operating room. They constitute an enabling platform for high
   performance surgical resections that assure local control while
   minimizing morbidity. New contrast agents that can increase the
   sensitivity and visualization power of existing intraoperative imaging
   techniques will further enhance their clinical benefit. We report here
   the development, detection and visualization of a dual-modality computed
   tomography and near-infrared fluorescence nano liposomal agent (CF800)
   in multiple preclinical animal models of cancer. We describe the
   successful application of this agent for combined preoperative computed
   tomography based three-dimensional surgical planning and intraoperative
   target mapping (>200 Hounsfield Units enhancement), as well as
   near-infrared fluorescence guided resection (>5-fold tumor-to-background
   ratio). These results strongly support the clinical advancement of this
   agent for image-guided surgery with potential to improve lesion
   localization, margin delineation and metastatic lymph node detection.

Abstract = {{In this paper, an automated cell orientation control system is proposed
   to reorient suspended cells in the plane, about a single axis of
   rotation. The system consists of a vision system, which images the
   suspended cell, a software system which estimates the cell orientation
   angle, and a rotating electric field, applied to rotate the suspended
   cell. The angular coordinate of the cell is used as a feedback in a
   closed-loop system to reorient the cell, rotating it to its desired
   angle. The closed-loop feedback system permits the suspended cell
   orientation to track reference input signals. A microscale device,
   energized with sinusoidal voltages, is used to generate a rotating
   electric field. This device was designed and fabricated using MEMS
   fabrication techniques. A vision-tracking algorithm to image and
   estimate cell orientation in real time was designed and implemented,
   based on the circular Hough transform. The cell is driven to its desired
   orientation angle with a PID controller using the estimated cell
   rotation angle as a feedback. Experiments have been carried out which
   demonstrate that the cell orientation control system performs well. A
   variety of tests have been performed, including step response and
   trajectory following. Cell orientation control may be used as one step
   in the general process of orienting cells for cell surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Galactose oxidase (EC 1.1.3.9) is a single copper metalloenzyme, having
   a molecular weight of 65-68 kDa. Galactose oxidase catalyzes the
   oxidation of primary alcohols to corresponding aldehydes with strict
   regioselectivity, and the selectivity is high for the galactose C-6
   primary hydroxyl group. The oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds
   is one of the most important reactions in synthetic chemistry, thus
   enzymatic biocatalysis requiring only molecular oxygen as an oxidant is
   a valuable alternative to chemical reagents.
   We review here the various mono-, oligo- and polysaccharide derivatives
   that have been synthesized by galactose oxidase-catalyzed reactions, and
   the several either qualitative or quantitative analytical techniques
   utilized to follow of the reaction, determine the conversion, and
   identify the products. The optimal reaction conditions, the formation of
   side products, and the oxidation of substrates other than carbohydrates
   are discussed. Finally, we summarize engineering efforts of galactose
   oxidase that have improved recombinant enzyme expression and yield, or
   altered substrate specificity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We address a novel integrated maintenance and production scheduling
   problem in a multi-machine and multi-period production system,
   considering maintenance as a long-term decision. Deterioration of
   machines over time decreases production capacity. Since maintenance
   activities not only improve machine conditions, increasing production
   capacity, but also take time that cannot be used for production, the
   challenge is to assign maintenance to periods and to schedule
   maintenance and production activities within each period to minimize the
   combined cost of maintenance and lost production over the planning
   horizon. Motivated by logic-based Benders decomposition, we design an
   integrated two-stage algorithm to solve the problem. The first stage
   assigns maintenance to machines and time periods, abstracting the
   scheduling problem, while the second stage creates a schedule for the
   current time period. The first stage is then re-solved using feedback
   from the schedule. This iteration between maintenance planning and
   scheduling continues until the solution costs in two stages converge.
   The integrated approach models the interdependencies between maintenance
   and scheduling decisions in highly coupled processes such as wafer
   fabrication in the semiconductor manufacturing. Our results demonstrate
   that the benefit of integrated decision making increases when
   maintenance is less expensive relative to lost production cost and that
   a longer horizon for maintenance planning is beneficial when maintenance
   cost increases.}},

Abstract = {{Tuned liquid dampers (TLDs) are dynamic vibration absorbers used in
   suppressing structural vibration under wind and seismic loads. They are
   easy to design and implement with low cost and low maintenance. However,
   due to their highly nonlinear behavior, it is difficult to establish
   representative models for TLDs that are accurate for a wide range of
   operations. In this paper, a new numerical model (finite volume
   method/finite element method (FVM/FEM method)) is introduced by
   simultaneously using finite volume and finite element approaches to
   represent fluid and solid domains, respectively. In order to assess the
   accuracy of the FVM/FEM results a state of the art experimental
   technique, namely real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS), is used. During
   the RTHS the response from the TLD is obtained experimentally while the
   structure is modeled in a computer, thus capturing the TLD-structure
   interaction in real-time. By keeping the structure as the analytical
   model, RTHS offers a unique flexibility in that a wide range of
   influential parameters are investigated without modifications to the
   experimental setup. This is not possible in traditional shake-table
   dynamic tests where a physical model of the structure needs to be built
   and tested together with the TLD. As a result, the verification of the
   numerical models for TLD-structure interaction available in the
   literature only consider a smaller, restricted dataset. In this study
   three numerical models from the literature are selected and together
   with the FVM/FEM developed here, the accuracies of these four models are
   assessed in comparison with RTHS results that consider a wide range of
   influential parameters. Results show that the proposed FVM/FEM model can
   accurately predict TLD behavior in both sinusoidal and ground motion
   forces and Yu's model is the most accurate among the investigated
   simplified models.}},

   observational study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: In a previous study of interruptions to intensive care unit
   (ICU) nurses, we found that other personnel tend to regulate their
   interruptions based on nurses' tasks. However, nurses' tasks are not
   always immediately visible to an interrupter. This article evaluates a
   task-severity awareness tool (TAT) designed for nurses to inform others
   when they are performing high-severity tasks. When a nurse engages the
   tool within an ICU room, a ``do not disturb please!{''} message is
   displayed outside the room.
   Methods: Task-severity awareness tool was installed in a cardiovascular
   ICU room at a Canadian hospital. Fifteen nurses assigned to the TAT room
   and 13 nurses assigned to 11 other rooms were observed, approximately 2
   hours each, over a 3-week period. Data were collected in real time,
   using a tablet computer.
   Results: Interruption rate during high-severity tasks in the TAT room
   was significantly lower than in other rooms; interruptions with personal
   content were entirely mitigated during high-severity tasks. Furthermore,
   interruptions from nurses and medical doctors were also entirely
   mitigated during high-severity tasks but happened more frequently during
   non-high-severity tasks compared with rooms with no TAT.
   Conclusions: Task-severity awareness tool proved to be effective in
   mitigating unnecessary interruptions to critical tasks. Future research
   should assess its long-term effectiveness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline (nc) metals are very attractive research materials due
   to the many beneficial properties the nc structure offers. However, the
   thermal stability of the nc structure is often of concern due to its
   high energy state. One curious phenomenon, often reported in nc Ni, is
   the occurrence of a late stage abnormal grain growth (AGG) which results
   in the appearance of abnormal-sized grains with faceted grain
   boundaries. Previously, it was reported that such an AGG stage was
   brought on by a critical S concentration at certain boundaries. On the
   contrary, a late stage AGG was observed in electroformed nc Ni without
   intentionally added additives, including those containing S. The
   objective of this study is to further elucidate on the initiation and
   growth of these faceted boundaries. The progression of this AGG stage in
   electroformed Ni has been systematically investigated by utilizing
   optical and electron microscopy. Clearly, the late stage AGG did not
   require a critical S concentration to occur in this case. Moreover,
   these faceted boundaries were found to be highly stable once its planar
   nature is fully developed suggesting that the previous focus on the
   rapid migration of these faceted boundaries may be misplaced.}},

Title = {{The relationship between interruption content and interrupted task
   severity in intensive care nursing: an observational study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1573-1581}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: In a previous study, we observed that the majority of
   interruptions experienced by nurses in a cardiovascular intensive care
   unit (CVICU) carried information directly related to their patient or
   other aspects of work affecting other patients or indirectly affecting
   their patient. Further, the proportion of interruptions with personal
   content was significantly higher during low-severity (in case of an
   error as defined by nurses) tasks compared to medium- and high-severity
   tasks suggesting that other personnel may have evaluated the criticality
   of the nurses' tasks before interrupting. However, this earlier study
   only collected data when an interruption happened and thus could not
   investigate interruption rate as a function of primary task type and
   severity while controlling for primary task duration as an exposure
   variable.
   Objectives: We addressed this methodological limitation in a second
   observational study that was conducted to further study interruptions
   and also to evaluate an interruption mitigation tool. The data from the
   baseline condition (i.e., no tool) is analyzed in this paper to validate
   the results of our previous study and to report interruption rates
   observed during tasks of varying severities (low, medium, high), with a
   particular focus on comparing different interruption contents.
   Design and setting: The study was conducted in a 24-bed closed CVICU at
   a Canadian hospital, during day shifts.
   Participants: The baseline condition involved thirteen nurses.
   Methods: Over a 3-week period, three researchers observed these nurses
   46-120 min each, with an average of 89 mm. Data were collected in real
   time, using a tablet computer and software designed for this purpose.
   The rate of interruptions with different content was compared across
   varying task severity levels as defined by CVICU nurses.
   Results: Nurses spent about 50\% of their time conducting
   medium-severity tasks (e.g., documentation), 35\% conducting
   high-severity tasks (e.g., procedure), and 14\% conducting low-severity
   tasks (e.g., general care). The rate of interruptions with personal
   content observed during low-severity tasks was 1.97 (95\% confidence
   interval, Cl: 1.04, 3.74) and 3.23 (95\% Cl: 1.51, 6.89) times the rate
   of interruptions with personal content observed during high- and
   medium-severity tasks, respectively.
   Conclusions: Interrupters might have evaluated task severity before
   interrupting. Increasing the transparency of the nature and severity of
   the task being performed may help others further modulate when and how
   they interrupt a nurse. Overall, rather than try to eliminate all
   interruptions, mitigation strategies should consider the relevance of
   interruptions to a task or patient as well as their urgency. (C) 2015

Title = {{The role of the sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling pathway in osteocyte
   mechanotransduction}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{71-78}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Osteocytes are proposed to be the mechanosensory cells that translate
   mechanical loading into biochemical signals during the process of bone
   adaptation. The lipid mediator sphingosine-l-phosphate (SIP) has been
   reported to play a role in the mechanotransduction process of blood
   vessels and also in the dynamic control of bone mineral homeostasis.
   Nevertheless, the potential role of SIP in bone mechanotransduction has
   yet to be elucidated. In this study, we hypothesized that a SIP cascade
   is involved in the activation of osteocytes in response to
   loading-induced oscillatory fluid flow (OFF) in bone. MLO-Y4
   osteocyte-like cells express the necessary components of a functional
   SIP cascade. To examine the involvement of SIP signaling in osteocyte
   mechanotransduction, we applied OFF (1 Pa, 1 Hz) to osteocyte-like
   MLO-Y4 cells under conditions where the SIP signaling pathway was
   modulated. We found that decreased endogenous SIP levels significantly
   suppressed the OFF-induced intracellular calcium response. Addition of
   extracellular SIP to MLO-Y4 cells enhanced the synthesis and release of
   prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) under static cells and amplified OFF-induced
   PGE(2) release. The stimulatory effect of OFF on the gene expression
   levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator for nuclear
   factor KB ligand (RANKL) was SIP dependent. Furthermore, the S1P(2)
   receptor subtype was shown to be involved in OFF-induced PGE2 synthesis
   and release, as well as down-regulation of RANKL/OPG gene expression
   ratio. In summary, our data suggest that SIP cascade is involved in
   OFF-induced mechanotransduction in MLO-Y4 cells and that extracellular
   SIP exerts its effect partly through S1P(2) receptors. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},

Volume = {{89}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the use of unit-cells comprised of
   nano-scale spherical particles to model the microporous layer (MPL) of
   polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. We determined the
   effective thermal conductivity of various unit-cells based on
   body-centred cubic (BCC) and face-centred cubic (FCC) orientations,
   developed for commercially available MPL materials SGL-10BB and
   SGL-10BC. Informed by previous work done by the authors, unit-cells are
   constructed with constant particle size and filling radius, while
   varying the particle separation distance. Here it was found that the
   effective thermal conductivity of the MPL is heavily dependent on
   particle spacing due to the high thermal conductivity of the carbon
   particles. Also, it was found that SGL-10BB unit-cells are slightly more
   conductive than SGL-10BC. The results of this study can be used in the
   stochastic representation of the MPL, and can be extended to
   measurements of oxygen diffusion and electrical conductivity. (C) 2015

Title = {{2D Psychoacoustic modeling of equivalent masking for automatic speech
   recognition}},
Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{9-19}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Noise robustness has long been one of the most important goals in speech
   recognition. While the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR)
   deteriorates in noisy situations, the human auditory system is
   relatively adept at handling noise. To mimic this adeptness, we study
   and apply psychoacoustic models in speech recognition as a means to
   improve robustness of ASR systems. Psychoacoustic models are usually
   implemented in a subtractive manner with the intention to remove noise.
   However, this is not necessarily the only approach to this challenge.
   This paper presents a novel algorithm which implements psychoacoustic
   models additively. The algorithm is motivated by the fact that weak
   sound elements that are below the masking threshold are the same for the
   human auditory system, regardless of the actual sound pressure level.
   Another important contribution of our proposed algorithm is a superior
   implementation of masking effect Only those sounds that fall below the
   masking threshold are modified, which better reflects physical masking
   effects. We give detailed experimental results showing relationships
   between the subtractive and additive approaches. Since all the
   parameters of the proposed filters are positive or zero, they are named
   2D psychoacoustic P-filters. Detailed theoretical analysis is provided
   to show the noise removal ability of these filters. Experiments are
   carried out on the AURORA2 database. Experimental results show that the
   word recognition rate using our proposed feature extraction method has
   been effectively increased. Given models trained with clean speech, our
   proposed method achieves up to 84.23\% word recognition on noisy data.

Abstract = {{Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) provide individuals with a means of

   tasks to achieve binary control. The goals of this study were to
   evaluate the possibility of using a personalized approach to establish
   control of a two-, three-, four-, and five-class NIRS BCI, and to
   explore how various user characteristics correlate to accuracy. Ten
   able-bodied participants were recruited for five data collection
   sessions. Participants performed six mental tasks and a personalized
   approach was used to select each individual's best discriminating subset
   of tasks. The average offline cross-validation accuracies achieved were
   78, 61, 47, and 37\% for the two-, three-, four-, and five-class
   problems, respectively. Most notably, all participants exceeded an
   accuracy of 70\% for the two-class problem, and two participants
   exceeded an accuracy of 70\% for the three-class problem. Additionally,
   accuracy was found to be strongly positively correlated (Pearson's) with
   perceived ease of session (rho = 0.653), ease of concentration (rho -

Abstract = {{Aberrant white matter structures in fronto-temporal regions have
   previously been identified in patients with schizophrenia. However,
   scant research has focused on white matter integrity in patients
   presenting with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) with persistent
   negative symptoms (PNS). This study aimed to explore microstructure in
   the neurocircunry proposed to be involved in PNS, by using a
   region-of-interest. approach. Secondly, the relationship between
   individual negative symptoms and white matter were explored. Fractional
   anisotropy (FA) was measured in the fornix and three other tracts
   bilaterally including the uncinaLe fasciculus, superior longitudinal
   fasciculus and the cingulum bundle. Twelve patients with PNS were
   compared to a non-PNS group (52) and a healthy control group (51).
   Results showed that the PNS group had significantly lower FA values in
   the fornix when compared to healthy controls and that the non-PNS group
   had significantly lower FA values in the right uncinare fasciculus
   compared to healthy controls. Significant correlations were observed
   between SANS global score for anhedonia-asociality and lower FA values
   in the right cingulum bundle. Our results suggest that frontotemporal
   white matter might be more closely related to PNS and that this
   relationship may possibly be mediated by greater anhedonia in PNS
   patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier lreland Ltd. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{Zwitterionic (ZI) membranes are well-known for their high resistance to
   protein fouling during ultrafiltration (UF). In this work, zwitterionic
   chitosan (ZICS) was firstly obtained by a Schiff-base formation and a
   sulfonation reaction. Then a series of zwitterionic organic-inorganic
   hybrid ultrafiltration membranes were prepared through linking ZICS with
   poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) using tetraethyl orthosilicate as a bridge,
   where the density of zwitterionic groups in the membranes was adjusted
   by varying the dosage of zwitterionic chitosan. The prepared membranes
   were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis
   (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the measurements of water
   contact angle and zeta-potential of membrane surface. The
   ultrafiltration performance was examined using the separation of bovine
   serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme (LYZ) as a model system. The results
   show that, zwitterionic chitosan-silica-PVA hybrid membranes can possess
   desirable porosity, hydrophilicity, permeability, antifouling capacity

Abstract = {{Bulk metallic glasses are a relatively new class of amorphous metal
   alloy which possess unique mechanical and magnetic properties. The
   specific concentrations and combinations of alloy elements needed to
   prevent crystallization during melt quenching remains poorly understood.
   A correlation between atomic properties that can explain some of the
   previously identified glass forming ability (GFA) anomalies of the NiAl
   and CuZr systems has been identified, with these findings likely
   extensible to other transition metal-transition metal and transition
   metal-metalloid (TM-M) alloy classes as a whole. In this work, molecular
   dynamics simulation methods are utilized to study thermodynamic,
   kinetic, and structural properties of equiatomic CuZr and NiAl metallic
   glasses in an attempt to further understand the underlying connections
   between glass forming ability, nature of atomic level bonding, short and
   medium range ordering, and the evolution of structure and relaxation
   properties in the disordered phase. The anomalous breakdown of the
   fragility parameter as a useful GFA indicator in TM-Malloy systems is
   addressed through an in-depth investigation of bulk stiffness properties
   and the evolution of (pseudo) Gruneisen parameters over the quench
   domain, with the efficacy of other common glass forming ability
   indicators similarly being analyzed through direct computation in
   respective CuZr and NiAl systems. Comparison of fractional
   liquid-crystal density differences in the two systems revealed 2-3 times
   higher values for the NiAl system, providing further support for its
   efficacy as a general purpose GFA indicator. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) are emerging energy
   storage devices that provide high power density and rapid charging
   rates, with higher energy density than conventional capacitors.
   Extensive research efforts have been devoted to develop novel, high
   performing electrode materials to improve device performance,
   particularly to increase energy density. A number of methods have been
   used to characterize and report the performance of EDLCs in literature.
   The lack of a consistent and representative normalization parameter and
   the absence of consistent electrochemical testing procedures make the
   comparison of performance data challenging. In this work, key factors
   that affect EDLC performance data are discussed. Consideration is given
   to potential normalization parameters: mass, volume, and specific
   surface area (SSA). As well, an investigation into the effects of
   charging rate, maximum operating voltage window, and electrochemical
   analysis technique is performed. This work demonstrates the dependence
   of measured capacitance on maximum voltage window and the variation in
   performance between two different electrode materials. Moreover, an
   inherent discrepancy between cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic
   cycling (GC) capacitance values at fast charging rates has been
   observed. We hope this effort will assist in the development of a much
   needed international protocol for accurate measurement and
   characterization of EDLC performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A detailed understanding of the scaling behavior associated with the
   fluid flow and the transport of gas molecules from a train of elongated
   gas plugs into neighboring liquid segments is of great importance for a
   broad range of microscale applications. The indirect dependence of the
   parameters affecting the Capillary and Peclet numbers and thereby
   scaling behavior (i.e., the velocity and length of the gas plugs, and
   the length of the liquid segments) on the directly adjustable
   experimental inputs (i.e., flow rate or pressure of each phase) has
   hindered the systematic investigation of scaling behavior in microscale
   gas liquid flows. Here, we take advantage of an image-based feedback
   strategy that allows us to directly impose Capillary and Pedet numbers.
   We custom fabricated a long, straight microchannel (width 300 mu m,
   length-to-width ratio 700) in a gas impermeable silicon glass substrate.
   We automatically determined the length reduction of initially uniformly
   sized gas plugs at different positions along the microchannel and
   elucidated the gas concentration within adjacent liquid segments. In
   accordance with penetration theory, we analytically estimated the gas
   liquid mass transfer time to scale with the Pedet number, Pe, to the
   power of -0.5. The experimentally measured scaling exponent -0.55 +/-
   0.5 for carbon dioxide dissolution in methanol and ethanol at Pe =
   2060-16500 compared favorably with the analytical prediction and
   provides a guideline for predicting physical transport for a wide range
   microscale gas liquid flow processes.}},

Abstract = {{Monocyte interactions with implanted biomaterials can contribute
   significantly to the ability of a biomaterial to support tissue
   integration and wound healing, as opposed to a chronic pro-inflammatory
   foreign body reaction, provided the materials are designed to do so.
   However, there are few biomaterials available designed to regulate
   immune cell response with the intention of reducing the pro-inflammatory
   activation state. Material chemistry is a powerful tool for regulating
   protein and cell interactions that can be incorporated into surfaces
   while maintaining desired mechanical properties. The aspects of material
   chemistry that can support monocyte activation away from a
   pro-inflammatory state are still poorly understood. Protein adsorption
   is a key initial event that transforms the surface of a biomedical
   device into a biological substrate that will govern subsequent cellular
   interactions. In this study, the chemistry of degradable block
   polyurethanes, termed degradable polar hydrophobic ionic (D-PHI)
   polyurethanes, were studied for their unique interactions with bound
   immunoglobulin G (IgG), a pro-inflammatory protein that supports
   monocyte-biomaterial interactions. The specific immunological active
   sites of the polyurethane-adsorbed protein were compared with IgG's
   adsorbed state on a homopolymeric material with surface chemistry
   conducive to cell interactions, e.g. tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS).
   IgG-coated TCPS supported sustained monocyte adhesion and enhanced
   monocyte spreading, effects not observed with IgG-coated PU. The
   degradable PU was subsequently shown to reduce the number of exposed
   IgG-Fab sites following pre-adsorption vs. IgG adsorbed to TCPS, with
   antibody inhibition experiments demonstrating that Fab-site exposure
   appears to dominate monocyte-biomaterial interactions. Minor changes in
   chemical segments within the PU molecular chains were subsequently
   investigated for their influence on directing IgG interactions towards
   reducing pro-inflammatory activity. A reduction in chemical
   heterogeneity within the PU, without significant differences in other
   material properties known to regulate monocyte response, was shown to
   increase Fab exposure and subsequently led to monocyte interactions
   similar to those observed for IgG-coated TCPS. These results infer that
   reduced IgG-Fab site exposure can be directed by material chemistry to
   attenuate pro-inflammatory monocyte interactions with biomaterial
   surfaces, and identify the chemical features of polymeric biomaterial
   design responsible for this process.
   Statement of Significance
   There is currently limited understanding of material design features
   that can regulate protein-material interactions in order to prevent
   adverse inflammatory responses to implanted biomaterials. In this paper,
   monocyte interactions with biomaterials (specifically a block
   co-polymeric degradable polyurethane {[}D-PHI] and tissue culture
   polystyrene ITCPS]) were investigated as a function of their
   interactions with adsorbed immunoglobulin G (IgG). D-PHI was shown to
   attenuate IgG-induced monocyte retention and spreading by reducing
   IgG-Fab site exposure upon adsorption relative to TCPS. Aspects of D-PHI
   chemistry important in regulating Fab site exposure were determined.
   This study thus identifies features of biomaterials, using D-PHI as a
   case study, which can contribute to the development of new
   immunomodulatory biomaterial design. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc.

Title = {{Immunomodulatory polymeric scaffold enhances extracellular matrix
   production in cell co-cultures under dynamic mechanical stimulation}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{74-86}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Despite the importance of immune cells in regulating the wound healing
   process following injury, there are few examples of synthetic
   biomaterials that have the capacity to push the body's immune cells
   toward pro-regeneration phenotypes, and fewer still that are designed
   with the intention of achieving this immunomodulatory character. While
   monocytes and their derived macrophages have been recognized as
   important contributors to tissue remodeling in vivo, this is primarily
   believed to be due to their ability to regulate other cell types. The
   ability of monocytes and macrophages to generate tissue products
   themselves, however, is currently not well appreciated within the field
   of tissue regeneration. Furthermore, while monocytes/macrophages are
   found in remodeling tissue that is subjected to mechanical loading, the
   effect this biomechanical strain on monocytes/macrophages and their
   ability to regulate tissue-specific cellular activity has not been
   understood due to the complexity of the many factors involved in the in
   vivo setting, hence necessitating the use of controlled in vitro culture
   platforms to investigate this phenomenon. In this study, human monocytes
   were co-cultured with human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)
   on a tubular (3 mm ID) degradable polyurethane scaffold, with a unique
   combination of non-ionic polar, hydrophobic and ionic chemistry (D-PHI).
   The goal was to determine if such a synthetic matrix could be used in a
   co-culture system along with dynamic biomechanical stimulus (10\%
   circumferential strain, 1 Hz) conditions in order to direct monocytes to
   enhance tissue generation, and to better comprehend the different ways
   in which monocytes/macrophages may contribute to new tissue production.
   Mechanical strain and monocyte co-culture had a complementary and
   non-mitigating effect on VSMC growth. Co-culture samples demonstrated
   increased deposition of sulphated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and elastin,
   as well as increases in the release of FGF-2, a growth factor that can
   stimulate VSMC growth, while dynamic culture supported increases in
   collagen I and III as well as increased mechanical properties (elastic
   modulus, tensile strength) vs. static controls. Macrophage polarization
   toward an M1 state was not promoted by the biomaterial or culture
   conditions tested. Monocytes/macrophages cultured on D-PHI were also
   shown to produce vascular extracellular matrix components, including
   collagen I, collagen III, elastin, and GAGs. This study highlights the
   use of synthetic biomaterials having immunomodulatory character in order
   to promote cell and tissue growth when used in tissue engineering
   strategies, and identifies ECM deposition by monocytes/macrophages as an
   unexpected source of this new tissue.
   Statement of Significance
   The ability of biomaterials to regulate macrophage activation towards a
   wound healing phenotype has recently been shown to support positive
   tissue regeneration. However, the ability of immunomodulatory
   biomaterials to harness monocyte/macrophage activity to support tissue
   engineering strategies in vitro holds enormous potential that has yet to
   be investigated. This study used a monocyte co-culture on a degradable
   polyurethane (D-PHI) to regulate the response of VSMCs in combination
   with biomechanical strain in a vascular tissue engineering context.
   Results demonstrate that immunomodulatory biomaterials, such as D-PHI,
   that support a desirable macrophage activation state can be combined
   with biomechanical strain to augment vascular tissue production in
   vitro, in part due to the novel and unexpected contribution of
   monocytes/macrophages themselves producing vascular ECM proteins. (C)

Abstract = {{A mathematical model for the growth of thin Clostridium thermocellum
   biofilms on cellulose sheets with penetration from the surface into the
   interior fiber matrix is formulated, and used to assess the potential of
   CO2 on-line measurements for activity of cellulolytic biofilms. The
   biofilm growth model is linked to a product formation model. It includes
   the processes of carbon substrate consumption, biofilm growth, biofilm
   upkeep, and carbon dioxide production. The mathematical description
   leads to a system of ordinary differential equations that is simple
   enough to lend itself to qualitative analysis, yet complex enough to
   capture the essential features of the system. Numerical fitting of the
   model against experimental data showed excellent quantitative agreement.
   The model substantiates the utility of on-line CO2 measurements as
   indicator of cellulose substrate colonization and consumption, which may
   be useful for reporting bioreactor performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Disinfection by-products (DBPs) are formed when naturally occurring
   organic matter reacts with chlorine used in drinking water treatment,
   and DBPs formed in chlorinated drinking water samples have been shown to
   cause a genotoxic response. The objective of the current study was to
   further understand the principles of biofiltration and the resulting
   impacts on the formation of DBPs and genotoxicity. Pilot-scale systems
   were utilized to assess the performance of engineered biofilters
   enhanced with hydrogen peroxide, in-line coagulants, and nutrients when
   compared to passively operated biofilters and conventional treatment
   (coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, non-biological filtration).
   Organic fractionation was completed using liquid chromatography-organic
   carbon detection (LC-OCD). Water samples were chlorinated after
   collection and examined for the removal of trihalomethane (THM),
   haloacetic acid (HAA), and adsorbable organic halide (AOX) precursors.
   Additionally, the formation potential of two halogenated furanones,
   3-chloro-4(dichloromethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (MX) and mucochloric acid
   (MCA), and genotoxicity was determined. Biofiltration was shown to
   preferentially remove more DBP precursors than dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC). Formation potential of the unregulated DBPs, including MX and
   MCA, and genotoxic response was shown to be correlated to THM formation.
   These results infer that monitoring for THMs and HAAs provide insight to
   the formation of more mutagenic DBPs such as halogenated furanones, and
   that biofiltration may preferentially remove precursors to DBPs at a
   rate exceeding the removal of DOC. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   used to develop an activity-travel generation model and separate models
   are estimated for non-workers and workers. Models are developed for
   individual years and then for the pooled data set of three
   cross-sectional years to develop a Meta model of activity generation
   processes. Individual year-specific models are used to increase
   knowledge about the temporal stability of different parameters of the
   model so that the Meta model could capture the non-linear evolution of
   some key parameters of the model. Different transferability indices are
   used to test temporal transferability of cross-sectional year-specific
   modes and the Meta model. The results show that, in general, the
   activity-travel generation process model shows good temporal

Abstract = {{Massive reinforced concrete (RC) structure is widely used in long-term
   damp environments. To improve the concrete durability and reduce the
   reinforcing steel corrosion, crack width control is more rigorous in
   massive RC structure. In this paper, the short-term (30days)
   temperatures of concrete are measured by the distributed temperature
   system (DTS) to inverse the thermal parameters using the genetic
   algorithm (GA), and the long-term (300days) temperature is predicted by
   using the calculated thermal parameters. Moreover, thermal stress field
   considering the creep is calculated based on the
   eight-parameters-equation, and the parameters were modified by the
   results of temperature stress test machine (TSTM). Furthermore, a
   quantitative reinforcement configuration method is proposed on the basis
   of the predicted thermal stress field, and its feasibility and
   effectiveness are verified by a sluice pier structure. Finally, the
   optimal reinforcement scheme obtained was selected by the comparisons of
   the crack width, reinforcement stress and the total cross-sectional area

Title = {{Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Control of Secreted Factors for
   Blood Stem Cell Culture}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Clinical use of umbilical cord blood has typically been limited by the
   need to expand hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) ex vivo.
   This expansion is challenging due to the accumulation of secreted
   signaling factors in the culture that have a negative regulatory effect
   on HSPC output. Strategies for global regulation of these factors
   through dilution have been developed, but do not accommodate the dynamic
   nature or inherent variability of hematopoietic cell culture. We have
   developed a mathematical model to simulate the impact of feedback
   control on in vitro hematopoiesis, and used it to design a
   proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm. This algorithm
   was implemented with a fed-batch bioreactor to regulate the
   concentrations of secreted factors. Controlling the concentration of a
   key target factor, TGF-beta 1, through dilution limited the negative
   effect it had on HSPCs, and allowed global control of other
   similarly-produced inhibitory endogenous factors. The PID control
   algorithm effectively maintained the target soluble factor at the target
   concentration. We show that feedback controlled dilution is predicted to
   be a more cost effective dilution strategy compared to other open-loop
   strategies, and can enhance HSPC expansion in short term culture. This
   study demonstrates the utility of secreted factor process control
   strategies to optimize stem cell culture systems, and motivates the
   development of multi-analyte protein sensors to automate the
   manufacturing of cell therapies.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, glutaraldehyde-chitosan complexes (GA-chitosan) were
   prepared and were used as functional additives to enhance the strength

   scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and
   time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. The effects of
   glutaraldehyde dosage and GA-chitosan to fiber ratio on the strength
   properties, including wet-strength, wet-web strength, and dry strength,
   were investigated. GA-chitosan did not require high temperature curing
   and had good cross-linking rates at room temperature. Samples treated
   with GA-chitosan exhibited significant improvements in their mechanical
   properties. Wet tensile index and wet-web tensile index (both at 50\%
   solids), and dry tensile index, were increased by about 1300, 190, and
   115\%, respectively. The GA-chitosan additive developed in this study

Title = {{Design of power systems for reverse osmosis desalination in remote

Abstract = {{Many remote communities lack access to a reliable water supply. They
   often have access to brackish groundwater or seawater, making reverse
   osmosis desalination a possible solution. However, reverse osmosis
   desalination is an energy-intensive process and many remote communities
   are off the electrical grid. Determining the most economic reverse
   osmosis system configuration and electrical power source for a given
   remote community is a challenge due to their unique resource
   availabilities. This paper presents an optimization-based approach to
   compare the economics of different small-scale reverse osmosis systems
   and power sources for remote communities. In this approach, physical
   models describe the performance of electrical power systems composed of
   photovoltaics, wind turbines, diesel generators, batteries, and hybrid
   systems. These power system models are coupled to a reverse osmosis
   system model to determine the water production. An optimization is
   performed to determine the most economic power system configuration,
   reverse osmosis system size, and water storage size that meets the
   desired water production reliability. The reliability is expressed as
   loss of water probability, which is computed using hourly environmental
   data. Here, this method is used to configure a reverse osmosis system
   for small communities. Results are presented for locations in Honduras,
   Eritrea, and Australia. Results show that the local climatic conditions
   greatly influence the economic attractiveness of different technologies.
   The variety of solutions found using this approach demonstrate the
   ability of the method to aid in the design of a power system and reverse
   osmosis system configuration for any location.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{Decoy-state quantum key distribution (QKD) is a standard technique in
   current quantum cryptographic implementations. Unfortunately, existing
   experiments have two important drawbacks: the state preparation is
   assumed to be perfect without errors and the employed security proofs do
   not fully consider the finite-key effects for general attacks. These two
   drawbacks mean that existing experiments are not guaranteed to be proven
   to be secure in practice. Here, we perform an experiment that shows
   secure QKD with imperfect state preparations over long distances and
   achieves rigorous finite-key security bounds for decoy-state QKD against
   coherent attacks in the universally composable framework. We quantify
   the source flaws experimentally and demonstrate a QKD implementation
   that is tolerant to channel loss despite the source flaws. Our
   implementation considers more real-world problems than most previous
   experiments, and our theory can be applied to general discrete-variable
   QKD systems. These features constitute a step towards secure QKD with
   imperfect devices.}},

   Protocol (MSTP), a multi-sensory hybrid treatment approach on five
   children (mean: 3;3 years; S.D. 0;1) with severe to profound speech

   design, replicated over five participants, was used to evaluate the
   effects of treatment on improving listeners' auditory and visual
   judgements of speech accuracy.Results: All participants demonstrated
   significant change between baseline and maintenance conditions, with the
   exception of KM, who may have had underlying psychosocial, regulation
   and/or attention difficulties. The training- (practiced in treatment)
   and test-words (not practiced in treatment) both demonstrated positive
   change in all participants, indicating generalization of target features

   production by improving speech motor control in this population.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer-grafted surfaces and channels are increasingly used for the
   design of responsive materials and sensors due to robust performance and
   ease of use. Various strategies for the control of the nanoscale
   morphologies of such materials and devices are being tested. Entropic
   repulsion between the polymer chains in a grafted brush of sufficient
   density causes the chains to extend in the direction perpendicular to
   the grafting surface in comparison to the position of unattached
   polymers. When nanoparticles having attractive interactions with the
   polymers are introduced into the solvent, these nanoparticles tend to
   infiltrate into the brush and reduce its extension. Under certain
   conditions, a sharp reduction in brush height extension can occur over a
   narrow range of nanoparticle concentrations in solution. We describe a
   way of controlling transport through polymer-functionalized nanochannels
   with nanoparticle additives, relying on the physics of nanoparticles and
   polymer brushes under confinement, and we suggest a blueprint for the
   creation of a tunable nanovalve. The nanovalve is modeled as a cylinder
   with a polymer brush grafted on its inside surface. Brush properties
   such as the chain length and the grafting density are chosen so that the
   brush chains extend into the center of the cylinder in the absence of
   nanoparticles, occluding the flux of analyte molecules through the pore.
   When nanoparticles that are attracted to the polymers are introduced
   into solution, they infiltrate into the brush and partially collapse it
   against the cylindrical grafting surface, opening space in the center of
   the cylinder through which analyte molecules can flow. The operation of
   such a nanovalve is analyzed via self-consistent field theory
   calculations in the strong-stretching approximation. Self-consistent
   field analysis is supported by Langevin dynamics simulations of the
   underlying coarse-grained model of the polymer nanoparticle system.}},

Abstract = {{A series of linear controlled rheology polypropylenes were produced
   through reaction with dicumyl peroxide in the melt state, to investigate
   the effect of molecular weight and viscosity on foaming. Foaming
   experiments by compression molding, using a chemical blowing agent
   (azodicarbonamide), and by batch foaming using nitrogen-blowing agent,
   revealed that lower viscosity promoted higher expansion ratios and
   larger cells, due to reduced resistance to cell growth. Linear
   polypropylene was further modified using trimethylolpropane
   trimethacrylate and triallyl trimesate coagents. Coagent modification
   resulted in pronounced changes in the shear thinning and elasticity of
   the modified polypropylenes. However, evidence of long-chain branching
   was only present in polypropylene modified by triallyl trimesate. Foams
   based on coagent-modified polypropylenes had higher expansion ratios
   than their degraded counterparts. This was ascribed in part to the lower
   viscosities, and to a nucleating effect, arising from the presence of a
   finely dispersed phase of coagent-rich nanoparticles. Strain hardening
   in polypropylenes modified by triallyl trimesate further resulted in a
   finer cell structure, due to suppressed coalescence.}},

Abstract = {{Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) produced following the administration of
   exogenous 5d-aminolevulinic acid is clinically approved for photodynamic
   therapy and fluorescence-guided resection in various jurisdictions
   around the world. For both applications, quantification of PPIX forms
   the basis for accurate therapeutic dose calculation and identification
   of malignant tissues for resection. While it is well established that
   the PPIX synthesis and accumulation rates are subject to the cell's
   biochemical microenvironment, the effect of the physical
   microenvironment, such as matrix stiffness, has received little
   attention to date. Here we studied the proliferation rate and PPIX
   synthesis and accumulation in two glioma cell lines U373 and U118
   cultured under five different substrate conditions, including the
   conventional tissue culture plastic and polyacrylamide gels that
   simulated tissue stiffness of normal brain (1 kPa) and glioblastoma
   tumors (12 kPa). We found that the proliferation rate increased with
   substrate stiffness for both cell lines, but not in a linear fashion.
   PPIX concentration was significantly higher in cells cultured on
   tissue-simulating gels than on the much stiffer tissue culture plastic
   for both cell lines. These findings, albeit preliminary, suggest that
   the physical microenvironment might be an important determinant of tumor
   aggressiveness and PPIX synthesis in glioma cells. (C) 2015 Society of

Abstract = {{Despite intense research, few treatments are available for most
   neurological disorders. Demyelinating diseases are no exception. This is
   perhaps not surprising considering the multifactorial nature of these
   diseases, which involve complex interactions between immune system
   cells, glia and neurons. In the case of multiple sclerosis, for example,
   there is no unanimity among researchers about the cause or even which
   system or cell type could be ground zero. This situation precludes the
   development and strategic application of mechanism-based therapies. We
   will discuss how computational modeling applied to questions at
   different biological levels can help link together disparate
   observations and decipher complex mechanisms whose solutions are not
   amenable to simple reductionism. By making testable predictions and
   revealing critical gaps in existing knowledge, such models can help
   direct research and will provide a rigorous framework in which to
   integrate new data as they are collected. Nowadays, there is no shortage
   of data; the challenge is to make sense of it all. In that respect,
   computational modeling is an invaluable tool that could, ultimately,
   transform how we understand, diagnose, and treat demyelinating diseases.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel low-voltage CMOS smart temperature sensor
   targeted for VLSI thermal management. A polyresistor is used as the

   circuits that operate at low supply voltages, which are compatible with
   the digital circuits in VLSI systems. Fabricated in 90-nm CMOS, the
   sensor can operate with a supply voltage as low as 0.8 V and features a
   supply sensitivity of 4 degrees C/V. After 50-sample moving-average and
   a two-point calibration at 25 degrees C and 45 degrees C, the design
   achieves an inaccuracy of -0.6 degrees C/0.8 degrees C over -40 degrees
   C-125 degrees C. It dissipates only 11.8 mu W at a sampling rate of 5

Abstract = {{This paper presents a low power self-calibrated delay-line based
   temperature sensor intended for Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI)
   thermal management applications. It proposes a fully digital automatic
   self-calibration method that removes the sensitivity to process
   variations in delay-line based temperature sensors. This method requires
   only one calibration block to calibrate multiple delay-line based
   temperature sensors sequentially. Both the proposed temperature sensors
   and the self-calibration method were verified experimentally on field
   programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and on 65 nm and 0.13 mu m custom ICs.
   The measurement results on three 65 nm custom ICs show a resolution of
   0.4 degrees C with 3 sigma errors of +/- 3.0 degrees C, from 20 to 80
   degrees C. The proposed temperature sensors were implemented on a FPGA
   based VLSI thermal management system. Four microprocessor cores were
   mapped onto the corners of a Cyclone IV FPGA chip to emulate the VLSI
   load. Each core has a proposed temperature sensor close by. The runtime
   thermal profiles were obtained for four microprocessor cores, with eight
   different Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) methods. Experimental results
   from different DTM techniques were studied. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Membrane proteins are crucial to heart function and development. Here we
   combine cationic silica-bead coating with shotgun proteomics to enrich
   for and identify plasma membrane-associated proteins from primary mouse
   neonatal and human fetal ventricular cardiomyocytes. We identify Tmem65
   as a cardiac-enriched, intercalated disc protein that increases during
   development in both mouse and human hearts. Functional analysis of
   Tmem65 both in vitro using lentiviral shRNA-mediated knockdown in mouse
   cardiomyocytes and in vivo using morpholino-based knockdown in zebrafish
   show marked alterations in gap junction function and cardiac morphology.
   Molecular analyses suggest that Tmem65 interaction with connexin 43
   (Cx43) is required for correct localization of Cx43 to the intercalated
   disc, since Tmem65 deletion results in marked internalization of Cx43, a
   shorter half-life through increased degradation, and loss of Cx43
   function. Our data demonstrate that the membrane protein Tmem65 is an
   intercalated disc protein that interacts with and functionally regulates
   ventricular Cx43.}},

Abstract = {{Constraint-based modeling of biological networks (metabolism,
   transcription and signal transduction), although used successfully in
   many applications, suffer from specific limitations such as the lack of
   representation of metabolite concentrations and enzymatic regulation,
   which are necessary for a complete physiologically relevant model.
   Kinetic models conversely overcome these shortcomings and enable dynamic
   analysis of biological systems for enhanced in silico hypothesis
   generation. Nonetheless, kinetic models also have limitations for
   modeling at genome-scales chiefly due to: (i) model non-linearity; (ii)
   computational tractability; (iii) parameter identifiability; (iv)
   estimability; and (v) uncertainty. In order to support further
   development of kinetic models as viable alternatives to constraint-based
   models, this review presents a brief description of the existing
   obstacles towards building genome-scale kinetic models. Specific kinetic
   modeling frameworks capable of overcoming these obstacles are covered in
   this review. The tractability and physiological feasibility of these
   models are discussed with the objective of using available in vivo
   experimental observations to define the model parameter space. Among the
   different methods discussed, Monte Carlo kinetic models of metabolism
   stand out as potentially tractable methods to model genome scale
   networks while also addressing in vivo parameter uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{We advocate to create a spot Internet transit market, where transit is
   sold using the under-utilized backbone capacity at a lower price. The
   providers can improve profit by capitalizing the perishable capacity,
   and customers can buy transit on demand without a minimum commitment
   level for elastic traffic, and as a result improve their surplus (i.e.,
   utility gains). We conduct a systematic study of the economical benefits
   of spot transit both theoretically and empirically. We propose a simple
   analytical framework with a general demand function, and solve the
   pricing problem to maximize the expected profit, taking into account the
   potential revenue loss of regular transit when spot transit traffic
   hikes. We prove the price advantage of spot transit, as well as the
   profit and surplus improvements for tier-1 ISPs and customers,
   respectively. Using real-world price data and traffic statistics of six
   IXPs with more than 1,000 ISPs, we evaluate spot transit and show that
   significant financial benefits can be achieved in both absolute and
   relative terms, robust to parameter values.}},

Abstract = {{Materials optimized for single-junction solar spectral harvesting, such
   as silicon, perovskites, and large-band-gap colloidal quantum dot
   solids, fail to absorb the considerable infrared spectral energy that
   lies below their respective band gap. Here we explore through modeling
   and experiment the potential for colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) to
   augment the performance of solar cells by harnessing transmitted light
   in the infrared. Through detailed balance modeling, we identify the CQD
   band gap that is best able to augment wafer-based, thin-film, and also
   solution-processed photovoltaic (PV) materials. The required quantum
   dots, with an excitonic peak at 1.3 mu m, have not previously been
   studied in depth for solar performance. Using computational studies we
   find that a new ligand scheme distinct from that employed in
   better-explored 0.95 mu m band gap Pb5 CQDs is necessary; only via the
   solution-phase application of a short bromothiol can we prevent dot
   fusion during ensuing solid-state film treatments and simultaneously
   offer a high valence band-edge density of states to enhance hole
   transport. Photoluminescence spectra and transient studies confirm the
   desired narrowed emission peaks and reduced surface-trap-associated
   decay. Electronic characterization reveals that only through the use of
   the bromothiol ligands is strong hole transport retained. The films,
   when used to make PV devices, achieve the highest AM1.5 power conversion
   efficiency yet reported in a solution-processed material having a sub-1
   eV band gap.}},

Abstract = {{Organometallic trihalide perovskites are solution-processed
   semiconductors that have made great strides in third-generation thin
   film light-harvesting and light-emitting optoelectronic devices.
   Recently, it has been demonstrated that large, high-purity single
   crystals of these perovskites can be synthesized from the solution
   phase. These crystals' large dimensions, clean bandgap, and solid-state
   order have provided us with a suitable medium to observe and quantify
   two-photon absorption in perovskites. When CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystals
   are pumped with intense 800 nm light, we observe band-to-band
   photoluminescence at 572 nm, indicative of two-photon absorption. We
   report the nonlinear absorption coefficient of CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskites
   to be 8.6 cm GW(-1) at 800 nm, comparable to epitaxial single-crystal
   semiconductors of similar bandgap. We have leveraged this nonlinear
   process to electrically autocorrelate a 100 fs pulsed laser using a
   two-photon perovskite photodetector. This work demonstrates the
   viability of organometallic trihalide perovskites as a convenient and
   low-cost nonlinear absorber for applications in ultrafast photonics.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel method for in-plane digital microfluidic
   spectroscopy. In this technique, a custom manifold (.stl file available
   online as ESM) aligns optical fibres with a digital microfluidic device,
   allowing optical measurements to be made in the plane of the device.
   Because of the greater width vs thickness of a droplet on-device, the
   in-plane alignment of this technique allows it to outperform the
   sensitivity of vertical absorbance measurements on digital microfluidic
   (DMF) devices by similar to 14x. The new system also has greater
   calibration sensitivity for thymol blue measurements than the popular
   NanoDrop system by similar to 2.5x. The improvements in absorbance
   sensitivity result from increased path length, as well as from
   additional effects likely caused by liquid lensing, in which the
   presence of a water droplet between optical fibres increases
   fibre-to-fibre transmission of light by similar to 2x through refraction
   and internal reflection. For interrogation of dilute samples, stretching
   of droplets using digital microfluidic electrodes and adjustment of
   fibre-to-fibre gap width allows absorbance path length to be changed
   on-demand. We anticipate this new digital microfluidic optical fibre
   absorbance and fluorescence measurement system will be useful for a wide
   variety of analytical applications involving microvolume samples with
   digital microfluidics.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Stoichiometric and constraint-based methods of computational
   strain design have become an important tool for rational metabolic
   engineering. One of those relies on the concept of constrained minimal
   cut sets (cMCSs). However, as most other techniques, cMCSs may consider
   only reaction (or gene) knockouts to achieve a desired phenotype.
   Results: We generalize the cMCSs approach to constrained regulatory MCSs
   (cRegMCSs), where up/downregulation of reaction rates can be combined
   along with reaction deletions. We show that flux up/downregulations can
   virtually be treated as cuts allowing their direct integration into the
   algorithmic framework of cMCSs. Because of vastly enlarged search spaces
   in genome-scale networks, we developed strategies to (optionally)
   preselect suitable candidates for flux regulation and novel algorithmic
   techniques to further enhance efficiency and speed of cMCSs calculation.
   We illustrate the cRegMCSs approach by a simple example network and
   apply it then by identifying strain designs for ethanol production in a
   genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli. The results clearly
   show that cRegMCSs combining reaction deletions and flux regulations
   provide a much larger number of suitable strain designs, many of which
   are significantly smaller relative to cMCSs involving only knockouts.
   Furthermore, with cRegMCSs, one may also enable the fine tuning of
   desired behaviours in a narrower range. The new cRegMCSs approach may
   thus accelerate the implementation of model-based strain designs for the
   bio-based production of fuels and chemicals.}},

   three phases of the data, and feeds into the phase detector the data
   phase that minimizes the CDR phase error. This frequency detector,
   implemented within a 10 Gb/s CDR in Fujitsu's 65 nm CMOS, consumes 11 mW

Abstract = {{Ubiquitination is a key protein post-translational modification that
   regulates many important cellular pathways and whose levels are
   regulated by equilibrium between the activities of ubiquitin ligases and
   deubiquitinases. Here, we present a method to identify specific
   deubiquitinase substrates based on treatment of cell lysates with
   recombinant enzymes, immunoaffinity purification, and global
   quantitative proteomic analysis. As a model system to identify
   substrates, we used a virulence-related deubiquitinase, SseL, secreted
   by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium into host cells. Using this
   approach, two SseL substrates were identified in the RAW 264.7 murine
   macrophage-like cell line, S100A6 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear
   protein K, in addition to the previously reported K63-linked ubiquitin
   chains. These substrates were further validated by a combination of
   enzymatic and binding assays. This method can be used for the systematic
   identification of substrates of deubiquitinases from other organisms and
   applied to study their functions in physiology and disease.}},

Abstract = {{Naturally-occurring porous media, such as sedimentary rock, rarely
   consist of mono sized particles, but rather tend to consist of
   distributions of particle sizes (poorly-sorted porous media). In this
   study, deterministic fractal geometries including a Sierpinski carpet
   and a slightly altered version of the Sierpinski carpet with a generator
   that has a circular inclusion were used to provide insight into the
   poorly-sorted porous media found in sedimentary rock. The relationships
   between tortuosity and porosity within these fractal geometries were
   investigated by presenting and applying a novel mathematical approach.
   We found a new correlation between the tortuosity, tau, and porosity,
   phi, within the Sierpinski carpet (tau = 3/2 - phi/2), which agrees well
   with previous empirical observations reported in the literature. We also
   found an analytical tortuosity-porosity correlation within the
   circular-based Sierpinski carpet (tau = (1 - 4/pi)phi + 4/pi), which is
   to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first tortuosity-porosity
   relationship proposed for such fractal geometry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{The effects of mutual coupling impact the performance of phased arrays
   as the beam is scanned off broadside. Wide-angle impedance matching
   (WAIM) alleviates this problem from a transmission-line impedance
   matching viewpoint, increasing the useable scan range of the array.
   Traditionally, a dielectric slab is placed at some distance above the
   array, resulting in a match at some given angle off broadside. We
   propose a simpler and more effective solution, replacing the dielectric
   slab with an ultra-thin metasurface composed of a sheet of split-ring
   resonators (SRRs) to improve the scanning characteristics of a dipole
   phased array. It is shown that the presence of the metasurface results
   in significant improvements in multiple scan planes. A generalized
   equivalent transmission-line model is introduced for the classical WAIM
   configuration and adapted for the metasurface. A quasi-analytical model
   based on the equivalent transmission-line model and the extracted
   scattering parameters of the metasurface properly predicts the scan
   range of the full structure, and allows for an accelerated design
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed generators (DGs) are being widely deployed in today's power
   grid. These energy sources are highly variable posing practical
   challenges for deployment and grid management. In this paper, a novel
   scalable distributed power dispatch strategy is proposed to effectively
   manage DGs at the distribution substation level, capitalizing on the
   recent push to cyber-enable power grid operations. We demonstrate how
   the inherent separability of the power dispatch problem allows the use
   of dual decomposition that enables every participating DG to locally
   compute its dispatch strategy based on simple broadcast data by the
   utility. Results and comparisons indicate that the DGs are able to
   rapidly converge to an optimal economical dispatch vector with
   significantly less concentrated computational effort and communication
   overhead, promoting security and privacy.}},

   propose a code-aided expectation-maximization algorithm to mitigate such
   nonlinear phase noise, iteratively utilizing both the time correlation
   of the nonlinearity-induced impairments and a soft-decision
   error-control code. Simulation and experimental results show that on a
   dual-polarization wavelength-division-multiplexed 16 QAM system,
   launch-power tolerance can be increased by 1.5 dB, and the optical
   signal-to-noise ratio requirement can be relaxed by 0.3 dB to achieve
   the same Q(2)-factor.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we report the apoptosis induction in HER2 overexpressed
   breast cancer cells using pulsed, continuous wave lasers and
   polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-stabilized magneto-plasmonic nanoshells
   (PVP-MPNS) delivered by immunoliposomes. The immunoliposomes containing
   PVP-MPNS were fabricated and characterized. Heating efficiency of the
   synthesized nanostructures was calculated. The effect of
   functionalization on cellular uptake of nanoparticles was assessed using
   two cell lines of BT-474 and Calu-6. The best uptake result was achieved
   by functionalized liposome (MPNS-LAb) and BT-474. Also, the interaction
   of 514 nm argon (Ar) and Nd/YAG second harmonic 532-nm lasers with
   nanoparticles was investigated based on the temperature rise of the
   nanoshell suspension and the release value of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein
   (CF) from CF/MPNS-loaded liposomes. The temperature increase of the
   suspensions after ten consecutive pulses of 532 nm and 5 min of
   irradiation by Ar laser were measured approximately 2 and 12 A degrees
   C, respectively. The irradiation of CF/MPNS-loaded liposomes by Ar laser
   for 3 min resulted in 24.3 \% release of CF, and in the case of 532 nm
   laser, the release was laser energy dependent. Furthermore, the
   comparison of CF release showed a higher efficiency for the Ar laser
   than by direct heating of nanoshell suspension using circulating water.
   The percentage of cell apoptosis after irradiation by Ar and 532 nm
   lasers were 44.6 and 42.6 \%, respectively. The obtained results suggest
   that controlling the NP-laser interaction using optical properties of
   nanoshells and the laser parameters can be used to develop a new cancer
   therapy modality via targeted nanoshell and drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive control may involve adjusting behaviour by inhibiting or
   altering habitual actions, requiring rapid communication between
   sensory, cognitive, and motor systems of the brain. Cognitive control
   may be achieved using top-down processing from frontal areas to inhibit
   prepared responses, likely mediated through frontal theta (4-8 Hz)
   oscillations. However there is conflicting evidence for mechanisms of
   response inhibition, where global and selective inhibition are either
   considered separate processes, or frontal areas maintain and execute
   goal-directed actions, including inhibition. In the current study we
   measured neuromagnetic oscillatory brain activity in twelve adults
   responding to rapidly presented visual cues. We used two tasks in the
   same subjects that required inhibition of a habitual ``go{''} response.
   Presentation of infrequent ``target{''} cues required subjects to
   completely inhibit responding (go/no-go task) or to perform an alternate
   response (go/switch task). Source analysis of oscillatory brain activity
   was compared for correct no-go and switch trials as well as error trials
   ({''}go{''} responses to targets). Frontal theta activity was similar in
   cortical location, amplitude and time course for correct no-go and
   switch responses reflecting an equivalent role in both global and
   selective response inhibition. Error-related frontal theta activity was
   also observed but was different in source location (errors vs correct,
   both tasks: p < 0.005) and power (go/switch N go/no-go error, correct
   switch power, p = 0.01). We additionally observed sensorimotor high
   gamma (60-90 Hz) activity accompanying motor responses, which was
   markedly stronger for correct switch and error responses compared with
   go responses, and was delayed for errors (p < 0.01). These results
   suggest that gamma signals in the motor cortex may function to integrate
   inhibitory signals with sensorimotor processing, and may represent a
   mechanism for the overriding of habitual behaviours, as errors were
   predicted by a delay in gamma onset. This study supports a role for
   frontal areas in maintaining and executing goal-directed actions, and
   demonstrates that frontal theta activity and sensorimotor gamma
   oscillations have distinct yet complementary functional roles in
   monitoring and modifying habitual motor plans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Electromigration (EM) in on-die metal lines is becoming a significant
   problem in modern integrated circuits technology. Due to the high levels
   of current density on the die, the large number of metal lines, and the
   inherent conservatism in classical full-chip EM models, designers are
   finding it very hard to meet the area and design specs while
   guaranteeing EM reliability. The EM problem is most significant in power
   grid lines, because unlike signal and clock lines, they do not benefit
   from healing due to their mostly unidirectional currents. In this paper,
   we develop a new model, referred to as the mesh model, for power grid EM
   checking which takes into account the inherent redundancy of its mesh
   structure while determining the reliability. To implement the mesh
   model, we also develop a framework to estimate the change in statistics
   of an interconnect as its effective-EM current varies. In order to
   overcome the conservative assumptions that designers usually make about
   chip workloads, we also propose a novel vectorless mesh model technique
   to estimate the average minimum time-to-failure of a power grid under
   workload uncertainties. The results indicate that the series model,
   which is currently used in the industry, gives a pessimistic estimate of
   power grid MTF and reliability by a factor of 3-4. Finally, we exploit
   multithreading and grid locality to speedup our implementation by almost
   6x.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The aim of this study was to determine the biomechanical
   properties of four fixation options for periprosthetic supracondylar
   femoral fractures.
   Methods Fourth-generation composite femurs were implanted with a
   posterior-stabilizing femoral component of total knee arthroplasty. All
   femurs were osteotomized to produce a AO/OTA 33-A3 fracture pattern and
   four different constructs were tested: (1) non-locking plate; (2)
   polyaxial locking plate; (3) intramedullary fibular strut allograft with
   polyaxial locking plate; (4) retrograde intramedullary nail. The
   composite femurs underwent non-destructive tests to determine construct
   stiffness in axial and torsional cyclic loading. The final testing
   consisted of quasi-static axial loading until failure.
   Results Under cyclic torsional loading, the retrograde intramedullary
   nail was less stiff than non-locking plate, polyaxial locking plate and
   intramedullary fibular strut allograft with polyaxial locking plate (p =
   0.046). No differences were detected in cyclic axial loading between the
   different constructs. During quasi-static axial loading to failure, the
   intramedullary nail achieved the highest axial stiffness while the
   non-locking plate showed the lowest (p = 0.036).
   Conclusions The intramedullary fibular strut allograft with polyaxial
   locking plate did not prove to be significantly better to the polyaxial
   locking plate only in a periprosthetic distal femur fracture model.}},

Abstract = {{Controlled rocking steel braced frames (CRSBFs) are being developed as a
   seismic force resisting system that can be constructed economically to
   avoid structural damage and residual deformations following an
   earthquake. In a CRSBF, selected columns are permitted to uplift from
   the foundation in response to severe seismic loading, and posttensioning
   and energy dissipation are selected to control the magnitude of the
   rocking response. Despite extensive experimental testing to demonstrate
   that this behavior is stable and repeatable, there has been a lack of
   comprehensive guidance for potential designers of CRSBFs. This paper
   proposes a performance-based design methodology for CRSBFs, which
   consists of defining the performance objectives, designing the base
   rocking joint based on a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model, and
   capacity protecting the rest of the structure for the maximum forces
   expected during the rocking response. This paper focuses on the design
   of the base rocking joint, while Part II proposes a method for capacity
   designing the rest of the structure with due consideration of
   higher-mode effects. This paper shows how to design the base rocking
   joint to achieve a targeted response based on the results of 30,492
   analyses of SDOF systems with flag-shaped hystereses. The SDOF results
   suggest that the rotation demands on the rocking joint depend on the
   initial stiffness of the system. For structures with initial periods
   less than about 0.4 s, the base rocking joint requires smaller force
   reduction factors than are codified for ductile seismic force-resisting
   systems, but much larger force reduction factors could be used for
   structures with longer initial periods, provided that the frame members
   are capacity designed and that there is sufficient deformation capacity
   in the posttensioning and energy dissipation elements. These conclusions
   are validated by considering the peak and residual displacement response
   of three example structures at two seismic hazard levels. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Controlled rocking steel braced frames (CRSBFs) are intended to have a
   self-centering response that avoids damage to main structural elements.
   To ensure that all nonlinearity is confined to the intended elements at
   the rocking joint, the frame must be adequately capacity designed. This
   requires accurate predictions of the peak forces that are likely to
   develop in all members of the frame while the rocking mechanism reaches
   its peak rotation. Previous studies have shown that the peak forces in
   CRSBF members are likely to be strongly influenced by higher mode
   effects, but these effects can be mitigated by designing multiple
   nonlinear mechanisms. This paper proposes methods for estimating the
   peak forces in frame elements, designing an additional mechanism if it
   is desired to mitigate higher mode effects, and predicting the reduction
   in response that will be achieved by adding this mechanism. The methods
   are validated by designing buildings with two, six, and 12 stories,
   including three alternative designs that use multiple mechanisms to
   mitigate the higher mode effects. The six frames are modeled using
   OpenSees and are subjected to 44 ground motions at the maximum
   considered earthquake level. The peak forces in the taller frames
   without additional mechanisms are dominated by higher mode effects, but
   these effects can be estimated using the proposed method. These forces
   can also be reduced by designing multiple mechanisms, and the proposed
   method provides a reasonable design-level prediction of this force
   reduction. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{A solution to the imbalance of vehicles in one-way carsharing systems is
   vehicle relocation which involves staff members to redistribute the
   vehicles between stations. Vehicle relocation, however, can lead to an
   imbalance of staff members between stations. Thus, staff members,
   themselves, need to be relocated between stations to perform the vehicle
   relocations. This study addresses the joint optimization of vehicle
   relocation and staff rebalancing using two integrated multi-traveling
   salesman formulations. Results show that fleet size is more sensitive to
   demand than staff size, staff size is inversely related to vehicle cost,
   and that vehicle relocation time increases with vehicle cost. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider two hospitals with different perceived
   quality of care competing to capture a fraction of the total market

   of patients and show that depending on the market demand and perceived
   quality of care of the hospitals, patients may enjoy a positive utility.
   Moreover, hospitals share the market demand based on their perceived
   quality of care and capacity. We also show that in a monopoly market (a
   market with a single hospital) the optimal demand captured by the
   hospital is independent of the perceived quality of care. We investigate
   the effects of different parameters including the market demand,
   hospitals' capacities, and perceived quality of care on the fraction of
   the demand that each hospital captures using some numerical examples.}},

   the dynamic nature of WiSAR by: 1) planning initial, time-optimal, and
   piecewise polynomial paths for all robots; 2) implementing and regularly
   evaluating the optimality of the paths through a set of checks that
   gauge feasibility of path-completion within the available time; and 3)
   replanning paths, on-line, whenever deemed necessary. The fundamental
   principle of maintaining the optimal deployment of the robots throughout
   the search guides the MRC methodology. The proposed path-planning
   strategy is illustrated through a simulated realistic WiSAR example, and

Title = {{Synthesis of Decision-Making Research in Construction}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Decision making has always been a major topic of research in the field
   of construction engineering and management. Recent trends (such as the
   push for sustainability, the increased desire for public engagement, and
   the globalization in construction) have influenced the environment under
   which decision makers work. Consequently, the models of how decisions
   are formed and made should adapt to that change. This paper reviews the
   research literature in this regard to provide a perspective on the
   evolution of decision models and tools in the filed through analyzing a
   representative set of papers published in the Journal of Construction
   Engineering and Management (J. Constr. Eng. M.) over the last 50 years.
   Decision-making problems are studied in terms of three major components:
   decision makers, decision tools, and techniques for selecting the best
   alternative. Decision tools are analyzed in more detail in terms of
   epistemology of the work, the way decision parameters are modeled, the
   analysis approach they take, and the application tool they use. At the
   epistemological level, it was found that despite some new attempts to
   adopt constructivist views, positivism and phenomenology dominate the
   philosophical foundations of the work in the field. In terms of decision
   makers, a shift was detected from an assumption of individual decision
   makers to a hierarchical structure, and, more recently, to a network of
   decision makers. Decision criteria have evolved from focusing on the
   technical and objective to soft and subjective aspects of construction.
   A general migration from models with pure deterministic nature to
   (fundamentally) probabilistic models with stochastic approaches is
   detected. The complexity of engineering problems has resulted in a shift
   from judgmental to rational selection techniques. Interest in softer and
   subjective issues (such as sustainability) and the increasing number of
   (diversified) stakeholders have promoted the application of
   emergent-based selection methods, particularly in infrastructure
   projects. Trends of changes detected here are hypothesized to push for
   more focus on networkedness, managing the evolutionary (and possibly,
   chaotic) process, and harnessing collective intelligence of users to
   generate innovative solutions. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil
   Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The oil removal efficiency for the ex situ extraction of bitumen from
   oil sands, or ex situ washing of oil-contaminated sand and related
   processes is determined by the balance of forces at the oil/water and
   solid/fluid interfaces. The objective of this work is to estimate the
   balance of forces at the interface using dimensionless numbers, and
   their use in evaluating and engineering ex situ soil washing processes.
   To this end, bitumen was removed from bitumen-coated sand particles
   using a two-step process. In the first step, the particles were mixed
   with a suitable solvent (toluene) used, primarily, to reduce the
   viscosity of bitumen. The particles were then mixed with water or an
   aqueous surfactant solution capable of producing low interfacial
   tensions with the solvent-bitumen mixture. The fraction of oil retained
   after washing was evaluated as a function of interfacial tension,
   solvent/bitumen ratio, mixing time, mixing velocity, and particle size.
   These ex situ washing conditions were normalized using dimensionless
   film and particle-based Weber and Capillary numbers. The fraction of oil
   retained by the particles was plotted against these dimensionless
   numbers to generate capillary curves similar to those used in enhanced
   oil recovery. These curves reveal the existence of a critical film-based
   Weber number and a particle-based Capillary number that can be used in
   the design or evaluation of soil washing processes. The film-based Weber
   number also explained literature data that associates interfacial
   tension with the removal of oil from oil-based drill cuttings, as well
   as field observations on the role that particle size plays on the
   removal of oil in soil washing operations.}},

Abstract = {{Myocardial infarction, a prevalent cardiovascular disease, is associated
   with cardiomyocyte cell death, and eventually heart failure. Cardiac
   tissue engineering has provided hopes for alternative treatment options,
   and high-fidelity tissue models for drug discovery. The signal
   transduction mechanisms relayed in response to mechanoelectrical
   (physical) stimulation or biochemical stimulation (hormones, cytokines,
   or drugs) in engineered heart tissues (EHTs) are poorly understood. In
   this study, an EHT model was used to elucidate the signaling mechanisms
   involved when insulin was applied in the presence of electrical
   stimulation, a stimulus that mimics functional heart tissue environment
   in vitro. EHTs were insulin treated, electrically stimulated, or applied
   in combination (insulin and electrical stimulation). Electrical
   excitability parameters (excitation threshold and maximum capture rate)
   were measured. Protein kinase B (AKT) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
   (PI3K) phosphorylation revealed that insulin and electrical stimulation
   relayed electrical excitability through two separate signaling cascades,
   while there was a negative crosstalk between sustained activation of AKT
   and PI3K.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines higher mode effects in systems where the ductile
   mechanism for seismic design is the base moment-rotation response. The
   modal properties of flexural and shear beams with uniform mass and
   elasticity and with a variable amount of base rotational restraint are
   derived. As the base fixity is released, the first mode becomes the
   rigid body rotation of the beam about the base, but the higher modes
   change much less, particularly for the shear beam model. Most response
   quantities that are of interest in the seismic design of typical
   mid-rise buildings are controlled by the first two lateral modes, except
   at locations along the height where the second mode contributes little.
   However, the third and higher lateral modes are more significant for
   high-rise buildings. Based on the theory of uniform cantilever shear
   beams, expressions are developed to avoid the need for a modal analysis
   to estimate the overturning moment, storey shear, and floor acceleration
   envelopes. Considering the measured response from the shake table
   testing of a large-scale eight-storey controlled rocking steel braced
   frame, the proposed expressions are shown to be of similar or better
   accuracy to a modified modal superposition technique, which combines the
   higher mode response from an elastic modal analysis with the response
   associated with achieving the maximum base overturning moment according
   to an inverted triangular load distribution. Because the proposed method
   uses only parameters that are available at the initial design stage,
   avoiding the analysis of a structural model, it is likely to be
   especially useful for preliminary design. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Quantitative magnetization transfer imaging (qMTI) increases specificity
   to macromolecular content in tissue by modeling the exchange process
   between the liquid and the macromolecular pool. However, its use has
   been mostly restricted to researchers that have developed these methods,
   in part due to the need to write complicated in-house software for
   modeling and data analysis. We have developed a software package
   (qMTLab) with a simple and easy to use graphical user interface that
   unifies three of the most widely used qMTI methods: MT spoiled gradient
   echo (MT-SPGR), MT balanced steady-state free precession (MT-bSSFP), and
   selective inversion recovery with fast spin echo (SIR-FSE). qMTLab is
   free open-source software that allows anyone interested in using these
   methods to easily simulate qMTI data, compare the performance of the
   methods under various experimental conditions, define new acquisition
   protocols, fit acquired data, and visualize the fitted parameters maps.
   By providing free software that gives end users a simple and easy to use
   graphical interface, we hope to make qMTI accessible to a greater number
   of investigators and facilitate the development, evaluation, and
   optimization of acquisition protocols and models. (C) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{The paper considers the problem of estimating the state of a
   complex-valued stochastic hybrid system observed distributively using an
   agent/sensor network (AN/SN) with complexvalued (possibly noncircular)
   observations. In several distributed estimation problems, a suitable
   model to describe the underlying system is unknown a priori, i.e.,
   distributed state estimation with structural uncertainty. Motivated by
   application of widely linear processing techniques in such problems, the
   paper proposes a class of distributed multiple-model adaptive estimation
   algorithms, referred to as the CD/MMAE. By incorporating the particular
   structure of the complex-valued observations on the second moment, first
   we develop two hierarchical CD/MMAE implementations and then use them as
   the building blocks and develop a diffusion-based hybrid estimator for
   decentralized estimation without incorporation of a fusion centre. The
   paper derives a new form of the adaptation law and a new form of
   information fusion, which takes advantage of the full second-order
   statistical properties of the underlying observations. Convergence
   properties of the proposed diffusion-based CD/MMAE are then
   investigated. We show that the adaptive weight of all local nodes
   converges to the true mode with probability one. Simulation results
   indicate that the proposed hybrid estimators provide improved
   performance and convergence properties over their traditional
   counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{The optical and electrical characteristics of the insulator-metal phase
   transition of vanadium dioxide (VO2) enable the realization of
   power-efficient, miniaturized hybrid optoelectronic devices. This work
   studies the current-controlled, two-step insulator-metal phase
   transition of VO2 in varying microwire geometries. Geometry-dependent
   scaling trends extracted from current-voltage measurements show that the
   first step induced by carrier injection is delocalized over the
   microwire, while the second, thermally-induced step is localized to a
   filament about 1 to 2 mu m wide for 100 nm-thick sputtered VO2 films on
   SiO2. These effects are confirmed by direct infrared imaging, which also
   measures the change in optical absorption in the two steps. The
   difference between the threshold currents of the two steps increases as
   the microwires are narrowed. Micron-and sub-micron-wide VO2 structures
   can be used to separate the two phase transition steps in photonic and
   electronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Owing to their remarkable thermoelastic and scale-dependent physical
   properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have emerged as promising
   reinforcements to enhance the thermomechanical response of nano-tailored
   composite materials. Two fundamental aspects influencing the
   thermoelastic response of a nano-tailored composite are investigated
   herein; namely, CNT waviness and the existence of an interphase between
   a CNT and the polymer matrix. We propose a systematic micromechanical
   modelling scheme in conjunction with a new interphase model to determine
   the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) of a nano-tailored
   composite. The proposed modelling approach has been applied to a case
   study involving the need to determine the effective CTEs of a novel
   nano-tailored composite-fuzzy carbon fiber heat exchanger. The results
   reveal that (i) the interphase between a CNT and the surrounding polymer
   matrix plays a crucial role in the modelling of the thermoelastic
   properties of the CNT-based composite, (ii) planar orientation of CNT
   waviness has a significant influence on the effective CTEs of the hybrid
   nano-tailored composite, and (iii) for the particular planar orientation
   of CNT waviness and the value of CNT wave frequency, the effective CTEs
   of the hybrid nano-tailored composite become zero, making the
   nanocomposite a ``super-insulator{''}. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to investigate the progressive failure
   behaviour of laminated cylindrical/conical panels under meridional
   compression considering geometric nonlinearity and evolving material
   damage. The evolving microscopic damage such as fiber breakage, matrix
   cracking, fiber matrix debonding etc. is modeled through a generalized
   macroscopic continuum theory within the framework of irreversible
   thermodynamics. The analysis is carried out using field consistent
   finite element approach based on first-order shear deformation theory.
   The nonlinear governing equations are solved using the Newton-Raphson
   iterative technique coupled with the adaptive displacement control
   method to trace the equilibrium path. The damage evolution equations are
   solved at every Gauss point using Newton-Raphson iterative technique
   within each iteration of a loading/displacement increment. To accurately
   model the transverse shear strain energy, shear correction factors are
   calculated using layers' properties and lamination scheme. The detailed
   study is carried out to highlight the influences of evolving damage,
   span-to-thickness ratio, lamination scheme, radius-to-span ratio,
   boundary conditions and semi-cone angle on the postbuckling response and
   failure load of laminated panels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{We report sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) following
   resective epilepsy surgery in two patients who had been documented as
   seizure free. One patient had been weaned off of anticonvulsants and was
   leading a normal life. The other patient had discontinued only one
   anticonvulsant but had recently started working night shifts. Following
   resective epilepsy surgery, one of the major objectives among patients,
   caregivers, and the healthcare team is to safely wean patients off
   anticonvulsant medications. The main concern regarding anticonvulsant
   withdrawal is seizure recurrence. While SUDEP following surgical
   resection has been reported, to our knowledge, there have been no
   confirmed cases in patients who have been seizure free. Considering the
   patients reported here, and given that there are no concrete guidelines
   for the safe withdrawal of anticonvulsants following epilepsy surgery,
   the discontinuation of anticonvulsants should be considered carefully
   and must be accompanied by close monitoring and counseling of patients
   regarding activities that lower seizure threshold, even after successful
   epilepsy surgery. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{While supine, fluid moves from the legs and accumulates in the chest and
   neck. However, patterns of rostral fluid shift are not clear.
   Furthermore, real-time measurement of neck fluid volume has not been
   investigated. The objective of this study was to investigate the
   dynamics of rostral fluid shift in men and women. We developed a
   bioelectrical impedance system to measure leg, abdominal, thoracic and
   neck fluid volumes (LFV, AFV, TFV, NFV) continuously. Forty healthy
   non-obese adults (20 men) lay supine for 90 min while fluid volumes were
   measured. After 90 min, a similar volume of fluid shifted out of the
   legs in both sexes (p = 0.079), but men accumulated more fluid in their
   thorax (63 +/- A 6 vs. 44 +/- A 11 ml, p = 0.016) and neck (17 +/- A 2
   vs. 14 +/- A 1 ml, p = 0.029) than women. In both sexes, the increase in
   NFV caused a significant increase in neck circumference, which was
   greater in men (p = 0.009). Furthermore, 80\% of rostral fluid shift
   would occur in the first 2 h of lying supine. These results suggest that
   greater fluid shift into the thorax and neck may contribute to the
   higher prevalence of sleep apnea in men than in women.}},

Abstract = {{Despite substantial improvement in microsurgical techniques for nerve
   repair, recovery after peripheral nerve injury is usually incomplete.
   FK506, an FDA approved immunosuppressant, improves functional recovery
   and reinnervation following peripheral nerve injury in animal models.
   However, systemically delivered FK506 causes undesirable global
   immunosuppression. We have, therefore, engineered a biodegradable local
   delivery system for FK506 using fibrin gel as a drug reservoir that
   could be placed at a site of nerve injury. FK506 was incorporated into
   fibrin gel in solubilized, particulated, and poly(lactic-co-glycolic)
   acid (PLGA) microspheres-encapsulated forms. A tunable release of FK506
   in the fibrin gel from days to weeks was observed with the rate of
   release being most rapid for the solubilized form and then the
   particulate form. The most prolonged period of release was seen with the
   PLGA microsphere-encapsulated form. As analyzed by in vitro dorsal root
   ganglion (DRG) neurite extension assay, PLGA microsphere encapsulation
   of FK506 did not alter the drug's properties and the released FK506
   maintained its bioactivity over the entire period of release. This study
   suggests that local delivery of FK506 with fibrin hydrogel could be used
   to enhance peripheral nerve regeneration. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2015;112:

Abstract = {{The letter considers a multi-sensor state estimation problem configured
   in a decentralized architecture where local complex statistics are
   communicated to the central processing unit for fusion instead of the
   raw observations. Naive adaptation of the augmented complex statistics
   to develop a decentralized state estimation algorithm results in
   increased local computations, and introduces extensive communication
   overhead, making it practically unattractive. The letter proposes a
   structure-induced complex Kalman filter framework with reduced
   communication overhead. In order to further reduce the local
   computations, the letter proposes a non-circularity criterion which
   allows each node to examine the non-circularity of its local
   observations. A local sensor node disregards its extra second-order
   statistical information when the non-circularity coefficient is small.
   In cases where the local observations are highly non-circular, an
   intuitively pleasing circularization approach is proposed to avoid
   computation and communication of the pseudo-covariance matrices.
   Simulation results indicate that the proposed structured-induced complex
   Kalman filter (SCKF) provides significant performance improvements over
   its traditional counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, we consider signals with a low-rank co-variance matrix
   which reside in a low-dimensional subspace and can be written in terms
   of a finite (small) number of parameters. Although such signals do not
   necessarily have a sparse representation in a finite basis, they possess
   a sparse structure which makes it possible to recover the signal from
   compressed measurements. We study the statistical performance bound for
   parameter estimation in the low-rank signal model from compressed
   measurements. Specifically, we derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for a
   generic low-rank model and we show that the number of compressed samples
   needs to be larger than the number of sources for the existence of an
   unbiased estimator with finite estimation variance. We further consider
   the applications to direction-of-arrival (DOA) and spectral estimation
   which fit into the low-rank signal model. We also investigate the effect
   of compression on the CRB by considering numerical examples of the DOA
   estimation scenario, and show how the CRB increases by increasing the
   compression or equivalently reducing the number of compressed samples.}},

Abstract = {{Two distinct methods of applying generalized averaging techniques appear
   in the literature. The first method involves a direct mathematical
   mapping of all system equations and inputs into the frequency domain to
   produce harmonic coefficients that precisely match those produced by a
   sliding window Fourier decomposition during transient events. Although
   this approach reproduces the same harmonic coefficients as a sliding
   window decomposition, it is shown that reconstruction of the time domain
   waveforms does not match the response of the underlying time domain
   system during transients. In contrast, a second method has recently been
   employed by some researchers that does not strictly map all system
   equations and inputs into the frequency domain, and yet it has been
   shown to precisely reproduce time domain results during transients. This
   paper shows that this matching of the time domain transients comes at
   the expense of introducing spurious dynamics into the associated
   harmonic domain model, which may not exist in the underlying time domain
   system. The limitations and implicit assumptions behind these two
   methods are identified and compared, thus allowing researchers to
   readily determine which compromises are to be made based on the
   application in question.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we set out the steps to efficiently synthesize boron
   subphthalocyanine (BsubPc)-containing polymers while circumventing the
   formation of a known side product. The synthesis was achieved using the
   post-polymerization coupling reaction of a carboxylic acid functional
   prepolymer with bromo-BsubPc. We have earlier shown that when
   copolymerizing styrene and acrylic acid (AA) a significant amount of an
   undesired side product is formed. In this study, we have determined that
   this side product persisted when styrene was copolymerized with AA or
   n-butyl acrylate but could be avoided when styrene was copolymerized
   with methacrylic acid (MAA), methyl methacrylate, or acrylonitrile.
   Therefore, MAA/styrene copolymer, synthesized by nitroxide-mediated
   polymerization was chosen to be coupled to BsubPc. The resulting BsubPc
   polymer was found to have similar electrochemical properties, solution
   state absorption and photoluminescence characteristics when compared
   against a small molecule model compound although the solid-state PL
   emission of the polymer was found to be excitation wavelength dependent.
   Finally, preliminary organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) were
   fabricated to assess the potential role(s) of the BsubPc polymer in
   organic electronic devices. These OLEDs represent the first-solution
   processed organic electronic devices containing BsubPc polymers as a
   functional material. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci.,

Abstract = {{Microwell platforms are frequently described for the efficient and
   uniform manufacture of 3-dimensional (3D) multicellular microtissues.
   Multiple partial or complete medium exchanges can displace microtissues
   from discrete microwells, and this can result in either the loss of
   microtissues from culture, or microtissue amalgamation when displaced
   microtissues fall into common microwells. Herein we describe the first
   microwell platform that incorporates a mesh to retain microtissues
   within discrete microwells; the microwell-mesh. We show that bonding a
   nylon mesh with an appropriate pore size over the microwell openings
   allows single cells to pass through the mesh into the microwells during
   the seeding process, but subsequently retains assembled microtissues
   within discrete microwells. To demonstrate the utility of this platform,
   we used the microwell-mesh to manufacture hundreds of cartilage
   microtissues, each formed from 5 x 10(3) bone marrow-derived mesenchymal
   stem/stromal cells (MSC). The microwell-mesh enabled reliable
   microtissue retention over 21-day cultures that included multiple full
   medium exchanges. Cartilage-like matrix formation was more rapid and
   homogeneous in microtissues than in conventional large diameter control
   cartilage pellets formed from 2 x 10(5) MSC each. The microwell-mesh
   platform offers an elegant mechanism to retain microtissues in
   microwells, and we believe that this improvement will make this platform
   useful in 3D culture protocols that require multiple medium exchanges,
   such as those that mimic specific developmental processes or complex
   sequential drug exposures. (c) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) brain-computer interface (BCI) studies
   have primarily made use of measurements taken from a single cortical
   area. In particular, the anterior prefrontal cortex has been the key
   area used for detecting higher-level cognitive task performance.
   However, mental task execution typically requires coordination between
   several, spatially-distributed brain regions. We investigated the value
   of expanding the area of interrogation to include NIRS measurements from
   both the prefrontal and parietal cortices to decode mental states.
   Hemodynamic activity was monitored at 46 locations over the prefrontal
   and parietal cortices using a continuous-wave near-infrared spectrometer
   while 11 able-bodied adults rested or performed either the verbal
   fluency task (VFT) or Stroop task. Offline classification was performed
   for the three possible binary problems using 25 iterations of bagging
   with a linear discriminant base classifier. Classifiers were trained on
   a 10 dimensional feature set. When all 46 measurement locations were
   considered for classification, average accuracies of 80.4 +/- 7.0\%,
   82.4 +/- 7.6\%, and 82.8 +/- 5.9\% in differentiating VFT vs rest,
   Stroop vs rest and VFT vs Stroop, respectively, were obtained. Relative
   to using measurements from the anterior PFC alone, an overall average
   improvement of 11.3\% was achieved. Utilizing NIRS measurements from the
   prefrontal and parietal cortices can be of value in classifying mental
   states involving working memory and attention. NIRS-BCI accuracies may
   be improved by incorporating measurements from several, distinct
   cortical regions, rather than a single area alone. Further development
   of an NIRS-BCI supporting combinations of VFT, Stroop task and rest
   states is also warranted. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Mineralization defects in cementum and craniofacial bone from loss of

Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{150-164}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Bone sialoprotein (BSP) is a multifunctional extracellular matrix
   protein found in mineralized tissues, including bone, cartilage, tooth
   root cementum (both acellular and cellular types), and dentin. In order
   to define the role BSP plays in the process of biomineralization of
   these tissues, we analyzed cementogenesis, dentinogenesis, and
   osteogenesis (intramembranous and endochondral) in craniofacial bone in
   Bsp null mice and wild-type (WT) controls over a developmental period
   (1-60 days post natal; dpn) by histology, immunohistochemistry,
   undecalcified histochemistry, microcomputed tomography (microCT),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM), and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Regions of intramembranous
   ossification in the alveolus, mandible, and calvaria presented delayed
   mineralization and osteoid accumulation, assessed by von Kossa and
   Goldner's trichrome stains at 1 and 14 dpn. Moreover, Bsp(-/-) mice
   featured increased cranial suture size at the early time point, 1 dpn.
   Immunostaining and PCR demonstrated that osteoblast markers, osterix,
   alkaline phosphatase, and osteopontin were unchanged in Bsp null
   mandibles compared to WT. Bsp(-/-) mouse molars featured a lack of
   functional acellular cementum formation by histology, SEM, and TEM, and
   subsequent loss of Sharpey's collagen fiber insertion into the tooth
   root structure. Bsp(-/-) mouse alveolar and mandibular bone featured
   equivalent or fewer osteoclasts at early ages (1 and 14 dpn), however,
   increased RANKL immunostaining and mRNA, and significantly increased
   number of osteodast-like cells (2-5 fold) were found at later ages (26
   and 60 dpn), corresponding to periodontal breakdown and severe alveolar
   bone resorption observed following molar teeth entering occlusion.
   Dentin formation was unperturbed in Bsp(-/-) mouse molars, with no delay
   in mineralization, no alteration in dentin dimensions, and no
   differences in odontoblast markers analyzed. No defects were identified
   in endochondral ossification in the cranial base, and craniofacial
   morphology was unaffected in Bsp(-/-) mice. These analyses confirm a
   critical role for BSP in processes of cementogenesis and intramembranous
   ossification of craniofacial bone, whereas endochondral ossification in
   the cranial base was minimally affected and dentinogenesis was normal in
   Bsp(-/-) molar teeth. Dissimilar effects of loss of BSP on
   mineralization of dental and craniofacial tissues suggest local
   differences in the role of BSP and/or yet to be defined interactions
   with site-specific factors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

   micro-machining}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{223}},
Pages = {{232-239}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Abrasive jet micromachining uses a jet of high-speed particles to erode
   a wide variety of materials. Since the air driven jet is highly
   divergent, the edges of the desired features are usually defined using a
   mask which is attached to the surface of the target material. This paper
   presents an alternate technique using shadow masks that can be moved
   over the surface, thus allowing direct writing of features on the
   surface. This eliminates the additional cost and time of fabricating and
   attaching traditional masks. The technique was used to machine straight
   channels in borosilicate glass, and their quality was compared to those
   machined using traditional clamped masks. The channels machined using
   the shadow mask were found to be approximately 10\% wider than those
   machined using clamped masks up to an aspect ratio of approximately 0.5.
   Under these conditions, the shadow mask channels were bounded on the
   edges by lightly-eroded, frosted regions approximately 60 mu m wide. The
   effects of nozzle standoff, shadow mask standoff, particle size and mask
   thickness on the frosted regions and the channel width were studied. To
   create a direct-writing device, a crossed arrangement of two mutually
   perpendicular sets of shadow masks was used to generate arbitrarily
   curved paths. These crossed shadow masks resulted in less frosting than
   did the parallel masks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   angles provided consistent measures of footwear slip resistance and
   demonstrated better resolution than mechanical tests. One footwear
   outsole material and tread combination outperformed the others on wet
   ice allowing participants to successfully walk on steep longitudinal
   slopes of 17.5 degrees +/- 1.9 degrees (mean +/- SD). By further
   exploiting the methodology to include additional surfaces and

Abstract = {{Embryonic epithelia have a remarkable ability to rapidly repair wounds.
   A supracellular actomyosin cable around the wound coordinates cellular
   movements and promotes wound closure. Actomyosin cable formation is
   accompanied by junctional rearrangements at the wound margin. We used in
   vivo time-lapse quantitative microscopy to show that clathrin, dynamin,
   and the ADP-ribosylation factor 6, three components of the endocytic
   machinery, accumulate around wounds in Drosophila melanogaster embryos
   in a process that requires calcium signaling and actomyosin
   contractility. Blocking endocytosis with pharmacological or genetic
   approaches disrupted wound repair. The defect in wound closure was
   accompanied by impaired removal of E-cadherin from the wound edge and
   defective actomyosin cable assembly. E-cadherin overexpression also
   resulted in reduced actin accumulation around wounds and slower wound
   closure. Reducing E-cadherin levels in embryos in which endocytosis was
   blocked rescued actin localization to the wound margin. Our results
   demonstrate a central role for endocytosis in wound healing and indicate
   that polarized E-cadherin endocytosis is necessary for actomyosin
   remodeling during embryonic wound repair.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{Protein splicing is mediated by inteins that auto-catalytically join two
   separated protein fragments with a peptide bond. Here we engineered a
   genetically encoded synthetic photoactivatable intein (named LOVInC), by
   using the light-sensitive LOV2 domain from Avena sativa as a switch to
   modulate the splicing activity of the split DnaE intein from Nostoc
   punctiforme. Periodic blue light illumination of LOVInC induced protein
   splicing activity in mammalian cells. To demonstrate the broad
   applicability of LOVInC, synthetic protein systems were engineered for
   the light-induced reassembly of several target proteins such as
   fluorescent protein markers, a dominant positive mutant of RhoA,
   caspase-7, and the genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator GCaMP2. Spatial
   precision of LOVInC was demonstrated by targeting activity to specific
   mammalian cells. Thus, LOVInC can serve as a general platform for
   engineering light-based control for modulating the activity of many
   different proteins.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we added a small amount of polyethylenimine (PEI) into
   several ambipolar and p-type polymer semiconductors and used these
   blends as channel materials in organic thin film transistors (OTFTs). It
   is found that PEI can effectively suppress hole transport
   characteristics while maintaining or promoting the electron transport
   performance. Unipolar n-channel OTFTs with electron-only transport
   behavior is achieved for all the polymer semiconductors chosen with 2-10
   wt \% PEI. The electron-rich nitrogen atoms in PEI are thought to fill
   the electron traps, raise the Fermi level and function as trapping sites
   for holes, leading to promotion of electron transport and suppression of
   hole transport. This work demonstrates a convenient general approach to
   transforming ambipolar and p-type polymer semiconductors into unipolar
   n-type polymer semiconductors that are useful for printed logic circuits
   and many other applications.}},

   signal-to-idler conversion range was 100 nm, limited by the tuning range
   of the pump source. The maximum conversion efficiency, defined as the
   ratio of the output idler power to the output signal power, was -38 dB.
   In support of our explanation of the experimentally observed trends, we
   present modal analysis and group velocity dispersion numerical analysis.

Abstract = {{Increased permeability of blood vessels is an indicator for various
   injuries and diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), of the central
   nervous system. Nanoparticles have the potential to deliver drugs
   locally to sites of tissue damage, reducing the drug administered and
   limiting associated side effects, but efficient accumulation still
   remains a challenge. We developed peptide-functionalized polymeric
   nanoparticles to target blood clots and the extracellular matrix
   molecule nidogen, which are associated with areas of tissue damage.
   Using the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in rats
   to provide a model of MS associated with tissue damage and blood vessel
   lesions, all targeted nanoparticles were delivered systemically. In vivo
   data demonstrates enhanced accumulation of peptide functionalized
   nanoparticles at the injury site compared to scrambled and naive
   controls, particularly for nanoparticles functionalized to target fibrin
   clots. This suggests that further investigations with drug laden,
   peptide functionalized nanoparticles might be of particular interest in
   the development of treatment strategies for MS. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Large GTPases of the dynamin superfamily promote membrane fusion and
   division, processes that are crucial for intracellular trafficking and
   organellar dynamics. To promote membrane scission, dynamin proteins
   polymerize, wrap around, and constrict the membrane; however, the
   mechanism underlying their role in membrane fusion remains unclear. We
   previously reported that the mitochondrial dynamin-related protein
   mitochondrial genome maintenance 1 (Mgm1) mediates fusion by first
   tethering opposing membranes and then undergoing a nucleotide-dependent
   structural transition. However, it is still unclear how Mgm1 directly
   affects the membrane to drive fusion of tethered membranes. Here, we
   show that Mgm1 association with the membrane alters the topography of
   the membrane, promoting local membrane bending. We also demonstrate that
   Mgm1 creates membrane ruffles resulting in the formation of tubular
   structures on both supported lipid bilayers and liposomes. These data
   suggest that Mgm1 membrane interactions impose a mechanical force on the
   membrane to overcome the hydrophilic repulsion of the phospholipid head
   groups and initiate the fusion reaction. The work reported here provides
   new insights into a possible mechanism of Mgm1-driven mitochondrial
   membrane fusion and sheds light into how members of the dynamin
   superfamily function as fusion molecules. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have already been proven in
   display applications and show promise as the next-generation solid-state
   lighting technology for general illumination. A major barrier to the
   adoption of OLEDs for solid-state lighting is the efficiency roll-off at
   high brightness, which occurs at much lower current densities for OLEDs
   than their inorganic counterparts, in large part due to the quenching of
   excitons. We discuss strategies to mitigate this efficiency roll-off
   through management of excitons in both white and monochrome devices,
   including the use of phosphorescent as well as thermally activated
   delayed fluorescent emitters. Successful high-efficiency devices are
   used as case studies for how to effectively manage excitons. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are promising for biomedical
   applications due to their unique thermoresponsive and elastic
   properties. ELP-based hydrogels have been produced through chemical and
   enzymatic crosslinking or photocrosslinking of modified ELPs. Herein, a
   photocrosslinked ELP gel using only canonical amino acids is presented.
   The inclusion of thiols from a pair of cysteine residues in the ELP
   sequence allows disulfide bond formation upon exposure to UV light,
   leading to the formation of a highly elastic hydrogel. The physical
   properties of the resulting hydrogel such as mechanical properties and
   swelling behavior can be easily tuned by controlling ELP concentrations.
   The biocompatibility of the engineered ELP hydrogels is shown in vitro
   as well as corroborated in vivo with subcutaneous implantation of
   hydrogels in rats. ELP constructs demonstrate long-term structural
   stability in vivo, and early and progressive host integration with no
   immune response, suggesting their potential for supporting wound repair.
   Ultimately, functionalized ELPs demonstrate the ability to function as
   an in vivo hemostatic material over bleeding wounds.}},

Abstract = {{In order to gain a fundamental understanding of the deformation behavior
   of multilayer architectures composed of a periodic layering of hard and
   soft structural features, NiCo samples possessing modulated
   nanocrystalline and coarse-grained microstructures were fabricated using
   pulsed electrodeposition. Scanning electron microscopy imaging confirmed
   that the samples possessed an alternating grain size distribution and
   the desired 1:1 thickness ratio of constitutive layers. Uniaxial tensile
   testing showed a rule of mixtures relationship in yield and ultimate
   tensile strengths for the multilayer with respect to reference samples.
   Notably, an increase in elongation to failure was observed in the
   multilayer when compared to the nanocrystalline reference. The gains in
   elongation were found to be associated with improved neck stability due
   to dislocation activity within the coarse-grained layers. The morphology
   of the fracture surface, considered together with the available
   mechanical data, electron micrographs and texture measurements, forms
   the basis of a multiscale deformation mechanism which describes a
   failure pathway for multilayer architectures with nanocrystalline and
   coarse-grained structural features. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The development of cell replacement strategies to repair the injured
   brain has gained considerable attention, with a particular interest in
   mobilizing endogenous neural stem and progenitor cells (known as neural
   precursor cells {[}NPCs]) to promote brain repair. Recent work
   demonstrated metformin, a drug used to manage type II diabetes, promotes
   neurogenesis. We sought to determine its role in neural repair following
   brain injury. We find that metformin administration activates endogenous
   NPCs, expanding the size of the NPC pool and promoting NPC migration and
   differentiation in the injured neonatal brain in a hypoxia-ischemia
   (H/I) injury model. Importantly, metformin treatment following H/I
   restores sensory-motor function. Lineage tracking reveals that metformin
   treatment following H/I causes an increase in the absolute number of
   subependyma-derived NPCs relative to untreated H/I controls in areas
   associated with sensory-motor function. Hence, activation of endogenous
   NPCs is a promising target for therapeutic intervention in childhood
   brain injury models.}},

   pentacene, is relatively efficient at facilitating the process. As
   expected, we found a major increase in photocurrent generation at the
   expense of device voltage. For a direct point of comparison, we also
   have paired the same polychlorinated boron subphthalocyanine with
   alpha-sexithiophene to probe the alternative technique of complementary
   absorption engineering. The sum of these efforts have let us present new
   guidelines for the molecular design of boron subphthalocyanine for

Abstract = {{LubX is part of the large arsenal of effectors in Legionella pneumophila
   that are translocated into the host cytosol during infection. Despite
   such unique features as the presence of two U-box motifs and its
   targeting of another effector SidH, the molecular basis of LubX activity
   remains poorly understood. Here we show that the N terminus of LubX is
   able to activate an extended number of ubiquitin-conjugating (E2)
   enzymes including UBE2W, UBEL6, and all tested members of UBE2D and
   UBE2E families. Crystal structures of LubX alone and in complex with
   UBE2D2 revealed drastic molecular diversification between the two U-box
   domains, with only the N-terminal U-box retaining E2 recognition
   features typical for its eukaryotic counterparts. Extensive mutagenesis
   followed by functional screening in a yeast model system captured
   functionally important LubX residues including Arg121, critical for
   interactions with SidH. Combined, these data provide a new molecular
   insight into the function of this unique pathogenic factor.}},

Title = {{Effect of source tampering in the security of quantum cryptography}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG 4}},
Abstract = {{The security of source has become an increasingly important issue in
   quantum cryptography. Based on the framework of
   measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), the
   source becomes the only region exploitable by a potential eavesdropper
   (Eve). Phase randomization is a cornerstone assumption in most
   discrete-variable (DV) quantum communication protocols (e.g., QKD,
   quantum coin tossing, weak-coherent- state blind quantum computing, and
   so on), and the violation of such an assumption is thus fatal to the
   security of those protocols. In this paper, we show a simple quantum
   hacking strategy, with commercial and homemade pulsed lasers, by Eve
   that allows her to actively tamper with the source and violate such an
   assumption, without leaving a trace afterwards. Furthermore, our attack
   may also be valid for continuous-variable (CV) QKD, which is another

Abstract = {{This article studies a single-item periodic-review inventory problem
   with stochastic demand, uncertain price, and price search cost. At the
   beginning of a period, an inventory manager has to decide, considering
   the current inventory level, whether a price should be searched for at a
   non-zero cost. Once the price is known, she will have to decide the
   order size. For tractability the number of realizable prices is limited
   to two and (r, S-1, S-2)-type policies are considered, where r is the
   threshold for the price search decision and S-i is the order-up-to level
   for price p(i) for i = 1, 2. Although the problem is significantly
   simplified, it still allows for price speculations by the inventory
   manager; i.e., she requests a quote but may not buy. The properties of
   long-run average costs are studies and optimization algorithms are
   presented. Numerical studies show the effectiveness of the proposed
   policy compared with classic (s, S)-type policy and its natural
   three-parameter extension.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{588}},
Pages = {{67-77}},

Abstract = {{MoS2 is a well-known lubricant for vacuum application. However, the role
   of contamination in achieving low friction and long wear life in
   industrial applications remains unclear as the literature presents some
   contradictions. A former study performed in ultrahigh vacuum showed that
   in a sliding macro contact, the origin of low friction was primarily due
   to the formation of a 3rd body layer, its trapping and its ability to
   flow plastically inside the contact. The study showed a homogenisation
   of the chemical elemental composition of the material and the internal
   coating contaminants throughout the contact and the 3rd body. To study
   that homogenisation and to verify if a chemical rearrangement occurred
   at a molecular level under friction, Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass
   Spectroscopy analyses are performed. Firstly, they show that the MoS2
   coating made by Physical Vapour Deposition is not a ``MoS2{''} but is a
   complex MoxSyOz structure. Secondly, they show that a chemical
   rearrangement of the material with the internal contaminants effectively
   occurs in ultrahigh vacuum and leads to the formation of a unique MoSxOy
   phase. Such a phase shows the beneficial role of reasonable
   contamination on the tribological behaviour. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Can the Windkessel Hypothesis Explain Delayed Intraparenchymal
   Haemorrhage After Flow Diversion? A Case Report and Model-Based Analysis

Journal = {{HEART LUNG AND CIRCULATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background Delayed ipsilateral intraparenchymal haemorrhage is a
   recently recognised complication after endovascular flow diversion for
   intracranial aneurysms. Although the mechanism of this phenomenon is not
   understood, one proposed explanation (the windkessel hypothesis) is that
   removal of aneurysmal compliance increases distal pulse pressure.
   Methods We present a case of delayed haemorrhage after placement of a
   Pipeline stent, discuss the proposed mechanisms, and describe a novel
   electrical analogue model that was used to evaluate the likely
   haemodynamic effect of stent placement.
   Results Model-based analysis suggests that stenting is not likely to
   produce a significant change in distal pulse pressure. Moreover, basic
   fluid dynamics principles suggest that a local reduction in disturbed
   flow in the region of the aneurysm could produce only a minor increase
   in distal pressure (a few mmHg), which is unlikely to be the main cause
   of the observed haemorrhage.
   Conclusion The windkessel hypothesis is unlikely to explain the
   occurrence of delayed ipsilateral intraparenchymal haemorrhage after
   flow diversion; however, other mechanisms involving altered
   haemodynamics distal to the treated aneurysm may play a role. Further
   studies involving the assessment of haemodynamic changes after flow
   diversion would be useful to understand, and eventually mitigate, this
   currently unpredictable risk.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND CONCRETE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{287-309}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{FormWorks-Plus is a generalized public domain user-friendly preprocessor
   developed to facilitate the process of creating finite element models
   for structural analysis programs. The lack of a graphical user interface
   in most academic analysis programs forces users to input the structural
   model information into the standard text files, which is a
   time-consuming and error-prone process. FormWorks-Plus enables engineers
   to conveniently set up the finite element model in a graphical
   environment, eliminating the problems associated with conventional input
   text files and improving the user's perception of the application. In
   this paper, a brief overview of the FormWorks-Plus structure is
   presented, followed by a detailed explanation of the main features of
   the program. In addition, demonstration is made of the application of
   FormWorks-Plus in combination with VecTor programs, advanced nonlinear
   analysis tools for reinforced concrete structures. Finally, aspects
   relating to the modelling and analysis of three case studies are
   discussed: a reinforced concrete beam-column joint, a steel-concrete
   composite shear wall, and a SFRC shear panel. The unique mixed-type
   frame-membrane modelling procedure implemented in FormWorks-Plus can
   address the limitations associated with most frame type analyses.}},

Abstract = {{It is commonly accepted that vision plays an important role in car
   braking, but it is unknown how people brake in the absence of visual
   information. In this simulator study, we measured drivers' braking
   behaviour while they had to stop their car at designated positions on
   the road. The access to visual information was manipulated by occluding
   the screen at the start of half of the braking trials, while the
   temporal demand was manipulated by varying the time-to-arrival (TTA).
   Results showed that for the longer TTA values (>= 6 s), participants in
   the occlusion condition stopped too early and at variable positions on
   the road as compared to the control condition. In the occlusion
   condition, participants were likely to apply an intermediate brake pedal
   depression, whereas in the control condition participants more often
   applied low or high pedal depressions. The results are interpreted in
   light of a distance estimation test, in which we found that participants
   underestimated the actual distance by 70\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Metabolic engineering has proven crucial for the microbial production of
   valuable chemicals. Due to the rapid development of tools in synthetic
   biology, there has been recent interest in the dynamic regulation of
   flux through metabolic pathways to overcome some of the issues arising
   from traditional strategies lacking dynamic control. There are many
   diverse implementations of dynamic control, with a range of metabolite
   sensors and inducers being used. Furthermore, control has been
   implemented at the transcriptional, translational and post-translational
   levels. Each of these levels have unique sets of engineering tools, and
   allow for control at different dynamic time-scales. In order to extend
   the applications of dynamic control, new tools are required to improve
   the dynamics of regulatory circuits. Further study and characterization
   of circuit robustness is also needed to improve their applicability to
   industry. The successful implementation of dynamic control, using
   technologies that are amenable to commercialization, will be a
   fundamental step in advancing metabolic engineering.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a FFSP (full-infinite fuzzy stochastic programming)
   method is developed for planning MEPS (municipal electric power systems)
   associated with GHG (greenhouse gas) control under uncertainty. FFSP can
   deal with multiple uncertainties presented in terms of fuzzy sets,
   functional intervals, and random variables. FFSP is also applied to a
   case study of Beijing for managing MEPS, and reducing the GHG emission
   through introducing the EU ETS (European Union greenhouse gas emission
   trading scheme). The results indicate that reasonable solutions have
   been generated, which can be used for generating schemes of energy
   resources, electricity production/allocation, and capacity expansion
   under various economic costs and GHG reduction requirements. The case
   study demonstrates that FFSP can increase the abilities of reflecting
   complexities for dynamics of capacity expansion and interaction of
   multiple uncertainties in MEPS. The results allow in-depth analyses of
   trade-offs between GHG mitigation and economic objective as well as
   those between system cost and decision makers' satisfaction degree.
   Besides, this study can also provide an example to help China construct
   domestic carbon trading market at municipal scale for addressing the
   challenges of global climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The beneficial mechanisms of the lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase
   CelS2 (ScLPMO10C) from Streptomyces coelicolor on interactions between
   cellulose and the processive cellulase cellobiohydrolase I (Cel7A) were
   investigated by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation. Initial
   binding of CelS2 to cellulose coated SiO2 sensors at 40 degrees C was
   rapid, but minimal, and was followed by modest positive changes in
   oscillation frequencies of the quartz crystal sensors that were
   attributed to mass loss from the cellulose surface. The presence of
   oxidized cellulose on the CelS2 treated sensors was verified by X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy. Subsequent binding of purified Cel7A from
   Trichoderma longibrachiatum at 23 degrees C was significantly less in
   overall extent to CelS2 treated sensors than to untreated controls
   despite identical initial binding rates and dissipation-change:
   frequency-change ratios (an indication of the rigidity of the newly
   forming layer). Moreover, initial Cel7A binding to the treated sensors
   was followed by positive overall frequency changes indicating potential
   increased hydrolytic removal of cellulose mass by cellobiohydrolase
   action at 23 degrees C. Furthermore, secondary binding of Cel7A to the
   control sensors was coupled with considerable changes in dissipation
   (indicating greater surface viscoelasticity) not observed during the
   initial binding phase; the extent of this secondary binding was observed
   to be negligible during Cel7A interaction with the CelS2 treated
   sensors. This drastic difference in more viscoelastic secondary binding
   suggests a reduction in loose non-productive cellobiohydrolase binding
   following CelS2 treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The air-stability of vapour-phase-deposited methylammonium lead
   triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite thin films has been studied using
   X-ray diffraction. It is found that the perovskite structure without
   organic coating decomposes completely within a short period of time
   (similar to two days) upon exposure to ambient environment. The
   degradation of the perovskite structure is drastically reduced when the
   perovskite films are capped with thin N, N'-Di(1-naphthyl)-N,
   N'-diphenyl-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diamine (NPB) films. We discovered that
   the amount of lead iodide (PbI2), a product of the degradation, grows as
   a function of time in a sigmoidal manner. Further mathematical modeling
   analysis shows that the perovskite degradation follows the Avrami
   equation, a kinetics theory developed for quantifying phase
   transformations in solid-state materials. (C) 2015 Author(s). All

Abstract = {{Organometallic halide perovskites are a class of solution-processed
   semiconductors exhibiting remarkable optoelectronic properties. They
   have seen rapid strides toward enabling efficient third-generation solar
   cell technologies. Here, we report the first material-tailoring of
   TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD junction-based photodiodes toward
   applications in photodetection, a field in need of fast, sensitive,
   low-cost, spectrally tunable materials that offer facile integration
   across a broad range of substrates. We report photodetection that
   exhibits 1 its temporal response, and we showcase stable operation in
   the detection of over 7 billion transient light pulses through a
   continuous pulsed-illumination period. The perovskite diode
   photodetector has a peak responsivity approaching 0.4 A W-1 at 600 nm
   wavelength, which is superior to red light detection in crystalline
   silicon photodiodes used in commercial image sensors. Only by developing
   a composite Al2O3/PCBM front contact interface layer were we able to
   stabilize device operation in air, reduce dark current, and enhance the
   responsivity in the low-bias regime to achieve an experimentally
   measured specific detectivity of 10(12) Jones.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical drop shapes are calculated for three drop constellations:
   pendant drops, constrained sessile drops, and unconstrained sessile
   drops. Based on total Gaussian curvature, shape parameter and critical
   shape parameter are discussed as a function of different drop sizes and
   surface tensions. The shape parameter is linked to physical parameters
   for every drop constellation. The as yet unavailable detailed
   dimensional analysis for the unconstrained sessile drop is presented.
   Results,show that the unconstrained sessile drop shape depends on a
   dimensionless volume term and the contact angle. Random perturbations
   are introduced and the accuracy of surface tension measurement is
   assessed for precise and perturbed profiles of the three drop
   constellations. It is concluded that pendant drops are the best method
   for accurate surface tension measurement, followed by constrained
   sessile drops. The unconstrained sessile drops come last because they
   tend to be more spherical at low and moderate contact angles. Of course,
   unconstrained sessile drops are the only option if contact angles are to
   be measured. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We describe three approaches to identify novel product affordances:
   affordance of absence; insights from lead users, specifically
   do-it-yourselfers (DIYers); and natural-language searches. While these
   approaches were separately pursued, we show their connection to each
   other in this paper. We begin by describing the affordance of absence,
   inspired by insights on affordances arising from a lack of resources.
   For example, in the absence of specialized tools, more general tools are
   used to accomplish similar tasks. Such absence clarifies how other tools
   could be modified to add relevant features and identifies critical
   features of the absent tool. In addition, the temporary removal of
   physical features and objects enables user interaction in ways that may
   not emerge in their presence. Affordance of absence has the potential to
   more fully specify affordances for a given object and to help overcome
   functional fixedness. For the second approach, we describe insights from
   DIYers obtained from the ``IKEA hackers{''} online community. We
   consider DIYers lead users for seeking out and exploiting product
   affordances, often transforming product functions dramatically. We also
   discuss their projects through the lens of affordance of absence. For
   the third approach, we outline our natural-language approach to
   affordance extraction, beginning with consumer product reviews provided
   for Canadian Tire, a major Canadian retailer. We describe efforts toward
   automatically identifying less common affordances, and the use of cue
   phrases to highlight insightful DIY transformations from the IKEA
   hackers community. Finally, we comment on the potential value of this
   work for product design in general.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals within a species vary in their responses to a wide range of
   stimuli, partly as a result of differences in their genetic makeup.
   Relatively little is known about the genetic and neuronal mechanisms
   contributing to diversity of behavior in natural populations. By
   studying intraspecies variation in innate avoidance behavior to thermal
   stimuli in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we uncovered genetic
   principles of how different components of a behavioral response can be
   altered in nature to generate behavioral diversity. Using a thermal
   pulse assay, we uncovered heritable variation in responses to a
   transient temperature increase. Quantitative trait locus mapping
   revealed that separate components of this response were controlled by
   distinct genomic loci. The loci we identified contributed to variation
   in components of thermal pulse avoidance behavior in an additive

   stimuli is composed of simpler behavioral components that are influenced
   by at least six distinct genetic loci. The loci that decouple components
   of the escape behavior reveal a genetic system that allows independent

Abstract = {{Purpose We present a new method for identifying the absolute location
   (i.e., relative to the optic disc) of the preferred retinal location
   (PRL) simultaneously for the two eyes of patients with central vision
   loss. For this, we used a binocular eye-tracking system that determines
   the pupillary axes of both eyes without a user calibration routine.
   Methods During monocular viewing, we measured the pupillary axis and the
   angle between it and the visual axis (angle Kappa) for 10 eyes with
   normal vision. We also determined their fovea location relative to the
   middle of the optic disc with the MP-1 microperimeter. Then, we created
   a transformation between the eye-tracking and microperimeter
   measurements. We used this transformation to predict the absolute
   location of the monocular and binocular PRLs of nine patients with
   central vision loss. The accuracy of the monocular prediction was
   evaluated with the microperimeter. The binocular PRLs were checked for
   retinal correspondence and functionality by placing them on fundus
   photographs.
   Results The transformation yielded an average error for the monocular
   measures of 0.2 (95\% confidence interval, 1.0 to -0.6 degrees)
   horizontally and 0.5 (95\% confidence interval, 1.1 to -0.1 degrees)
   vertically. The predicted binocular measures showed that the PRLs were
   generally in corresponding locations in the two eyes. One patient whose
   PRLs were not in corresponding positions complained about diplopia. For
   all patients, at least one PRL fell onto functional retina during
   binocular viewing.
   Conclusions This study shows that measurements of the location of the
   binocular PRLs relative to the pupillary axes can be transformed into
   absolute locations.}},

Abstract = {{Nanofibrillar hydrogels are an important class of biomaterials with
   applications as catalytic scaffolds, artificial extracellular matrixes,

   the results of a comprehensive study of nanofibrillar hydrogels formed
   by cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) in the presence of cations with various
   charge numbers and ionic radii. We examined sol gel transitions in
   aqueous CNC suspensions and the rheological and structural properties of
   the CNC hydrogels. At a particular CNC concentration, with increasing
   charge and cation size, the dynamic shear moduli and mesh size in the
   hydrogel increased. These effects were ascribed to a stronger propensity
   of CNCs for side-by-side association. The resulting hydrogels had an
   isotropic nanofibrillar structure. A combination of complementary
   techniques offered insight into structure-property relationships of CNC
   hydrogels, which are important for their potential applications.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveTo investigate the abortion of seizure generation using minimal
   intervention in hippocampi using two rat models of human temporal lobe
   epilepsy.
   MethodsThe recording or stimulation electrodes were implanted into both
   hippocampi (CA1 area). Using the kainic acid (chronic: experiment
   duration 24days) and the 4-aminopyridine (acute: experiment duration 2h)
   models of paroxysms in rats, a real-time feedback stimulation paradigm
   was implemented, which triggered a short periodic electrical stimulus
   (5Hz for 5s) upon detecting a seizure precursor. Our seizure precursor
   detection algorithm relied on the monitoring of the real-time phase
   synchronization analysis, and detected/anticipated electrographic
   seizures as early as a few seconds to a few minutes before the
   behavioral and electrographic seizure onset, with a very low
   false-positive rate of the detection.
   ResultsThe baseline mean seizure frequencies were 5.39 seizures per day
   (chronic) and 13.2 seizures per hour (acute). The phase synchrony
   analysis detected 88\% (434 of 494) of seizures with a mean false alarm
   of 0.67 per day (chronic) and 83\% (86 of 104) of seizures with a mean
   false alarm of 0.47 per hour (acute). The feedback stimulation reduced
   the seizure frequencies to 0.41 seizures per day (chronic) and 2.4
   seizures per hour (acute). Overall, the feedback stimulation paradigm
   reduced seizure frequency by a minimum of 80\% to a maximum of 100\% in
   10 rats, with 83\% of the animals rendered seizure-free.
   SignificanceThis approach represents a simple and efficient manner for
   stopping seizure development. Because of the short on-demand stimuli,
   few or no associated side effects are expected in clinical application
   in patients with epilepsy. Abnormal synchrony patterns are common
   features in epilepsy and other neurologic and psychiatric syndromes;
   therefore, this type of feedback stimulation paradigm could be a novel
   therapeutic modality for use in various neurologic and psychiatric
   disorders.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we investigate the interfacial mechanical characteristics
   of carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforced epoxy composite using molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations. The MD simulations were carried out by
   developing two pull-out models; namely, the displacement-load model and
   the velocity-load model. The second-generation force field polymer
   consistent force field (PCFF) - is used in the current MD simulations.
   The effects of various parameters, such as epoxy density, length and
   diameter of a CNT, the CNT-epoxy interfacial thickness, LJ cut-off
   distance and capping conditions of a CNT on the interfacial mechanical
   characteristics have also been investigated and discussed. The results
   from the present pull-out model, which are validated with earlier
   studies, reveal that (i) the interfacial shear strength (ISS) of the
   CNT-reinforced epoxy composite is improved with the increase in the
   epoxy density, (ii) the ISS of the CNT-reinforced epoxy composite
   decreases with the increase in the values of length and diameter of a
   CNT, and the thickness of CNT-epoxy matrix interface, (iii) the LJ
   cut-off distance has marginal effect on the ISS and the pull-out force
   of CNT, and (iv) incorporation of an end cap in the simulations results
   high initial pull-out peaks, which well correlate with the experimental
   findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Coupled shape oscillations and translational motion of an incompressible
   gas bubble in a vibrating liquid container is studied numerically. The
   bubble oscillation characteristics are mapped based on the bubble Bond
   number (Bo) and the ratio of the vibration amplitude of the container to
   the bubble diameter (A/D). At small Bo and A/D, the bubble oscillation
   is found to be linear with small amplitudes, and at large Bo and A/D, it
   is nonlinear and chaotic. This chaotic bubble oscillation is similar to
   those observed in two coupled nonlinear systems, here being the gas
   inside the bubble and its surrounding liquid. Further increases in the
   forcing, results in the bubble breakup due to large liquid inertia. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{24}},

Pages = {{1173-1184}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A three-degrees-of-freedom microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)
   electrostatic actuator was developed, fabricated, and tested. The
   actuator utilizes a piston-tube configuration that enables the use of
   electrodes with a wide area. Therefore, a large output force can be
   generated. The actuator also utilizes a flexure mechanism in which the
   in-plane (x-y) stiffness is high compared with the out-of-plane (z-axis)
   stiffness. This flexure mechanism enables a large translation stroke
   along the z-axis before experiencing lateral pull-in instability. A
   prototype of the actuator was able to achieve a pure translation
   (piston-style motion) of 28 mu m at 80 V and an angle of rotation of
   0.78 degrees at 70 V. A mass of 1 mg was translated 24 mu m at 80 V,
   indicating the ability of the actuator to provide high output force. The
   actuator was fabricated using the Micralyne MicraGEM-Si MEMS fabrication
   process, in which the pistons and tubes are fabricated in the device
   layers of two bonded Silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers. The misalignment
   between the pistons and the tubes using this process was similar to
   0.005 of the gap between adjacent pistons and tubes. This amount of
   misalignment leads to a negligible lateral instability effect.

Abstract = {{Tetrahydrofuran, added to the oil-in-water emulsions formed by the
   aqueous processing of yellow mustard flour, produced oil/water/THF
   miscellas containing 1-2 \% water. The high water content prevented the
   direct conversion of the system to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME)
   through a single-phase base-catalyzed transmethylation process.
   Dehydration of these miscellas by adsorption on 4A molecular sieves at
   room temperature using either batch or continuous fixed-bed systems
   successfully reduced the water content to the quality standards needed
   for biodiesel feedstock (0.3 \%). Equilibrium adsorption studies for the
   uptake of water from oil/THF/water miscella phases at room temperature
   allowed quantitative comparison of the water adsorption capacity based
   on the oil and THF concentrations of the miscellas. Batch contact was
   used to investigate the dominant parameters affecting the uptake of
   water including miscella composition, adsorbent dose and contact time.
   The adsorption of the water was strongly dependent on adsorbent dose and
   miscella oil concentrations. The regeneration of molecular sieves by
   heating under nitrogen at reduced pressure for 6 h at 275 A degrees C
   resulted in incomplete desorption of miscella components. The adsorption
   breakthrough curves in terms of flow rates, initial water and oil
   miscella concentrations were determined. The dehydrated miscella phases
   were reacted with methanol in a single-phase base-catalyzed
   transmethylation process with high yields (99.3 wt\%) to FAME. The
   resulting FAME met the ASTM international standard in terms of total
   glycerol content and acid number.}},

Abstract = {{The inability to voluntarily control the trunk musculature is a major
   problem following spinal cord injury as it can compromise functional
   independence and produce unwanted secondary complications. Recent
   developments suggest that neuroprostheses utilizing functional
   electrical stimulation (FES) may be able to facilitate or restore trunk
   control during sitting, standing, and other tasks involving postural
   control. In spite of these efforts, no study to date has used
   low-intensity FES to increase multidirectional trunk stiffness and
   damping in an attempt to bolster stability while minimizing muscle
   fatigue. Therefore, we set out to investigate how multidirectional trunk
   stiffness changes in response to low-intensity FES of a few selected
   trunk muscles. Fifteen healthy participants sitting naturally were
   randomly perturbed in eight horizontal directions. Trunk stiffness and
   damping during natural and FES-supported sitting conditions were
   quantified using force and trunk kinematics in combination with two
   models of a mass-spring-damper system. Our results indicate that
   low-intensity FES can increase trunk stiffness in healthy individuals,
   and this specifically for directions associated with the stimulated
   muscles. In contrast, trunk damping was not found to be altered during
   FES. The presented results suggest that low-intensity FES is a simple
   and effective method for increasing trunk stiffness on demand. (C) 2015

Title = {{The value of nodal information in predicting lung cancer relapse using

Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{4727-4733}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: There is evidence that computed tomography (CT) and positron
   emission tomography (PET) imaging metrics are prognostic and predictive
   in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment outcomes. However, few
   studies have explored the use of standardized uptake value (SUV)-based
   image features of nodal regions as predictive features. The authors
   investigated and compared the use of tumor and node image features
   extracted from the radiotherapy target volumes to predict relapse in a
   cohort of NSCLC patients undergoing chemoradiation treatment.
   Methods: A prospective cohort of 25 patients with locally advanced NSCLC
   underwent 4DPET/4DCT imaging for radiation planning. Thirty-seven image
   features were derived from the CT-defined volumes and SUVs of the PET
   image from both the tumor and nodal target regions. The machine learning
   methods of logistic regression and repeated stratified five-fold
   cross-validation (CV) were used to predict local and overall relapses in
   2 yr. The authors used well-known feature selection methods (Spearman's
   rank correlation, recursive feature elimination) within each fold of CV.
   Classifiers were ranked on their Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC)
   after CV. Area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity values are
   also presented.
   Results: For predicting local relapse, the best classifier found had a
   mean MCC of 0.07 and was composed of eight tumor features. For
   predicting overall relapse, the best classifier found had a mean MCC of
   0.29 and was composed of a single feature: the volume greater than 0.5
   times the maximum SUV (N).
   Conclusions: The best classifier for predicting local relapse had only
   tumor features. In contrast, the best classifier for predicting overall
   relapse included a node feature. Overall, the methods showed that nodes
   add value in predicting overall relapse but not local relapse. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Purpose: Functional image guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy
   has the potential to improve cancer treatment quality by basing
   treatment parameters such as heterogeneous dose distributions
   information derived from imaging. However, such heterogeneous dose
   distributions are subject to imaging uncertainty. In this paper, the
   authors develop a robust optimization model to design plans that are
   desensitized to imaging uncertainty.
   Methods: Starting from the pretreatment fluorodeoxyglucose-positron
   emission tomography scans, the authors use the raw voxel standard uptake
   values (SUVs) as input into a series of intermediate functions to
   transform the SUV into a desired dose. The calculated desired doses were
   used as an input into a robust optimization model to generate beamlet
   intensities. For each voxel, the authors assume that the true SUV cannot
   be observed but instead resides in an interval centered on the nominal
   (i.e., observed) SUV. Then the authors evaluated the nominal and robust
   solutions through a simulation study. The simulation considered the
   effect of the true SUV being different from the nominal SUV on the
   quality of the treatment plan. Treatment plans were compared on the
   metrics of objective function value and tumor control probability (TCP).
   Results: Computational results demonstrate the potential for
   improvements in tumor control probability and deviation from the desired
   dose distribution compared to a nonrobust model while maintaining
   acceptable tissue dose.
   Conclusions: Robust optimization can help design treatment plans that
   are more stable in the presence of image value uncertainties. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Knowing the sequence specificities of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins is
   essential for developing models of the regulatory processes in
   biological systems and for identifying causal disease variants. Here we
   show that sequence specificities can be ascertained from experimental
   data with `deep learning' techniques, which offer a scalable, flexible
   and unified computational approach for pattern discovery. Using a
   diverse array of experimental data and evaluation metrics, we find that
   deep learning outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, even when
   training on in vitro data and testing on in vivo data. We call this
   approach DeepBind and have built a stand-alone software tool that is
   fully automatic and handles millions of sequences per experiment.
   Specificities determined by DeepBind are readily visualized as a
   weighted ensemble of position weight matrices or as a `mutation map'
   that indicates how variations affect binding within a specific sequence.}},

Title = {{Assessment of spatial transferability of an activity-based model, TASHA}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{200-213}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Spatial transferability has been recognized as a useful validation test
   for travel demand models. To date, however, transferability of
   activity-based models has not been frequently assessed. This paper
   assesses the spatial transferability of an activity-based model, TASHA
   (Travel Activity Scheduler for Household Agents), which has been
   developed for the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada. TASHA has been
   transferred to the context of the Island of Montreal, Canada using the
   2003 Origin-Destination (O-D) travel survey and the 2001 Canadian
   Census. It generates daily schedules of activities (individual and
   joint) for each individual in this region. The modelled activity
   attributes (frequency, start time, duration and distance) from TASHA and
   observed attributes from the 2003 O-D travel survey are compared for
   five different activities (i.e. work, school, shopping, other, and
   return to home). At the aggregate level, TASHA provides quite reasonable
   outcomes (in some cases - better results than for the Toronto Area) for
   all four attributes for work, school and return to home activities with
   few exceptions (for instance, school start time). The model outcomes are
   also promising for shopping frequency and start times; however, TASHA
   provides larger differences for average shopping durations and
   distances. Only the forecasts for all four attributes for the `other'
   activity type differ greatly with the observed attributes for the
   Montreal Island. These large differences most likely indicate the
   differences in behaviour between the Montreal Island and the Toronto
   Area. In general, we conclude that re-estimation of model parameters and
   the use of local activity attribute distributions (frequency, start time
   and duration) is a desirable step in the transfer of the TASHA model
   from one context to another. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims at investigating the over-prediction of public transit
   ridership by traditional mode choice models estimated using revealed
   preference data. Five different types of models are estimated and
   analysed, namely a traditional Revealed Preference (RP) data-based mode
   choice model, a hybrid mode choice model with a latent variable, a
   Stated Preference (SP) data-based mode switching model, a joint RP/SP
   mode switching model, and a hybrid mode switching model with a latent
   variable. A comparison of the RP data-based mode choice model with the
   mode choice models including a latent variable showed that the inclusion
   of behavioural factors (especially habit formation) significantly
   improved the models. The SP data-based mode switching models elucidated
   the reasons why traditional models tend to over-predict transit
   ridership by revealing the role played by different transit
   level-of-service attributes and their relative importance to mode
   switching decisions. The results showed that traditional attributes
   (e.g. travel cost and time) are of lower importance to mode switching
   behaviour than behavioural factors (e.g. habit formation towards car
   driving) and other transit service design attributes (e.g. crowding
   level, number of transfers, and schedule delays). The findings of this
   study provide general guidelines for developing a variety of transit
   ridership forecasting models depending on the availability of data and
   the experience of the planner. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Thermoelectric effect is defined as the revisable translation between
   thermal and electrical energy. In this paper, we investigate the
   properties of p-type poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) based polymer
   composite foams that can be used in next generation energy harvesting
   applications. The composites were created using the continuous melt
   blending method. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and graphene
   nano-platelets (GNPs) were used as secondary phases to strengthen the
   electrical conductivity of the composites. Foam structures were later
   generated using the super-critical carbon dioxide saturation method. We
   study the material properties between solid and foam samples; the
   results indicate a dramatic increase in overall thermoelectric
   properties for GNP foamed samples. We also report at least an order
   decrease in thermal conductivity, which is in favor of the
   thermoelectric effect. An unexpected drop in electrical conductivity was
   observed after the foaming process and can be explained by the large
   volumetric expansion of the foam. Finally, we report the Seebeck

Abstract = {{Newer approaches to characterizing hippocampal morphology can provide
   novel insights regarding cognitive function across the lifespan. We
   comprehensively assessed the relationships among age, hippocampal
   morphology, and hippocampal-dependent cognitive function in 137 healthy
   individuals across the adult lifespan (18-86 years of age). They
   underwent MRI, cognitive assessments and genotyping for Apolipoprotein E
   status. We measured hippocampal subfield volumes using a new multiatlas
   segmentation tool (MAGeT-Brain) and assessed vertex-wise (inward and
   outward displacements) and global surface-based descriptions of
   hippocampus morphology. We examined the effects of age on hippocampal
   morphology, as well as the relationship among age, hippocampal
   morphology, and episodic and working memory performance. Age and volume
   were modestly correlated across hippocampal subfields. Significant
   patterns of inward and outward displacement in hippocampal head and tail
   were associated with age. The first principal shape component of the
   left hippocampus, characterized by a lengthening of the antero-posterior
   axis was prominently associated with working memory performance across
   the adult lifespan. In contrast, no significant relationships were found
   among subfield volumes and cognitive performance. Our findings
   demonstrate that hippocampal shape plays a unique and important role in
   hippocampal-dependent cognitive aging across the adult lifespan,
   meriting consideration as a biomarker in strategies targeting the delay
   of cognitive aging. Hum Brain Mapp 36:3020-3037, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{We study low-delay erasure correction codes in a real-time streaming
   setup. The encoder observes a stream of source packets and outputs the
   channel packets in a causal fashion, which are broadcast to two
   receivers over burst-erasure channels. Each receiver must decode the
   source packets sequentially with a deadline of T-i, while its channel
   can introduce an erasure burst of maximum length B-i, where i is an
   element of \{1, 2\} and w.l.o.g. B-2 > B-1. We study the associated
   capacity as a function of the burst lengths and decoding deadlines. We
   observe that the operation of the system can be divided into two main
   regimes. The so-called large-delay regime corresponds to the case when
   either T-1 >= B-2 or T-2 >= B-1 + B-2. We show that for these
   parameters, the optimal code is obtained through simple modifications of
   previously proposed single-user codes by Martinian et al. and the
   diversity embedded streaming codes proposed by Badr et al. When both T-1
   < B-2 and T-2 < B-1 + B-2, the system is said to be in the low-delay
   regime. We propose a new code construction and establish its optimality
   when T-2 >= T-1 + B-1. In the case when T-2 < T-1 + B-1, we establish
   upper and lower bounds on the capacity and characterize the exact
   capacity when either T-1 = B-1 or T-2 = B-2. Our upper bounds in the
   low-delay regime are based on novel information theoretic arguments that
   capture the tension between the decoding constraints at the two
   receivers.}},

Title = {{Design, Testing, and Detailed Component Modeling of a High-Capacity
   Self-Centering Energy-Dissipative Brace}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{The self-centering energy-dissipative (SCED) brace is an innovative
   cross brace for buildings that provides a nonlinear response with good
   energy dissipation and postyield stiffness while minimizing residual
   drift after an earthquake. This provides a high level of seismic
   performance by allowing structures to remain operational even after
   major seismic events. Recently, the SCED brace has been improved through
   the design and experimental evaluation of a high-capacity SCED (HC-SCED)
   that has an axial capacity similar to some of the largest available
   conventional cross braces for buildings. This prototype HC-SCED
   satisfied testing protocols for buckling-restrained braces and exhibited
   full self-centering behavior during cycles up to 1.5\% drift. To
   characterize the hysteretic response of the brace in detail, a new
   analytical approach is developed. This new approach is necessary because
   simplified stiffness estimates do not provide good predictions of the
   low-amplitude displacement response and initial effective stiffness that
   was measured in the full-scale experiments. The proposed analytical
   approach includes the effects of fabrication tolerances, which have been
   identified as the main reason for incorrect low-amplitude displacement
   predictions that result from the simplified stiffness estimates. Using
   the results from the HC-SCED tests, the new analytical approach provided
   good estimates of the initial stiffness of the braces and also was able
   to predict the behavior of the brace well under a larger fabrication
   tolerance scenario. These improved predictions may be used to improve
   the characterization of the effective hysteretic behavior of actual SCED
   braces for use in nonlinear time history analyses. (C) 2014 American

Title = {{Engineering of hyaline cartilage with a calcified zone using bone marrow
   stromal cells}},
Journal = {{OSTEOARTHRITIS AND CARTILAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1307-1315}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective: In healthy joints, a zone of calcified cartilage (ZCC)
   provides the mechanical integration between articular cartilage and
   subchondral bone. Recapitulation of this architectural feature should
   serve to resist the constant shear force from the movement of the joint
   and prevent the delamination of tissue-engineered cartilage. Previous
   approaches to create the ZCC at the cartilage-substrate interface have
   relied on strategic use of exogenous scaffolds and adhesives, which are
   susceptible to failure by degradation and wear. In contrast, we report a
   successful scaffold-free engineering of ZCC to integrate
   tissue-engineered cartilage and a porous biodegradable bone substitute,
   using sheep bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) as the cell source for
   both cartilaginous zones.
   Design: BMSCs were predifferentiated to chondrocytes, harvested and then
   grown on a porous calcium polyphosphate substrate in the presence of
   triiodothyronine (T3). T3 was withdrawn, and additional
   predifferentiated chondrocytes were placed on top of the construct and
   grown for 21 days.
   Results: This protocol yielded two distinct zones: hyaline cartilage
   that accumulated proteoglycans and collagen type II, and calcified
   cartilage adjacent to the substrate that additionally accumulated
   mineral and collagen type X. Constructs with the calcified interface
   hadcomparable compressive strength to native sheep osteochondral tissue
   and higher interfacial shear strength compared to control without a
   calcified zone.
   Conclusion: This protocol improves on the existing scaffold-free
   approaches to cartilage tissue engineering by incorporating a calcified
   zone. Since this protocol employs no xenogeneic material, it will be
   appropriate for use in preclinical large-animal studies. (C) 2015

Title = {{Helical coil electrode radiofrequency ablation designed for application
   in osteolytic vertebral tumors-initial evaluation in a porcine model}},
Journal = {{SPINE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{1832-1840}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is emerging as a
   complementary treatment for vertebral metastases. Traditional RFA
   induces frictional heating leading to local tissue necrosis but often
   yields small, incomplete, and inhomogeneous zones of ablation in bone.
   We have developed a new bone-specific RFA electrode that uses a
   nontraditional frequency (27.12 MHz) and geometry (helical), exploiting
   a magnetic field and an electric field to generate larger and more
   comprehensive treatment zones.
   PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and
   safety of the Bone Coil RFA electrode in the spine.
   STUDY DESIGN: This is a preclinical in vivo study based on basic
   science.
   METHODS: Under institutional approval, six healthy Yorkshire pigs
   received a sham and an RF treatment in two adjacent cervical vertebrae.
   To deploy the Bone Coil RFA device in dense porcine vertebrae, a
   surgical approach was required; an irrigated coring drill bit created a
   cylindrical path in the vertebral bodies through which the RFA
   electrodes were placed. The electronic circuit was completed by four
   grounding pads. Treatment was delivered for 10 minutes at 20W (n=1), 25W
   (n=1), and 30W (n=4). To monitor the thermal rise and for safety,
   fiber-optic probes recorded temperatures in the center of each coil and
   near the spinal foramen. After the procedure, animals were monitored for
   2 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was completed immediately
   after treatment and at 14 days. Magnetic resonance image segmentation
   and histology were used to evaluate the ablation volume.
   RESULTS: Comprehensive treatment of the porcine vertebrae was
   demonstrated by temperature monitoring, MRI, and histology. Large zones
   of RF ablation were obtained (RF: 3.72 +/- 0.73 cm(3) vs. sham: 1.98 +/-
   0.16 cm(3), p<.05), confined within the vertebral body. Internal
   temperatures were elevated with RF (66.1 degrees C-102.9 degrees C),
   without temperature rise outside of the vertebrae (38.2 inverted
   perpendicular C61.5 degrees C). Mobility, neurological responses, and
   behavior were normal, consistent with pre-procedural examination.
   Magnetic resonance imaging best visualized ablation at Day 14. Histology
   revealed comprehensive homogeneous coagulative necrosis with little
   peripheral sign of repair.
   CONCLUSIONS: The Bone Coil RFA device created large intravertebral
   ablation volumes with no neurologic sequelae. Radiofrequency thermal
   ablation (clearly distinguished from the much smaller effects arising
   from core drilling) corresponded to the homogeneous necrosis visible on
   histology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) members represents a
   key issue in the seismic performance assessment of structures. Many
   structures constructed in the 1980s or earlier were designed based on
   force limits; thus they often exhibit brittle failure modes, strength
   and stiffness degradation, and severe pinching effects. Field surveys
   and experimental evidence have demonstrated that such inelastic
   responses affect the global behavior of RC structural systems. Efforts
   have been made to consider the degrading stiffness and strength in the
   simplified nonlinear static procedures commonly adopted by
   practitioners. This paper investigates the accuracy of such procedures
   for the seismic performance assessment of RC structural systems. Refined
   finite element models of a shear critical bridge bent and a
   flexure-critical bridge pier are used as reference models. The numerical
   models are validated against experimental results and used to evaluate
   the inelastic dynamic response of the structures subjected to earthquake
   ground motions with increasing amplitude. The maximum response from the
   refined numerical models is compared against the results from the
   simplified static procedures, namely modified capacity spectrum method
   and coefficient method in FEMA-440. The accuracy of the static
   procedures in estimating the displacement demand of a flexure-critical
   system and shear-critical system is discussed in detail. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we extend the earlier studies to investigate the effects
   of various parameters which govern the symmetric snap-through buckling
   of an initially curved microbeam subject to an electrostatic force. The
   governing formulations are developed using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.
   The mid-plane stretching experienced during the snap-through buckling is
   considered using von Karman nonlinear strain, and the nonzero strain
   component is determined and solved using Galerkin decomposition
   approach. The studied parameters include: beam fixation type
   (double-clamped and simply-supported), arch shape, residual axial force,
   and uniform temperature variation. The results of our work reveal the
   significant effects of the type of the beam fixation, the residual
   force, and the temperature variation on the criterion for the symmetric
   snap-through buckling of microbeams, while the effect of the arch shape
   is somewhat insignificant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years the US-based National Academy of Engineering and
   Engineers Canada have urged engineering educators to supplement
   technical coursework with multiple domains of professional skills
   development. One such domain is that of engineering leadership. While
   leadership education is beginning to be infused into some undergraduate
   engineering programs, it has not yet gained traction as a legitimate
   field of study. The legitimacy of the field depends on engineers
   recognizing themselves as members of a leadership profession. Our paper
   facilitates this process of recognition by grounding leadership theory
   in the professional experiences of engineers employed by four Canadian
   engineering-intensive firms. Our constant comparative analysis of
   qualitative data collected through nine focus groups and seven
   interviews suggests that engineers are largely resistant to dominant
   leadership paradigms drawn from other disciplines, but that they do, in
   fact lead in ways that blend key aspects of their identities with
   professionally recognized forms of influence. Our compound model of
   engineering leadership has practical and theoretical implications for
   engineers, leadership theorists and engineering educators.}},

   modern medical practice to improve the precision of clinical
   decision-making. This potential improvement, however, has not been
   transferred to the practice of organ assessment and transplantation
   because previously developed gene-profiling techniques require an
   extended period of time to perform, making them unsuitable in the
   time-sensitive organ assessment process. We sought to develop a novel
   class of chip-based sensors that would enable rapid analysis of tissue
   levels of preimplantation mRNA markers that correlate with the
   development of primary graft dysfunction (PGD) in recipients after
   transplant. Using fractal circuit sensors (FraCS), three-dimensional
   metal structures with large surface areas, we were able to rapidly (<20
   min) and reproducibly quantify small differences in the expression of
   interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and ATP11B mRNA in donor lung biopsies. A
   proof-of-concept study using 52 human donor lungs was performed to
   develop a model that was used to predict, with excellent sensitivity
   (74\%) and specificity (91\%), the incidence of PGD for a donor lung.
   Thus, the FraCS-based approach delivers a key predictive value test that
   could be applied to enhance transplant patient outcomes. This work
   provides an important step toward bringing rapid diagnostic mRNA
   profiling to clinical application in lung transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering mature tissues requires a guided assembly of cells into
   organized three-dimensional (3D) structures with multiple cell types.
   Guidance is usually achieved by microtopographical scaffold cues or by
   cell-gel compaction. The assembly of individual units into functional 3D
   tissues is often time-consuming, relying on cell ingrowth and matrix
   remodeling, whereas disassembly requires an invasive method that
   includes either matrix dissolution or mechanical cutting. We invented
   Tissue-Velcro, a bio-scaffold with a microfabricated hook and loop
   system. The assembly of Tissue-Velcro preserved the guided cell
   alignment realized by the topographical features in the 2D scaffold mesh
   and allowed for the instant establishment of coculture conditions by
   spatially defined stacking of cardiac cell layers or through endothelial
   cell coating. The assembled cardiac 3D tissue constructs were
   immediately functional as measured by their ability to contract in
   response to electrical field stimulation. Facile, on-demand tissue
   disassembly was demonstrated while preserving the structure, physical
   integrity, and beating function of individual layers.}},

Abstract = {{Many symptoms of nerve damage arise from ectopic spiking caused by
   hyperexcitability. Ectopic spiking can originate at the site of axonal
   damage and elsewhere within affected neurons. This raises the question
   of whether localized damage elicits cell-wide changes in excitability
   and/or if localized changes in excitability can drive abnormal spiking
   at remote locations. Computer modeling revealed an example of the latter
   involving afterdischarge (AD)-stimulus-evoked spiking that outlasts
   stimulation. We found that AD originating in a hyperexcitable region of
   axon could shift to the soma where it was maintained. This repositioning
   of ectopic spike initiation was independent of distance between the two
   sites but relied on the rate and number of ectopic spikes originating
   from the first site. Nonlinear dynamical analysis of a reduced model
   demonstrated that properties which rendered the axonal site prone to
   initiating AD discouraged it from maintaining AD, whereas the soma had
   the inverse properties thus enabling the two sites to interact
   cooperatively. A first phase of AD originating in the axon could, by
   providing sufficient drive to trigger somatic AD, give way to a second
   phase of AD originating in the soma such that spiking continued when
   axonal AD failed. Ectopic spikes originating from the soma during phase
   2 AD propagated successfully through the defunct site of axonal spike
   initiation. This novel mechanism whereby ectopic spiking at one site
   facilitates ectopic spiking at another site is likely to contribute to
   the chronification of hyperexcitability in conditions such as
   neuropathic pain.}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the dynamic behavior of complex structural
   systems experimental testing is indispensable and real-time
   pseudodynamic (PSD) and real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) are versatile
   testing methods to address this need. Accurate control of hydraulic
   actuators is essential for the accuracy and stability of these methods.
   This paper introduces a nonlinear state-space controller to control
   hydraulic actuators under displacement control, specifically for
   real-time testing applications. The proposed control design process uses
   the nonlinear state-space model of the system, and utilizes state
   feedback linearization through a transformation of the state variables.
   As such, it can efficiently handle the nonlinearities associated with
   the servo-hydraulic system and the test structure. Comparisons of
   numerical simulation results for linear state-space and nonlinear
   state-space controllers are provided. The improved tracking performance
   of the proposed controller will contribute to more accurate real-time
   test results, which in turn will enable a more accurate assessment of
   dynamic characteristics of complex structural systems. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{A kinematically admissible mechanism is presented for the progressive
   collapse of a foam-filled and unfilled circular frustum. The mechanism
   uses a three-limb model of collapse for the frustum shell, taking into
   account the plastic strain and circumferential strain energy dissipation
   during collapse. For the foam-filled case, the energy dissipation due to
   the plastic collapse Of the foam and the interaction effects between it
   and outer frustum shell were considered. To account for the interaction
   effects, a pressure equivalent to the stress plateau of the foam was
   applied only to the inward bending proportion of the frustum. This is
   the result of our extensive experimental studies, which shows that
   Poisson's effects are negligible and that there will be no transverse
   strains resulting from the axial collapse of the frustum. We have
   further conducted analysis of empty frustum. A comparative analysis for
   the developed mechanism and previously conducted experimental studies
   showed good agreement between the two. Lastly, a parametric study of the
   mechanism correctly predicts that the magnitude of the crushing load
   depends on the length and proportion of the inward folds. Our
   upper-bound model gives a closed form solution for the collapse of
   foam-filled and unfilled frusta that can be used for crash energy
   management in automobiles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Counter-flow moving bed heat exchangers provide thermal and economic
   advantages over their co-current counterparts. Recently, Laplace
   transforms were used to develop an analytical solution for the set of

   presented, revealing an important dependency on the capacity ratio. The
   steady-state energy equations for a plate system are formulated and
   nondimensionalized, and an analytical solution is presented. Temperature
   functions, and the associated transcendental equations, for the solids
   and fluid are presented. The analytical expressions depend on the
   capacity ratio due to its influence on the location and multiplicity of
   roots in the Laplace domain solution. Limiting cases are explored and
   contrasted with expressions in the literature. A graphical analysis
   further depicts some of the representative behaviors of the solution.

Abstract = {{Parallel kinematic mechanisms (PKMs) provide high stiffness and compact
   structures that are suitable for a large number of applications,
   including 5-axis milling. This paper presents a new pentapod-based PKM
   with an additional redundant degree-of-freedom (DOF) capable of reaching
   platform tilt angles of at least 90 deg over a large workspace. The
   proposed new PKM has a 6DOF 4 x SPRR + 1 x PSPR architecture. It is
   compared herein to Metrom (R) VR Pentapod as well as to several other
   pertinent PKMs in terms of workspace and dynamic stiffness. It is shown
   that the proposed mechanism can yield a tangibly larger workspace
   volume, when compared to those PKMs, while maintaining its high
   stiffness characteristics.}},

Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},

Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{348-358}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Helping someone carry a table is fairly easy; however, our understanding
   of such joint motor actions is still poorly understood. We studied how
   pairs of human subjects (referred to as dyads) collaborate physically to
   attenuate external mechanical perturbations during a target tracking
   task. Subjects tracked a target moving in a slow and predictable way
   using wrist flexion/extension movements, with and without destabilizing
   torque perturbations. Dyad strategies were classified using interaction
   torques and muscular activity. During unperturbed interactions
   (baseline), the dyads tended to stabilize on a particular strategy. The
   baseline strategy was not the same in all dyads, suggesting that the
   solution to the task was not global but specific to each particular
   dyad. After several trials of unperturbed interactions, we introduced
   mechanical vibrations and analyzed the adaptation process. Dyads showed
   a tendency to counteract the external disturbances by first increasing
   co-contraction within each subject (independent co-contraction), and
   then raising the amount of opposing interaction torques (dyadic
   co-contraction) with increased perturbation amplitude. The introduction
   of perturbations impelled dyads to abandon their unperturbed baseline
   strategy and adopt a more common strategy across dyads, suggesting
   attractor solutions. Our results establish a framework for future
   human-human interaction studies, and have implications in human motor
   control as well as human-robot and robot-robot interactions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper develops a tool for estimating energy-related CO2 emissions
   from the world's cities based on regression models. The models are

   lead to significant increase in energy emissions (upto 346\% in
   electricity \& 428\% in transportation at 2\% density decline by 2050).
   Among the IPCC climate scenarios tested, A1B is the most effective in
   reducing growth of emissions (upto 12\% in electricity \& 35\% in
   heating). The tool can further be improved by including more data in the

Abstract = {{Novel oil-filled microcapsules were prepared by introducing a phase
   separation method using ethyl cellulose as a shell-forming containing
   rapeseed oil. The prepared oil-filled microcapsules were evaluated by
   optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and particle size
   analysis. Results showed that spherical microcapsules with a diameter of
   10 to 45 pm and a rough porous shell were obtained. Carboxylated
   styrene/butadiene copolymer latex films containing various levels of
   these microcapsules were subjected to various levels of pre-elongation
   and their tensile properties were examined. The addition of oil-filled
   microcapsules resulted in a significant improvement in the modulus,
   strain-to-break, and toughness of the films. The self-healing mechanism
   of latex films was examined through the colorimetric measurements of the
   release of dye-containing following the pre-elongation of the samples.
   These measurements confirmed that pre-elongation of samples resulted in
   the release of oil within the latex films, hence plasticizing the
   surrounding polymeric network and partly restoring the mechanical
   properties of the pre-elongated films. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study breast cancer screening policies using computer
   simulation. We developed a multi-state Markov model for breast cancer
   progression, considering both the screening and treatment stages of
   breast cancer. The parameters of our model were estimated through data
   from the Canadian National Breast Cancer Screening Study as well as data
   in the relevant literature. Using computer simulation, we evaluated
   various screening policies to study the impact of mammography screening
   for age-based subpopulations in Canada. We also performed sensitivity
   analysis to examine the impact of certain parameters on number of deaths
   and total costs. The analysis comparing screening policies reveals that
   a policy in which women belonging to the 40-49 age group are not
   screened, whereas those belonging to the 50-59 and 60-69 age groups are
   screened once every 5 years, outperforms others with respect to cost per
   life saved. Our analysis also indicates that increasing the screening
   frequencies for the 50-59 and 60-69 age groups decrease mortality, and
   that the average number of deaths generally decreases with an increase
   in screening frequency. We found that screening annually for all age
   groups is associated with the highest costs per life saved. Our analysis
   thus reveals that cost per life saved increases with an increase in
   screening frequency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{136-145}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Human occupants have a profound influence on indoor environments,
   although there is limited information on means to cost-effectively
   assess occupant metrics in all types of buildings. Multiple measures of
   occupancy (i.e., the number of occupants and the duration of their
   presence) and occupant activity (i.e., the number of occupant movements
   through room doorways) were investigated in ten single-patient rooms in
   a new hospital in Chicago, Illinois as part of the Hospital Microbiome
   Project, with the overarching goal of determining occupant
   characteristics to inform an investigation of interactions between
   humans and microbial communities. Four relatively low-cost, non-invasive
   methods to estimate time-resolved occupancy and occupant activity were
   developed using data from (1) CO2 concentration sensors installed in
   patient rooms and the supply air streams serving each room and (2)
   non-directional doorway beam-break sensors installed at each patient
   room doorway. A method that utilized data from both sensors produced the
   most accurate estimates and was used to characterize time-varying
   occupancy and occupant activity. Daily occupancy varied among rooms,
   with median values ranging from 0 to 3 persons per hour. Occupant
   activity exhibited less variation on average (approximately 8 doorway
   movements per hour), but reached high levels on certain days for some
   patient rooms. No consistent relationship was observed between estimated
   occupancy and occupant activity, indicating that one metric cannot be
   inferred from the other. This study shows that this dual-sensor
   methodology provides a relatively inexpensive, non-invasive, accurate
   approach to estimate occupancy and occupant activity in an environment
   with rigorous privacy and security limitations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   revealed by cryo-TEM}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{42-49}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The structure of the mineralized collagen fibril, which is the basic
   building block of mineralized connective tissues, is critical to its
   function. We use cryo-TEM to study collagen structure at a well-defined
   hard-soft tissue interface, across which collagen fibrils are
   continuous, in order to evaluate changes to collagen upon
   mineralization. To establish a basis for the analysis of collagen
   banding, we compared cryo-TEM images of rat-tail tendon collagen to a
   model based on the X-ray structure. While there is close correspondence
   of periodicity, differences in band intensity indicate fibril regions
   with high density but lacking order, providing new insight into collagen
   fibrillar structure. Across a mineralized interface, we show that
   mineralization results in an axial contraction of the fibril,
   concomitant with lateral expansion, and that this contraction occurs
   only in the more flexible gap region of the fibril. Nevertheless, the
   major features of the banding pattern are not significantly changed,
   indicating that the axial arrangement of molecules remains largely
   intact These results suggest a mechanism by which collagen fibrils are
   able to accommodate large amounts of mineral without significant
   disruption of their molecular packing, leading to synergy of mechanical
   properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in the development of miniaturized nozzles have made
   possible the use of abrasive waterjets to perform controlled-depth
   micro-milling. Haghbin et al. (2015) discussed the effects of the
   surrounding fluid in the micro-machining of shallow channels in 316L
   stainless steel and 6061-T6 aluminum using a prototype nozzle having an
   orifice diameter of 127 pm and a 254 pm mixing tube diameter. This paper
   uses those results to develop a new surface evolution model that
   predicts the size and shape of relatively deep micro-channels resulting
   from unsubmerged and submerged abrasive water jet micro-machining
   (AWJM). For both unsubmerged and submerged AWN, and for both materials,
   the erosive efficacy distribution changed suddenly after the initial
   formation of the channel. The initially wide distribution was due to
   backflow of the abrasive slurry along the channel walls, which did not
   occur once the channel was formed and most of the flow was directed
   along the channel length. A novel approach in which two different
   erosive efficacy expressions are sequentially used in a surface
   evolution equation is presented and shown to accurately predict the
   evolving surface topography for micro-channels up to aspect ratios of 3.

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{386-397}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The free and forced vibration characteristics of bimodular cross-ply
   laminated clamped clamped circular cylindrical shells are studied using
   Bert's and a recently proposed model considering first order shear
   deformation theory. The free vibration frequencies in positive and
   negative half cycles are found to be same for all asymmetric modes and
   for axisymmetric modes with even number of axial half waves, and
   different for axisymmetric modes with odd number of axial half waves.
   However, the negative half cycle amplitude is significantly greater than
   the positive half cycle amplitude due to the local stiffness of
   bimodular cylindrical shells being different for positive and negative
   half cycles even though the natural frequencies are same for positive
   and negative half cycles of asymmetric vibrations. The relative
   difference of positive and negative half cycle frequencies is very less
   for single layer orthotropic shells, and it is significant for cross-ply
   shells for axisymmetric mode of vibration. The vibration characteristics
   predicted using proposed and Bert's constitutive models are quite close
   except for the transverse to the fiber direction normal stress. (C) 2015

   emulsions}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{153}},
Pages = {{336-345}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{The study of toluene emulsions is relevant to understand the behavior,
   and the separation of solventdiluted bitumen emulsions. Previous studies
   of similar systems have revealed that the presence of naphthenates,
   particles-specifically kaolinite-and asphaltenes can play an important
   role in the formation and stability of solvent-diluted bitumen
   emulsions. The objective of this work was to elucidate the relative
   importance of these factors. It was determined that in bitumen-free
   systems the presence of sodium naphthenates facilitates the entrapment
   of kaolinite in the emulsion and its segregation at the oil-water
   interface, which contributes to stabilize the emulsions. However,
   bitumen components (asphaltenes, resins, and other components) were
   shown to be more interfacially active than naphthenate-adsorbed
   kaolinite, resulting in the rejection of kaolinite from the emulsion. In
   naphthenate-adsorbed kaolinite emulsions, the presence of bitumen
   components is the dominant factor in determining the level of particles
   and water entrapped in the emulsion. Bitumen-coated kaolinite emulsions
   behaved in the same way as bitumen-free systems, suggesting that as long
   as the particle is pre-adsorbed with the dominant surface active
   species, particles can contribute to stabilize emulsions. (C) 2015

Title = {{Adaptive updating of regularization parameters}},
Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{228-233}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Iterative minimization of an objective function is usually used for
   restoring a signal from its noisy measurements. The performance of such
   iterative algorithms is controlled by regularization parameters, such as
   Lagrange multipliers. Inappropriate choice of these parameters can
   either trap the algorithm in local minima and/or lead to a lower
   convergence rate. We propose a Noise Confidence Region Evaluation (NCRE)
   algorithm, which adaptively adjusts the regularization parameters. The
   adjustment is based on evaluation and comparison of error residuals and
   the considered noise statistics, at the end of each iteration. Moreover,
   it stops the iterations when the statistical characteristics of the
   residual match those of the considered noise. NCRE can be used with
   different algorithms, such as: wavelet soft thresholding, Total
   Variation denoising, Iterative Soft Thresholding compressed sensing
   recovery, that have been explained in this paper. In addition, NCRE
   enables Block Matching and 3D filtering denoising method to be used in
   an iterative scheme applied on low dose computed tomography images.
   simulation results showed advantages of the NCRE in improving the
   performance of the discussed methods in sense of image quality and mean
   squared error. Moreover, NCRE enables these algorithms to converge in
   fewer iterations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Water quality parameters affecting sodium silicate performance in
   partial lead service line replacements were examined using a fractional
   factorial experimental design and static pipe systems. An external
   copper wire was used to create a galvanic connection between a former
   lead service line and a new copper pipe. The pipe systems were filled
   with lab prepared water made to mimic real water quality. Water was
   changed on a three times per week basis. A 2(4-1) fractional factorial
   design was used to evaluate the impact of alkalinity (15mg L-1 or 250mg
   L-1 as CaCO3), nitrate (1mg L-1 or 7mg L-1 as N), natural organic matter
   (1mg L-1 or 7mg L-1 as dissolved organic carbon), and disinfectant type
   (1mg L-1 chlorine or 3mg L-1 monochloramine), resulting in eight
   treatment conditions. Fractional factorial analysis revealed that
   alkalinity, natural organic matter and monochloramine had a significant
   positive effect on galvanic current. Natural organic matter and
   monochloramine also had a significant positive effect with respect to
   both total and dissolved lead release. For the treatment conditions
   examined, 67-98\% of the lead released through galvanic currents was
   stored as corrosion scales and predominantly comprised of particulate
   lead (96.1-99.9\%) for all eight treatments. The use of monochloramine
   and the presence of natural organic matter (7mg L-1) were not favourable
   for corrosion control in sodium silicate-treated partial lead service
   line replacements, although further studies would be required to
   characterize optimal water quality parameters for specific water quality
   types. For utilities operating with sodium silicate as a corrosion
   inhibitor, this work offers further evidence regarding the consideration
   of chlorine as a secondary disinfectant instead of monochloramine, as
   well as the value of controlling natural organic matter in distributed
   water.}},

Abstract = {{In current seismic design, structures that are essential for
   post-disaster recovery, and hazardous facilities are classified as risk
   category IV and are designed with higher importance factors and
   stringent drift limits. These structures are expected to perform better
   in an earthquake event because a larger base shear and more stringent
   drift limit are used. Although this provision has been in the seismic
   design code over the last three decades, few studies have investigated
   the performance of essential structures. The aim of this study is to
   quantify the impact of higher importance factors and stringent drift
   limits on the seismic performance of steel moment resisting frames. A
   total of 16 steel structures are designed for Los Angeles and Seattle.
   Different risk categories are used for the design. The effects of the
   risk categories on the structural periods, and thus on the seismic force
   demand, are investigated. A suite of inelastic time history analyses are
   carried out to understand the probability of exceeding a specified limit
   state when the structures are subjected to different levels of
   earthquake events. The results show that the periods of the structures
   in risk category IV decrease by a factor of 0.5 to 0.8, and the
   strengths increase by a factor of 1.5 to 3.2. Seismic fragility analysis
   shows that the structures in risk category IV generally satisfy the
   probabilistic performance objectives. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like enzymes comprise a large
   superfamily of phosphohydrolases present in all organisms. The
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome encodes at least 19 soluble HADs,
   including 10 uncharacterized proteins. Here, we biochemically
   characterized 13 yeast phosphatases from the HAD superfamily, which
   includes both specific and promiscuous enzymes active against various
   phosphorylated metabolites and peptides with several HADs implicated in
   detoxification of phosphorylated compounds and pseudouridine. The
   crystal structures of four yeast HADs provided insight into their active
   sites, whereas the structure of the YKR070W dimer in complex with
   substrate revealed a composite substrate-binding site. Although the S.
   cerevisiae and Escherichia coli HADs share low sequence similarities,
   the comparison of their substrate profiles revealed seven phosphatases
   with common preferred substrates. The cluster of secondary substrates
   supporting significant activity of both S. cerevisiae and E. coli HADs
   includes 28 common metabolites that appear to represent the pool of
   potential activities for the evolution of novel HAD phosphatases.
   Evolution of novel substrate specificities of HAD phosphatases shows no
   strict correlation with sequence divergence. Thus, evolution of the HAD
   superfamily combines the conservation of the overall substrate pool and
   the substrate profiles of some enzymes with remarkable biochemical and
   structural flexibility of other superfamily members.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a multiscale modeling technique is developed to
   determine the effective elastic moduli of CNT-reinforced epoxy
   composites containing either well-dispersed or agglomerated carbon
   nanotubes (CNTs). Two aspects of the work are accordingly examined. In
   the first, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to determine
   the atomic-level elastic properties of a representative volume element
   (RVE) comprised of either epoxy polymer or transversely isotropic
   CNT-epoxy composite. To study the effect of agglomeration of CNTs on the
   bulk elastic properties of the nanocomposite, CNT bundles of different
   sizes were considered. A constant-strain energy minimization method is
   used to determine the elastic coefficients of the RVEs. In the second,
   the Mori-Tanaka method is used to scale up the properties of the atomic
   structure to the microscale level, and the outcome is used to
   investigate the effect of orientations and agglomeration of CNTs on the
   bulk elastic properties of the nanocomposite. Our results reveal that as
   the number of CNTs in the bundle increases, the effective elastic
   properties of the nanocomposite decrease at the same CNT volume
   fraction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A pilot scale injection of nanoscale Zerovalent iron (nZVI) stabilized
   with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was performed at an active field site
   contaminated with a range of chlorinated volatile organic compounds

   at the site before and after nZVI injection. The remedial injection
   successfully reduced parent compound concentrations On site A period of
   abiotic degradation was followed by a period of enhanced biotic
   degradation. Results suggest that the nZVI/CMC injection, created
   conditions that stimulated the native populations of
   organohalide-respiring microorganisms. The abundance of Dehalococcoides
   spp. immediately following the nZVI/CMC injection increased by 1 order
   of magnitude throughout the nZVI/CMC affected area relative to
   preinjection abundance. Distinctly higher cVOC degradation occurred as a
   result of the nZVI/CMC injection over a 3 week evaluation period when
   compared to control wells. This suggests that both abiotic and biotic
   degradation occurred following injection.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{The optical response of Au cylindrical metallic nanostructures
   (nanocups) with very thin walls is studied by means of finite difference
   time domain simulations. The simulations predict that, by changing the
   geometry of the nanocups, they behave as tunable optical nanoresonators
   with strong near-field enhancement. This opens up the possibility to use
   them simultaneously as container and field enhancer. Nanocups have been
   produced by an on-purpose designed fabrication route that combines
   nanoimprint lithography, definition of an intermediate hard mask, and
   metal lift-off. The fabrication route offers a manifold of supplementary
   advantages: thorough control of geometrical parameters; versatility of
   compositional design, including multishell nanocups; precise positioning
   of nanocups over the substrate; and low-cost and fast manufacturing of
   large areas of desirable density without loss of resolution, all
   processes being compatible with high throughput, low cost production,
   thus enabling future commercial applications. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Title = {{Dynamically reconfigurable nanoscale modulators utilizing coupled hybrid
   plasmonics}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{The balance between extinction ratio (ER) and insertion loss (IL)
   dictates strict trade-off when designing travelling-wave electro-optic
   modulators. This in turn entails significant compromise in device
   footprint (L-3dB) or energy consumption (E). In this work, we report a
   nanoscale modulator architecture that alleviates this trade-off while
   providing dynamic reconfigurability that was previously unattainable.
   This is achieved with the aide of three mechanisms: (1) Utilization of
   epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) effect, which maximizes the attainable
   attenuation that an ultra-thin active material can inflict on an optical
   mode. (2) Non-resonant coupled-plasmonic structure which supports modes
   with athermal long-range propagation. (3) Triode-like biasing scheme for
   flexible manipulation of field symmetry and subsequently waveguide
   attributes. By electrically inducing indium tin oxide (ITO) to be in a
   local ENZ state, we show that a Si/ITO/HfO2/Al/HfO2/ITO/Si
   coupled-plasmonic waveguide can provide amplitude modulation with ER =
   4.83 dB/mu m, IL = 0.03 dB/mu m, L-3dB = 622 nm, and E = 14.8 fJ,
   showing at least an order of magnitude improvement in modulator
   figure-of-merit and power efficiency compared to other waveguide
   platforms. Employing different biasing permutations, the same waveguide
   can then be reconfigured for phase and 4-quadrature-amplitude
   modulation, with actively device length of only 5.53 mu m and 17.78 mu m
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Activation of I kappa B kinase (IKK) and NF-kappa B by genotoxic
   stresses modulates apoptotic responses and production of inflammatory
   mediators, thereby contributing to therapy resistance and premature
   aging. We previously reported that genotoxic agents induce nuclear
   localization of NF-kappa B essential modulator (NEMO) via an undefined
   mechanism to arbitrate subsequent DNA damage-dependent IKK/NF-kappa B
   signaling. Here we show that a nonclassical nuclear import pathway via
   IPO3 (importin 3, transportin 2) mediates stress-induced NEMO nuclear
   translocation. We found putative nuclear localization signals in NEMO
   whose mutations disrupted stress-inducible nuclear translocation of NEMO
   and IKK/NF-kappa B activation in stably reconstituted NEMO-deficient
   cells. RNAi screening of both importin alpha and beta family members, as
   well as co-immunoprecipitation analyses, revealed that a nonclassical
   importin beta family member, IPO3, was the only importin that was able
   to associate with NEMO and whose reduced expression prevented genotoxic
   stress-induced NEMO nuclear translocation, IKK/NF-kappa B activation,
   and inflammatory cytokine transcription. Recombinant IPO3 interacted
   with recombinant NEMO but not the nuclear localization signal mutant
   version and induced nuclear import of NEMO in digitonin-permeabilized
   cells. We also provide evidence that NEMO is disengaged from IKK complex
   following genotoxic stress induction. Thus, the IPO3 nuclear import
   pathway is an early and crucial determinant of the IKK/NF-kappa B
   signaling arm of the mammalian DNA damage response.}},

Abstract = {{Heteroepitaxy-atomically aligned growth of a crystalline film atop a
   different crystalline substrate-is the basis of electrically driven
   lasers, multijunction solar cells, and blue-light-emitting diodes(1-5).
   Crystalline coherence is preserved even when atomic identity is
   modulated, a fact that is the critical enabler of quantum wells, wires,
   and dots(6-10). The interfacial quality achieved as a result of
   hetero-epitaxial growth allows new combinations of materials with
   complementary properties, which enables the design and realization of
   functionalities that are not available in the single-phase constituents.
   Here we show that organohalide perovskites and preformed colloidal
   quantum dots, combined in the solution phase, produce epitaxially
   aligned `dots-in-a-matrix' crystals. Using transmission electron
   microscopy and electron diffraction, we reveal heterocrystals as large
   as about 60 nanometres and containing at least 20 mutually aligned dots
   that inherit the crystalline orientation of the perovskite matrix. The
   heterocrystals exhibit remarkable optoelectronic properties that are
   traceable to their atom-scale crystalline coherence: photoelectrons and
   holes generated in the larger-bandgap perovskites are transferred with
   80\% efficiency to become excitons in the quantum dot nanocrystals,
   which exploit the excellent photocarrier diffusion of perovskites to
   produce bright-light emission from infrared-bandgap quantum-tuned
   materials. By combining the electrical transport properties of the
   perovskite matrix with the high radiative efficiency of the quantum
   dots, we engineer a new platform to advance solution-processed infrared
   optoelectronics.}},

Title = {{Is it safe to drive after acute mild stroke? A preliminary report}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{354}},
Number = {{1-2}},

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Most guidelines recommend that patients should refrain from
   driving for at least one month after stroke. Despite these guidelines,
   and the fact that patients post-stroke may be at an increased risk for
   driving impairment, many patients report resuming driving within the
   acute phase of injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the
   driving performance of patients with acute mild stroke.
   Methods: The current study compared the driving simulator performance of
   ten patients with acute mild ischemic stroke (>48 h and <7 days) to that
   of ten healthy, age- and education-matched controls.
   Results: During the City Driving and Bus Following Scenarios, patients
   on average committed over twice as many errors (e.g., collisions, center
   line crossings, speed exceedances) as controls (12.4 vs. 6.0, t(18) =
   2.77, p < 0.01; and 8.2 vs. 2.1, t(17) = 2.55, p < 0.05; respectively).
   Although there was no difference between patients and controls in the
   number of errors committed during simple right and left turns, patients
   committed significantly more errors than controls during left turns with
   traffic (0.49 vs. 0.26, U = 26.5, p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Results suggest that patients with acute mild ischemic
   stroke may be able to maintain driving performance during basic tasks
   (e.g., straight driving, right turns) and that deficits may become
   apparent during more complex tasks (e.g., left turns with traffic, bus
   following). The results highlight the importance of healthcare
   professionals providing driving advice to their patients post-stroke,
   particularly in the acute phase of injury. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The partition of non-ionic surfactants between oil and water is an
   important parameter that influences the performance of surfactant-based
   separations, the fate of surfactants in the environment, and the
   absorption by surfactants in living organisms. From a thermodynamics
   point of view, the partition of surfactants between oil and water can be
   used as a method to quantify the hydrophilic-lipophilic nature of
   surfactants and oil. In this work, a group contribution model, the
   universal functional activity coefficient (UNIFAC) framework, has been
   modified to fit and predict the partition of alkylphenol, and alkyl
   ethoxylated surfactants between aqueous and oil phases. To perform such
   calculations the interaction parameters of an ethoxylate functional
   group were optimized, including the temperature dependence for
   functional groups known to form hydrogen bonds (CH2CH2O - H2O, OH-H2O).
   The optimization was performed by fitting this modified UNIFAC tnodel to
   experimental partition coefficient of octylphenol ethoxylated
   surfactants in the excess phases (water and n-heptane) of middle phase
   microemulsions at 25 and 55 degrees C and to experimental critical
   micelle concentration (CMC) data. The modified UNIFAC is capable of
   predicting the partition of alkylphenol ethoxylates and alkyl
   ethoxylates with varying degrees of ethoxylation, tail length and
   temperature and different oils. The predicted partition values correlate
   with experimental bioconcentration factors (BCFs) reported for alkyl
   ethoxylates. The model also predicts properly the critical micelle
   concentration (CMC) of alkyl and alkylphenol ethoxylate surfactants. The
   predicted partitions also helped estimate the equivalent alkane carbon
   numbers (EACNs) of various oils. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{CRISPR-Cas are small RNA-based adaptive prokaryotic immunity systems
   protecting cells from foreign DNA or RNA. Type I CRISPR-Cas systems are
   composed of a multiprotein complex (Cascade) that, when bound to CRISPR
   RNA (crRNA), can recognize double-stranded DNA targets and recruit the
   Cas3 nuclease to destroy target-containing DNA. In the Es-cherichia coli
   type I-E CRISPR-Cas system, crRNAs are generated upon transcription of
   CRISPR arrays consisting of multiple palindromic repeats and intervening
   spacers through the function of Cas6e endoribonuclease, which cleaves at
   specific positions of repeat sequences of the CRISPR array transcript.
   Cas6e is also a component of Cascade. Here, we show that when mature
   unit-sized crRNAs are provided in a Cas6e-independent manner by
   transcription termination, the CRISPR-Cas system can function without
   Cas6e. The results should allow facile interrogation of various targets
   by type I-E CRISPR-Cas system in E. coli using unit-sized crRNAs
   generated by transcription.}},

Title = {{Two polarization-entangled sources from the same semiconductor chip}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 13}},
Abstract = {{Generating nonclassical states of photons such as polarization-entangled
   states on a monolithic chip is a crucial step towards practical
   applications of optical quantum information processing such as quantum
   computing and quantum key distribution. Here we demonstrate two
   polarization-entangled photon sources in a single monolithic
   semiconductor waveguide. The first source is achieved through the
   concurrent utilization of two spontaneous parametric down-conversion
   (SPDC) processes, namely, type-0 and type-I SPDC processes. The chip can
   also generate polarization-entangled photons via the type-II SPDC
   process, enabling the generation of both copolarized- and
   cross-polarized polarization-entangled photons in the same device. In
   both cases, polarization entanglement is generated directly on the chip
   without the use of any off-chip compensation, interferometry, or
   bandpass filtering. This enables direct, chip-based generation of both
   Bell states (vertical bar H, H > + vertical bar V, V >)/root 2 and
   (vertical bar H, V > + vertical bar V, H >)/root 2 simultaneously
   utilizing the same pump source. In addition, based on compound
   semiconductors, this chip can be directly integrated with it own pump
   laser. This technique ushers an era of self-contained, integrated,
   electrically pumped, room-temperature polarization-entangled photon
   sources.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic honeycomb sandwich panels are fabricated through a simple

   their internal architecture over a wide domain of material process

   parameters: the node density, the total length of webs, the Euler
   number, and a characteristic fractal area fraction. The mechanical
   response of the polymer melt was quantified in terms of peak stress and
   stiffness, along with apparent elongation viscosity. The observed
   architectures and polymer melt responses were consistent with a varying
   activated entanglement density in the melt and illustrate how the
   fabrication conditions can be tuned to obtain a desired architecture.

Title = {{Development of polylactide bead foams with double crystal melting peaks}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{83-94}},
Month = {{JUL 9}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we report the development of polylactide (PLA) bead foams
   with a double crystal melting peak structure. PLA bead foams with 3- to
   30-fold expansion ratios and average cell sizes ranged from 350 nm to 15
   mu m were prepared. We found that the PLA's foam structure was
   significantly affected by the amount of perfected crystals (that is,
   crystals with a high melting temperature) generated during CO2
   saturation. The structure was also affected by crystals with a low
   melting temperature that formed during foaming and cooling. Various CO2
   pressures further influenced the crystallization kinetics of the
   crystals with a high melting temperature during the saturation. At
   various pressures, different crystallization kinetics also significantly
   affected the PLA foam's cell morphology and its uniformity. At a high
   saturation pressure, the increased content of dissolved CO2 in the PLA
   promoted the cell nucleation rate through the increased degree of
   thermodynamic instability. On the other hand, at high pressures,
   small-sized perfect crystals were induced as high-melting peak crystals.
   Thus, the heterogeneous cell nucleation around these crystals was
   further improved, which also caused the generation of a more uniform
   foam structure. Moreover, this study introduces this bead foam
   technology as an innovative new way to produce nanocellular foam
   products. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Interdigitated electrode structures have applications in a myriad of
   fields and have become attractive for in-line electrochemical detection
   in lab-on-a-chip microsystems. Analytical models can replace complex and
   expensive numerical simulations to determine the capacitance of
   interdigitated electrode structures in cases where simple geometries can
   be assumed. Closed-form analytical expressions derived from
   Schwarz-Christoffel conformal mappings were used to determine the
   capacitance of multi-layer interdigitated electrode structures with an
   additional parallel continuous electrode. The partial capacitance
   approach was reformulated to find the capacitance of multi-layer
   structures with non-monotonically changing permittivities. The
   analytical model was found to be in close agreement with finite-element
   simulations. The model is used for optimization of an insulated
   transducer for sensitive detection of surface processes. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A class of microcellular polymer nanocomposites of multi-walled carbon
   nanotubes (MWCNT) is reported that exhibits a stable and significantly
   high dielectric permittivity coupled with a stable and low dielectric
   loss in a wide range of frequency. Polypropylene (PP)-MWCNT
   nanocomposites with a cellular structure were prepared by melt mixing
   followed by physical foaming in an injection molding process. The
   generation of a cellular structure inside the nanocomposites provides a
   unique planar-like arrangement of the MWCNTs around the cells. This
   enhances the dielectric permittivity of nanocomposites up to an order of
   magnitude. Therefore, microcellular PP-1.25 vol\% MWCNT presents a
   dielectric permittivity of epsilon' = 57.2 and a dielectric loss of tan
   delta=0.05 at 0.1 MHz, highly superior to the best values of the solid
   nanocomposites prepared by regular compression molding (epsilon' =14.1
   and tan delta=0.39) and by injection molding (epsilon' =17.8 and tan
   delta=0.04). Also, microcellular PP-1.66 vol\% MWCNT exhibits
   epsilon'=95.6 and tan delta=0.14, which surpasses the dielectric
   performances reported in the literature. Hence, these nanocomposites
   with a cellular structure provide a novel and general approach to
   develop microscopically tailored structures for dielectric applications
   using facile methods. Such dielectrics can be used for energy storage in
   modern electronics and electrical power systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach for multirate sampled-data control
   of a fly-by-wireless quadrotor using three feedback loops: attitude
   control loop, velocity control loop, and position control loop. The
   proposed multiloop controller operates over a network of sensors. Each
   sensor corresponds to one of the control loops and is dedicated to
   sampling the attitude, the velocity, or the position of the quadrotor.
   The sensors operate at different sampling frequencies that are assumed
   to be lower bounded. The control signals in each loop are computed at
   different rates, which are dictated by the corresponding sensor of the
   control loop. Two formal results are proved. Given the controller gains,
   the first result provides sufficient conditions for finding the lowest
   allowable sampling frequency for each control loop such that stability
   of the closed-loop system is guaranteed. The second result provides a
   controller synthesis algorithm and sufficient conditions guaranteeing
   the stability of the closed-loop system. Simulation results show the
   effectiveness of the proposed multiloop controller when compared to the
   single-loop, single-rate case. In particular, the results show that
   increasing the sampling frequency of a control loop allows a designer to
   decrease the sampling frequency of the other control loops below the
   limit imposed by the single-rate case. Using the technique proposed in
   this paper, an engineer can thus select the proper combination of
   sampling frequencies for a specific application, based on the price,
   availability, performance, power requirements, weight, maintenance
   costs, and other characteristics of the sensors.}},

Title = {{Structural and Functional Adaptation of Vancomycin Resistance VanT
   Serine Racemases}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{Vancomycin resistance in Gram-positive bacteria results from the
   replacement of the D-alanyl-D-alanine target of peptidoglycan precursors
   with D-alanyl-D-lactate or D-alanyl-D-serine (D-Ala-D-Ser), to which
   vancomycin has low binding affinity. VanT is one of the proteins
   required for the production of D-Ala-D-Ser-terminating precursors by
   converting L-Ser to D-Ser. VanT is composed of two domains, an
   N-terminal membrane-bound domain, likely involved in L-Ser uptake, and a
   C-terminal cytoplasmic catalytic domain which is related to bacterial
   alanine racemases. To gain insight into the molecular function of VanT,
   the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of VanT(G) from VanG-type
   resistant Enterococcus faecalis BM4518 was determined. The structure
   showed significant similarity to type III pyridoxal 5'-phosphate
   (PLP)-dependent alanine racemases, which are essential for peptidoglycan
   synthesis. Comparative structural analysis between VanT(G) and alanine
   racemases as well as site-directed mutagenesis identified three specific
   active site positions centered around Asn(696) which are responsible for
   the L-amino acid specificity. This analysis also suggested that VanT
   racemases evolved from regular alanine racemases by acquiring additional
   selectivity toward serine while preserving that for alanine. The
   4-fold-lower relative catalytic efficiency of VanT(G) against L-Ser
   versus L-Ala implied that this enzyme relies on its membrane-bound
   domain for L-Ser transport to increase the overall rate of D-Ser
   production. These findings illustrate how vancomycin pressure selected
   for molecular adaptation of a housekeeping enzyme to a bifunctional
   enzyme to allow for peptidoglycan remodeling, a strategy increasingly
   observed in antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
   IMPORTANCE Vancomycin is one of the drugs of last resort against
   Gram-positive antibiotic-resistant pathogens. However, bacteria have
   evolved a sophisticated mechanism which remodels the drug target, the
   D-alanine ending precursors in cell wall synthesis, into precursors
   terminating with D-lactate or D-serine, to which vancomycin has less
   affinity. D-Ser is synthesized by VanT serine racemase, which has two
   unusual characteristics: (i) it is one of the few serine racemases
   identified in bacteria and (ii) it contains a membrane-bound domain
   involved in L-Ser uptake. The structure of the catalytic domain of
   VanT(G) showed high similarity to alanine racemases, and we identified
   three specific active site substitutions responsible for L-Ser
   specificity. The data provide the molecular basis for VanT evolution to
   a bifunctional enzyme coordinating both transport and racemization. Our
   findings also illustrate the evolution of the essential alanine racemase
   into a vancomycin resistance enzyme in response to antibiotic pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Wind-tunnel experiments are used to study the effect of momentum
   coefficient and excitation frequency on flow separation using synthetic
   jet actuation. Experiments are conducted on a NACA 0025 airfoil at a
   chord-based Reynolds number of 100,000 and angle of attack of 10deg. The
   actuator is located near the leading edge, downstream of the mean
   separation location. High-frequency excitation is able to reattach the
   flow and eliminate the large-scale vortex shedding in the wake, leading
   to a decrease in drag of approximately 45\%. Low-frequency excitation is
   employed to target the instabilities associated with the separated shear
   layer and vortex shedding in the wake. Excitation of the wake
   instability also causes the flow to reattach; however, it leads to
   organization of the large-scale vortex shedding. By forcing the boundary
   layer at the frequency of the shear-layer instability, the threshold
   momentum required to reattach the flow is an order of magnitude smaller
   as compared with high-frequency excitation, and the large-scale vortex
   shedding is suppressed.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Selection medium is important in sperm isolation for assisted
   reproductive technologies. Contrary to the naturally occurring human
   cervical mucus which has a high viscosity, most current practices for
   motility based sperm selection use a low viscosity medium. In this
   study, we used a microfluidic device to assess the effects of high
   viscosity media made with hyaluronic acid (HA) and methyl cellulose (MC)
   on bovine and human sperm motility and viability (sperm transferred
   directly from cryoprotectant). The microfluidic penetration test,
   viability, and motility were compared for sperm swimming in both HA and
   MC media with about 20cp viscosity (measured at 20 degrees C). Our
   resulted indicate that MC medium resulted in a significantly higher
   number of viable bovine sperm penetrating the medium as compared to HA.
   Furthermore, MC resulted in the selection of a sperm subpopulation with
   a 274\% increase in sperm viability in comparison to the raw semen,
   while HA increased viability by only 133\%. In addition to viability,
   bovine sperm motility parameters were significantly higher in the MC
   medium as compared with HA. Experiments with human sperm swimming in MC
   indicate that sperm swim slower and straighter at higher viscosities. In
   conclusion, the results indicate that in a micro-confined environment
   representative of the in vivo environment, MC is a preferred high
   viscosity medium to ensure the highest concentration of motile and
   viable sperm. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{51}},

Abstract = {{The assumption that gas is infinitely mobile, moving without viscous
   pressure drops, is common in studies of unsaturated flow in porous
   media. The objectives of this work were to use experimental measurements
   to examine that assumption in systems experiencing rapid drainage and to
   explore the extent to which observed pressure drops could be described
   by conventional multiphase flow simulation tracking viscous flow in both
   phases. Because many published studies have used vented columns in an
   effort to equilibrate pore gas pressures with inlet gas, an additional
   objective of the work was to use experimental measurements to explore
   the ability of column vents to equilibrate pore gas with inlet gas
   during dynamic drainage. Results of the work suggest that gas pressure
   gradients can be significant, and that the assumption of infinite gas
   mobility is likely to be unsatisfactory in many systems where moderately
   rapid saturation change occurs. While vents have the potential to
   influence flow by providing additional gas inlets, experimental results
   of this work show almost no impact on pore gas pressures from a vent
   similar in size to those in other published studies. An equation
   developed as a part of the work suggests that the spatial slope of gas
   pressure with distance away from the front during dynamic drainage is
   proportional to the ratio of outflow Darcy velocity to saturated
   hydraulic conductivity for vertical columns. As such, systems with more
   rapid saturation change also have a greater potential to exhibit
   experimental artifacts related to gas pressure gradients.}},

Title = {{Narrowing the Expertise Gap for Predicting Intracranial Aneurysm
   Hemodynamics: Impact of Solver Numerics versus Mesh and Time-Step
   Resolution}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{36}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent high-resolution computational fluid
   dynamics studies have uncovered the presence of laminar flow
   instabilities and possible transitional or turbulent flow in some
   intracranial aneurysms. The purpose of this study was to elucidate
   requirements for computational fluid dynamics to detect these complex
   flows, and, in particular, to discriminate the impact of solver numerics
   versus mesh and time-step resolution.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We focused on 3 MCA aneurysms, exemplifying
   highly unstable, mildly unstable, or stable flow phenotypes,
   respectively. For each, the number of mesh elements was varied by 320X
   and the number of time-steps by 25X. Computational fluid dynamics
   simulations were performed by using an optimized second-order, minimally
   dissipative solver, and a more typical first-order, stabilized solver.
   RESULTS: With the optimized solver and settings, qualitative differences
   in flow and wall shear stress patterns were negligible for models down
   to similar to 800,000 tetrahedra and similar to 5000 time-steps per
   cardiac cycle and could be solved within clinically acceptable
   timeframes. At the same model resolutions, however, the stabilized
   solver had poorer accuracy and completely suppressed flow instabilities
   for the 2 unstable flow cases. These findings were verified by using the
   popular commercial computational fluid dynamics solver, Fluent.
   CONCLUSIONS: Solver numerics must be considered at least as important as
   mesh and time-step resolution in determining the quality of aneurysm
   computational fluid dynamics simulations. Proper computational fluid
   dynamics verification studies, and not just superficial grid
   refinements, are therefore required to avoid overlooking potentially
   clinically and biologically relevant flow features.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the use of combined ultrasonic imaging (USI) and
   photoacoustic radar imaging (PARI) with linear chirp laser modulation to
   provide visualization of blood with and without the use of gold
   nanoparticles. A blood vessel simulating sample (S1) containing pure
   sheep blood was shown to be an optically weak absorbing medium which
   satisfies thermal but not acoustic confinement. On the contrary, the
   blood-gold combinations (S2) using 10\% and S3 (20\%) Au concentrations
   behaved as optically strongly absorbing media. A heating efficiency of
   0.54 to 8.60 x 10(3) Kcm(2) J(-1) was determined for Au NPs. The optimal
   optical power modulation spectral density was determined to be in the
   range of 0.5 to 0.8 MHz and 0.3 to 1.0 MHz for USI and PARI,
   respectively. USI produced a better structural image while PARI produced
   a better functional image of the simulated blood vessel in the order of
   S2 > S3 > S1 due to enhanced signal-to-noise ratio. Two-dimensional
   images of the simulated blood vessel were also obtained. In summary, the
   PA signal does not increase linearly with Au NP concentration and the
   change of blood osmolarity due to temperature increase can cause
   thermo-hemolysis of red blood cells which in turn degrades the PA signal
   and thus the blood imaging quality. On the other hand, USI produced the
   best structural image, S4, due to the strong US reflection response from
   Au NPs and its insensitivity to the presence of blood. (C) 2015 Society

Abstract = {{We used ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging modalities to
   characterize cattle trabecular bones. The PA signals were generated with
   an 805-nm continuous wave laser used for optimally deep optical
   penetration depth. The detector for both modalities was a 2.25-MHz US
   transducer with a lateral resolution of similar to 1 mm at its focal
   point. Using a lateral pixel size much larger than the size of the
   trabeculae, raster scanning generated PA images related to the averaged
   values of the optical and thermoelastic properties, as well as density
   measurements in the focal volume. US backscatter yielded images related
   to mechanical properties and density in the focal volume. The depth of
   interest was selected by time-gating the signals for both modalities.
   The raster scanned PA and US images were compared with microcomputed
   tomography (mu CT) images averaged over the same volume to generate
   similar spatial resolution as US and PA. The comparison revealed
   correlations between PA and US modalities with the mineral volume
   fraction of the bone tissue. Various features and properties of these
   modalities such as detectable depth, resolution, and sensitivity are

Abstract = {{Centrifugal casting of composites and ceramics has been widely employed
   to improve the mechanical and thermal properties of functional
   materials. This powerful method has yet to be deployed in the context of
   nanoparticles-yet size-effect tuning of quantum dots is among their most
   distinctive and application-relevant features. Here we report the first
   gradient nanoparticle films to be constructed in a single step. By
   creating a stable colloid of nanoparticles that are capped with
   electronic-conduction-compatible ligands we were able to leverage
   centrifugal casting for thin-films devices. This new method, termed
   centrifugal colloidal casting, is demonstrated to form films in a
   bandgap-ordered manner with efficient carrier funnelling towards the
   lowest energy layer. We constructed the first quantum-gradient
   photodiode to be formed in a single deposition step and, as a result of
   the gradient-enhanced electric field, experimentally measured the
   highest normalized detectivity of any colloidal quantum dot
   photodetector.}},

Abstract = {{For kraft pulp mills that have thermally limited recovery boilers,
   lignin removal from black liquor has become an attractive option for
   increasing pulp production by allowing more black liquor to be processed
   through the boiler. This study systematically examined the combustion
   characteristics of lignin-lean black liquor and precipitated lignin from
   three kraft mills using a thermogravimetric combustor. The results
   confirm that adding lignin-lean black liquor to its original black
   liquor decreased the heating value and the degree of swelling of the
   mixed liquor. The effect on liquor swelling, however, was insignificant
   for mixed liquors that contained less than 20 wt\% of lignin-lean
   liquor. As with other biofuels, the combustion of precipitated lignin
   was found to occur through three main stages: drying, volatile burning,
   and char burning. During the volatile burning stage, hardwood lignin
   swelled significantly, softwood lignin did not swell much, and mixed
   hardwood and softwood lignin was somewhere in between. Although the char
   content in lignin was about half of the volatile content, it took 10
   times longer for the char to burn compared to the volatiles.}},

Abstract = {{Lime kilns are used to calcine lime mud to produce lime for reuse in the
   causticizing plant of pulp mills. With significant increase in fossil
   fuel costs and the sustained drive to minimize carbon footprint, there
   has been a great deal of research and development of the biorefinery
   concept and production of biofuels for use within pulp mills. Several
   new biofuels will become available, together with traditional mill
   derived fuels such as tall oil. In considering use of biofuels for
   replacement of fossil fuels in the lime kiln, each fuel has a different
   impact on kiln performance. An assessment on kiln performance can be
   achieved and compared to either heavy fuel oil or natural gas. In most
   cases, the lime kiln fuels with high oxygen content and moderately low
   calorific values burn in a similar manner as natural gas; hence, in
   assessing impact on kiln performance, production and induced draft fan
   limits together with kiln exit gas temperatures need to be considered.}},

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{481-489}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Overliming and the consequent presence of unreacted lime (or free lime)
   in the lime mud are commonly believed to be the cause of many problems
   in the operation of causticizing plants and lime kilns in kraft pulp
   mills. The free lime content in lime mud is typically determined in mill
   laboratories using a so-called ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) method and in
   commercial laboratories using a thermal decomposition (TD) method. Over
   the years, we analyzed many lime mud samples from mills and found that
   the free lime content was consistently low, < 3 wt\% calcium hydroxide
   (Ca(OH)(2)), even in cases where overliming was suspected to have caused
   problems. A systematic study was therefore conducted to investigate the
   validity of free-lime measurement methods, the reason for the
   consistently low free lime content in lime mud, and if free lime values
   can be used to indicate overliming. The results show that the NH4Cl
   method is not suitable for determining free lime. The TD method is good,
   but the possible interference of magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)(2)) must be
   taken into account. Since most pulp mills perform their free lime
   analysis on mud samples collected from pre-coat filters which have been
   washed, the resulting free lime value is low, and thus, cannot be used
   to assess the extent of overliming in the causticizing plant.}},

Title = {{On the feasibility of growth-coupled product synthesis in microbial
   strains}},
Journal = {{METABOLIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{166-178}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Enforcing obligate coupling of growth with synthesis of a desired
   product has become a key principle for metabolic engineering of
   microbial production strains. Various methods from stoichiometric and
   constraint-based modeling have been developed to calculate intervention
   strategies by which a given microorganism can only grow if it
   synthesizes a desired compound as a mandatory by-product. However,
   growth-coupled synthesis is not necessarily feasible for every compound
   of a metabolic network and no rigorous criterion is currently known to
   test feasibility of coupled product and biomass formation (before
   searching for suitable intervention strategies). In this work, we show
   which properties a network must fulfill such that strain designs
   guaranteeing coupled biomass and product synthesis can exist at all In
   networks without flux bounds, coupling is feasible if and only if an
   elementary mode exists that leads to formation of both biomass and
   product Setting flux boundaries leads to more complicated inhomogeneous
   problems. Making use of the concept of elementary (flux) vectors, a
   generalization of elementary modes, a criterion for feasibility can also
   be derived for this situation. We applied our criteria to a metabolic
   model of Escherichia coli and determined for each metabolite, whether
   its net production can be coupled with biomass synthesis and calculated
   the maximal (guaranteed) coupling yield. The somewhat surprising result
   is that, under aerobic conditions, coupling is indeed possible for each
   carbon metabolite of the central metabolism. This also holds true for
   most metabolites under anaerobic conditions but consideration of ATP
   maintenance requirements implies infeasibility of coupling for certain
   compounds. On the other hand, ATP maintenance may also increase the
   maximal coupling yield for some metabolites. Overall, our work provides
   important insights and novel tools for a central problem of
   computational strain design. (C) 2015 International Metabolic

Abstract = {{We study a multistate partially observable process control model with a
   general state transition structure. The process is initially in control
   and subject to Markovian deterioration that can bring it to
   out-of-control states. The process may continue making transitions among
   the out-of-control states, or even back to the in-control state until it
   reaches an absorbing state. We assume that at least one out-of-control
   state is absorbing. The objective is to minimize the expected total cost
   over a finite horizon. By transforming the standard Cartesian belief
   space into the spherical coordinate system, we show that the optimal
   policy has a simple control-limit structure. We also examine two
   specialized models. The first is the phase-type transition time model,
   in which we develop an algorithm whose complexity is not affected by the
   number of phases. The second is a model with multiple absorbing
   out-of-control states, by which we show that certain out-of-control
   states may incur less total cost than the in-control state, a phenomenon
   never occurs in the two-state models. We conclude that there are
   fundamental differences between multistate models and two-state models,
   and that the spherical coordinate transformation offers significant
   analytical and computational benefits.}},

Abstract = {{The periodontium is the set of tissues responsible for tooth anchorage,
   and consists of interconnected layers of mineralized and unmineralized
   tissues (bone, ligament and cementum). The ligament-cementum interface
   is a particularly elegant example of biological control of
   mineralization and the controlling factors are poorly understood. Here
   we use a tissue-based in vitro model of mineralization, in which
   sections of demineralized mouse jaw remineralize with the same
   selectivity as found in vivo, to probe the molecular mechanism of
   control over collagen mineralization in the periodontium. Removal or
   enzymatic cleavage of noncollagenous proteins-have very similar effects:
   a reduction in the rate of remineralization that is much more drastic in
   cementum than in dentin. The periodontal ligament does not mineralize
   within experimental parameters even after protein removal/digestion.
   Dephosphorylation results in a slight reduction in mineralization in
   dentin and cementum. Understanding the mechanisms controlling selective
   mineralization in the periodontium will help elucidate the molecular
   factors controlling collagen biomienralization, and provide inspiration
   for the development of scaffolds for regeneration of hard soft tissue
   interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a RIFP (robust interval-fuzzy programming) approach is
   developed for risk analysis of EPS (electric power systems) in
   association with multiple uncertainties expressed as fuzzy-boundary
   intervals and probability distributions. RIFP can provide an effective
   linkage between the pre-regulated policies and the associated corrective
   actions against any infeasibility arising from random outcomes. A
   RIFP-MEP (RIFP-based municipal-scale electric-power-system planning)
   model is formulated for the City of Shanghai, China. Various robustness
   levels and feasibility degrees are incorporated within the modeling
   formulation for enhancing the RIFP-MEP model capability. Solutions have
   been generated and are useful for supporting the Shanghai's energy
   supply, electricity generation, capacity expansion, and air-pollution
   control. Results can help decision makers to address the challenge
   generated in the processes of electric power production (such as
   imbalance between electricity supply and demand, the contradiction
   between air pollution emission and environmental protection); this
   allows an increased robustness in controlling system risk in the
   optimization process, which permits in-depth analyses of various
   conditions that are associated with different robustness levels of
   economic penalties when the promised policy targets are violated, and
   thus help the decision makers to identify desired electricity-generation

Abstract = {{Purpose: Experimentally verify a previously described technique for
   performing passive acoustic imaging through an intact human skull using
   noninvasive, computed tomography (CT)-based aberration corrections Jones
   et al. {[}Phys. Med. Biol. 58, 4981-5005 (2013)].
   Methods: A sparse hemispherical receiver array (30 cm diameter)
   consisting of 128 piezoceramic discs (2.5 mm diameter, 612 kHz center
   frequency) was used to passively listen through ex vivo human skullcaps
   (n = 4) to acoustic emissions from a narrow-band fixed source (1 mm
   diameter, 516 kHz center frequency) and from ultrasound-stimulated (5
   cycle bursts, 1 Hz pulse repetition frequency, estimated in situ peak
   negative pressure 0.11-0.33 MPa, 306 kHz driving frequency) Definity
   (TM) microbubbles flowing through a thin-walled tube phantom. Initial in
   vivo feasibility testing of the method was performed. The performance of
   the method was assessed through comparisons to images generated without
   skull corrections, with invasive source-based corrections, and with
   water-path control images.
   Results: For source locations at least 25 mm from the inner skull
   surface, the modified reconstruction algorithm successfully restored a
   single focus within the skull cavity at a location within 1.25 mm from
   the true position of the narrow-band source. The results obtained from
   imaging single bubbles are in good agreement with numerical simulations
   of point source emitters and the authors' previous experimental
   measurements using source-based skull corrections O'Reilly et al.
   {[}IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 61, 1285-1294 (2014)]. In a rat model,
   microbubble activity was mapped through an intact human skull at
   pressure levels below and above the threshold for focused
   ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier opening. During bursts that led
   to coherent bubble activity, the location of maximum intensity in images
   generated with CT-based skull corrections was found to deviate by less
   than 1 mm, on average, from the position obtained using source-based
   corrections.
   Conclusions: Taken together, these results demonstrate the feasibility
   of using the method to guide bubble-mediated ultrasound therapies in the
   brain. The technique may also have application in ultrasound-based
   cerebral angiography. (C) 2015 American Association of Physicists in

Abstract = {{Colloidal nanoplatelets, quasi-two-dimensional quantum wells, have
   recently been introduced as colloidal semiconductor materials with the
   narrowest known photoluminescence line width (similar to 10 nm).
   Unfortunately, these materials have not been shown to have continuously
   tunable emission but rather emit at discrete wavelengths that depend
   strictly on atomic-layer thickness. Herein, we report a new synthesis
   approach that overcomes this issue: by alloying CdSe colloidal
   nanoplatelets with CdS, we finely tune the emission spectrum while still
   leveraging atomic-scale thickness control. We proceed to demonstrate
   light-emitting diodes with sub-bandgap turn-on voltages (2.1 V for a
   device emitting at 2.4 eV) and the narrowest electroluminescence
   spectrum (FWHM similar to 12.5 nm) reported for colloidal semiconductor
   LEDs.}},

Abstract = {{Solder joint fracture toughness was measured using

   time, and the geometry of the end of the solder layer. Although the
   toughness was a strong function of the loading phase angle and strain
   rate, relatively small differences were due to the solder composition,

Abstract = {{Parabolic equation (PE) methods have been widely applied to the modeling
   of wireless propagation in tunnel environments. However, the relevant
   literature does not include concrete guidelines for the choice of the
   parameters of these methods and the tradeoffs involved. This paper
   provides a comprehensive analysis of the two sources of error that arise
   when PE methods are employed for the modeling of radio-wave propagation
   scenarios: the well-known numerical dispersion error stemming from the
   finite-difference solvers for PE and the approximation error stemming
   from the use of PE for the solution of wave propagation problems that
   are subject to Maxwell's equations. The analysis is performed for four
   methods, three of which have been already used in PE-based propagation
   studies, namely, the Crank-Nicolson (CN) scheme, the
   alternative-direction-implicit (ADI) method, and its locally
   one-dimensional (LOD-ADI) version. The fourth method is the
   Mitchell-Fairweather (MF)-ADI scheme that has been recently shown to be
   a promising alternative technique for tunnel propagation modeling. The
   proposed method leads to robust criteria for the choice of spatial
   discretization in realistic propagation scenarios, as shown via
   numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{As a noninvasive and safe optical measure of hemodynamic brain activity,
   near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has emerged as a potential
   brain-computer interface (BCI) access modality. Currently, to the best
   of our knowledge, all NIRS BCIs use mental tasks to elicit changes in
   regional hemodynamic activity. One of the limitations of using mental
   tasks is that they can be cognitively demanding, and unintuitive. The
   goal of this work was to explore the development of a
   neurofeedback-based NIRS BCI that weans users off mental tasks, to
   instead use voluntary self-regulation. Ten able-bodied participants were
   recruited for this study. After ten sessions of using two personalized
   mental tasks to increase and decrease the participant's hemodynamic
   activity, the users were asked, for the remaining sessions, to stop
   performing their tasks and instead use only a desire to modulate their
   hemodynamic activity. By the final online session, participants were
   able to exclusively use voluntary self-regulation with an average
   accuracy of 79 +/- 13\%. Additionally, the majority of participants
   indicated that BCI control via self-regulation was less taxing and more
   intuitive than BCI operation using mental tasks.}},

Abstract = {{The present study proposes a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) with
   64 selectable items based on the fusion of P300 and steady-state
   visually evoked potential (SSVEP) brain signals. With this approach,
   row/column (RC) P300 and two-step SSVEP paradigms were integrated to
   create two hybrid paradigms, which we denote as the double RC (DRC) and
   4-D spellers. In each hybrid paradigm, the target is simultaneously
   detected based on both P300 and SSVEP potentials as measured by the
   electroencephalogram. We further proposed a maximum-probability
   estimation (MPE) fusion approach to combine the P300 and SSVEP on a
   score level and compared this approach to other approaches based on
   linear discriminant analysis, a naive Bayes classifier, and support
   vector machines. The experimental results obtained from thirteen
   participants indicated that the 4-D hybrid paradigm outperformed the DRC
   paradigm and that the MPE fusion achieved higher accuracy compared with
   the other approaches. Importantly, 12 of the 13 participants, using the
   4-D paradigm achieved an accuracy of over 90\% and the average accuracy
   was 95.18\%. These promising results suggest that the proposed hybrid
   BCI system could be used in the design of a high-performance BCI-based
   keyboard.}},

Abstract = {{It is well-known that surfactantoilwater (SOW) emulsions undergo
   substantial changes in drop size (10-fold or more) and stability (up to
   4 orders of magnitude) near the phase inversion point. Predicting these
   changes is important in numerous applications. However, the complex
   connection between composition, formulation properties, and hydrodynamic
   conditions limits the ability to predict the outcome of emulsification
   and demulsification processes. To address this gap, the
   hydrophilic-lipophilic deviation (HLD) was used to quantify the
   proximity to the inversion point, considering the composition of the
   formulation, temperature, and electrolyte concentration. The
   net-average-curvature (NAC) equations combined with the HLD predicted
   the density, interfacial tension, interfacial rigidity, and viscosity
   for the sodium dihexyl sulfosuccinate (SDHS)-toluene-water system. The
   predicted properties were incorporated in hydrodynamic models to predict
   the initial emulsion drop size. The calculated properties and initial
   drop size were then used in a modified version of the Davies and Rideal
   coalescence model that incorporates hole nucleation theory to predict
   emulsion stability. The predictions were consistent with the changes in
   emulsion drop size and stability around the phase inversion obtained for
   the SDHS-toluene-water system, and with stability values reported in the
   literature for ionic and nonionic SOW systems.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In reduced-order (0D/1D) blood or respiratory flow models, pressure
   losses at junctions are usually neglected. However, these may become
   important where velocities are high and significant flow redirection
   occurs. Current methods for estimating losses rely on relatively complex
   empirical equations that are only valid for specific junction geometries
   and flow regimes. In pulsatile multi-directional flows, switching
   between empirical equations upon reversing flow may introduce
   unrealistic discontinuities in simulated haemodynamic waveforms. Drawing
   from work by Bassett et al. (SAE Trans 112:565-583, 2003), we therefore
   developed a unified method (Unified0D) for estimating loss coefficients
   that can be applied to any junction (i.e. any number of branches at any
   angle) and any flow regime. Discontinuities in simulated waveforms were
   avoided by extending Bassett et al.'s control volume-based method to
   incorporate a pseudodatum' supplier branch, an imaginary effective
   vessel containing all inflow to the junction. Energy exchange between
   diverging flow streams was also accounted for empirically. The
   formulation was validated using high resolution computational fluid
   dynamics in a wide range flow conditions and junction configurations. In
   a pulsatile 1D simulation exhibiting transitions between four different
   flow regimes, the new formulation produced smooth transitions in
   calculated pressure losses. Copyright (c) 2015John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   on application for which the plasmonic waveguide is designed: 1)
   applications which require high power density and 2) applications which
   require high lateral packing density. The first figure of merit is based
   on the power density and propagation loss, whereas the second depends on
   the coupling length and the propagation loss. We have identified the

   displacement}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL ENGINEERING \& PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{665-673}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Dual-axis accelerometry has recently shown promise as a non-invasive
   method for detecting swallowing impairment using signal processing and
   pattern classification algorithms. However, it is unknown whether
   variations in sensor placement alter signal characteristics, threatening
   the accuracy of signal processing classifiers for aspiration detection.
   To address this question, water swallows were recorded in 14 healthy
   adults using a dual-axis accelerometer in 13 different positions
   (baseline, and 2, 4, 6 and 8 mm above, below and to the right of
   baseline). The baseline position was midline, immediately below the
   thyroid cartilage during quiet breathing. After segmentation and
   pre-processing, signal features were extracted in multiple domains
   (time, frequency, time-frequency). The effect of sensor position on
   signal feature distributions was examined with non-parametric
   statistical analysis. The analysis showed that the sensor could be
   displaced by as much as 4 mm inferior and lateral to the baseline
   position and by up to 6 mm above the baseline location without
   significantly altering time-frequency features. In other words, when
   considering the baseline position as the origin, the admissible region
   for sensor placement spans 10 mm in the superior-inferior axis and 8 mm
   in the medial-lateral direction. Results of this study suggest that
   time-frequency representations of accelerometry signals are most robust
   to sensor placement variations around the baseline position. The
   implication of this finding is that a swallowing accelerometry
   classifier based on time-frequency features can likely tolerate small
   variations in sensor location without degradation in classification
   performance. (C) 2015 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Multiscale properties of weighted total variation flow with applications
   to denoising and registration}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{28-42}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Images consist of structures of varying scales: large scale structures
   such as flat regions, and small scale structures such as noise,
   textures, and rapidly oscillatory patterns. In the hierarchical (BV,
   L-2) image decomposition, Tadmor, et al. (2004) start with extracting
   coarse scale structures from a given image, and successively extract
   finer structures from the residuals in each step of the iterative
   decomposition. We propose to begin instead by extracting the finest
   structures from the given image and then proceed to extract increasingly
   coarser structures. In most images, noise could be considered as a fine
   scale structure. Thus, starting the image decomposition with finer
   scales, rather than large scales, leads to fast denoising. We note that
   our approach turns out to be equivalent to the nonstationary
   regularization in Scherzer and Weickert (2000). The continuous limit of
   this procedure leads to a rime-scaled version of total variation flow.
   Motivated by specific clinical applications, we introduce an image
   depending weight in the regularization functional, and study the
   corresponding weighted TV flow. We show that the edge-preserving
   property of the multiscale representation of an input image obtained
   with the weighted TV flow can be enhanced and localized by appropriate
   choice of the weight. We use this in developing an efficient and
   edge-preserving denoising algorithm with control on speed and
   localization properties. We examine analytical properties of the
   weighted TV flow that give precise information about the denoising speed
   and the rate of change of energy of the images.
   An additional contribution of the paper is to use the images obtained at
   different scales for robust multiscale registration. We show that the
   inherently multiscale nature of the weighted TV flow improved
   performance for registration of noisy cardiac MRI images, compared to
   other methods such as bilateral or Gaussian filtering. A clinical
   application of the multiscale registration algorithm is also
   demonstrated for aligning viability assessment magnetic resonance (MR)
   images from 8 patients with previous myocardial infarctions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Purpose To validate a method of measuring grating acuity with remote
   gaze tracking (GT) against a current clinical test of visual acuity
   (VA), the Teller Acuity Cards (TACs), as part of the development of an
   automated VA test for infants.
   Methods Visual acuity for computer-generated horizontal square-wave
   gratings was determined from relative fixation time on a grating area
   compared with the background. In experiment 1, binocular VA was based on
   eye movements with a GT in 15 uncorrected myopic adults and compared
   with VA measured with subjective responses with the same stimuli and
   with the TACs. In experiment 2, binocular VA was determined in 19
   typically developing infants aged 3 to 11 months on two visits with both
   the GT and TACs.
   Results In adults, the mean difference between VA measured by the GT and
   TACs was 0.01 log cycles per degree (cpd) and the 95\% limits of
   agreement were 0.11. One hundred percent of GT VA results were within
   0.5 octave of the TACs' VAs. The mean difference between the GT and TACs
   for infants was 0.17 log cpd on both the first and second visit (95\%
   limits of agreement, 0.42 and 0.47, respectively). The mean difference
   between test and retest for infant GT VA was 0.06 log cpd, and limits of
   agreement for repeatability were 0.48 log cpd. In infants, both the TACs
   and the GT had a reliability of 89\% within less than or equal to 1
   octave between visits. Gaze tracking VA improved with age and is in
   agreement with published norms.
   Conclusions The agreement between the TACs and GT in adults and infants
   validates the method of measuring grating acuity with the remote GT.
   These results demonstrate its potential for an automated test of infant
   VA.}},

Abstract = {{Gamma KnifeA (R) Perfexion (TM) (PFX) is used for delivering
   radiosurgery plans to treat lesions and tumours in the brain by means of
   selectively ionizing the tissue with high-energy beams of radiation. An
   important component of designing PFX treatments is the selection of
   points in the target structure at which to focus the radiation, called
   isocentres. This study applies skeletonization methods to select such
   isocentres. Our skeletonization technique identifies clusters of each
   target structure's skeleton using distance coding methods. A
   user-defined number of isocentre locations are chosen from the skeletal
   clusters. The isocentres resulting from this approach are used as input
   to a sector duration optimization model that determines the optimal shot
   shapes and intensities for the radiation deposited at each isocentre.
   The results for seven clinical cases are presented. For each case,
   target structure dose and conformity meet clinical radiosurgery
   guidelines, while brainstem dose is kept to acceptable levels and other
   healthy organs are also spared.}},

Abstract = {{An ideal infinite impulse response (IIR) decision feedback equalizer
   (DFE) can have an effect on wireline received waveforms similar to a
   continuous-time equalizer, but without the associated amplification of

   significantly as the feedback loop delay increases. Fortunately, adding
   a single discrete-time tap can eliminate the degradation. The
   implementation of a half-rate DFE with two IIR taps and one
   discrete-time tap is presented here. The two IIR filters have different
   time constants to accommodate a variety of channel pulse responses
   having a long tail. The discrete-time tap cancels the first post-cursor
   inter-symbol interference (ISI) term and alleviates feedback loop timing
   issues. The DFE can receive data transmitted with a low swing of 150
   mVpp-diff through 24 dB of channel loss at half the bitrate while
   consuming 4.1 mW at 10 Gb/s. Digital foreground calibration of clock
   phase shifters and offset cancellation is described. The receiver,

Abstract = {{The analysis of cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs), which are present at
   significant levels in the blood of cancer patients, can reveal the
   mutational spectrum of a tumour without the need for invasive sampling
   of the tissue. However, this requires differentiation between the
   nucleic acids that originate from healthy cells and the mutated
   sequences shed by tumour cells. Here we report an electrochemical clamp
   assay that directly detects mutated sequences in patient serum. This is
   the first successful detection of cfNAs without the need for enzymatic
   amplification, a step that normally requires extensive sample processing
   and is prone to interference. The new chip-based assay reads out the
   presence of mutations within 15 minutes using a collection of
   oligonucleotides that sequester closely related sequences in solution,
   and thus allow only the mutated sequence to bind to a chip-based sensor.
   We demonstrate excellent levels of sensitivity and specificity and show
   that the clamp assay accurately detects mutated sequences in a
   collection of samples taken from lung cancer and melanoma patients.}},

Abstract = {{Many reductive dehalogenases (RDases) have been identified in
   organohalide-respiring microorganisms, and yet their substrates,
   specific activities, and conditions for expression are not well
   understood. We tested whether RDase expression varied depending on the
   substrate-exposure history of reductive dechlorinating communities. For
   this purpose, we used the enrichment culture KB-1 maintained on
   trichloroethene (TCE), as well as subcultures maintained on the
   intermediates cis-dichloroethene (cDCE) and vinyl chloride (VC). KB-1
   contains a TCE-to-cDCE dechlorinating Geobacter and several
   Dehalococcoides strains that together harbor many of the known
   chloroethene reductases. Expressed RDases were identified using blue
   native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, enzyme assays in gel slices,
   and peptide sequencing. As anticipated but never previously quantified,
   the RDase from Geobacter was only detected transiently at the beginning
   of TCE dechlorination. The Dehalococcoides RDase VcrA and smaller
   amounts of TceA were expressed in the parent KB-1 culture during
   complete dechlorination of TCE to ethene regardless of time point or
   amended substrate. The Dehalococcoides RDase BvcA was only detected in
   enrichments maintained on cDCE as growth substrates, in roughly equal
   abundance to VcrA. Only VcrA was detected in subcultures enriched on VC.
   Enzyme assays revealed that 1,1-DCE, a substrate not used for culture
   enrichment, afforded the highest specific activity. trans-DCE was
   substantially dechlorinated only by extracts from cDCE enrichments
   expressing BvcA. RDase gene distribution indicated enrichment of
   different strains of Dehalococcoides as a function of electron acceptor
   TCE, cDCE, or VC. Each chloroethene reductase has distinct substrate
   preferences leading to strain selection in mixed communities.}},

Abstract = {{The University of today is little changed from that of a century ago.
   Students attend lectures, sitting in rows of chairs rather than benches.
   The lecture notes are projected onto a screen; only occasionally are
   chalkboards used. The biggest change is with technology, in that lecture
   material is posted to a course website; a growing number of lectures are
   videotaped so that students can review the lecture whenever they wish.
   The pressures on universities come in the form of mandated quality
   programs. Programs are expected to define what it is that they expect
   their students to learn along with having a system that measures student
   learning, and a review process that identifies deficiencies and proposes
   solutions. Engineering programs are very good at imparting knowledge;
   these are the mathematics, natural science, and engineering science
   components of the curriculum. Programs are less successful at the
   industrially relevant aspects of the profession. The criteria are
   described in accreditation criteria, but there is no generally accepted
   curriculum model. All programs provide courses in thermodynamics, fluid
   mechanics, and reaction engineering, but many have no similar course on
   the management of safety. Further, the requisite industrial knowledge is
   not widely held within the university world. This paper provides a
   historical perspective on this issue, reviews attempts to improve the
   situation, and proposes improvements to address the situation.}},

Abstract = {{Aims/hypothesis Precise regulation of insulin secretion by the
   pancreatic beta cell is essential for the maintenance of glucose
   homeostasis. Insulin secretory activity is initiated by the stepwise
   breakdown of ambient glucose to increase cellular ATP via glycolysis and
   mitochondrial respiration. Knockout of Lkb1, the gene encoding liver
   kinase B1 (LKB1) from the beta cell in mice enhances insulin secretory
   activity by an undefined mechanism. Here, we sought to determine the
   molecular basis for how deletion of Lkb1 promotes insulin secretion.
   Methods To explore the role of LKB1 on individual steps in the insulin
   secretion pathway, we used mitochondrial functional analyses,
   electrophysiology and metabolic tracing coupled with by gas
   chromatography and mass spectrometry.
   Results Beta cells lacking LKB1 surprisingly display impaired
   mitochondrial metabolism and lower ATP levels following glucose
   stimulation, yet compensate for this by upregulating both uptake and
   synthesis of glutamine, leading to increased production of citrate.
   Furthermore, under low glucose conditions, Lkb1(-/-) beta cells fail to
   inhibit acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), the rate-limiting enzyme in
   lipid synthesis, and consequently accumulate NEFA and display increased
   membrane excitability.
   Conclusions/interpretation Taken together, our data show that LKB1 plays
   a critical role in coupling glucose metabolism to insulin secretion, and
   factors in addition to ATP act as coupling intermediates between feeding
   cues and secretion. Our data suggest that beta cells lacking LKB1 could
   be used as a system to identify additional molecular events that connect
   metabolism to cellular excitation in the insulin secretion pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Forest bioenergy can contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with energy production. We
   assessed changes in GHG emissions resulting from displacement of coal
   with wood pellets for the Atikokan Generating Station located in
   Northwestern Ontario, Canada. Two contrasting biomass sources were
   considered for continuous wood pellet production: harvest residue from
   current harvest operations (residue scenario) and fibre from expanded
   harvest of standing live trees (stemwood scenario). For the stemwood
   scenario, two metrics were used to assess the effects of displacing coal
   with forest biomass on GHG emissions: (i) time to carbon sequestration
   parity, defined as the time from the beginning of harvest to when the
   combined GHG benefit of displacing coal with biomass and the amount of
   carbon in regenerating forest equalled the amount of forest carbon
   without harvest for energy production; and (ii) time to carbon debt
   repayment, defined as the time from the beginning of harvest to when the
   combined GHG benefit of displacing coal with biomass and the amount of
   carbon in the regenerating forest equalled forest carbon at the time of
   harvest. Only time to carbon sequestration parity was used for the
   residue scenario. In the residue scenario, carbon sequestration parity
   was achieved within 1year. In the stemwood scenario, times to carbon
   sequestration parity and carbon debt repayment were 91 and 112years,
   respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that estimates were robust
   when parameter values were varied. Modelling experiments showed that
   increasing growth rates for regenerating stands in the stemwood scenario
   could substantially reduce time to carbon sequestration parity. We
   discuss the use of the two metrics (time to carbon sequestration parity
   and time to carbon debt repayment) for assessing the effects of forest
   bioenergy projects on GHG emissions and make recommendations on
   terminology and methodologies for forest bioenergy studies.}},

Title = {{A Complete Color Normalization Approach to Histopathology Images Using

Abstract = {{Goal: In digital histopathology, tasks of segmentation and disease
   diagnosis are achieved by quantitative analysis of image content.
   However, color variation in image samples makes it challenging to
   produce reliable results. This paper introduces a complete normalization
   scheme to address the problem of color variation in histopathology
   images jointly caused by inconsistent biopsy staining and nonstandard
   imaging condition. Method: Different from existing normalization methods
   that either address partial cause of color variation or lump them
   together, our method identifies causes of color variation based on a
   microscopic imaging model and addresses inconsistency in biopsy imaging
   and staining by an illuminant normalization module and a spectral
   normalization module, respectively. In evaluation, we use two public
   datasets that are representative of histopathology images commonly
   received in clinics to examine the proposed method from the aspects of
   robustness to system settings, performance consistency against
   achromatic pixels, and normalization effectiveness in terms of
   histological information preservation. Results: As the saturation
   weighted statistics proposed in this study generates stable and reliable
   color cues for stain normalization, our scheme is robust to system
   parameters and insensitive to image content and achromatic colors.
   Conclusion: Extensive experimentation suggests that our approach
   outperforms state-of-the-art normalization methods as the proposed
   method is the only approach that succeeds to preserve histological
   information after normalization. Significance: The proposed color
   normalization solution would be useful to mitigate effects of color
   variation in pathology images on subsequent quantitative analysis.}},

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{Most model-based approaches to fault diagnosis of discrete-event systems
   require a complete and accurate model of the system to be diagnosed.
   However, the discrete-event model may have arisen from abstraction and
   simplification of a continuous time system, or through model building
   from input-output data. As such, it may not capture the dynamic behavior
   of the system completely. In a previous paper, we addressed the problem
   of diagnosing faults given an incomplete model of the discreteevent
   system. We presented the learning diagnoser which not only diagnoses
   faults, but also attempts to learn missing model information through
   parsimonious hypothesis generation. In this paper, we study the
   properties of learnability and diagnosability. Learnability deals with
   the issue of whether the missing model information can be learned, while
   diagnosability corresponds to the ability to detect and isolate a fault
   after it has occurred. We provide conditions under which the learning
   diagnoser can learn missing model information. We define the notions of
   weak and strong diagnosability and also give conditions under which they
   hold.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Although concrete in compression and wood in flexural tension are both
   intrinsically brittle, composite beams made of these two materials can
   develop a reliable measure of softening before failure when ductile
   shear connectors are used to link concrete and wood, provided the
   connectors are dimensioned to yield before failure of wood or concrete.
   This article describes an analytical method for predicting the complete
   load-deflection response of timber/concrete composite beams with ductile
   shear connectors. The approach involves the superposition of results
   obtained from a series of linear models, each of which has a
   progressively smaller number of connectors corresponding to the order in
   which they yield. The nonlinear behavior of the system can thus be
   determined without iteration using only linear computations. The
   analytical method is validated against experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the piezoresistive behavior of polyethylene (PE)
   composites containing different types of carbon nanoparticle fillers.
   The fillers investigated are single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT),
   multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT), and graphene nanoplatelets (GNP),
   which were dispersed in PE through melt blending in concentrations
   ranging between 0.5 and 10 wt\%. The dispersion and nanocomposite
   morphology were investigated using scanning electron microscopy and
   X-ray diffraction with strong evidence found for shear-induced
   orientation of GNP nanoparticles during the compression molding process.
   The conductivity and permittivity of the composite materials was
   investigated using impedance spectroscopy and the lowest percolation
   threshold and highest electrical conductivity was observed for SWCNT
   composites, followed by MWCNT and GNP. The compressive piezoresistance
   of the nanocomposites was measured and the initial, elastic, and plastic
   deformation regions were all identifiable by the resistance
   measurements. The main finding of this study is that the piezoresistance
   of MWCNT nanocomposites is more sensitive to the effects of varying
   stress and composition than SWCNT nanocomposites. This indicates an
   evolving filler network in the case for MWCNT, while a static network
   for SWCNT, which is explained by the higher aspect ratio and surface
   area of the latter. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 55:1643-1651, 2015. (c) 2014

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objectives The implementation of electronic remote blood
   issue (ERBI) may provide safety and efficiency gains for transfusion
   medicine. This systematic review's objective was to assess whether ERBI
   affects incidents of adverse events, time taken for blood issue and
   delivery, and cross-match to transfusion ratios, among other measures of
   safety and efficiency. The review also sought to uncover barriers and
   facilitators of ERBI implementation.
   Materials and Methods We searched four aggregated electronic databases
   (Med-line, EMBASE, CINAHL and BIOSIS) up to 19 July 2012, with an
   updated search performed on 5 March 2014 for studies on ERBI. No
   specific study design criteria were used in the initial inclusion due to
   the low number of studies on ERBI.
   Results A total of 4758 citations were initially identified; after 1844
   duplicates were removed, 2612 citations were excluded on the basis of
   the abstract. Two reviewers evaluated a total of 302 full-text articles
   independently; of these, seven citations were eligible for inclusion. An
   updated search and the authors' own collections confirmed an additional
   five citations, totalling 13 citations and six studies within these.
   Conclusion There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether ERBI
   significantly impacts safety and efficiency of blood transfusion and
   delivery processes. Rigorously designed studies to assess safety and
   efficiency outcomes are required using proxy or corollary measures. A
   number of positive results were reported, however, and most studies
   included suggestions for facilitating ERBI implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Single-hole blast-induced damage in a granitic outcrop has been assessed
   through both controlled experiments and numerical simulations with a
   combined finite-discrete element method (FEM-DEM). Damage tomographies
   from decoupled short and long explosive charges in flooded boreholes
   were obtained through a high-resolution cross-hole system, by measuring
   pre- and post-blast seismic velocities around the blastholes. Damage was
   assessed through crack density, which was calculated by inversion of
   P-wave velocity measurements through an Effective Medium Theory (EMT)
   method. The resulting damage was found to be highly asymmetrical around
   each blast hole, both along the vertical and horizontal planes, despite
   the apparent isotropy and homogeneity of the granitic rock mass.
   Experimental results combined with numerical simulations carried out to
   assess damage from stress waves alone, showed that most damage from
   experiments was caused by the expansion of gases, while its magnitude
   and extension were strongly dependent on confining conditions along the
   blasthole. The difficulty of quantifying the relative contribution of
   stress waves and gas expansion and the problems inherent in prediction
   of blast-induced damage are described. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Sensitivity of Intersegmental Angles of the Spinal Column to Errors Due
   to Marker Misplacement}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{The ranges of angular motion measured using multisegmented spinal column
   models are typically small, meaning that minor experimental errors can
   potentially affect the reliability of these measures. This study aimed
   to investigate the sensitivity of the 3D intersegmental angles, measured
   using a multisegmented spinal column model, to errors due to marker
   misplacement. Eleven healthy subjects performed trunk bending in five
   directions. Six cameras recorded the trajectory of 22 markers,
   representing seven spinal column segments. Misplacement error for each
   marker was modeled as a Gaussian function with a standard deviation of 6
   mm, and constrained to a maximum value of 12 mm in each coordinate
   across the skin. The sensitivity of 3D intersegmental angles to these
   marker misplacement errors, added to the measured data, was evaluated.
   The errors in sagittal plane motions resulting from marker misplacement
   were small (RMS error less than 3.2 deg and relative error in the
   angular range less than 15\%) during the five trunk bending direction.
   The errors in the frontal and transverse plane motions, induced by
   marker misplacement, however, were large (RMS error up to 10.2 deg and
   relative error in the range up to 58\%), especially during trunk bending
   in anterior, anterior-left, and anterior-right directions, and were
   often comparable in size to the intersubject variability for those
   motions. The induced errors in the frontal and transverse plane motions
   tended to be the greatest at the intersegmental levels in the lower
   lumbar region. These observations questioned reliability of angle
   measures in the frontal and transverse planes particularly in the lower
   lumbar region during trunk bending in anterior direction, and thus did
   not recommend interpreting these measures for clinical evaluation and
   decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple layers of water on Au (111) surface are studied using first
   principle computations within the framework of Density Functional
   Theory. Gold surface coverage of one (1L), two (2L) and three (3L) water
   layers were analyzed. The ratio of Au surface atoms to water molecules
   in 1L, 2L, and 3L corresponds to 1:1, 1:2, and 1 :3, respectively. The
   first two water layers are unique in energy and structure as compared to
   ice like layers and are only stable at the interface. Thus the
   interfacial region was defined by the region created by the first two
   water layers. The third water layer adopts a structure that is close to
   that of an ice water layer in geometry and energy. The dielectric
   response of bulk water is recovered at the 3rd water layer signifying
   the transition from interfacial water to bulk water which occurs at a
   surface coverage that is greater than (2L). The first water layer is
   defined as the water bilayer which is adjacent to the Au (111) hexagonal
   surface. This bilayer structure changes significantly with the addition
   of the second water layer whereas additional layers added thereafter
   generate insignificant changes. The bilayer structure and hence the
   dielectric response of the layer is a function of the presence of
   surrounding water layers. The rapid decrease in the work function of
   gold with an increase in the number of water layers becomes less
   pronounced as more layers are added and asymptotically attains a
   constant value once the bulk properties of water are reproduced. The
   calculated decrease of work function for a surface coverage greater than
   2L matches the experimental results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   sterically confined and lying flat on the Cu substrate form an ordered,
   multi-domained, 2D oblique lattice. As coverage is increased beyond 1 ML
   the molecule-substrate interaction diminishes in strength while the
   intermolecular interaction begins to dominate, causing the layer
   separation to increase, and the crystal domain size and lattice
   constants to shrink as the crystal structure begins to more closely
   resemble the bulk alpha-phase CuPc molecular solid. This trend continues
   for the layer-by-layer growth of 3 complete ML, eventually giving way to
   the emergence of large 3D islands at a coverage equivalent to 4 ML (C)

Abstract = {{Socially Responsible Service Operations Management (SRSOM) can be
   defined as managerial activities to design and control (or optimize)
   various service operations that involve (or integrate) social
   responsibility toward legal, ethical, and environmental concerns. We
   propose a framework of research on SRSOM from the perspective of the
   service triad: target market, service concept, and service delivery
   system design choices. Unlike conventional service operations
   management, SRSOM focuses on: (1) non-voluntary citizens rather than
   voluntary customers as the main target group; (2) the provision of a
   general necessary service to citizens as the service concept; and (3)
   effectiveness and responsibility rather than efficiency as the service
   delivery system design choice. We also provide an overview of the
   related research on SRSOM published over the past 20 years, and attempt
   to place the seven papers shown in this collection in the proposed
   framework. While the current literature on SRSOM is limited, the number
   of papers has been steadily increasing. We hope that this paper will
   lead to further research on SRSOM among researchers and practitioners in
   related fields.}},

Abstract = {{The beam orientation optimization (BOO) problem for intensity-modulated
   radiation therapy (IMRT) is the selection of beams for radiation
   delivery. Conventionally, it is desirable for beams to be spatially
   separated to ensure a homogeneous dose. However, many BOO approaches
   yield clustered beams. This issue is especially prevalent for total
   marrow irradiation (TMI), where the target is very large and spread
   throughout the patient's body. Based on previous set-cover formulations
   of the BOO problem for TMI-IMRT, we propose an extension that enforces
   geometric beam constraints by iteratively removing beams violating
   geometric constraints within the set-cover framework. After beams are
   selected, they are used as input to a fluence map optimization solver to
   obtain optimal fluence maps. Results for a clinical TMI case meet
   clinical guidelines for target coverage and differentiation of organ and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Surface enhancement techniques such as shot peening are extensively used
   to increase the fatigue life of components in gas turbine engines. Due
   to the combined thermomechanical nature of the loading encountered
   within an engine, aeroengine designers have avoided incorporating the
   beneficial effects in their analysis. This can lead to overdesign and
   early retirement of critical engine components. A finite element
   modeling procedure is introduced that incorporates the shot peening
   residual stresses on a fir-tree turbine disk assembly. Unlike
   traditional equivalent loading approaches, the method models the actual
   impact of shots on the assembly and is the first time this approach is
   used to introduce peening residual stresses in turbine disks. In
   addition, the stability of these residual stresses in response to cyclic
   thermomechanical loadings at the contact interface is also studied. The
   results reveal that thermomechanical overload can nearly fully relax the
   shot peening residual stresses within the first cycle due to the
   combined effects of decreased material yield strength and plastic
   deformation. This work will enable aeroengine designers to assess
   critical surface treated components for structural integrity, optimal
   design, and residual life.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a rigid-flexible planar parallel manipulator (PPM)
   actuated by three linear ultrasonic motors for high-accuracy positioning
   is proposed. Based on the extended Hamilton's principle, a
   rigid-flexible dynamic model of the proposed PPM is developed utilizing
   exact boundary conditions. To derive an appropriate low-order dynamic
   model for the design of the controller, the assumed modes method is
   employed to discretize elastic motion. Then to investigate the
   interaction between the rigid and elastic motions, a proportional
   derivative feedback controller combined with a feed-forward-computed
   torque controller is developed to achieve motion tracking while
   attenuating the residual vibration. Then the controller is extended to
   incorporate an input shaper for the further suppression of residual

Pages = {{48-64}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of experimental and theoretical
   investigations on a novel form of pierced double skin composite wall
   (DSCW) system consisting of two skins of profiled steel sheeting with an
   in-fill of concrete. Nineteen composite walls are tested to failure
   under axial loading. The test variables include: types of profiled steel
   sheeting, types of load transfer device, size/orientation of
   opening/holes, wall height and types of strength enhancement devices
   around holes. The effects of each of these variables on axial
   load-deformation response, axial strength, steel-sheet concrete
   interaction, failure modes (including concrete core cracking and steel
   sheet buckling) and stress-strain development are critically evaluated.
   Strengthening of hole boundaries is found to be essential in enhancing
   the axial strength of the walls. The performance of strength enhancement
   devices installed in the walls is found satisfactory based on axial
   strength-deformation characteristics and failure modes of walls.
   Theoretical model for the prediction of axial strength of both pierced
   and non-pierced composite walls is developed taking into consideration
   the reduction of concrete capacity due to profiling and buckling of
   steel sheeting. The performance of the model is validated through
   comparisons with experimental results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A study is conducted with the aim of developing and implementing a
   fatigue prediction model for assessing the damage tolerance capabilities
   of polymer matrix composite structures. The damage mechanics based model
   uses empirical material parameters to represent orthotropic damage
   evolution. The model accounts for local multiaxial stresses as well as
   variable amplitude cyclic loading, which may result from local stress
   redistributions caused by damage evolution. The numerical results show
   the capability of the developed model to predict the variation of damage
   evolution and material property degradation in a tri-axially braided
   carbon fiber polymer matrix component. The predictions are validated by
   independent experiments on composite components using digital image
   correlation, which shows a strong correlation between the measured and
   predicted strain contours at various cyclic intervals. This is a key
   contribution and a step forward in developing a viable design tool for
   assessing the integrity and durability of composite structures. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Akaganeite-activated carbon (beta-FeOOH-AC) nano composite was prepared

   perchloroethylene (PCE) from water. The adsorption performance and
   mechanism of PCE from water by beta-FeOOH-AC is investigated through
   batch experiments including kinetics, thermodynamics and isothermal
   adsorption models. The results show that the PCE removal achieves
   97.83\% when the initial PCE concentration is 100 mg/L and sorbent
   dosage is 8 g/L at temperature 298 K. The kinetic data prove a closer
   fit to the pseudo-second order model. The isotherm data can be fit with
   Langmuir and Freundlich isothermal adsorption models. Additionally, the
   thermodynamic analysis indicates PCE adsorption on beta-FeOOH-AC is a
   spontaneous, endothermic, single and multi-layer combined physical
   adsorption process, and beta-FeOOH-AC has a strong PCE adsorption
   affinity. The excellent adsorption performance and low cost of the
   beta-FeOOH-AC can be considered as one of the effective options to
   remove PCE from contaminated water. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Precise alignment of femtosecond laser tracks in standard single mode
   optical fiber is shown to enable controllable optical tapping of the

   Asymmetric directional couplers are presented with tunable coupling

   wavelengths. Real-time fiber monitoring during laser writing permitted a
   means of controlling the coupler length to compensate for micron-scale
   alignment errors and to facilitate tailored design of coupling ratio,
   spectral bandwidth and polarization properties. Laser induced waveguide
   birefringence was harnessed for polarization dependent coupling that led
   to the formation of in-fiber polarization-selective taps with 32 dB
   extinction ratio. This technology enables the interconnection of light
   propagating in pre-existing waveguides with laser-formed devices,
   thereby opening a new practical direction for the three-dimensional
   integration of optical devices in the cladding of optical fibers and
   planar lightwave circuits. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{Genome-scale resources for Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum is a
   hemicellulose-degrading thermophilic anaerobe that was previously
   engineered to produce ethanol at high yield. A major project was
   undertaken to develop this organism into an industrial biocatalyst, but
   the lack of genome information and resources were recognized early on as
   a key limitation.
   Results: Here we present a set of genome-scale resources to enable the
   systems level investigation and development of this potentially
   important industrial organism. Resources include a complete genome
   sequence for strain JW/SL-YS485, a genome-scale reconstruction of
   metabolism, tiled microarray data showing transcription units, mRNA
   expression data from 71 different growth conditions or timepoints and
   GC/MS-based metabolite analysis data from 42 different conditions or
   timepoints. Growth conditions include hemicellulose hydrolysate, the
   inhibitors HMF, furfural, diamide, and ethanol, as well as high levels
   of cellulose, xylose, cellobiose or maltodextrin. The genome consists of
   a 2.7 Mbp chromosome and a 110 Kbp megaplasmid. An active prophage was
   also detected, and the expression levels of CRISPR genes were observed
   to increase in association with those of the phage. Hemicellulose
   hydrolysate elicited a response of carbohydrate transport and catabolism
   genes, as well as poorly characterized genes suggesting a redox
   challenge. In some conditions, a time series of combined transcription
   and metabolite measurements were made to allow careful study of
   microbial physiology under process conditions. As a demonstration of the
   potential utility of the metabolic reconstruction, the OptKnock
   algorithm was used to predict a set of gene knockouts that maximize
   growth-coupled ethanol production. The predictions validated intuitive
   strain designs and matched previous experimental results.
   Conclusion: These data will be a useful asset for efforts to develop T.
   saccharolyticum for efficient industrial production of biofuels. The
   resources presented herein may also be useful on a comparative basis for
   development of other lignocellulose degrading microbes, such as
   Clostridium thermocellum.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores how the rheological and crystallization properties
   of linear polypropylene (PP) are changed by incorporating fibrillated
   polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PET domains are fibrillated by melt
   blending with PP followed by drawing. In uniaxial extensional flows, the
   PP/fibrillated-PET shows strain hardening behavior, not observed for
   PP/PET blends with spherical PET domains or for the neat PP. At PET
   fibril contents >= 3 wt\%, a plateau appears in the storage modulus at
   low frequencies, indicating the formation of a percolated physical
   network of fibrils that responds elastically over long timescales.
   Avrami analysis of the crystallization of PP/fibrillated-PET at ambient
   and elevated CO2 pressures reveals that the PET fibrils enhance the
   kinetics of isothermal crystallization of PP under both pressure
   conditions. WAXS study shows that when PP/fibrillated-PET is
   isothermally crystallized at high pressures, gamma-phase crystal
   formation of PP is promoted which is representative of superior
   mechanical properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   fMRI}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 25}},
Abstract = {{Often we must balance being prepared to act quickly with being prepared
   to suddenly stop. The stop signal task (SST) is widely used to study
   inhibitory control, and provides a measure of the speed of the stop
   process that is robust to changes in subjects' response strategy.
   Previous studies have shown that preparation affects inhibition. We used
   fMRI to separate activity that occurs after a brief (500 ms) warning
   stimulus (warning-phase) from activity that occurs during responses that
   follow (response-phase). Both of these phases could contribute to the
   preparedness to stop because they both precede stop signals. Warning
   stimuli activated posterior networks that signal the need for top-down
   control, whereas response phases engaged prefrontal and subcortical
   networks that implement top-down control. Regression analyses revealed
   that both of these phases affect inhibitory control in different ways.
   Warning-phase activity in the cerebellum and posterior cingulate
   predicted stop latency and accuracy, respectively. By contrast,
   response-phase activity in fronto-temporal areas and left striatum
   predicted go speed and stop accuracy, in pre-supplementary motor area
   affected stop accuracy, and in right striatum predicted stop latency and
   accuracy. The ability to separate hidden contributions to inhibitory
   control during warning-phases from those during response-phases can aid
   in the study of models of preparation and inhibitory control, and of
   disorders marked by poor top-down control.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, lanthanum, yttrium, and cerium oxide coatings were
   fabricated on porous 430 stainless steel substrates by sal-gel dip
   coating and subsequent heat treatment at 650 degrees C in air. The
   effects of viscosity of the sal-gel solution, the withdrawal speed of
   the substrate from the solution, and the number of dipping and drying
   steps on coating thickness and coating morphologies were characterized
   by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). During subsequent heating at 800
   degrees C, the La2O3 layer reacted with Cr from the substrate to forma
   LaCrO3 layer on the substrate. The envelope of sal-gel dip coating
   parameters with which oxidation resistant coatings can be fabricated on
   porous stainless steel supports was determined from oxidation weight
   gain experiments of supports with various protective coatings. High
   temperature oxidation of the coated substrates showed that La2O3 and
   Y2O3 coatings were highly effective in decreasing the oxidation rates of
   the porous supports, while CeO2 coatings were not found to be as
   effective for the protection of metallic substrates for metal-supported
   SOFCs. Rough estimation of oxide layer thicknesses after 40,000 h based
   on calculated oxidation rates of the Y2O3-coated and La2O3-coated
   substrates in air at 800 degrees C showed that oxide growth filling the
   pore structure would not be the factor limiting the lifetime of
   Y2O3-coated and La2O3-coated supports for SOFCs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Metal phthalocyanities (MPcs) are versatile conjugated macrocycles that
   have attracted a great deal of interest as active components in modem
   organic electronic devices. In particular, the charge transport
   properties of MPcs, their chemical stability, and their synthetic
   versatility make them ideal candidate materials for use in organic
   thin-film transistors (OTFTs). This article reviews recent progress in
   both the material design and device engineering of MPc-based OTFTs,
   including the introduction of solubilizing groups on the MPcs and the
   surface modification of substrates to induce favorable MPc
   self-assembly. Finally, a discussion on emerging niche applications
   based on MPc OTFTs will be explored, in addition to a perspective and
   outlook on these promising materials in OTFTs. The scope of this review
   is focused primarily on the advances made in the field of MPc-based

Abstract = {{Organometal halide perovskites have recently attracted tremendous
   attention both at the experimental and theoretical levels. These
   materials, in particular methylammonium triiodide, are still limited by
   poor chemical and structural stability under ambient conditions. Today
   this represents one of the major challenges for polycrystalline
   perovskite-based photovoltaic technology. In addition to this, the
   performance of perovskite-based devices is degraded by deep localized
   states, or traps. To achieve better-performing devices, it is necessary
   to understand the nature of these states and the mechanisms that lead to
   their formation. Here we show that the major sources of deep traps in
   the different halide systems have different origin and character. Halide
   vacancies are shallow donors in I-based perovskites, whereas they evolve
   into a major source of traps in Cl-based perovskites. Lead
   interstitials, which can form lead dimers, are the dominant source of
   defects in Br-based perovskites, in line with recent experimental data.
   As a result, the optimal growth conditions are also different for the
   distinct halide perovskites: growth should be halide-rich for Br and Cl,
   and halide-poor for I-based perovskites. We discuss stability in
   relation to the reaction enthalpies of mixtures of bulk precursors with
   respect to final perovskite product. Methylammonium lead triiodide is
   characterized by the lowest reaction enthalpy, explaining its low
   stability. At the opposite end, the highest stability was found for the
   methylammonium lead trichloride, also consistent with our experimental
   findings which show no observable structural variations over an extended
   period of time.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main mechanisms of resistance to lincosamide and
   aminoglycoside antibiotics is their inactivation by
   O-nucleotidylyltransferases (NTases). Significant sequence variation of
   lincomycin nucleotidylyltransferase (Lnu) and aminoglycoside
   nucleotidylyltransferase (ANT) enzymes plus lack of detailed information
   about the molecular basis for specificity of these enzymes toward
   chemically distinct antibiotic scaffolds hinders development of a
   general strategy to curb this resistance mechanism. We conducted an
   extensive sequence analysis identifying 129 putative antibiotic NTases
   constituting six distinct subfamilies represented by Lnu(A), Lnu(B),
   Lnu(C), Lnu(D), Lnu(F)/(G) plus ANT(2{''}) enzymes. Since only the
   Lnu(B) enzyme has been previously studied in detail, we biochemically
   characterized the Lnu(A) and Lnu(D) enzymes, with the former
   representing the most sequence distinct Lnu ortholog. We also determined
   the crystal structure of the Lnu(A) enzyme in complex with a
   lincosamide. These data suggested that, while sharing the N-terminal
   nucleotidylyltransferase domain, the groups of antibiotic NTases feature
   structurally distinct C-terminal domains (CTDs) adapted to accommodate
   antibiotics. Comparative structural analysis among antibiotic NTases
   rationalized their specificity toward lincosamides versus
   aminoglycosides through active-site plasticity, which allows retention
   of general catalytic activity while accepting alterations at multiple,
   specific positions contributed by both domains. Based on this structural
   analysis, we suggest that antibiotic NTases evolved from an ancestral
   nucleotidylyltransferase along independent paths according to the
   identified groups, characterized by structural changes in the active
   site and recruitment of structurally diverse CTDs. These data show the
   complexity of enzyme-driven antibiotic resistance and provide a basis
   for broadly active inhibitors by identifying the key unifying features
   of antibiotic NTases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Organometal halide perovskites have recently attracted tremendous
   attention at both the experimental and theoretical levels. Much of this
   work has been dedicated to bulk material studies, yet recent
   experimental work has shown the formation of highly efficient
   quantum-confined nanocrystals with tunable band band edges. Here we
   investigate perovskite quantum dots from theory, an upper bound of the
   Bohr radius of 45 angstrom that agrees well with predicting literature
   values. When the quantum dots are stoichiometric, they are trap-free and
   have nearly symmetric contributions to confinement from the valence and
   conduction bands. We further show that surface-associated conduction
   bandedge states in perovskite nanocrystals lie below the bulk states,
   which could explain the difference in Urbach tails between mesoporous
   and planar perovskdte films. In addition to conventional molecular
   dynamics (MD), we implement an enhanced phase-space sampling algorithm,
   replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD). We find that in simulation
   of methylammonium orientation and global minima, REMD outperforms
   conventional MD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first REMD
   implementation for realistic-sized systems in the realm of DFT
   calculations.}},

Abstract = {{The isolation and rapid molecular characterization of circulating tumor
   cells (CTCs) from a liquid biopsy could enable the convenient and
   effective characterization of the state and aggressiveness of cancerous
   tumors. Existing technologies enumerate CTCS using immunostaining;
   however, these approaches are slow, labor-intensive, and often fail to
   enable further genetic characterization of CTCs. Here, we report on an
   integrated circuit that combines the capture of CTCs with the profiling
   of their gene expression signatures. Specifically, we use a velocity
   valley chip to efficiently capture magnetic nanopartide-bound CTCs,
   which are then directly analyzed for their gene expression profiles
   using nanostructured microelectrode biosensors. CTCs are captured with
   97\% efficiency from 2 mL of whole blood, yielding a 300-fold
   concentration within 1 h. We show efficient capture of as few as 2
   cancer cells/(mL of blood) and demonstrate that the gene expression
   module accurately profiles the expression of prostate-specific genes in
   CTCs captured from whole blood. This advance provides the first
   sample-to-answer solution for gene-based, testing of CTCs. The approach
   was successfully validated using samples collected from prostate cancer
   patients: both CTCs and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA sequences
   were detected in all cancer patient samples and not in the healthy
   controls.}},

Abstract = {{Optical tweezers have revolutionized our understanding of the
   microscopic world. Axial optical tweezers, which apply force to a
   surface-tethered molecule by directly moving either the trap or the
   stage along the laser beam axis, offer several potential benefits when
   studying a range of novel biophysical phenomena. This geometry, although
   it is conceptually straightforward, suffers from aberrations that result
   in variation of the trap stiffness when the distance between the
   microscope coverslip and the trap focus is being changed. Many standard
   techniques, such as back-focal-plane interferometry, are difficult to
   employ in this geometry due to back-scattered light between the bead and
   the coverslip, whereas the noise inherent in a surface-tethered assay
   can severely limit the resolution of an experiment. Because of these
   complications, precision force spectroscopy measurements have adapted
   alternative geometries such as the highly successful dumbbell traps. In
   recent years, however, most of the difficulties inherent in constructing
   a precision axial optical tweezers have been solved. This review article
   aims to inform the reader about recent progress in axial optical
   trapping, as well as the potential for these devices to perform
   innovative biophysical measurements.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{91-105}},
Month = {{JUN 16}},
Abstract = {{Discrete element modeling of granular flows is effective, but requires
   large numerical models. In an effort to reduce computational effort,
   this paper presents a finite element (FE) continuum model of the
   vibrationally fluidized granular flow produced by a tub vibratory
   finisher. The constitutive equations governing the continuum model were
   calibrated using the discrete element method (DEM). A constant stiffness
   was used for the normal contact of the polyurethane tub wall and the
   spherical steel media, and an effective coefficient of Coulomb friction
   was obtained by studying the variation of the shear and normal forces at
   different points along the tub wall using DEM simulations. The DEM
   predictions of the ratio of the tangential to normal contact forces
   showed that rolling of the media on the tub wall was much more common
   than sliding, and the average effective coefficient of friction was
   relatively uniform over the wall. Average values of the equivalent
   elastic and plastic properties of the media were used in the continuum
   model, neglecting the small local variations that existed within the
   vibrationally-fluidized bed. The bulk How behavior of the equivalent
   continuum media was then studied using both Lagrangian and Eulerian FE
   formulations. The bulk flow velocities predicted by the Lagrangian
   approach were in good agreement with those obtained using DEM
   simulations over a wide range of tub wall amplitudes. The qualitative
   trend of the local impact velocity distribution at various locations in
   the tub predicted by the DEM agreed with the trend predicted by the
   continuum model using the shear rate as a measure of the granular
   temperature and hence local velocity. The FE simulations required
   approximately 8 Limes less computing time than the equivalent DEM. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, a thermo-elasto-plastic model for the fiber-metal
   laminated (FML) beams is established and the mechanic characterization
   of a FML beam with interfacial damage under thermal environment is
   investigated. The elasto-plastic behavior of the FML beam is modeled by
   a macromechanical orthotropic plasticity theory, where the composite
   layers in the FML are assumed to be linearly elastic and the aluminum
   layers are taken as orthotropic elasto-plastic. Additionally, the
   thermal stresses in the FML beam are studied by introducing heat
   conduction equation. Considering the mismatch in properties of different
   layers, the interfacial damage is investigated based on cohesive zone
   model and shear-lag model, and the evolution of the interfacial damage
   is addressed as well. The incremental thermo-elasto-plastic governing
   equations for the FML beams are solved by finite difference method and
   iteration method. In the numerical simulations, the temperature
   variation, the elasto-plastic deformation and the interfacial damage
   evolution of the elasto-plastic FML beam are discussed in detail. The
   results show that mode II interfacial damage occurs at 1/4 and 3/4
   length of the beam and mode I damage is most likely to happen at the
   center. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3251-3265}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Classical methods of DOA estimation such as the MUSIC algorithm are
   based on estimating the signal and noise subspaces from the sample
   covariance matrix. For a small number of samples, such methods are
   exposed to performance breakdown, as the sample covariance matrix can
   largely deviate from the true covariance matrix. In this paper, the
   problem of DOA estimation performance breakdown is investigated. We
   consider the structure of the sample covariance matrix and the dynamics
   of the root-MUSIC algorithm. The performance breakdown in the threshold
   region is associated with the subspace leakage where some portion of the
   true signal subspace resides in the estimated noise subspace. In this
   paper, the subspace leakage is theoretically derived. We also propose a
   two-step method that improves the performance by modifying the sample
   covariance matrix such that the amount of the subspace leakage is
   reduced. Furthermore, we introduce a phenomenon named as root-swap which
   occurs in the root-MUSIC algorithm in the low sample size region and
   degrades the performance of the DOA estimation. A new method is then
   proposed to alleviate this problem. Numerical examples and simulation
   results are given for uncorrelated and correlated sources to illustrate
   the improvement achieved by the proposed methods. Moreover, the proposed
   algorithms are combined with the pseudo-noise resampling method to
   further improve the performance.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{264-273}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{An energy-based model is developed to predict the evolution of
   sub-critical matrix crack density in symmetric multidirectional
   composite laminates for the case of multiaxial loading. A finite
   element-based numerical scheme is also developed to evaluate the
   critical strain energy release rate, G(Ic), associated with matrix
   micro-cracking, a parameter that previously required fitting with
   experimental data. Furthermore, the prediction scheme is improved to
   account for the statistical variation of G(Ic), within the material
   volume by using a two-parameter Weibull distribution. The variation of
   G(Ic) with increasing crack density is also accounted for based on
   reported experimental evidence. The simulated results for carbon/epoxy
   and glass/epoxy cross-ply laminates demonstrate the ability of the
   improved model to predict the evolution of multidirectional ply
   cracking. By integrating this damage evolution model with the
   synergistic damage mechanics approach for stiffness degradation, the
   stress-strain response of the studied laminates is predicted. Finally,
   biaxial stress envelopes for ply crack initiation and predetermined
   stiffness degradation levels are predicted to serve as representative
   examples of stiffness-based design and failure criterion. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Disinfection by-product (DBP) formation may be a concern when applying
   ultraviolet light and free chlorine (UV/chlorine) as an advanced
   oxidation process (AOP) for drinking water treatment, due to typically
   large chlorine doses (e.g. 5-10 mg L-1 as free chlorine). A potential
   mitigating factor is the low chlorine contact times for this AOP
   treatment (e.g. seconds). Full-scale and pilot-scale test results showed
   minimal trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HAA) formation during
   UV/chlorine treatment, while dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) and
   bromochloroacetonitrile (BCAN) were produced rapidly. Adsorbable organic
   halide (AOX) formation was significant when applying the UV/chlorine
   process in water that had not been previously chlorinated, while little
   additional formation was observed in prechlorinated water. Chlorine
   photolysis led to chlorate and bromate formation, equivalent to
   approximately 2-17\% and 0.01-0.05\% of the photolyzed chlorine,
   respectively. No perchlorate or chlorite formation was observed. During
   simulated secondary disinfection of AOP-treated water, DBP formation
   potential for THMs, HAAs, HANs, and AOX was observed to increase
   approximately to the same extent as was observed for pretreatment using
   the more common AOP of UV combined with hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2). (C)

Abstract = {{The interfacial tension of poly lactic acid (PLA) melt is measured in
   supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) at the temperature range of 143
   degrees C to 168 degrees C and CO2 pressures up to 13,790 kpa, using
   axisymmetric drop shape analysis profile (ADSA-P). The results show a
   decrease in interfacial tension with increasing temperature and
   pressure. However, the interfacial tension dependency on temperature at
   high pressures decreases because of a reduction in CO2 solubility at
   high temperatures. The relationship between the interfacial tension and
   the density-difference of polymer-supercritical CO2 mixtures is also
   examined by the generalized Macleod's equation. Moreover, the range of
   stability for the melted drop, in interfacial tension measurements, is
   obtained by dimensionless Bond number. The results indicate the validity
   of the measurements for Bond number between 0.36 and 0.48. (C) 2015

Journal = {{ACS APPLIED MATERIALS \& INTERFACES}},

Pages = {{11939-11947}},

Abstract = {{This paper outlines an improved design of inexpensive, wireless and
   battery free biosensors for in situ monitoring of food quality. This
   type of device has an additional advantage of being operated remotely.
   To make the device, a portion of an antenna of a passive 13.56 MHz radio
   frequency identification (RFID) tag was altered with a sensing element
   composed of conductive nanofillers/particles, a binding agent, and a
   polymer matrix. These novel RFID tags were exposed to biogenic amine
   putrescine, commonly used as a marker for food spoilage, and their
   response was monitored over time using a general-purpose network
   analyzer. The effect of conductive filler properties, including
   conductivity and morphology, and filler functionalization was
   investigated by preparing sensing composites containing carbon particles
   (CPs), multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and binding agent
   grafted-multiwall carbon nanotubes (g-MWCNTs), respectively. During
   exposure to putrescine, the amount of reflected waves, frequency at
   resonance, and quality factor of the novel RFID tags decreased in
   response. The use of MWCNTs reduced tag cutoff time (i.e., faster
   response time) as compared with the use of CPs, which highlighted the
   effectiveness of the conductive nanofiller morphology, while the
   addition of g-MWCNTs further accelerated the sensor response time as a
   result of localized binding on the conductive nanofiller surface.
   Microstructural investigation of the film morphology indicated a better
   dispersion of g-MWCNTs in the sensing composite as compared to MWCNTs
   and CPs, as well as a smoother texture of the surface of the resulting
   coating. These results demonstrated that grafting of the binding agent
   onto the conductive particles in the sensing composite is an effective
   way to further enhance the detection sensitivity of the RFID tag based
   sensor.}},

Title = {{Spatial and temporal mapping of heterogeneity in liposome uptake and

Volume = {{207}},

Abstract = {{Existing paradigms in nano-based drug delivery are currently being
   challenged. Assessment of bulk tumor accumulation has been routinely
   considered an indicative measure of nanomedicine potency. However, it is
   now recognized that the intratumoral distribution of nanomedicines also
   impacts their therapeutic effect. At this time, our understanding of the
   relationship between the bulk (i.e., macro-) tumor accumulation of
   nanocarriers and their intratumoral (i.e., micro-) distribution remains
   limited. Liposome-based drug formulations, in particular, suffer from
   diminished efficacy in vivo as a result of transport-limiting
   properties, combined with the heterogeneous nature of the tumor
   microenvironment. In this report, we perform a quantitative image-based
   assessment of macro- and microdistribution of liposomes. Multi-scalar
   assessment of liposome distribution was enabled by a stable formulation
   which co-encapsulates an iodinated contrast agent and a near-infrared
   fluorescence probe, for computed tomography (CT) and optical microscopy,
   respectively. Spatio-temporal quantification of tumor uptake in
   orthotopic xenografts was performed using CT at the bulk tissue level,
   and within defined sub-volumes of the tumor (i.e., rim, periphery and
   core). Tumor penetration and relative distribution of liposomes were
   assessed by fluorescence microscopy of whole tumor sections.
   Microdistribution analysis of whole tumor images exposed a heterogeneous
   distribution of both liposomes and tumor vasculature. Highest levels of
   liposome uptake were achieved and maintained in the well-vascularized
   tumor rim over the study period, corresponding to a positive correlation
   between liposome and microvascular density. Tumor penetration of
   liposomes was found to be time- dependent in all regions of the tumor
   however independent of location in the tumor. Importantly, a
   multi-scalar comparison of liposome distribution reveals that macro-
   accumulation in tissues (e.g., blood, whole tumor) may not reflect
   micro- accumulation levels present within specific regions of the tumor
   as a function of time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pro-fibrotic microenvironments of scars and tumors characterized by
   increased stiffness stimulate mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to
   express alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). We investigated whether
   incorporation of a-SMA into contractile stress fibers regulates human
   MSC fate. Sorted alpha-SMA-positive MSCs exhibited high contractile
   activity, low clonogenicity, and differentiation potential limited to
   osteogenesis. Knockdown of alpha-SMA was sufficient to restore
   clonogenicity and adipogenesis in MSCs. Conversely, a-SMA overexpression
   induced YAP translocation to the nucleus and reduced the high
   clonogenicity and adipogenic potential of alpha-SMA-negative MSCs.
   Inhibition of YAP rescued the decreased adipogenic differentiation
   potential induced by alpha-SMA, establishing a mechanistic link between
   matrix stiffness, alpha-SMA, YAP, and MSC differentiation. Consistent
   with in vitro findings, nuclear localization of YAP was positively
   correlated in a-SMA expressing stromal cells of adiposarcoma and
   osteosarcoma. We propose that a-SMA mediated contraction plays a
   critical role in mechanically regulating MSC fate by controlling YAP/TAZ
   activation.}},

Abstract = {{The utility of stem cells and their progeny in adult transplantation
   models has been limited by poor survival and integration. We designed an
   injectable and bioresorbable hydrogel blend of hyaluronan and

   models, thereby gaining an understanding of its general applicability
   for enhanced cell distribution, survival, integration, and functional
   repair relative to conventional cell delivery in saline. HAMC improves
   cell survival and integration of retinal stem cell (RSC)-derived rods in
   the retina. The pro-survival mechanism of HAMC is ascribed to the
   interaction of the CD44 receptor with HA. Transient disruption of the
   retinal outer limiting membrane, combined with HAMC delivery, results in
   significantly improved rod survival and visual function. HAMC also
   improves the distribution, viability, and functional repair of neural
   stem and progenitor cells (NSCs). The HAMC delivery system improves cell
   transplantation efficacy in two CNS models, suggesting broad

   two separate injectable vaccines on the same day were randomized to
   rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix (TM)) first followed by the injectable
   vaccines and sucrose (Tootsweet (TM)) afterwards, or vice versa. Pain
   was assessed by blinded raters using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS,
   range 0-10) (parents, clinicians), or Modified Behavioural Pain Scale
   (MBPS, range 0-10) and cry duration (observers). Data were analyzed
   using t-tests or chi(2)-tests; Bonferroni correction was applied to
   correct for multiple comparisons, as appropriate.
   Results: Altogether, 120 infants participated: 60 were randomized to
   rotavirus vaccine first. Groups did not differ in demographics,
   including; age (p = 0.448) and sex (p = 0.464). The mean pain score
   (standard deviation) for both vaccine injections did not differ between
   infants given rotavirus vaccine first versus sucrose solution first:
   observer MBPS, parent NRS and clinician NRS scores were 7.4 (1.6) vs.
   7.7 (1.6), 4.9 (2.1) vs. 5.8 (2.1), and 4.2 (2.1) vs, 4.6 (2.2),
   respectively. Similarly, there was no difference between groups in cry
   duration.
   Conclusion: Rotavirus vaccine did not differ from sucrose solution in
   reducing injection-induced pain. Based on the findings, it is
   recommended that rotavirus vaccine be administered prior to injectable
   vaccines in infants aged 2 and 4 months. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUN 2}},
Abstract = {{Changes in psychological state have been proposed as a cause of
   variation in brain-computer interface performance, but little formal
   analysis has been conducted to support this hypothesis. In this study,
   we investigated the effects of three mental states fatigue, frustration,
   and attention on BCI performance. Twelve able-bodied participants were
   trained to use a two-class EEG-BCI based on the performance of
   user-specific mental tasks. Following training, participants completed
   three testing sessions, during which they used the BCI to play a simple
   maze navigation game while periodically reporting their perceived levels
   of fatigue, frustration, and attention. Statistical analysis indicated
   that there is a significant relationship between frustration and BCI
   performance while the relationship between fatigue and BCI performance
   approached significance. BCI performance was 7\% lower than average when
   self-reported fatigue was low and 7\% higher than average when
   self-reported frustration was moderate. A multivariate analysis of
   mental state revealed the presence of contiguous regions in mental state
   space where BCI performance was more accurate than average, suggesting
   the importance of moderate fatigue for achieving effortless focus on BCI
   control, frustration as a potential motivating factor, and attention as
   a compensatory mechanism to increasing frustration. Finally, a visual
   analysis showed the sensitivity of underlying class distributions to
   changes in mental state. Collectively, these results indicate that
   mental state is closely related to BCI performance, encouraging future
   development of psychologically adaptive BCIs.}},

Abstract = {{Pathological high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) (80-800 Hz) are
   considered biomarkers of epileptogenic tissue, but the underlying
   complex neuronal events are not well understood. Here, we identify and
   discuss several outstanding issues or conundrums in regards to the
   recording, analysis, and interpretation of HFOs in the epileptic brain
   to critically highlight what is known and what is not about these
   enigmatic events. High-frequency oscillations reflect a range of
   neuronal processes contributing to overlapping frequencies from the
   lower 80 Hz to the very fast spectral frequency bands. Given their
   complex neuronal nature, HFOs are extremely sensitive to recording
   conditions and analytical approaches. We provide a list of
   recommendations that could help to obtain comparable HFO signals in
   clinical and basic epilepsy research. Adopting basic standards will
   facilitate data sharing and interpretation that collectively will aid in
   understanding the role of HFOs in health and disease for translational
   purpose.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomous robots (manipulators or vehicles) may accumulate significant
   errors during their long-range motion to a desired position and
   orientation (pose). These errors, however, can be compensated for by
   subsequent local, short-range corrective actions to within random noise
   levels of the system. This paper presents a generic localization method
   for high-precision parallel kinematic mechanisms (PKMs) in order to
   allow them to accurately achieve their desired poses. The proposed
   method employs a novel non-contact spatial sensing technique combined
   with an iterative pose-correction procedure. The proposed sensing
   technique is based on the use of multiple spatial lines-of-sights (LOSs)
   emanating from a single source and `hitting' a planar position sensitive
   detector (PSD) placed on the PKM's platform. Using the positional
   feedback provided by the PSD, the instantaneous actual pose of the
   platform is accurately estimated. A pose-correction method is
   subsequently invoked to iteratively guide the platform to its desired
   location within noise levels. Extensive simulations were carried out to
   illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed localization method for a
   spatial PKM being developed in our laboratory.}},

Abstract = {{Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has emerged as a promising direction
   for next-generation network design. Due to its clean-slate and highly
   flexible design, it is believed to be the foundational principle for
   designing network architectures and improving their flexibility,
   resilience, reliability, and security. As the technology matures,
   research in both industry and academia has designed a considerable
   number of tools to scale software-defined networks, in preparation for
   the wide deployment in wide-area networks. In this paper, we survey the
   mechanisms that can be used to address the scalability issues in
   software-defined wide-area networks. Starting from a successful
   distributed system, the Domain Name System, we discuss the essential
   elements to make a large scale network infrastructure scalable. Then,
   the existing technologies proposed in the literature are reviewed in
   three categories: scaling out/up the data plane and scaling the control
   plane. We conclude with possible research directions towards scaling
   software-defined wide-area networks.}},

Abstract = {{This study compares fluorescence and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of ex
   vivo tumors and organs from tumor-bearing mice injected intravenously
   with ultrasmall (<3 nm) tiopronin-capped Au nanoparticles and compares
   the data with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).
   Good agreement is seen in particle distributions and concentrations at
   the organ level. The spatial resolution from the imaging techniques
   allows for localization of the particles within organ structures.
   Although the particles do not have a plasmon peak, their absorbance in
   the near-infrared (NIR) is sufficient for PA excitation. PA imaging
   shows an increase of signal as particle concentrations increase, with
   changes in spectrum if particles aggregate. Fluorescence imaging using
   the particles' native NIR emission shows agreement in general intensity
   in each organ, though quenching of emission can be seen at very high
   concentrations. Both of these imaging techniques are noninvasive and
   labor-saving alternatives to organ digestion and ICP-MS and may provide
   insight into cellular distribution of particles. The simple construct
   avoids the use of toxic semiconductor materials or dyes, relying upon
   the gold itself for both the fluorescence and PA signal. This provides a
   useful alternative to more complex approaches to multimodal imaging and
   one that is readily translatable to the clinic. (C) 2015 Society of

Abstract = {{Shape memory polymers (SMP) are a class of stimuli-responsive materials
   which can change shape upon activation. The objective of this study is
   to optimize the actuation (or shape recovery) properties of the
   biocompatible thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)/polylactic acid (PLA)
   shape memory polymer (SMP) blend by altering the blend composition and
   programming temperature. A comprehensive characterization of the shape
   memory, morphological, and actuation properties of TPU/PLA blends was
   carried out on 80/20, 65/35, and 50/50 TPU/PLA blends and neat TPU.
   Three programming temperatures were utilized: 25 degrees C (room
   temperature), 37 degrees C (body temperature), and 70 degrees C (above
   the glass transition temperature). The transition temperature (T-trans)
   range was characterized by recovering the samples between 30 degrees C
   and 100 degrees C, at 10 degrees C intervals. The results showed that
   the shape fixity ratio (R-f) increased significantly with increasing PLA
   composition and programming temperature, and the shape recovery ratio
   (120 was not dependent on the programming temperature. The T-trans
   increased with increasing programming temperature, and its range
   decreased with increasing PLA composition. The highest shape recovery
   force was observed in the 80/20 and 65/35 TPU/PLA blends programmed at
   70 degrees C, reaching up to 0.6 N/cm. These samples were able to lift a
   50 g weight during the shape recovery process. The actuation forces of
   the TPU/PLA blends in this study is an order of magnitude higher
   compared to the currently available biocompatible SMPs. Therefore, these
   SMP blends can be further developed into actuators for biomedical
   applications such as artificial muscles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide,
   necessitating the development of effective treatment strategies. A
   myocardial infarction involves the blockage of a coronary artery leading
   to depletion of nutrient and oxygen supply to cardiomyocytes and massive
   cell death in a region of the myocardium. Cardiac tissue engineering is
   the growth of functional cardiac tissue in vitro on biomaterial
   scaffolds for regenerative medicine application. This strategy relies on
   the optimization of the complex relationship between cell networks and
   biomaterial properties. In this review, we discuss important biomaterial
   properties for cardiac tissue engineering applications, such as
   elasticity, degradation, and induced host response, and their
   relationship to engineered cardiac cell environments. With these
   properties in mind, we also emphasize in vitro use of cardiac tissues
   for high-throughput drug screening and disease modelling.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death globally.
   Since the adult heart lacks the capacity to regenerate, loss of
   myocardium following myocardial infarction is irreversible and
   ultimately leads to failure to maintain cardiac function. In order to
   repopulate the areas of cell loss in the damaged hearts for restoration
   of cardiac function, cell transplantation/replacement has been
   extensively investigated. Recently, biomaterials have emerged as an
   approach to improve delivery and viability of cells for the regeneration
   of the damaged heart. Here we review the most common approaches in
   hydrogel-based cardiac tissue regeneration with particular focus on the

Abstract = {{A laboratory apparatus was constructed to simulate the operating
   conditions of recovery boiler smelt dissolving tanks and used to
   systematically study the interaction between molten smelt droplets and
   water. Experiments were performed on synthetic smelt made of 80 wt\%
   Na2CO3 and 20 wt\% NaCl at 800 degrees C, 900 degrees C, and 1000
   degrees C. The results show that upon contact with water, some smelt
   droplets explode immediately and break into small pieces, some require a
   delay time to explode, and others solidify without exploding. The
   probability of explosion strongly depends on water temperature and to
   some extent, smelt temperature. At a given smelt temperature, there
   exists a water temperature range below which explosion always occurs
   (the lower critical water temperature) and above which there is no
   explosion (the upper critical water temperature). The lower critical
   water temperature decreases with increasing smelt temperature, while the
   upper critical water temperature remains the same at 82 degrees C in all
   cases. Up to this upper critical water temperature, both the explosion
   delay time and explosion intensity increase with increasing water
   temperature. The data was used to construct a Smelt-Water Interaction
   Temperature (SWIT) diagram that can predict if a molten synthetic smelt
   droplet will explode in water at different smelt and water temperatures.}},

Title = {{Digital microfluidic immunocytochemistry in single cells}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We report a new technique called Digital microfluidic
   Immunocytochemistry in Single Cells (DISC). DISC automates protocols for
   cell culture, stimulation and immunocytochemistry, enabling the
   interrogation of protein phosphorylation on pulsing with stimulus for as
   little as 3 s. DISC was used to probe the phosphorylation states of
   platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and the downstream
   signalling protein, Akt, to evaluate concentration-and time-dependent
   effects of stimulation. The high time resolution of the technique
   allowed for surprising new observations-for example, a 10 s pulse
   stimulus of a low concentration of PDGF is sufficient to cause >30\% of
   adherent fibroblasts to commit to Akt activation. With the ability to
   quantitatively probe signalling events with high time resolution at the
   single-cell level, we propose that DISC may be an important new
   technique for a wide range of applications, especially for screening
   signalling responses of a heterogeneous cell population.}},

Title = {{CD24 tracks divergent pluripotent states in mouse and human cells}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Reprogramming is a dynamic process that can result in multiple
   pluripotent cell types emerging from divergent paths. Cell surface
   protein expression is a particularly desirable tool to categorize
   reprogramming and pluripotency as it enables robust quantification and
   enrichment of live cells. Here we use cell surface proteomics to
   interrogate mouse cell reprogramming dynamics and discover CD24 as a
   marker that tracks the emergence of reprogramming-responsive cells,
   while enabling the analysis and enrichment of transgene-dependent
   (F-class) and -independent (traditional) induced pluripotent stem cells
   (iPSCs) at later stages. Furthermore, CD24 can be used to delineate
   epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in mouse
   pluripotent culture. Importantly, regulated CD24 expression is conserved
   in human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), tracking the conversion of human
   ESCs to more naive-like PSC states. Thus, CD24 is a conserved marker for
   tracking divergent states in both reprogramming and standard pluripotent
   culture.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound (US) backscatter from bones depends on the mechanical
   properties and the microstructure of the interrogated bone. On the other
   hand, photoacoustics (PA) is sensitive to optical properties of tissue
   and can detect composition variation. Therefore, PA can provide
   complementary information about bone health and integrity. In this work,
   a comparative study of US backscattering and PA back-propagating signals
   from animal trabecular bones was performed. Both methods were applied
   using a linear frequency modulation chirp and matched filtering. A 2.2
   MHz ultrasonic transducer was employed to detect both signals. The use
   of the frequency domain facilitates spectral analysis. The variation of
   signals shows that in addition to sensitivity to mineral changes, PA
   exhibits sensitivity to changes in the organic part of the bone. It is,
   therefore, concluded that the combination of both modalities can provide
   complementary detailed information on bone health than either method
   separately. In addition, comparison of PA and US depthwise images shows
   the higher penetration of US. Surface scan images exhibit very weak
   correlation between US and PA which could be caused by the different
   signal generation origins in mechanical versus optical properties,
   respectively.}},
