Abstract = {{It is argued that the process of perception takes origin within physics
   itself. A simple, physical model of a biological sensory receptor unit,
   a unit which mediates perception at its most elemental level, is
   developed. This model will be not just a detector of sensory signals
   (like a light meter or sound level meter), but will transduce these
   signals to the level of consciousness. The properties of this physical
   model of the sensory receptor unit are drawn from classical physics.
   Because of its simplicity, the receptor model allows for perception of
   only discrete quantities of incident signal energy. My primary goal in
   presenting this reduced model of perception is to teach concepts without
   the need for detailed anatomy or physiology. Using the simple
   mathematical properties of the receptor model, we are able to derive a
   number of the empirical equations of sensory science. Since the idea has
   been advanced that the process of perception, at a fundamental level,
   belongs to physics whose validity is universal, it is suggested that the
   ``laws{''} of perception of the world manifested by organisms anywhere
   within the universe will be similar to the laws we observe here on
   earth. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Biomass ash alkalinity reduction for land application via CO2 from
   treated boiler flue gas}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{208-218}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Burning biomass fuels generates large quantities of ash products which
   contain plant nutrients, such as Ca, Mg, P and K. To return these
   nutrients back to forest soil, biomass ash could be spread onto forest
   soil. Although biomass ash land application can decrease soil acidity
   and restore soil nutrient balance, its high alkalinity presents some
   challenges in terms of direct land application. The high alkalinity
   affects the leachability of various ash components and adversely affects
   ground vegetation. In this paper, we will show how CO2 can be used to
   effectively decrease ash alkalinity. The use of CO2 aqueous solubility
   and bicarbonate reactivity will be shown to be essential. From the
   study, we found that the rate of CO2 absorption depends heavily on the
   moisture content of the ash. Thus, the amount of water that needs to be
   added to the cooled ash products is important. The rate is also
   influenced by the CO2 partial pressure in the gas, up to almost 15\% by
   volume. This concentration of CO2 is commonly found in treated flue gas
   providing an opportunity for CO2 capture. The work also reports on the
   effect of carbonation on the leachability of ash nutrients. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) stereocomplex formation in isothermal conditions
   in the absence and presence of a nucleating agent was studied from a
   rheological point of view due to sensitivity of viscoelastic properties
   to structural changes during this process. PDLA was melt blended in low
   concentrations with PLLA to produce a stereocomplex. Amorphous samples
   were prepared and crystallization was carried out in a rheometer at high
   temperatures to simulate melt processing conditions. Stereocomplexation
   was explored over time by measuring rheological parameters in small
   deformation oscillatory shear mode at a low frequency using parallel
   plate geometry. Kinetic data obtained by this means was compared to data
   from calorimetric studies, showing a different trend depending on the
   characterization method. Moreover, after the completion of
   crystallization, final crystalline structure was probed over a wide
   range of frequencies to investigate the rheological modification role of
   PDLA on PLLA major component. Differences in rheological characteristics
   of asymmetric PLLA/PDLA blends as compared to neat PLLA were associated
   to the structural changes happening because of the formation of the
   stereocomplex. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{In principle, quantum key distribution (QKD) offers unconditional
   security based on the laws of physics. Unfortunately, all previous QKD
   experiments assume perfect state preparation in their security analysis.
   Therefore, the generated key is not proven to be secure in the presence
   of unavoidable modulation errors. The key reason that modulation errors
   are not considered in previous QKD experiments lies in a crucial
   weakness of the standard Gottesman-Lo-L ``utkenhaus-Preskill (GLLP)
   model, namely, it is not loss tolerant and Eve may in principle enhance
   imperfections through losses. Here, we propose a QKD protocol that is
   loss tolerant to state preparation flaws. Importantly, we show
   conclusively that the state preparation process in QKD can be much less
   precise than initially thought. Our method can also be applied to other
   quantum cryptographic protocols.}},

Title = {{Development of the radical-stable Coprinus cinereus peroxidase (CiP) by

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{189}},
Pages = {{78-85}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Despite the potential use of peroxidases as industrial biocatalysts,
   their practical application is often impeded due to suicide inactivation
   by radicals generated in oxidative reactions. Using a peroxidase from
   Coprinus cinereus (CiP) as a model enzyme, we revealed a dominant factor
   for peroxidase inactivation during phenol oxidation, and we engineered
   radical-stable mutants by site-directed mutagenesis of an amino acid
   residue susceptible to modification by phenoxyl radical. Mass
   spectrometry analysis of inactivated CiP identified an adduct between
   F230 and a phenoxyl radical, and subsequently, the F230 residue was
   mutated to amino acids that resisted radical coupling. Of the F230
   mutants, the F230A mutant showed the highest stability against radical
   inactivation, retaining 80\% of its initial activity, while the
   wild-type protein was almost completely inactivated. The F230A mutant
   also exhibited a 16-fold higher turnover of the phenol substrate
   compared with the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, the F230A mutant was
   stable during the oxidation of other phenolic compounds, including
   m-cresol and 3-methoxyphenol. No structural changes were observed by
   UV-vis and CD spectra of CiP after radical coupling, implying that the
   F230-phenol radical adduct inactivated CiP by blocking substrate access
   to the active site. Our novel strategy can be used to improve the
   stability of other peroxidases inactivated by radicals. (C) 2014

Title = {{The effect of field-orientation on the magnetoelectric coupling in
   Terfenol-D/PZT/Terfenol-D laminated structure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{The field-orientation dependent magnetoelectric coupling is
   experimentally studied for a rectangular Terfenol-D/PZT/Terfenol-D
   laminated structure. The considered magnetic field, namely the dc-bias
   magnetic field or the ac-excitation magnetic field, is allowed to be
   spatially re-orientated between two orthogonal geometric dimensions of
   the composite. In the study, the direction of the excitation can be
   fixed in the longitudinal (Scheme-I) or thickness (Scheme-II)
   directions, while considering the bias orientation. Alternatively, the
   bias field can be restricted to the longitudinal (Scheme-III) or
   thickness (Scheme-IV) directions, while the excitation orientation is
   considered. The variation in magnetoelectric coefficient as a function
   of the bias magnitude is studied with special attention paid to the
   field-orientation dependency. For the testing schemes of I and II, the
   direction of the dc-bias field can be re-oriented by forming an angle
   with the fixed direction of the ac-excitation field. As the angle
   changes from 0 degrees to 90 degrees, the magnetoelectric coupling
   evolves from L-T mode to S-T surface shear for Scheme-I, and from T-T
   mode to S-T thickness shear for Scheme-II. The bias-field-orientation
   dependence demonstrates a complex pattern due to the varying overall
   state of anisotropy in Terfenol-D. In Scheme-I with low bias magnitude,
   the orientation dependence can be represented by the measured effective
   longitudinal piezomagnetic coefficient. In addition, the optimal bias
   field for maximum magnetoelectric coefficient is observed to linearly
   increase with the bias orientation angle. Alternatively, the orientation
   dependence in Schemes III and IV is more predictable due to the barely
   changed overall state of anisotropy. In this case, Scheme-III shows that
   the magnetoelectric coefficient decreases monotonically with the
   orientation angle and Scheme-IV indicates that the maximum coefficient
   is attained at around 60 degrees. The dependence of the magnetoelectric
   coupling on the excitation-filed orientation can be understood via
   analysis of the resultant magnetostriction in Terfenol-D with assumed
   effective magnetization, which may depart from the bias field due to the
   strong demagnetization effect. The analysis is supported by the computed
   field-orientation dependence of the magnetostriction in Terfenol-D. (C)

Pages = {{76-90}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{A grain based Distinct Element Method and its embedded Grain Based
   Method are used to simulate the fracturing processes leading to shear
   rupture zone creation in a calibrated massive (non-jointed) brittle rock
   specimen deformed in direct shear under constant normal stiffness
   boundary conditions. Under these boundary conditions, shear rupture zone
   creation relative to the shear stress versus applied horizontal
   displacement (load-displacement) curve occurs pre-peak, before the
   maximum peak shear strength is reached. This is found to be the result
   of a normal stress feedback process caused by the imposed shear
   displacement which couples increases in normal stress, due to rupture
   zone dilation, with shear stress, producing a complex normal-shear
   stress-path that reaches and then follows the rock's yield (strength)
   envelope. While the yield envelope is followed, the shear strength
   increases further and shear stress oscillations (repeated stress drops
   followed by re-strengthening periods) in the load-displacement curves
   occur due to fracture creation as the rupture zone geometry smoothens.
   Once the maximum peak strength is reached (after a series of shear
   stress oscillations) the largest stress drops occur as the ultimate or
   residual shear strength is approached. The simulation results provide
   insight into the fracturing process during rupture zone creation and
   improve the understanding of the shear stress versus applied horizontal
   displacement response, as well as the stick-slip behaviour of shear
   rupture zones that are being created under constant normal stiffness
   boundary conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A significant improvement in the photoluminescence of erbium doped
   amorphous carbon (a-C: H(Er)) is reported. The effects of the RF power
   on the anode and cathode a-C: H films were investigated in terms of the
   microstructural and local bonding features. It was determined that Er
   doped a-C: H films should be placed on the anode to obtain wider bandgap
   and lower percentage of sp(2) carbon bonding. The metalorganic compound,
   tris(6,6,7,7,8,8,8-heptafluoro-2,2-dimethyl-3,5-octanedionate)
   Erbium(+III) or Er(fod)(3), was incorporated in-situ into an a-C: H host
   by metalorganic rf plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. This
   technique provides the capability of doping Er in a vertically uniform
   profile. The high erbium concentration (3.9 at.\%), partial fluorination
   of the surrounding ligands, and the large optical bandgap of the host
   a-C: H are the primary factors that enable enhancement of the
   photoluminescence. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The periodic reactivity trend and the connection of kinetics to the
   thermodynamic activity of oxygen are established for the oxidation of
   methanol on metal clusters. First-order rate coefficients are a
   single-valued function of the O-2-to-CH3OH ratio, because this ratio,
   together with the rate constants for O-2 and CH3OH activation, determine
   the oxygen chemical potential, thus the relative abundance of active
   sites and bulk chemical state of the clusters. CH3OH activation rate
   constants on oxygen-covered Ag, Pt, and Pd and on RuO2 clusters vary
   with the metal-oxygen binding strength in a classical volcano-type
   relation, because the oxygen-binding strength directly influences the
   reactivities of oxygen as H abstractors during the kinetically relevant
   CH3OH activation step. The differences in oxygen thermodynamic activity
   lead to five orders of magnitude variation in rates (Pt > Pd > RuO2 >
   Ag, 373 K), because of its strong effects on the activation enthalpy and
   more prominently activation entropy in CH3OH activation.}},

Abstract = {{Optical packet switching is the next-generation disruptive technology
   for massive cloud data centers. All-optical routers, supporting
   wavelength parallelism, accelerate the execution of applications and
   facilitate server virtualization. Despite the recent advances in optical
   technologies, the greatest challenge in the realization of optical
   routers is the lack of a mature solution for buffering optical signals.
   Fiber delay lines (FDLs) have been proposed to emulate electronic
   buffering by delaying contending optical packets for a fixed amount of
   time. However, the practical limitation on the number of FDLs in a
   router requires its ports to be run at low utilization, sacrificing a
   significant portion of network capacity. In this paper, we introduce a
   novel modular router architecture based on wavelength-division
   multiplexed (WDM) recirculation buffers as a solution to the problem of
   limited buffering capacity. We propose a load-balancing scheduler to
   maximize throughput. Our mathematical analysis and Monte Carlo
   simulations show that the consolidation of optical buffers in WDM FDLs
   accompanied with internal load balancing leads to a virtually lossless
   router, resilient to data center traffic anomalies. The load balancing
   further minimizes the number of packet recirculations, leading to
   negligible queueing latency. Our design supports physical layer
   scalability and is amenable to large-scale optical integration.}},

Abstract = {{Structured-light (SL) techniques are emerging as popular noncontact
   approaches for obtaining three-dimensional (3-D) measurements of complex
   objects for real-time applications in manufacturing, bioengineering, and
   robotics. The performance of SL systems is determined by the emitting
   (i.e., projector) and capturing (i.e., camera) hardware components and
   the triangulation configuration between them and an object of interest.
   A generic design methodology is presented to determine optimal
   triangulation configurations for SL systems. These optimal
   configurations are determined with respect to a set of performance
   metrics: (1) minimizing the 3-D reconstruction errors, (2) maximizing
   the pixel-to-pixel correspondence between the projector and camera, and
   (3) maximizing the dispersion of the measured 3-D points within a
   measurement volume, while satisfying design constraints based on
   hardware and user-defined specifications. The proposed methodology
   utilizes a 3-D geometric triangulation model based on ray-tracing
   geometry and pin-hole models for the projector and camera. Using the
   methodology, a set of optimal system configurations can be determined
   for a given set of hardware components. The design methodology was
   applied to a real-time SL system for surface profiling of complex
   objects. Experiments were conducted with an optimal sensor configuration
   and its performance verified with respect to a nonoptimal hardware
   configuration. (C) 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Abstract = {{Wood ash is produced in large quantities in Canada as a by-product of
   the pulp and paper, sawmill, and bioenergy industries and it is
   anticipated that its disposal in landfills will not be a viable option.
   An alternative option may be to use it to amend forest soils. Wood ash
   is a complex mixture and its composition depends on several variables,
   including the combustion parameters of the boiler in which it is
   generated. We present an analysis of the amendment of two Canadian
   forest soils (a Brunisol from the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence and a Luvisol
   from the Carolinian forest regions of Ontario) with six different wood
   ashes collected from different biomass boilers through short-term
   controlled incubations. We show that following an 8-wk incubation
   period, amendment of the soils with wood ash led to small to moderate
   increases in soil pH, but had little effect on soil microbial activity
   and biomass. The concentration of important base cations such as
   calcium, magnesium and potassium as well as phosphorus generally
   increased in both soil types following amendment with different ash.
   This practice can return nutrients lost from forest ecosystems during
   harvesting; however, effects were found to be boiler-specific. Lastly,
   we show that four ash types led to small increases in cadmium in either
   soil; the concentration of all other measured heavy metals was not
   significantly increased following amendment, and in certain cases
   decreased, particularly with lead. The only potentially negative aspect
   encountered was elevated sodium, particularly with ash from one boiler,
   but unacceptable Na-absorptivity ratios were not exceeded. These results
   demonstrate that with proper characterization and selection of wood ash
   type and application rates, amendment of Canadian forest soils with wood
   ash may benefit forest ecosystems and is unlikely to disrupt the
   chemical and biological processes in soil environments.}},

Abstract = {{In a secondary spectrum market, the utility of a secondary user often
   depends on not only whether it wins, but also which channels it wins.
   Combinatorial auctions are a natural fit here to allow secondary users
   to bid for combinations of channels. In this context, the VCG mechanism
   constitutes a generic auction that uniquely guarantees both truthfulness
   and efficiency. There also exists related auction design that relaxes
   efficiency due to perceived complexity issues, and focuses on
   truthfulness. Starting with new empirical evidences on the complexity
   issue, we propose to design core-selecting auctions instead, which
   resolve VCG's vulnerability to collusion and shill bidding, and improve
   seller revenue. While the VCG type of auctions are unique in
   guaranteeing both efficiency and truthfulness, we prove that our
   core-selecting auctions are unique in guaranteeing both efficiency and
   shill-proofness, and always outperform VCG auctions in terms of seller
   revenue generated. Employing linear programming and quadratic
   programming techniques, we design two payment rules for minimizing the
   incentives of bidders to deviate from truth telling.}},

Abstract = {{We consider private commons for secondary sharing of licensed spectrum
   bands with no access coordination provided by the primary license
   holder. In such environments, heterogeneity in demand patterns of the
   secondary users can lead to constant changes in the interference levels,
   and thus can be a source of volatility to the utilities of the users. In
   this paper, we consider secondary users to be service providers that
   provide downlink services. We formulate the spectrum sharing problem as
   a non-cooperative iterated game of power control where service providers
   change their power levels to fix their long-term average rates at
   utility-maximizing values. First, we show that in any iterated 2x2 game,
   the structure of the single-stage game dictates the degree of control
   that a service provider can exert on the long-term outcome of the game.
   Then we show that if service providers use binary actions either to
   access or not to access the channel at any round of the game, then the
   long-term rate can be fixed regardless of the strategy of the opponent.
   We identify these rates and show that they can be achieved using mixed
   Markovian strategies which will be also identified in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the world and is likely
   to remain as such in the foreseeable future. There is a great deal of
   optimism for cardiac regenerative therapies because recent advances in
   stem cell technology have made it possible to derive millions of
   cardiomyocytes from human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent
   stem cells. These stem cell-derived cardiac cells also have an enormous
   potential in drug discovery, toxicology studies and fundamental cardiac
   physiology. Cardiomyocytes do not have well-established, specific
   surface markers to enable their separation from heterogeneous cultures
   using transient antibody labelling and traditional methods such as
   fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) or magnetic activated cell
   sorting (MACS). Therefore, a major obstacle in realizing their potential
   is the development of separation methods that are compatible with
   clinical applications and can isolate cardiomyocytes and specific
   cardiac cell subpopulations after in vitro culture in sufficient
   numbers, purity and quality. This review provides an overview of the
   present state of the art in labelled and label-free cardiomyocyte
   isolation, the challenges to the field and a perspective on the future
   of cardiac cell separation.}},

Abstract = {{The Biomedical Polymers Laboratory at the Institute of Biomaterials and
   Biomedical Engineering in Toronto in the Faculties of Applied Science
   and Engineering, Dentistry and Medicine is coordinated by Professor J
   Paul Santerre in the Institute's Biomaterials, Tissue engineering and
   Regenerative Medicine theme area. Research in the Santerre group is
   focused on new polymer synthesis and specifically polyurethane chemistry
   for biomedical implants and their bio-stability, conceiving new
   biomaterials for tissue engineering applications of vascular and
   connective tissues, and utilizing co-culture techniques as a means of
   circumventing complicated biochemical modifications of materials. In
   this reported work, D-PHI interactions in both two and three dimensional
   architectures with human gingival fibroblast (HGFs) and endothelial
   cells (ECs) show good cell growth, viability and collagen production
   relative to established degradable biomaterials such as
   polylactic-glycolic acid (PLGA) and tissue culture materials such as
   tissue culture polystyrene (TOPS). In addition, HGFs cultured on D-PHI
   show VEGF production under optimal perfusion flow conditions, thereby
   enabling the potential to contribute to micro-vessel formation when the
   materials are applied towards the development of gingival tissues. The
   work further shows the potential use of D-PHI as an elastomer under
   cyclic mechanical loading for vascular tissue engineering applications,
   as indicated by the material's ability to support an anti-inflammatory
   monocyte state, which combine to also support the growth and modulated
   contractile phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC).}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This paper investigates the effect of a feedback-reward
   system on speeding and tailgating behaviors. Background: Inappropriate
   speed choice and headway increase crash risks. A wide range of
   countermeasures such as law enforcement and educational messages are in
   effect to limit speeding and tailgating behaviors. However, these
   countermeasures are not tailored to the behavior of the individual, and
   may be absent in some situations. Emerging technology can circumvent the
   limits of current countermeasures by providing real-time feedback to
   alert the drivers to these inappropriate behaviors. Further, incentives
   can be utilized to increase drivers' motivation to adapt their driving
   behavior according to feedback. Previous research provides encouraging
   findings for both real-time feedback and incentives. Method: A field
   trial was conducted with 37 participants with the system installed in
   participants' own vehicles. Real-time in-vehicle feedback was provided
   based on speed limit compliance and safe headway maintenance.
   Participants also accumulated reward points and could view related
   information on a secured website. The trial consisted of three phases:
   baseline (two weeks), intervention with the system (twelve weeks), and
   post-intervention without the system (two weeks). Results: A cluster
   analysis based on baseline data revealed two driving styles: more speed
   and headway compliant (Cluster A), less speed and headway compliant
   (Cluster B). Overall, the intervention closed the gap between the two
   groups. For speed limit compliance, both groups became more compliant in
   the intervention phase with a slight decline in the post-intervention
   phase, which was still better than the baseline. For headway compliance,
   Cluster A did not have any changes throughout the trial, whereas for
   Cluster B, the headway compliance rate increased with the intervention
   and then decreased slightly in the post-intervention phase, which again
   was still better than the baseline. Conclusion: The results are
   promising, in particular as the group of drivers who were less speed and
   headway compliant during the baseline and needed the intervention more,
   benefited more from it. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Organization of airway epithelium determines ciliary beat direction and
   coordination for proper mucociliary clearance. Fluidic shear stresses
   have the potential to influence ciliary organization. Here, an in vitro
   fluidic flow system was developed for inducing long-term airflow shear
   stresses on airway epithelium with a view to influencing epithelial
   organization. Our system consists of a fluidic device for cell culture,
   integrated into a humidified airflow circuit. The fluidic device has a
   modular design and is made from a combination of polystyrene and
   adhesive components incorporated into a 6-well filter membrane insert.
   We demonstrate the system operates within physiologically relevant shear
   and pressure ranges and estimate the shear stress exerted on the
   epithelial cell layer as a result of air flow using a computational
   model. For both the bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS2B and primary
   human tracheal airway epithelial cells, we demonstrate that cells remain
   viable within the device when exposed to airflow for 24 h and that
   normal differentiation and cilia formation occurs. Furthermore, we
   demonstrate the utility of our device for exploring the impact of
   exposing cells to airflow: our tool enables quantification of
   cytoskeletal organization, and is compatible with in situ bead assays to
   assess the orientation of cilia beating. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We present analytical closed-form expressions for the radiation patterns
   of 2-D line sources and 3-D point dipoles embedded in a general
   multilayered configuration. While the former are simplified model
   sources, used as a preliminary analytical step to reduce derivation
   complexity, the latter have been shown experimentally to reproduce the
   electromagnetic behavior of many elementary statistical sources. By
   decomposing the sources to current elements generating pure transverse
   electric (TE) or transverse magnetic (TM) polarized radiation, we arrive
   at a unified format for the radiation pattern expression for all sources
   considered. Analyzing the common 1-D (characteristic) Green's function,
   we show that the normalized TE-polarized emission of model 2-D electric
   line sources reproduces exactly the measured TE-polarized radiation of
   statistical (3-D) dipoles with random in-plane orientation; the
   connection between the TM-polarized emission of the two species is
   discussed, and physical interpretation is provided via the unified
   expression. These results specify the precise relations between the 2-D
   and 3-D models, providing intuition as well as guidelines for proper
   usage of simplified 2-D results for analysis of realistic 3-D
   statistical configurations.}},

Abstract = {{Test specimens from a study on shear-critical reinforced concrete (RC)
   beams strengthened using fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) wraps were found
   to be poorly predicted using FRP design formulations from CAN/CSA S6-06
   and ACI 440.2R-08, which resulted in overpredicted FRP debonding
   failures and underpredicted rupture failures. In addition, some
   specimens reached FRP failure after the occurrence of flexural yielding,
   which is beyond the scope of current shear design provisions. An
   analytical method is presented to predict the load-deformation response
   of FRP strengthened beams, thereby determining ductility and accounting
   for shear failures that occur after flexural yielding. This paper also
   presents revised FRP strain limits for design based on developed
   theoretical expressions for debonding behavior. Presented strain limits
   for closed wraps account for both direct tensile rupture within the web
   and reduced rupture strain at the wrapped beam corners.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dot films have seen rapid progress as active materials
   in photodetection, light emission, and photovoltaics. Their processing
   from the solution phase makes them an attractive option for these
   applications due to the expected cost reductions associated with
   liquid-phase material deposition. Colloidally stable nanoparticles
   capped using long, insulating aliphatic ligands are used to form
   semiconducting, insoluble films via a solid-state ligand exchange in
   which the original ligands are replaced with short bifunctional ligands.
   Here we show that this ligand exchange can have unintended and undesired
   side effects: a high molecular weight complex can form, containing both
   lead oleate and the shorter conductive ligand, and this poorly soluble
   complex can end up embedded within the colloidal quantum dot (CQD)
   active layer. We further show that, by adding an acidic treatment during
   film processing, we can break up and wash away these complexes,
   producing a higher quality CQD solid. The improved material leads to
   photovoltaic devices with reduced series resistance and enhanced fill
   factor relative to controls employing previously reported CQD solids.}},

Abstract = {{Driving is a complex activity that requires intact cognitive,
   behavioral, and motor function. Stroke is one of the most prevalent
   neurologic impairments and can affect all of these functions. However,
   diagnosis of stroke is not a definitive indicator of driving impairment.
   Determining fitness to drive after stroke is a very complex process and
   is typically based on cognitive assessments, on-road performance,
   simulator based assessment, or a combination of the three. The aim of
   this review was to provide (1) a systematic review of the literature on
   cognitive, on-road, and simulator assessment after stroke, and (2)
   address the existing limitations and inconsistencies in stroke and
   driving research. Our results indicated that of 1413 total stroke
   patients, 748 definitively passed and 367 definitely failed an on-road
   assessment, with minimal information provided about clinical
   presentation. In addition, although the Stroke Driver Screening
   Assessment, the Useful Field of View Test, and the Rey-O Complex Figure
   test may have some utility in predicting driving performance, most
   cognitive measures have been inconsistently and minimally explored.
   Several limitations were observed across studies such as procedural
   inconsistencies, including outcome variables used (eg, driving cessation
   and pass/ fail classification) and the heterogeneity of patient samples
   (eg, time since stroke and stroke location). Due, in part, to the larger
   variability in results of cognitive, on-road, and simulator-based
   assessment, there is no consensus regarding a valid and reliable driving
   assessment for physicians. Future studies should assess poststroke
   driving fitness by differentiating different stages, severities, and
   locations of stroke.}},

Abstract = {{Photovoltaic devices based on lead iodide perovskite films have seen
   rapid advancements, recently achieving an impressive 17.9\% certified
   solar power conversion efficiency. Reports have consistently emphasized
   that the specific choice of growth conditions and chemical precursors is
   central to achieving superior performance from these materials; yet the
   roles and mechanisms underlying the selection of materials processing
   route is poorly understood. Here we show that films grown under
   iodine-rich conditions are prone to a high density of deep electronic
   traps (recombination centers), while the use of a chloride precursor
   avoids the formation of key defects (Pb atom substituted by I)
   responsible for short diffusion lengths and poor photovoltaic
   performance. Furthermore, the lowest-energy surfaces of perovskite
   crystals are found to be entirely trap-free, preserving both electron
   and hole delocalization to a remarkable degree, helping to account for
   explaining the success of polycrystalline perovskite films. We construct
   perovskite films from I-poor conditions using a lead acetate precursor,
   and our measurement of a long (600 +/- 40 nm) diffusion length confirms
   this new picture of the importance of growth conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Optogenetics is a novel technology that combines optics and genetics by
   optical control of microbial opsins, targeted to living cell membranes.
   The versatility and the electrophysiologic characteristics of the
   light-sensitive ion-channels channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), halorhodopsin
   (NpHR), and the light-sensitive proton pump archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch)
   make these optogenetic tools potent candidates in controlling neuronal
   firing in models of epilepsy and in providing insights into the
   physiology and pathology of neuronal network organization and
   synchronization. Opsins allow selective activation of excitatory neurons
   and inhibitory interneurons, or subclasses of interneurons, to study
   their activity patterns in distinct brain-states in vivo and to dissect
   their role in generation of synchrony and seizures. The influence of
   gliotransmission on epileptic network function is another topic of great
   interest that can be further explored by using light-activated Gq
   protein-coupled opsins for selective activation of astrocytes. The
   ever-growing optogenetic toolbox can also be combined with emerging
   techniques that have greatly expanded our ability to record specific
   subtypes of cortical and hippocampal neurons in awake behaving animals
   such as juxtacellular recording and two-photon guided whole-cell
   recording, to identify the specific subtypes of neurons that are altered
   in epileptic networks. Finally, optogenetic tools allow rapid and
   reversible suppression of epileptic electroencephalography (EEG)
   activity upon photoactivation. This review outlines the most recent
   advances achieved with optogenetic techniques in the field of epilepsy

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of throughput maximization in an
   energy-harvesting two-hop amplify-and-forward relay network. We obtain
   optimal policies for transmission power for two cases. First, we assume
   non-causal knowledge of the harvested energy and that of the fading
   channel states. Then, we assume that this information is known only
   causally. We propose an effective algorithm to solve the power-use
   problem in the non-causal (offline) case. For the causal (online) case,
   we cast the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve the
   resulting optimization problem using only causal knowledge of the fading
   and the harvested energy. This MDP approach yields good performance, but
   at the cost of computational complexity. To address this issue, we
   consider the case where the power control at the transmitting nodes is
   limited to on-off switching. We derive interesting properties for the
   optimal solutions to the MDP formulation for this special case.
   Furthermore, using these properties, we propose a computationally simple
   power allocation scheme. The performances of the proposed schemes are
   evaluated using computer simulations and are compared to existing
   methods which address the same problem.}},

Abstract = {{The rising cost of fossil fuel is a recognized phenomenon, but its
   impact at the household level is still widely unknown. Understanding how
   the socioeconomic impacts of rising fuel prices might be distributed
   across urban areas is a critical issue that is necessary for sustainable
   urban transportation planning. This study has refined the vulnerability
   index for petrol expense rises (VIPER) framework {[}previously proposed
   by Dodson and Sipe Urban Stud 44(1):37-62, (2007)] by incorporating
   travel survey data to better represent households' car dependence.
   Through this modified VIPER framework, we seek to understand how the
   socioeconomic impact of rising fuel costs will be distributed across the
   greater toronto area. The findings of this research reveal a pattern in
   the distribution of oil vulnerability that depicts a three-ring
   configuration: expanding outwards from the lowest oil vulnerability in
   the urban core (1st ring), followed by the highest oil vulnerability in
   the city's inner suburbs (2nd ring), and a transition to a lower oil
   vulnerability in the suburban areas (3rd ring). Such results reveal the
   need for transportation and land use policy measures that tackle the

Title = {{Influence of different rehabilitation therapy models on patient
   outcomes: Hand function therapy in individuals with incomplete SCI}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SPINAL CORD MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{734-743}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: The primary objective was to compare the benefits of single
   (COT1) versus double (COT2) dose of conventional occupational therapy
   (COT) in improving voluntary hand function in individuals with
   incomplete, sub-acute C3-C7 spinal cord injury (SCI). The secondary
   objective was to compare these two interventions versus functional
   electrical stimulation therapy plus COT (FES + COT).
   Design: Retrospective analysis.
   Setting: Inpatient spinal cord rehabilitation center, Toronto.
   Participants: Individuals with traumatic incomplete sub-acute SCI.
   Interventions: Data from Phases I and II (ClinicalTrials.gov ID
   NCT00221117) randomized control trials were pooled together for the
   purpose of this study. Participants in the COT1 group received 45 hours
   of therapy, the COT2 group received 80 hours of therapy, and the FES +
   COT group received 40 hours of COT therapy + 40 hours of FES therapy.
   Outcome measures: We analyzed the functional independence measure (FIM)
   and the spinal cord independence measure (SCIM) self-care sub-scores.
   Results: The mean change scores on the FIM self-care sub-score for the
   COT1, COT2, and FES + COT groups were 12.8, 10, and 20.1 points,
   respectively. Similarly, the mean change scores on the SCIM self-care
   sub-score for the COT1, COT2, and FES + COT groups were, 2.6, 3.16, and
   10.2 points, respectively.
   Conclusion: Increased rehabilitation intensity alone may not always be
   beneficial. The type of intervention plays a significant role in
   determining functional changes. In this instance, receiving one (COT1)
   or two (COT2) doses of COT resulted in similar outcomes, however, FES +
   COT therapy yielded much better outcomes compared to COT1 and COT2
   interventions.}},

Title = {{Multi-atlas segmentation of the whole hippocampus and subfields using
   multiple automatically generated templates}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{494-512}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Advances in image segmentation of magnetic resonance
   images (MRI) have demonstrated that multi-atlas approaches improve
   segmentation over regular atlas-based approaches. These approaches often
   rely on a large number of manually segmented atlases (e.g. 30-80) that
   take significant time and expertise to produce. We present an algorithm,
   MAGeT-Brain (Multiple Automatically Generated Templates), for the
   automatic segmentation of the hippocampus that minimises the number of
   atlases needed whilst still achieving similar agreement to multi-atlas
   approaches. Thus, our method acts as a reliable multi-atlas approach
   when using special or hard-to-define atlases that are laborious to
   construct.
   Method: MAGeT-Brain works by propagating atlas segmentations to a
   template library, formed from a subset of target images, via
   transformations estimated by nonlinear image registration. The resulting
   segmentations are then propagated to each target image and fused using a
   label fusion method. We conduct two separate Monte Carlo
   cross-validation experiments comparing MAGeT-Brain and basic multi-atlas
   whole hippocampal segmentation using differing atlas and template
   library sizes, and registration and label fusion methods. The first
   experiment is a 10-fold validation (per parameter setting) over 60
   subjects taken from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Database
   (ADNI), and the second is a five-fold validation over 81 subjects having
   had a first episode of psychosis. In both cases, automated segmentations
   are compared with manual segmentations following the Pruessner-protocol.
   Using the best settings found from these experiments, we segment 246
   images of the ADNI1: Complete 1Yr 1.5T dataset and compare these with
   segmentations from existing automated and semi-automated methods: FSL
   FIRST, FreeSurfer, MAPER, and SNT. Finally, we conduct a leave-one-out
   cross-validation of hippocampal subfield segmentation in standard 3T
   T1-weighted images, using five high-resolution manually segmented
   atlases (Winterburn et al., 2013).
   Results: In the ADNI cross-validation, using 9 atlases MAGeT-Brain
   achieves a mean Dice's Similarity Coefficient (DSC) score of 0.869 with
   respect to manual whole hippocampus segmentations, and also exhibits
   significantly lower variability in DSC scores than multi-atlas
   segmentation. In the younger, psychosis dataset, MAGeT-Brain achieves a
   mean DSC score of 0.892 and produces volumes which agree with manual
   segmentation volumes better than those produced by the FreeSurfer and
   FSL FIRST methods (mean difference in volume: 80 mm(3), 1600 mm(3), and
   800 mm(3), respectively). Similarly, in the ADNI1: Complete 1Yr 1.5T
   dataset, MAGeT-Brain produces hippocampal segmentations well correlated
   (r > 0.85) with SNT semi-automated reference volumes within disease
   categories, and shows a conservative bias and a mean difference in
   volume of 250 mm(3) across the entire dataset, compared with FreeSurfer
   and FSL FIRST which both overestimate volume differences by 2600 mm(3)
   and 2800 mm(3) on average, respectively. Finally, MAGeT-Brain segments
   the CA1, CA4/DG and subiculum subfields on standard 3T T1-weighted
   resolution images with DSC overlap scores of 0.56, 0.65, and 0.58,
   respectively, relative to manual segmentations.
   Conclusion: We demonstrate that MAGeT-Brain produces consistent whole
   hippocampal segmentations using only 9 atlases, or fewer, with various
   hippocampal definitions, disease populations, and image acquisition
   types. Additionally, we show that MAGeT-Brain identifies hippocampal
   subfields in standard 3T T1-weighted images with overlap scores
   comparable to competing methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The use of thermographic phosphors for high-temperature (> 1000 K)
   thermometry currently is limited by loss of signal due to thermal
   quenching. This work demonstrates a new phosphor generated by
   substituting tetrahedral site Al3+-O2- in YAG:Dy with B3+-N3- to produce
   YABNG:Dy. Conventional YAG:Dy and YABNG:Dy phosphors were synthesized
   using identical solgel synthesis techniques. X-ray diffraction
   measurements showed that both had nearly pure crystalline phases, with a
   minor secondary yttrium-aluminum-monoclinic (YAM) phase present in the
   YABNG:Dy. The YABNG:Dy sample had a larger and more spherical primary
   grain than did the YAG:Dy in scanning electron microscopy images. Tests
   of the thermal response showed that the YABNG:Dy had much stronger
   phosphorescence emissions than did YAG:Dy, likely due to the
   morphological differences. Furthermore, the onset of thermal quenching
   was delayed by approximately 100 K for YABGN:Dy compared to YAG:Dy, and
   the rate of signal decrease with temperature was reduced. This resulted
   in greater signal-to-noise ratios and less uncertainty in the
   temperature measurements, particularly at high temperatures. (C) 2014

Journal = {{SYNTHETIC METALS}},

Volume = {{197}},
Pages = {{34-47}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The main focus of this study is the multiobjective optimization of a
   trilayer actuator comprising two layers of polypyrrole and a PVDF
   membrane core. Since the performance of these actuators is difficult to
   predict due to their mechanical and chemical properties, optimizing
   their output behaviors such as their generated tip displacement and
   blocking force is of crucial importance. The optimization process leads
   to exploit the full potentials of these trilayer actuators, and more
   significantly, increase their performance predictability. Considering
   mechanical and chemical characteristics of the bending actuators, two
   mathematical models are developed to capture their performance in terms
   of tip blocking force and vertical displacement. Results obtained from
   both models explicitly indicate the trade-off between the two designated
   outputs. The optimization models include a system of nonlinear equations
   along with their corresponding constraints. A multiobjective genetic
   algorithm and a nonlinear programming solver in MATLAB were employed to
   solve the mathematical models. Ultimately, the results obtained from the
   two developed optimization methodologies were experimentally verified.
   For this purpose, a trilayer PPy based actuator was fabricated and
   related measurements were performed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Evaluation of an Emergency Department Lean Process Improvement Program
   to Reduce Length of Stay}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{427-438}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Study objective: In recent years, lean principles have been applied to
   improve wait times in the emergency department (ED). In 2009, an ED
   process improvement program based on lean methods was introduced in
   Ontario as part of a broad strategy to reduce ED length of stay and
   improve patient flow. This study seeks to determine the effect of this
   program on ED wait times and quality of care.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all ED visits at
   program and control sites during 3 program waves from April 1, 2007, to
   June 30, 2011, in Ontario, Canada. Time series analyses of outcomes
   before and after the program and difference-in-differences analyses
   comparing changes in program sites with control sites were conducted.
   Results: In before-after models among program sites alone, 90th
   percentile ED length of stay did not change in wave 1 (-14 minutes
   {[}95\% confidence interval \{CI\} -47 to 20]) but decreased after wave
   2 (-87 {[}95\% CI -108 to -66]) and wave 3 (-33 {[}95\% CI -50 to -17]);
   median ED length of stay decreased after wave 1 (-18 {[}95\% CI -24 to
   -12]), wave 2 (-23 {[}95\% CI -27 to -19]), and wave 3 (-15 {[}95\% CI
   -18 to -12]). In all waves, decreases were observed in time to physician
   assessment, left-without-being-seen rates, and 72-hour ED revisit rates.
   In the difference-in-difference models, in which changes in program
   sites were compared with controls, the program was associated with no
   change in 90th percentile ED length of stay in wave 2 (17 {[}95\% CI
   -0.2 to 33]) and increases in wave 1 (23 {[}95\% CI 0.9 to 45]) and wave
   3 (31 {[}95\% CI 10 to 51]), modest reductions in median ED length of
   stay in waves 2 and 3 alone, and a decrease in time to physician
   assessment in wave 3 alone.
   Conclusion: Although the program reduced ED waiting times, it appeared
   that its benefits were diminished or disappeared when compared with that
   of control sites, which were exposed to system-wide initiatives such as
   public reporting and pay for performance. This study suggests that
   further evaluation of the effectiveness of lean methods in the ED is
   warranted before widespread implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Affinity-based release systems use transient interactions to sustain and
   control the release of a therapeutic from a polymeric matrix. The most
   common affinity-based systems use heparin-based scaffolds to sustain the
   release of heparin-binding proteins, such as fibroblast growth factor-2
   (FGF2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, novel
   affinity-based systems based on, for example, proteinprotein or
   DNAprotein interactions, are emerging to control the release of an
   expanding repertoire of therapeutics. Mathematical models of
   affinity-based systems have provided a thorough understanding of which
   parameters affect release rate from these systems, and how these release
   rates can be tuned. In this review, recent affinity-based release
   systems will be described, including an overview of the various types of
   affinity interactions used to modulate release, the mechanisms by which
   release from these systems is tuned, and the time scales of sustained
   release. This advanced drug delivery paradigm provides tunable and
   predictable release rates and has expanded the scope of deliverable
   therapeutics for tissue repair and regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the development of 3-dimensional engineered heart
   tissue (EHT) has made large strides forward because of advances in stem
   cell biology, materials science, prevascularization strategies, and
   nanotechnology. As a result, the role of tissue engineering in cardiac
   regenerative medicine has become multifaceted as new applications become
   feasible. Cardiac tissue engineering has long been established to have
   the potential to partially or fully restore cardiac function after
   cardiac injury. However, EHTs may also serve as surrogate human cardiac
   tissue for drug-related toxicity screening. Cardiotoxicity remains a
   major cause of drug withdrawal in the pharmaceutical industry. Unsafe
   drugs reach the market because preclinical evaluation is insufficient to
   weed out cardiotoxic drugs in all their forms. Bioengineering methods
   could provide functional and mature human myocardial tissues, ie,
   physiologically relevant platforms, for screening the cardiotoxic
   effects of pharmaceutical agents and facilitate the discovery of new
   therapeutic agents. Finally, advances in induced pluripotent stem cells
   have made patient-specific EHTs possible, which opens up the possibility
   of personalized medicine. Herein, we give an overview of the present
   state of the art in cardiac tissue engineering, the challenges to the
   field, and future perspectives.}},

Abstract = {{Despite advances in coronary artery disease treatment and prevention,
   myocardial damage due to acute myocardial infarction (MI) remains a
   major cause of morbidity and mortality in the population. Cell-based
   clinical trials to treat MI have focused on cells derived from the bone
   marrow or those potentially possessing functional similarities such as
   skeletal myoblasts or cardiac progenitors isolated from heart biopsies.
   Any benefits provided by these cells in improving heart function, left
   ventricular ejection fraction, or extending life expectancy after MI
   have been credited mostly to paracrine effects. Functional restoration
   of damaged myocardium will require a functional cell type with similar
   phenotype and characteristics of the damaged tissue that can also
   integrate, survive, and electrically couple to the host. Human
   pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have the ability to differentiate into
   multiple cell types of the adult body. hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes
   represent a promising target population for cell-based therapies for MI
   because they are scalable and the product can be defined with a specific
   set of release criteria. The purpose of this article is to review the
   rationale for cell therapy in heart disease, discuss the properties of
   hPSC cardiomyocytes that define their usefulness for regenerative
   therapy, consider manufacturing issues and preclinical investigation,
   and finally examine the steps required to establish effective clinical
   implementation. Pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte-based
   therapies have enormous potential to revolutionize the management of
   heart disease; expedient but careful development is needed to ensure
   that this potential is fully realized.}},

Abstract = {{We present a semianalytical formulation of the interaction between a
   given source field and a scalar Huygens metasurface (HMS), a recently
   introduced promising concept for wavefront manipulation based on a sheet
   of orthogonal electric and magnetic dipoles. Utilizing the equivalent
   surface impedance representation of these metasurfaces, we establish
   that an arbitrary source field can be converted into directive radiation
   via a passive lossless HMS if two physical conditions are met: 1) local
   power conservation and 2) local impedance equalization. Expressing the
   fields via their plane-wave spectrum and harnessing the slowly-varying
   envelope approximation, we obtain semianalytical formulae for the
   scattered fields, and prescribe the surface reactance required for the
   metasurface implementation. The resulting design procedure indicates
   that the local impedance equalization induces a Fresnel-like reflection,
   while local power conservation forms a radiating virtual aperture which
   follows the total excitation field magnitude. The semianalytical
   predictions are verified by finite-element simulations of HMSs designed
   for different source configurations. Besides serving as a flexible
   design procedure for HMS radiators, the proposed formulation also
   provides a robust mechanism to incorporate a variety of source
   configurations into general HMS models, as well as physical insight on
   the conditions enabling purely reactive implementation of this novel
   type of metasurfaces.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the sequential transmission of a stream of messages over a
   block-fading multi-input-multi-output channel. A new message arrives at
   the beginning of each coherence block, and the decoder is required to
   output each message sequentially, after a delay of T coherence blocks.
   In the special case when T = 1, the setup reduces to the quasi-static
   fading channel. We establish the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff
   (DMT) in the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime, and show that it
   equals T times the DMT of the quasi-static channel. The converse is
   based on utilizing the delay constraint to amplify a local outage event
   associated with a message, globally across all the coherence blocks.
   This approach appears to be new. We propose two coding schemes that
   achieve the optimal DMT. The first scheme involves interleaving of
   messages, such that each message is transmitted across T consecutive
   coherence blocks. This scheme requires the knowledge of the delay
   constraint at both the encoder and decoder. Our second coding scheme
   involves a sequential tree code and is delay universal, i.e., the
   knowledge of the decoding delay is not required by the encoder. However,
   in this scheme, we require the coherence block length to increase as log
   (SNR), in order to attain the optimal DMT. Finally, we discuss the case
   when multiple messages arrive at uniform intervals within each coherence
   period. Through a simple example, we exhibit the suboptimality of
   interleaving and propose another scheme that achieves the optimal DMT.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that information will play an important role in
   enhancing emerging smart grid system operation. Therefore, questions
   naturally arise as to when the increased data-dependence may be
   considered excessive. Two practical considerations emerge: 1)
   communications and computational overhead, in which redundant and
   irrelevant information acquisition and use results in heavy
   computational burden with limited performance return; and 2) increasing
   risks of power system disruption due to information delay from
   communication congestion or cyber attack. One strategy to improve smart
   grid resilience is to determine the appropriate degree of dependence on
   cyber information to balance performance with overhead and risk. In this
   paper, we present a hierarchical cyber-physical multiagent model of
   smart grid system operation based on flocking theory in the context of
   the transient stability problem. Through this model, we study strategies
   that harness a selective degree of cyber technology by leveraging
   physical couplings. Our formulation enables the identification of
   large-scale distributed control strategies for robust and resilient
   power grid operation. We demonstrate the potential performance
   improvements of our findings on the New England 39-bus power system for
   case studies involving a variety of system faults and communication
   delays.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: One important challenge in image-guided ablative therapies is
   the effect of heat diffusion which can cause damage to surrounding
   organs and limit the ability to achieve a conformal pattern of thermal
   damage. Furthermore, tissue properties such as perfusion and energy
   absorption can be dynamic and difficult to measure. This paper attempts
   to address these problems by proposing new control methods. Materials
   and methods: A novel predictive approach was developed to compensate for
   the effect of heat diffusion using a minimally invasive rotating
   ultrasound heating applicator for ablative therapy. This method can be
   merged into any closed-loop control strategy. A binary controller, a
   previously developed adaptive proportional-integral controller, and a
   model reference adaptive controller were employed and compared, all with
   the predictive element incorporated. The reason for choosing these
   controllers was that none of them needed a model of the tissue or exact
   values of their parameters. Results: The effectiveness of these
   controllers was demonstrated through both simulation and experimental
   studies. The results were consistent and demonstrated equivalent
   performance between controllers. Conclusions: The dominant influence on
   radial targeting accuracy was the prediction element described in this
   paper. A binary controller with a predictive element may provide the
   best balance of performance and simplicity for this application.}},

Abstract = {{K-band spectra are presented for a sample of 39 Spitzer Infrared

   positions in the near-infrared-Spitzer color-magnitude diagrams and
   their properties as deduced from the Spitzer IRS spectra. Specifically,
   the near-infrared spectra show strong atomic and molecular features
   representative of oxygen-rich and carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch
   stars, respectively. A small subset of stars was chosen from the
   luminous and red extreme ``tip{''} of the color-magnitude diagram. These
   objects have properties consistent with dusty envelopes but also cool,
   carbon-rich ``stellar{''} cores. Modest amounts of dust mass loss
   combine with the stellar spectral energy distribution to make these
   objects appear extreme in their near-infrared and mid-infrared colors.
   One object in our sample, HV 915, a known post-asymptotic giant branch

Abstract = {{Expansin and expansin-related proteins loosen plant cell wall
   architectures and are widely distributed in several types of organisms,
   including plants, fungi and bacteria. Here we describe sequence
   diversity and unique gene expression profiles of multiple
   expansin-related proteins identified in the basidiomycete, Phanerochaete
   carnosa. The protein sequences were homologous to loosenin, an
   expansin-related protein reported in the basidiomycete, Bjerkandera
   adusta. We identified homologous sequences of each of those P. carnosa
   proteins in many basidiomycete species. Twelve P. carnosa loosenin-like
   proteins (LOOLs) were classified into two subgroups according to
   sequence homology. Conservation of polysaccharide-binding amino acid
   residues was stricter in subgroup A. Subgroup A sequences included a
   conserved 8-9 amino acid insertion in a polysaccharide-binding groove
   whereas subgroup B contained a 12-18 amino acid insertion next to the
   binding groove. The P. carnosa genome also encodes the expansin-related
   protein, DREX1, which adopts a loosenin-like structure but has lower
   sequence homology to other LOOLs. The gene expression analysis of those
   proteins showed distinct patterns that were not significantly related to
   subgroupings. The variation in the protein sequences and gene expression
   patterns, and wide distribution among the basidiomycota, suggest that
   the diverse cell wall loosening proteins contribute to effective plant
   cell wall association and utilization by basidiomycetes. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Alternative splicing (AS) of precursor RNAs is responsible for greatly
   expanding the regulatory and functional capacity of eukaryotic genomes.
   Of the different classes of AS, intron retention (IR) is the least well
   understood. In plants and unicellular eukaryotes, IR is the most common
   form of AS, whereas in animals, it is thought to represent the least
   prevalent form. Using high-coverage poly(A)(+) RNA-seq data, we observe
   that IR is surprisingly frequent in mammals, affecting transcripts from
   as many as three-quarters of multiexonic genes. A highly correlated set
   of cis features comprising an ``IR code{''} reliably discriminates
   retained from constitutively spliced introns. We show that IR acts
   widely to reduce the levels of transcripts that are less or not required
   for the physiology of the cell or tissue type in which they are
   detected. This ``transcriptome tuning{''} function of IR acts through
   both nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and nuclear sequestration and turnover
   of IR transcripts. We further show that IR is linked to a cross-talk
   mechanism involving localized stalling of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and
   reduced availability of spliceosomal components. Collectively, the
   results implicate a global checkpoint-type mechanism whereby reduced
   recruitment of splicing components coupled to Pol II pausing underlies
   widespread IR-mediated suppression of inappropriately expressed
   transcripts.}},

Abstract = {{Intrinsic wave attenuation at seismic frequencies is strongly dependent
   on rock permeability, fluid properties, and saturation. However, in
   order to use attenuation as an attribute to extract information on
   rock/fluid properties from seismic data, experimental studies on
   attenuation are necessary for a better understanding of physical
   mechanisms that are dominant at those frequencies. An appropriate
   laboratory methodology to measure attenuation at seismic frequencies is
   the forced oscillation method, but technical challenges kept this
   technique from being widely used. There is a need for the
   standardization of devices employing this method, and a comparison of
   existing setups is a step towards it. Here we summarize the apparatuses
   based on the forced oscillation method that were built in the last 30

Abstract = {{This paper presents the fundamental concepts of a generalized central
   power management system and a decentralized, robust control strategy for
   autonomous mode of operation of a microgrid that includes multiple
   distributed energy resource (DER) units. DER units are divided into
   voltage-controlled and power-controlled DER units. The frequency of each
   DER unit is determined by its independent internal oscillator and all
   oscillators are synchronized by a common time-reference signal based on
   a global positioning system (GPS). The power management system (PMS)
   specifies the power and voltage set points for the local controllers of
   each DER unit. A linear, time-invariant, multivariable, robust,
   decentralized control system is designed to track the setpoints. Each
   control agent guarantees fast tracking, zero steady state error, and
   robust performance despite uncertainties of the microgrid parameters,
   topology, and the operating point. Existence conditions, control design
   procedures, eigenanalysis and robust stability analysis of the
   closed-loop system, and performance of the control strategy based on
   digital time-domain simulation studies in PSCAD/EMTDC platform, are
   reported. Performance of the control system is also verified based on
   hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) studies in the RTDS environment.}},

Abstract = {{This study, conducted between 2010 and 2012, compares the winter quality
   of storm water outflows from one pervious concrete and two permeable
   interlocking concrete pavement systems with runoff from an asphalt
   control pavement. The permeable pavement systems were designed for
   partial infiltration with underdrains. During the winter, the pavements
   were plowed and, occasionally, salted. Analyses are based on samples of
   permeable pavement effluent and asphalt runoff collected for 19 events
   over two winter seasons. The permeable pavement systems performed
   similarly and provided excellent storm water treatment during winter
   months by reducing event mean concentrations (EMC) and total pollutant
   loadings for petroleum hydrocarbons, total suspended solids, metals
   (copper, iron, manganese, and zinc), and nutrients (total-nitrogen and
   total-phosphorus). The permeable pavements were also shown to provide
   temporary storage and create opportunities for the dilution of sodium
   and chloride in outflows. Road salt was identified as a pollutant source
   for numerous pollutants beyond sodium and chloride. Freezing conditions
   did not inhibit the functionality of the permeable pavement systems for
   storm water treatment. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Although soft-story mechanisms are generally undesirable for the seismic
   response of building structures, they provide potential benefits caused
   by the isolating effect they produce for the stories located above. In
   this paper, an approach for enhancing the seismic response of soft-story
   structures is proposed that takes advantage of the positive aspects of
   their response while mitigating the negative ones. To this end, an
   additional gapped-inclined brace (GIB) is introduced to reduce the
   impact of P-Delta effects on the displacement demands and to increase
   the deformation capacity of existing columns in soft stories without
   significantly increasing their lateral resistance. The mechanics of the
   proposed system are first defined, and theoretical relations and
   numerical models are then derived to verify the response. The cyclic
   behavior of a single-degree-of-freedom single-bay RC frame is then
   investigated numerically to illustrate the effect of the retrofitted
   system on the global response of a structure. The analytical results
   indicate that the hysteretic response of the retrofitted system is
   highly improved in terms of the energy dissipation and the residual
   deformation while not significantly increasing the overall strength of
   the structure. Although the equations governing the response of the
   system are derived for a single story, the concept is primarily intended
   to be applicable to multistory buildings. (C) 2014 American Society of

Abstract = {{The partitioning of corrosion inhibitor (CI) products is a measure of

   of a series of anionic (alkoxylated phosphate esters) and cationic
   (alkoxylated amines, aromatic amines, imidazoline acetates and
   quaternary amines) actives. This parameter is expressed over a range of
   pHs within which pipeline corrosion occurs. The HLD model is next used
   to predict the partitioning of each active from water into toluene at
   increased salinities. Linear mixing rules are lastly used to predict the
   characteristic curvature of Product A (C (c,mix)) as a function of the C
   (c,act) of a subset of actives.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a chain extender (CE) was added to polylactide (PLA) to
   improve its foamability. The steady and transient rheological properties
   of neat PLA and CE-treated PLA revealed that the introduction of the CE
   profoundly affected the melt viscosity and elasticity. The linear
   viscoelastic properties of CE-enriched PLA suggested that a long-chain
   branching (LCB) structure was formed from the reaction with the CE.
   LCB-PLA exhibited an increased viscosity, more shear sensitivity, and
   longer relaxation time in comparison with the linear PLA. The LCB
   structure was also found to affect the transient shear stress growth and
   elongational flow behavior. LCB-PLA exhibited a pronounced strain
   hardening, whereas no strain hardening was observed for the linear PLA.
   Batch foaming of the linear and LCB-PLAs was also examined at foaming
   temperatures of 130, 140, and 155 A degrees C. The LCB structure
   significantly increased the integrity of the cells, cell density, and

   reducing these errors.
   Methods The study focused on medication verification and administration
   in an ambulatory chemotherapy setting. A simulation laboratory
   experiment was conducted to determine interruption-related error rates
   during specific medication verification and administration tasks.
   Interventions to reduce these errors were developed through a
   participatory design process, and their error reduction effectiveness
   was assessed through a postintervention experiment.
   Results Significantly more nurses committed medication errors when
   interrupted than when uninterrupted. With use of interventions when
   interrupted, significantly fewer nurses made errors in verifying
   medication volumes contained in syringes (16/18; 89\% preintervention
   error rate vs 11/19; 58\% postintervention error rate; p=0.038; Fisher's
   exact test) and programmed in ambulatory pumps (17/18; 94\%
   preintervention vs 11/19; 58\% postintervention; p=0.012). The rate of
   error commission significantly decreased with use of interventions when
   interrupted during intravenous push (16/18; 89\% preintervention vs
   6/19; 32\% postintervention; p=0.017) and pump programming (7/18; 39\%
   preintervention vs 1/19; 5\% postintervention; p=0.017). No
   statistically significant differences were observed for other medication
   verification tasks.
   Conclusions Interruptions can lead to medication verification and
   administration errors. Interventions were highly effective at reducing
   unanticipated errors of commission in medication administration tasks,
   but showed mixed effectiveness at reducing predictable errors of
   detection in medication verification tasks. These findings can be
   generalised and adapted to mitigate interruption-related errors in other
   settings where medication verification and administration are required.}},

Abstract = {{We study solar cell properties of single silicon wires connected at
   their ends to two dissimilar metals of different work functions. Effects
   of wire dimensions, the work functions of the metals, and minority
   carrier lifetimes on short circuit current as well as open circuit
   voltage are studied. The most efficient photovoltaic behavior is found
   to occur when one metal makes a Schottky contact with the wire, and the
   other makes an Ohmic contact. As wire length increases, both short
   circuit current and open circuit voltage increase before saturation
   occurs. Depending on the work function difference between the metals and
   the wire dimensions, the saturation length increases by approximately an
   order of magnitude with a two order magnitude increase in minority
   carrier length. However current per surface area exposed to light is
   found to decrease rapidly with increase in length. The use of a
   multi-contact interdigitated design for long wires is investigated to
   increase the photovoltaic response of the devices. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{11, SI}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The natural-language approach to identifying biological analogies
   exploits the existing format of much biological knowledge, beyond
   databases created for biomimetic design. However, designers may need to
   select analogies from search results, during which biases may exist
   toward: specific words in descriptions of biological phenomena, familiar
   organisms and scales, and strategies that match preconceived solutions.
   Therefore, we conducted two experiments to study the effect of
   abstraction on overcoming these biases and selecting biological
   phenomena based on analogical similarities. Abstraction in our
   experiments involved replacing biological nouns with hypernyms. The
   first experiment asked novice designers to choose between a phenomenon
   suggesting a highly useful strategy for solving a given problem, and
   another suggesting a less-useful strategy, but featuring bias elements.
   The second experiment asked novice designers to evaluate the relevance
   of two biological phenomena that suggest similarly useful strategies to
   solve a given problem. Neither experiment demonstrated the anticipated
   benefits of abstraction. Instead, our abstraction led to: (1)
   participants associating nonabstracted words to design problems and (2)
   increased difficulty in understanding descriptions of biological
   phenomena. We recommend investigating other ways to implement
   abstraction when developing similar tools or techniques that aim to
   support biomimetic design.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between a mildly underexpanded supersonic jet and a
   single cylinder was studied experimentally at laboratory scale by using
   the schlieren technique coupled with high-speed photography and pitot
   pressure measurements. This study was motivated by the need to optimize
   sootblowing operation in kraft recovery boilers. The effects of the
   transverse distance between the jet and cylinder centerlines
   (eccentricity), nozzle-cylinder distance, and cylinder size on
   jet-cylinder interaction were determined. Results show that upon
   impingement on a cylinder, a supersonic jet deflects at an angle and
   creates a weaker supersonic jet that we refer to as a ``secondary{''}
   jet. The angle and strength of the deflected or secondary jet depend on
   the eccentricity between the primary jet and cylinder centerlines. When
   a jet impinges on a cylinder of diameter comparable to that of the jet
   or smaller, secondary jets form not only when the cylinder is placed
   close to the nozzle (in the stronger portion of the jet) but also when
   the cylinder is placed far away (in the jet's weaker portion; up to
   20-24 nozzle exit diameters in the present study). Changing the
   eccentricity slightly results in a significant change in the secondary
   jet characteristics. For a cylinder much larger than the jet, secondary
   jets do not form at zero eccentricity (head-on impingement); the
   eccentricity at which they begin to form increases with the cylinder
   size. A study of the secondary jets shows that they spread out much more
   than the primary jet and are sheet-or fan-like with an oblong, oval
   cross section. The centerline pitot pressure of the secondary jets
   remains as high as the primary jet for a considerable distance from the
   tube only during weak interaction between the primary jet and the
   cylinder (i.e., during strongly eccentric/off-centerd impingement). As
   the interaction between the primary jet and the cylinder intensifies at
   lower eccentricities, the maximum centerline pitot pressure of the
   secondary jet decreases, and the pitot pressure decreases more quickly
   with distance from the tube.}},

Abstract = {{Loss of mechanical strength and relatively high variability in
   durability performance are major factors preventing large-scale
   utilization of scrap tire waste in concrete. This study examines an
   approach to pre-treat crumb rubber in conjunction with the addition of
   supplementary cementitious materials in order to mitigate the loss of
   mechanical properties in rubberized concrete. The mechanical and
   durability properties of concrete composites containing as-received and
   limestone powder pre-coated crumb rubber at 0\%, 5\%, 10\% and 15\% fine
   aggregate substitution by volume are investigated. In addition, some
   mixtures also contain silica fume at 15\% cement replacement by volume.
   The results reveal that although the strength improvement due to
   pre-coated crumb rubber alone was minor, the synergistic effect of
   pre-coated crumb rubber and silica fume as cement replacement material
   enhanced the mechanical properties of mixtures significantly. Moreover,
   both as-received and pre-coated crumb rubber acted as an electrical
   insulator increasing the surface resistivity and chloride permeability

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{131}},
Pages = {{203-215}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The objective of this paper is to develop a model, which
   optimizes jointly the inspection frequency and the inventory level for a
   k-out-of-n system with repairable components whose failures are hidden.
   Scope: The system is periodically inspected to detect failed components,
   and the components are either minimally repaired or replaced with spares
   from the inventory. The system fails between periodic inspections if
   n-k+1 components are down; in that case, all failed components are
   inspected and rectified if possible. Otherwise, the failed components
   are rectified at periodic inspections. An emergency spare is ordered at
   a system failure, if the inventory is empty and all failed components
   require replacement.
   Methodology: Using analytical approach to find the optimal solution is
   computationally intensive and not practical; a simulation model is
   developed to solve the problem.
   Results: The proposed model harmonizes the maintenance and inventory
   policies and finds the joint optimal solution which results in a minimum
   total cost.
   Conclusion: The joint optimization model results in a lower cost
   compared to separate maintenance and inventory optimization models.
   Novelty: Few joint models for k-out-of-n systems exist, and none of them
   investigate repairable components whose failures are hidden and follow a
   non-homogeneous Poisson process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Low-fat and high dietary-fiber diets are important elements in the
   prevention of chronic diseases. The objective of this work was to
   understand the effect of wheat bran inclusion in large amounts to a
   gluten starch matrix, in structure formation and associated quality
   attributes, during deep-fat frying. Matrices were prepared mixing 12 g
   of gluten and 88 g of wheat starch per 100 g of dry solids, ensuring a
   moisture content of 40 g water/100 g dough. Starch was gradually
   replaced by wheat bran (up to 40 g/100 g dry solids), and lack of
   structure formation was overcome by partially replacing starch with
   pregelatinized corn starch. Samples were fried at 170 degrees C and oil
   absorption in high fiber products was reduced through post-frying
   centrifugation. Pregelatinized corn starch addition allowed obtaining an

Title = {{Action Possibility Judgments of People with Varying Motor Abilities Due

Abstract = {{Predictions about one's own action capabilities as well as the action
   capabilities of others are thought to be based on a simulation process
   involving linked perceptual and motor networks. Given the central role
   of motor experience in the formation of these networks, one's present
   motor capabilities are thought to be the basis of their perceptual
   judgments about actions. However, it remains unknown whether the ability
   to form these action possibility judgments is affected by performance
   related changes in the motor system. To determine if judgments of action
   capabilities are affected by long-term changes in one's own motor
   capabilities, participants with different degrees of upper-limb function
   due to their level (cervical vs. below cervical) of spinal cord injury
   (SCI) were tested on a perceptual-motor judgment task. Participants
   observed apparent motion videos of reciprocal aiming movements with
   varying levels of difficulty. For each movement, participants determined
   the shortest movement time (MT) at which they themselves and a young
   adult could perform the task while maintaining accuracy. Participants
   also performed the task. Analyses of MTs revealed that perceptual
   judgments for participant's own movement capabilities were consistent
   with their actual performance-people with cervical SCI had longer judged
   and actual MTs than people with below cervical SCI. However, there were
   no between-group differences in judged MTs for the young adult. Although
   it is unclear how the judgments were adjusted (altered simulation vs.
   threshold modification), the data reveal that people with different
   motor capabilities due to SCI are not completely biased by their present
   capabilities and can effectively adjust their judgments to estimate the
   actions of others.}},

Abstract = {{Studying the effects of the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials
   on cellular uptake, toxicity, and exocytosis can provide the foundation
   for designing safer and more effective nanoparticles for clinical
   applications. However, an understanding of the effects of these
   properties on subcellular transport, accumulation, and distribution
   remains limited. The present study investigates the effects of surface
   density and particle size of semiconductor quantum dots on cellular
   uptake as well as nuclear transport kinetics, retention, and
   accumulation. The current work illustrates that cellular uptake and
   nuclear accumulation of nanoparticles depend on surface density of the
   nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides with nuclear transport
   reaching a plateau at 20\% surface NLS density in as little as 30 min.
   These intracellular nanoparticles have no effects on cell viability up
   to 72 h post treatment. These findings will set a foundation for
   engineering more sophisticated nanoparticle systems for imaging and
   manipulating genetic targets in the nucleus.}},

Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{The molecular structural mechanics method has been extended to
   investigate the buckling of microtubules (MTs) with various
   configurations. The results indicate that for relative short MTs the
   shear deformation effect, rather than the nonlocal effect, is mainly
   responsible for the limitation of their widely used Euler beam
   description and the observed length-dependence of their bending
   stiffness. In addition, the configuration effect of MTs is also studied
   and considered as an explanation for the large scattering of the
   critical buckling force and bending stiffness observed in existing
   experiments. This configuration effect is also found to mainly originate
   from the geometry of the MTs and is mainly determined by the
   protofilament number. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{TMEM43 Mutation p.S358L Alters Intercalated Disc Protein Expression and

   Cardiomyopathy}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a myocardial
   disease characterized by fibro-fatty replacement of myocardium in the
   right ventricular free wall and frequently results in life-threatening
   ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. A heterozygous
   missense mutation in the transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43) gene, p.
   S358L, has been genetically identified to cause autosomal dominant ARVC
   type 5 in a founder population from the island of Newfoundland, Canada.
   Little is known about the function of the TMEM43 protein or how it leads
   to the pathogenesis of ARVC. We sought to determine the distribution of
   TMEM43 and the effect of the p. S358L mutation on the expression and
   distribution of various intercalated (IC) disc proteins as well as
   functional effects on IC disc gap junction dye transfer and conduction
   velocity in cell culture. Through Western blot analysis, transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescence (IF), and
   electrophysiological analysis, our results showed that the stable
   expression of p. S358L mutation in the HL-1 cardiac cell line resulted
   in decreased Zonula Occludens (ZO-1) expression and the loss of ZO-1
   localization to cell-cell junctions. Junctional Plakoglobin (JUP) and
   a-catenin proteins were redistributed to the cytoplasm with decreased
   localization to cell-cell junctions. Connexin-43 (Cx43) phosphorylation
   was altered, and there was reduced gap junction dye transfer and
   conduction velocity in mutant TMEM43-transfected cells. These
   observations suggest that expression of the p. S358L mutant of TMEM43
   found in ARVC type 5 may affect localization of proteins involved in
   conduction, alter gap junction function and reduce conduction velocity
   in cardiac tissue.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) distinguishing
   extraembryonic endoderm (ExEn) stem (XEN) cells from those that maintain
   the extensively characterized embryonic stem cell (ESC). An intriguing
   network candidate is Sox17, an essential transcription factor for XEN
   derivation and self-renewal. Here, we show that forced Sox17 expression
   drives ESCs toward ExEn, generating XEN cells that contribute to ExEn
   when placed back into early mouse embryos. Transient Sox17 expression is
   sufficient to drive this fate change during which time cells transit
   through distinct intermediate states prior to the generation of
   functional XEN-like cells. To orchestrate this conversion process, Sox17
   acts in autoregulatory and feedforward network motifs, regulating
   dynamic GRNs directing cell fate. Sox17-mediated XEN conversion helps to
   explain the regulation of cell-fate changes and reveals GRNs regulating
   lineage decisions in the mouse embryo.}},

Abstract = {{With a simple and versatile microcantilever-based force measurement
   technique, we have probed the drag forces involved in Caenorhabditis
   elegans locomotion. As a worm crawls on an agar surface, we found that
   substrate viscoelasticity introduces nonlinearities in the
   force-velocity relationships, yielding nonconstant drag coefficients
   that are not captured by original resistive force theory. A major
   contributing factor to these nonlinearities is the formation of a
   shallow groove on the agar surface. We measured both the adhesion forces
   that cause the worm's body to settle into the agar and the resulting
   dynamics of groove formation. Furthermore, we quantified the locomotive
   forces produced by C. elegans undulatory motions on a wet viscoelastic
   agar surface. We show that an extension of resistive force theory is
   able to use the dynamics of a nematode's body shape along with the
   measured drag coefficients to predict the forces generated by a crawling
   nematode.}},

Title = {{Colloidal quantum dot solar cells on curved and flexible substrates}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals synthesized
   with, processed in, and deposited from the solution phase, potentially
   enabling low-cost, facile manufacture of solar cells. Unfortunately, CQD
   solar cell reports, until now, have only explored batch-processing
   methods-such as spin-coating-that offer limited capacity for scaling.
   Spray-coating could offer a means of producing uniform colloidal quantum
   dot films that yield high-quality devices. Here, we explore the
   versatility of the spray-coating method by producing CQD solar cells in
   a variety of previously unexplored substrate arrangements. The potential
   transferability of the spray-coating method to a roll-to-roll
   manufacturing process was tested by spray-coating the CQD active layer
   onto six substrates mounted on a rapidly rotating drum, yielding devices
   with an average power conversion efficiency of 6.7\%. We further tested
   the manufacturability of the process by endeavoring to spray onto
   flexible substrates, only to find that spraying while the substrate was
   flexed was crucial to achieving champion performance of 7.2\% without
   compromise to open-circuit voltage. Having deposited onto a substrate
   with one axis of curvature, we then built our CQD solar cells onto a
   spherical lens substrate having two axes of curvature resulting in a 5\%
   efficient device. These results show that CQDs deposited using our
   spraying method can be integrated to large-area manufacturing processes
   and can be used to make solar cells on unconventional shapes. (C) 2014

Title = {{The ErbB2 inhibitor Herceptin (Trastuzumab) promotes axonal outgrowth
   four weeks after acute nerve transection and repair}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{582}},
Pages = {{81-86}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{Accumulating evidence suggests that neuregulin, a potent Schwann cell
   mitogen, and its receptor, ErbB2, have an important role in regulating
   peripheral nerve regeneration. We hypothesized that Herceptin
   (Trastuzumab), a monoclonal antibody that binds ErbB2, would disrupt
   ErbB2 signaling, allowing us to evaluate ErbB2's importance in
   peripheral nerve regeneration. In this study, the extent of peripheral
   motor and sensory nerve regeneration and distal axonal outgrowth was
   analyzed two and four weeks after common peroneal (CP) nerve injury in
   rats. Outcomes analyzed included neuron counts after retrograde
   labeling, histomorphometry, and protein analysis. The data analysis
   revealed that there was no impact of Herceptin administration on either
   the numbers of motor or sensory neurons that regenerated their axons but
   histomorphometry revealed that Herceptin significantly increased the
   number of regenerated axons in the distal repaired nerve after 4 weeks.
   Protein analysis with Western blotting revealed no difference in either
   expression levels of ErbB2 or the amount of activated, phosphorylated
   ErbB2 in injured nerves. In conclusion, administration of the ErbB2
   receptor inhibitor after nerve transection and surgical repair did not
   alter the number of regenerating neurons but markedly increased the
   number of regenerated axons per neuron in the distal nerve stump.
   Enhanced axon outgrowth in the presence of this ErbB2 inhibitor
   indicates that ErbB2 signaling may limit the numbers of axons that are
   emitted from each regenerating neuron. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Fungal secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes are of major interest due
   to the pharmacological properties of their products (like mycotoxins and
   antibiotics). The genome of the plant pathogenic fungus Fusarium
   graminearum codes for a large number of candidate enzymes involved in
   secondary metabolite biosynthesis. However, the chemical nature of most
   enzymatic products of proteins encoded by putative secondary metabolism
   biosynthetic genes is largely unknown. Based on our analysis we present
   67 gene clusters with significant enrichment of predicted secondary
   metabolism related enzymatic functions. 20 gene clusters with unknown
   metabolites exhibit strong gene expression correlation in planta and
   presumably play a role in virulence. Furthermore, the identification of
   conserved and over-represented putative transcription factor binding
   sites serves as additional evidence for cluster co-regulation.
   Orthologous cluster search provided insight into the evolution of
   secondary metabolism clusters. Some clusters are characteristic for the
   Fusarium phylum while others show evidence of horizontal gene transfer
   as orthologs can be found in representatives of the Botrytis or
   Cochliobolus lineage. The presented candidate clusters provide valuable
   targets for experimental examination.}},

Abstract = {{We present low-coherence virtual reference interferometry (LC-VRI) for
   short length (<1 m) fiber dispersion characterization using a broadband
   LED source and a low-resolution spectrometer or spectrum analyzer. The
   LC-VRI is a simple and convenient alternative to balanced spectral
   interferometry (BSI), capable of measuring both first- and second-order
   dispersion directly from the interference pattern. The main advantage of
   using LC-VRI instead of BSI is that full characterization can be
   performed from a single spectral scan, without the need for precision
   control of the reference path. The technique is demonstrated for the
   characterization of SMF28 fiber and the results are compared with the
   manufacturer's specifications and to measurements obtained using BSI.
   The standard deviation of the first-and second-order dispersion is found
   to be on the order of 10(-3) ps and 10(-4) ps/nm, respectively, for both
   BSI and LC-VRI.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of nanoscale zero valent iron (nZVI) into the
   subsurface has recently received significant attention as a potentially
   effective method for remediation of source zones of chlorinated solvents
   present as dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPL). One of the challenges
   in the deployment of nZVI is to achieve good subsurface nZVI mobility to
   permit delivery of the nZVI to the target treatment zone. Stabilization
   of nZVI with various polymers has shown promise for enhancing nZVI
   subsurface mobility, but the impact of subsurface conditions on nZVI
   mobility has not been fully explored. In this study, the effect of humic
   acid and kaolinite on the transport of polymer-stabilized nZVI
   (carboxylmethyl cellulose-surface modified nZVI, CMC90K-RNIP) in sand
   was investigated using column experiments. In addition, effects of
   electrolytes on the stability of CMC90K-RNIP in the presence of humic
   acid, and the stability of humic add-coated reactive nanoscale iron
   particles (HA-RNIP) at various humic add concentrations were
   investigated. Humic acid enhanced the mobility of bare RNIP, whereas the
   transport of CMC90K-RNIP was not significantly affected by humic acid
   injected as a background solution, except at the highest concentration
   of 500 mg/L. At lower pore water velocity, the effect of humic acid on
   the transport of CMC90K-RNIP was greater than that at high water
   velocity. Adding kaolinite up to 2\% by weight to the sand column
   reduced the retention of CMC90K-RNIP, but further increases in kaolinite
   content (to 5\%) did not significantly affect nZVI retention. The impact
   of kaolinite on nZVI retention was more pronounced at lower pore water
   velocities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All tights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Temporally distinct populations of neural stem cells (NSCs; embryonic
   and adult) display the cardinal stem cell properties of self-renewal and
   multipotentiality; however, their relative frequency and cell kinetics
   vary through development and into old age. We asked whether changes in
   NSC behavior could be accounted for by changes in environmental signals
   over time. We identified a prosurvival signaling cascade that enhances
   adult-derived NSC survival using cues released from embryonic neurons.
   Specifically, we demonstrate that stromal-cell-derived factor-1 alpha
   (SDF-1 alpha) released by embryonic neurons leads to upregulation of
   neuronal nitric oxide synthase in adult neural precursor cells. The
   resulting increase in nitric oxide leads to the upregulation of the stem
   cell factor (SCF) receptor ckit on adult NSCs (ANSCs). SCF released from
   embryonic neurons results in enhanced NSC survival. Using both in vitro
   and in vivo assays, we have demonstrated expansion of the size of the
   NSC pool through this pathway, indicating that ANSCs retain their
   ability to respond to embryonic-derived cues into adulthood.}},

Abstract = {{The preparation of composite biopolymer hydrogels offers the capability
   to produce biocompatible and biodegradable materials with cooperative
   properties. In this paper, two natural polymers, namely, chitosan and
   agarose were employed to prepare composite hydrogels with dual pH and
   temperature properties. The elastic modulus of the composite hydrogels
   increased with agarose concentration reaching the value of 1 kPa for the
   chitosan/agarose gel with a 2\% (w/v) concentration of agarose. In
   addition, composite gels exhibited a higher stability in acidic aqueous
   solutions, in comparison with agarose gels. The drug release properties
   of the composite hydrogels were tested by loading a model anticancer
   drug, 5-Fluorouracil, in the hydrogel interior. At pH=7.4, the
   cumulative release of 5-FU was similar to 50\% within 96 h and decreased
   to similar to 33\% at pH=5.2, which was attributed to the different
   solubility of 5-FU as a function of pH. The preparation of composite
   microgels with controllable dimensions in the range from 42 to 18 mu m
   and with narrow size distribution (polidispersity not exceeding 1.5\%)
   was achieved by the microfluidic emulsification of an aqueous mixture of
   chitosan and agarose and subsequent gelation of the precursor droplets
   by cooling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotube (CNT) agglomeration exists inevitably in all CNT-polymer
   composites. This paper quantified the effect of CNT agglomeration on the
   piezoresistivity of CNT-polymer composites. A new multiscale model of
   3-dimensional deformable CNT percolating networks has been developed,
   where the CNT agglomerates were modeled as second phases embedded
   randomly in the polymer matrix. The newly developed model agrees
   quantitatively with experimental data. The study found that the CNT
   agglomeration is responsible for the reduced electrical conductivity and
   nonlinearity of piezoresistivity with respect to the zero strain. Its
   effect can be quantified by the newly developed model. Parametric
   analyses were conducted to show the effects of morphology and electrical
   properties of CNTs, the Poisson's ratio of CNT-polymer composites and
   the extent, internal density and size of CNT agglomeration on the
   electrical conductivity and piezoresistivity. The current work provides
   a useful analysis tool for designing smart sensing and multifunctional

Abstract = {{The surface tensions of non-hydrogen-bonding, organic liquids can be
   accurately calculated from their electromagnetic properties, using an
   approximate form of the Lifshitz theory. A simple extension of this
   approach to the calculation of the surface tensions of hydrogen-bonding
   liquids is proposed. It is shown that the higher surface tensions of
   hydrogen-bonding liquids can be accounted for, with reasonable accuracy,
   by the increase in dispersion due to the shortened distance of approach
   between hydrogen-bonded atoms. Similar considerations allow calculations
   of contact angles on several low-energy solid surfaces in terms of
   molecular and electromagnetic properties. In accordance with well-known
   experimental observations, the calculated contact angles of both
   hydrogen-bonding and non-hydrogen-bonding liquids on the same low-energy
   surface nearly follow a single, smooth pattern.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{3817-3829}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{The lab-on-chip (LOC) platform has presented a powerful opportunity to
   improve functionalization, parallelization, and miniaturization on
   planar or multilevel geometries that has not been possible with fiber
   optic technology. A migration of such LOC devices into the optical fiber
   platform would therefore open the revolutionary prospect of creating
   novel lab-in-fiber (LIF) systems on the basis of an efficient optical
   transport highway for multifunctional sensing. For the LIF, the core
   optical waveguide inherently offers a facile means to interconnect
   numerous types of sensing elements along the optical fiber, presenting a
   radical opportunity for optimizing the packaging and densification of
   diverse components in convenient geometries beyond that available with
   conventional LOCs. In this paper, three-dimensional patterning inside
   the optical fiber by femtosecond laser writing, together with selective
   chemical etching, is presented as a powerful tool to form refractive
   index structures such as optical waveguides and gratings as well as to
   open buried microfluidic channels and optical resonators inside the
   flexible and robust glass fiber. In this approach, optically smooth
   surfaces (similar to 12 nm rms) are introduced for the first time inside
   the fiber cladding that precisely conform to planar nanograting
   structures when formed by aberration-free focusing with an oil-immersion
   lens across the cylindrical fiber wall. This process has enabled
   optofluidic components to be precisely embedded within the fiber to be
   probed by either the single-mode fiber core waveguide or the
   laser-formed optical circuits. We establish cladding waveguides,
   X-couplers, fiber Bragg gratings, microholes, mirrors, optoftuidic
   resonators, and microfluidic reservoirs that define the building blocks
   for facile interconnection of inline core-waveguide devices with
   cladding optoftuidics. With these components, more advanced, integrated,
   and multiplexed fiber microsystems are presented demonstrating
   fluorescence detection, Fabry-Perot interferometric refractometry, and
   simultaneous sensing of refractive index, temperature, and bending
   strain. The flexible writing technique and multiplexed sensors described
   here open powerful prospects to migrate the benefits of LOCs into a more
   flexible and miniature LIF platform for highly functional and
   distributed sensing capabilities. The waveguide backbone of the {[}IF
   inherently provides an efficient exchange of information, combining
   sensing data that are attractive in telecom networks, smart catheters
   for medical procedures, compact sensors for security and defense, shape
   sensors, and low-cost health care products.}},

Abstract = {{The cyclic deformation response, CSSC behavior and microstructural
   evolution of oxygen free high conductivity polycrystalline copper
   samples were investigated under pure compression fatigue conditions. The
   results were compared with the observations made under symmetrical and
   pulsating tension fatigue. It was found that the cyclic deformation
   response, cyclic stress-strain curve and microstructural evolution of
   copper for pure compression fatigue condition are substantially
   different from those for push-pull fatigue. Unlike the symmetrical
   fatigue, rapid hardening and cyclic creep were observed in all tested
   compression fatigue conditions. To track surface micro-structural
   changes, optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic
   force measurement (AFM) were utilized. Dislocation structures were also
   examined using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) for different
   peak conditions after different numbers of cycles. The observations
   showed that cyclic plastic deformation accommodation by the material was
   not majorly contributed by the dislocation activities as evidenced by
   the very moderate slip activities on the surface as well as the lack of
   persistent slip band dislocation structures. Instead, cyclic creep was
   found to be the major form of plastic strain accommodation, which was
   found to be introduced though grain boundary activities, i.e. grain
   boundary extrusions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Independent lines of research on urbanization, urban areas, and carbon
   have advanced our understanding of some of the processes through which
   energy and land uses affect carbon. This synthesis integrates some of
   these diverse viewpoints as a first step toward a coproduced, integrated
   framework for understanding urbanization, urban areas, and their
   relationships to carbon. It suggests the need for approaches that
   complement and combine the plethora of existing insights into
   interdisciplinary explorations of how different urbanization processes,
   and socio-ecological and technological components of urban areas, affect
   the spatial and temporal patterns of carbon emissions, differentially
   over time and within and across cities. It also calls for a more
   holistic approach to examining the carbon implications of urbanization
   and urban areas, based not only on demographics or income but also on
   other interconnected features of urban development pathways such as
   urban form, economic function, economic-growth policies, and other
   governance arrangements. It points to a wide array of uncertainties
   around the urbanization processes, their interactions with urban
   socio-institutional and built environment systems, and how these impact
   the exchange of carbon flows within and outside urban areas. We must
   also understand in turn how carbon feedbacks, including carbon impacts
   and potential impacts of climate change, can affect urbanization
   processes. Finally, the paper explores options, barriers, and limits to
   transitioning cities to low-carbon trajectories, and suggests the
   development of an end-to-end, coproduced and integrated scientific
   understanding that can more effectively inform the navigation of
   transitional journeys and the avoidance of obstacles along the way.}},

Abstract = {{The expected urbanization of the planet in the coming century coupled
   with aging infrastructure in developed regions, increasing complexity of
   man-made systems, and pressing climate change impacts have created
   opportunities for reassessing the role of infrastructure and
   technologies in cities and how they contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions. Modern urbanization is predicated on complex, increasingly
   coupled infrastructure systems, and energy use continues to be largely
   met from fossil fuels. Until energy infrastructures evolve away from
   carbon-based fuels, GHG emissions are critically tied to the
   urbanization process. Further complicating the challenge of decoupling
   urban growth from GHG emissions are lock-in effects and
   interdependencies. This paper synthesizes state-of-the-art thinking for
   transportation, fuels, buildings, water, electricity, and waste systems
   and finds that GHG emissions assessments tend to view these systems as
   static and isolated from social and institutional systems. Despite
   significant understanding of methods and technologies for reducing
   infrastructure-related GHG emissions, physical, institutional, and
   cultural constraints continue to work against us, pointing to knowledge
   gaps that must be addressed. This paper identifies three challenge
   themes to improve our understanding of the role of infrastructure and
   technologies in urbanization processes and position these increasingly
   complex systems for low-carbon growth. The challenges emphasize how we
   can reimagine the role of infrastructure in the future and how people,
   institutions, and ecological systems interface with infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Gas injection into liquids is common in many applications. Nozzles with

   diameter ratios has been studied. It was found that changes in diameter
   ratios have a definitive effect on the performance of these nozzles as
   the gas is injected into a liquid. Pressure measurements of the gas
   during injection were conducted so momentum transfer could be estimated;
   additionally high speed video allowed us to see the differences in the
   gas plumes as the different nozzles were used.}},

   Cardiac Interventions}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Recently, there is a growing interest in using magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) to guide interventional procedures due to its excellent
   soft tissue contrast and lack of ionizing radiation compared to
   traditional radiographic guidance. One of these applications is the use
   of MRI to guide radio frequency ablation of anatomic substrates, within
   the left ventricle, responsible for ventricular tachycardia. However,
   different MRI acquisition schemes have significant tradeoffs between
   image quality and acquisition time. Guidance using high-quality
   preoperative 3-D MR images is limited in the case of cardiac
   interventions because the heart moves dynamically during the procedure.
   On the other hand, 2-D real-time MR images acquired during the
   intervention sacrifice image quality for shorter image acquisition time,
   leading to real-time positional updates of cardiac anatomy. Ideally, we
   wish to combine the advantages of live feedback from real-time images
   and accurate visualization of anatomical structures from preoperative
   images. Therefore, to improve the MRI guidance capabilities for cardiac
   interventions, we describe a novel multiscale rigid registration
   framework to correct for respiratory motion between the prior and
   real-time datasets. In the proposed approach, we use a weighted total
   variation flow algorithm to extract coarse-to-fine features from the
   input images and subsequently register the corresponding scales in a
   hierarchical manner. Registration experiments were performed with in
   vivo human imaging data, and the target registration error achieved was
   1.51 mm. Thus, the feasibility of motion correction in an interventional
   setting has been demonstrated, which may lead to significant
   improvements in the guidance of cardiac interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium chloride brines present a number of potential advantages for
   the processing of lateritic saprolite ores for nickel production.
   Concentrated MgCl2 solutions enhance the activity of acid used, allow
   atmospheric leaching at elevated temperature, and inhibit magnesium
   dissolution, which reduces acid consumption and increases metal
   selectivity. However, with a chloride based leach it is economically
   requisite to recover hydrochloric acid, conventionally accomplished by
   pyrohydrolysis. This work was performed in conjunction with a novel
   flowsheet for the processing on saprolite ores, which recovers HCl by
   the precipitation and subsequent decomposition of magnesium
   hydroxychlorides, alleviating some of the issues with pyrohydrolysis.
   Leaching experiments have been conducted in concentrated MgCl2 brines,
   up to 4.5 m, to determine the amenable process conditions and explore
   the kinetics of the process. It was determined that >95\% extraction of
   metals was possible using both aqueous and gaseous HCl, while
   suppressing the dissolution of Mg from the ore.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe some observations from the attempted reaction
   of Br-BsubPc with phenol in DMF and DMAc. During these efforts, we found
   that Br-BsubPc reacts with the respective solvents to produce axially
   substituted formate-BsubPc and acetate-BsubPc. When no phenol is present
   the reaction proceeds to completion in a relatively short period of
   time. However, when phenol was present in DMF the reaction produced a
   mixture of formate-BsubPc, phenoxy-BsubPc, and HO-BsubPc. Similar
   results were found for the less-reactive Cl-BsubPc and MsO-BsubPc. Aside
   from these observations, it was found that simple heating in wet acetone
   of Br-BsubPc quantitatively produced HO-BsubPc after a facile workup.
   This method of producing HO-BsubPc removes the high temperatures, long
   reaction times, and harmful chemicals required in other synthetic
   methods. These results are relevant to anyone considering the reaction

Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{Lack of detailed land use (LU) information and of efficient data
   gathering methods have made modeling of urban systems difficult. This
   study aims to develop a hierarchical rule-based LU extraction system
   using very high resolution (VHR) remotely sensed imagery and geographic
   vector data. Land cover information extracted from remote sensing and
   several types of geographic data from the study area, City of
   Fredericton, Canada, are fused into a comprehensive database, in order
   to develop a sophisticated LU Extraction Expert System (LUEES). This
   paper illustrates how the proposed LUEES though a case study for
   residential uses in the study area. Morphological (individual-based)
   analysis at the building-level is carried out through a step-wise binary
   logistic regression model, which differentiates residential and
   non-residential buildings and results in an overall accuracy of 93.1\%.
   The results derived from morphological analysis are then subject to a
   post-correction process using a spatial arrangement analysis, in order
   to further mitigate the misclassification issues arising from the
   morphological analysis. In this regard, Gabriel Graph connectivity
   examines the spatial structure and arrangements of urban features
   concerning different LU types. It is found that the spatial arrangement
   analysis further enhances the residential LU classification accuracy,
   which gives rise to an overall accuracy of 97.4\%. It is believed that,
   equipped with such a powerful LU data collection tool and resulting
   detailed/accurate LU data, urban planners/modelers should be able to
   more reliably and precisely represent/predict economic interactions,
   activity locations, space and housing developments, business expansion,
   and trip patterns. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For a wireless multi-tier heterogeneous network with orthogonal spectrum
   allocation across tiers, we optimize the association probability and the
   fraction of spectrum allocated to each tier so as to maximize rate
   coverage. In practice, the association probability can be controlled
   using a biased received signal power. The optimization problem is
   non-convex and we are forced to explore locally optimal solutions. We
   make two contributions in this paper: first, we show that there exists a
   relation between the first derivatives of the objective function with
   respect to each of the optimization variables. This can be used to
   simplify numerical solutions to the optimization problem. Second, we
   explore the optimality of the intuitive solution that the fraction of
   spectrum allocated to each tier should be equal to the tier association
   probability. We show that, in this case, a closed-form solution exists.
   Importantly, our numerical results show that there is essentially zero
   performance loss. The results also illustrate the significant gains
   possible by jointly optimizing the user association and the resource
   allocation.}},

Abstract = {{New inorganic ligands including halide anions have significantly
   accelerated progress in colloidal quantum dot (CQD) photovoltaics in
   recent years. All such device reports to date have relied on halide
   treatment during solid-state ligand exchanges or on co-treatment of
   long-aliphatic-ligand-capped nanoparticles in the solution phase. Here
   we report solar cells based on a colloidal quantum dot ink that is
   capped using halide-based ligands alone. By judicious choice of solvents
   and ligands, we developed a CQD ink from which a homogeneous and thick
   colloidal quantum dot solid is applied in a single step. The resultant
   films display an n-type character, making it suitable as a key component
   in a solar-converting device. We demonstrate two types of quantum
   junction devices that exploit these iodide-ligand-based inks. We achieve
   solar power conversion efficiencies of 6\% using this class of colloids.}},

Abstract = {{Conformal integration of semiconductor gain media is broadly important
   in on-chip optical communication technology. Here we deploy atomic layer
   deposition to create conformally deposited organohalide perovskites-an

   coherent light emission on spherical optical cavities. We demonstrate
   the high quality of perovskite gain media fabricated with this method,
   achieving optical gain in the nanosecond pulse regime with a threshold
   for amplified spontaneous emission of 65 +/- 8 mu J cm(-2). Through
   variable stripe length measurements, we report a net modal gain of 125
   +/- 22 cm(-1) and a gain bandwidth of 50 +/- 14 meV. Leveraging the high
   quality of the gain medium, we conformally coat silica microspheres with
   perovskite to form whispering gallery mode optical cavities and achieve

Abstract = {{Traffic assignment has traditionally been performed using aggregate
   static user equilibrium approaches for a single mode. These approaches
   are typically favoured over more complex dynamic multimodal micro and
   meso-simulated models. Investigations into dynamic multimodal assignment
   models have shown promise, prompting interest in the adoption of complex
   modelling structures. The development and operation of these complex
   models can still be problematic, highlighting the need for efficient
   approaches to allow practitioners to acquire and apply these models.
   This paper presents a method to modify existing static auto assignment
   networks for dynamic multimodal assignment. To complement this, a
   method, which improves the overall performance of the transit routing
   procedure used within many assignment models, is presented. These
   methods were tested using data from the Greater Toronto and Hamilton
   Area, and result in an assignment procedure with reasonable run time and
   results, suggesting potential for wide spread adoption of these
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The complete adaxial surface development and degradation due to
   weathering of two superhydrophobic leaf species with (black locust,
   Robinia pseudoacacia and bigtooth aspen, Populus grandidentata) and one
   without (quaking aspen, Populus tremuloides) a protective downy layer of
   trichomes was followed over one entire growing season using scanning
   electron microscopy and wetting property measurements. Scanning electron
   microscopy micrographs illustrate the initial development period of a
   dual-scale surface structure consisting of micrometre-sized papillae and
   nanoscale wax crystals, which was followed by a period of environmental
   degradation as nanoscale wax features were subjected to environmental
   stress. It was discovered that robust micropapillae protect nanoscale
   wax morphologies in-between them for quite some time allowing for a high
   tolerance to wear and erosion. Weather data was used to demonstrate the
   correlation between cumulative environmental stresses (temperature,
   relative humidity, precipitation and wind) and the loss of
   superhydrophobicity at the end of the growing season. Analysis of all
   binary combinations of the aforementioned environmental stress factors
   propose that cumulatively hot and humid weather have the most
   significant impact on degradation of nanoscale wax crystals and
   therefore result in the final loss of superhydrophobic behaviour. These
   findings were also tentatively linked to their importance in
   ecohydrology suggesting that canopy storage capacity, which has been
   previously correlated with leaf hydrophobicity, of superhydrophobic
   leaves may fluctuate considerably throughout an entire growing season.

Abstract = {{We describe in detail a reliable experimental protocol for c-fos
   immuno-labeling of patterns of neural activation in the chinchilla
   (chinchilla laniger). We report on resting-level neural activity in
   inferior colliculus (IC) of auditory midbrain, and on tonotopic bands
   present following 90 min of pure-tone sound stimulation. Neurons
   activated by 6-kHz sound stimulation lay ventro-medial to those
   activated at 2 kHz. This is consistent with the known tonotopic
   organization of IC, and verified in the present report by multi-unit
   neuron response recordings in central nucleus of IC. Of particular
   interest, we observe a significant reduction in cell labeling adjacent
   to the tonotopic bands, and suggest that such decreases represent
   inhibitory regions. C-fos-labeled bands and lateral regions of reduced
   labeling resemble excitatory and lateral-inhibitory response areas of IC
   neurons. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks can offer benefits to distributed
   content-based publish/subscribe data dissemination systems. In
   particular, since a P2P network's aggregate resources grow as the number
   of participants increases, scalability can be achieved using no
   infrastructure other than the participants' own resources. This paper
   proposes algorithms for supporting content-based publish/subscribe in
   which subscriptions can specify a range of interest and publications a
   range of values. The algorithms are built over a distributed hash table
   abstraction and are completely decentralized. Load balance is addressed
   by subscription delegation away from overloaded peers and a bottom-up
   tree search technique that avoids root hotspots. Furthermore, fault
   tolerance is achieved with a lightweight replication scheme that quickly
   detects and recovers from faults. Experimental results support the
   scalability and fault-tolerance properties of the algorithms: For
   example, doubling the number of subscriptions does not double internal
   system messages, and even the simultaneous failure of 20\% of the peers
   in the system requires less than 2 min to fully recover.}},

Pages = {{3652-3664}},

Abstract = {{We study the secrecy capacity of fast fading channels under imperfect
   main channel (between the transmitter and the legitimate receiver)
   estimation at the transmitter. Lower and upper bounds on the ergodic
   secrecy capacity are derived for a class of independent identically
   distributed (i.i.d.) fading channels. The achievable rate follows from a
   standard wiretap code in which a simple on-off power control is employed
   along with a Gaussian input. The upper bound is obtained using an
   appropriate correlation scheme of the main and eavesdropper channels and
   is the best known upper bound so far. The upper and lower bounds
   coincide with recently derived ones in case of perfect main CSI.
   Furthermore, the upper bound is tight in case of no main CSI, where the
   secrecy capacity is equal to zero. Asymptotic analysis at high and low
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is also given. At high SNR, we show that the
   capacity is bounded by providing upper and lower bounds that depend on
   the channel estimation error. At low SNR, however, we prove that the
   secrecy capacity is asymptotically equal to the capacity of the main
   channel as if there were no secrecy constraint. Numerical results are
   provided for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channels.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the medium access design for secondary users (SUs)
   from a game-theoretic learning perspective. In consideration of the
   random return of primary users (PUs), a distributed SU access approach
   is presented based on an adaptive carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)
   scheme, in which each SU accesses multiple idle frequency slots of a
   licensed frequency band with adaptive activity factors. The problem of
   finding optimal activity factors of SUs is formulated as a potential
   game, and the existence, feasibility, and optimality of Nash equilibrium
   (NE) are analyzed. Furthermore, to achieve NEs of the formulated game,
   learning-based algorithms are developed in which each SU independently
   adjusts its activity factors. Convergence properties of best-response
   dynamics and log-linear dynamics are studied. Subsequently, by learning
   other SUs' behavior from locally available information, the convergence
   with probability of one to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the
   globally optimal solution is investigated by both analysis and
   simulation.}},

Abstract = {{To achieve the full multiplexing gain of a K-multiuser
   multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) overlay cognitive radio (CR)
   network, a distributed opportunistic interference alignment (DOIA)
   technique using a new beamforming algorithm, namely, threshold-based
   beamforming (TBF), is proposed. The MIMO overlay CR system consists of
   one primary user (PU) and K secondary users (SUs) where the local
   channel state information is available at both the transmitters and
   receivers of SUs. Assuming that the receiver and the transmitter of the
   PU have perfect knowledge of their own channel matrix, the PU uses a
   maximum eigenmode beamforming (MEB) scheme for its data transmission to
   release some of its eigenmodes for the SUs. For this virtual
   cooperation, the SUs align their transmitted signals to the spatial
   directions (SDs) associated with the unused PU's eigenmodes to ensure
   orthogonality between the links of the PU and the SUs. In addition, the
   MEB scheme overcomes the limitation of the conventional water-filling
   power allocation (WPA) in releasing the PU's eigenmodes for the SUs at
   high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). A noniterative and distributed
   power-allocation strategy, namely, TBF, is proposed, in which the SUs'
   links with a maximum eigenvalue above a certain threshold transmit data
   at full power, and the rest remain silent. This protocol, along with the
   MEB scheme, enables the MIMO overlay CR system to enhance the throughput
   of the network described as the average sum rate of both the PU and SUs.
   The proposed DOIA-TBF protocol allows the opportunistic SUs to use the
   same frequency band of a preexisting PU and guarantees that no
   interference is imposed on the PU's performance for such a MIMO overlay
   CR system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a micro-simulation modeling framework for evaluating
   pedestrian-vehicle conflicts in crowded crossing areas. The framework
   adopts a simulation approach that models vehicles and pedestrians at the
   microscopic level while satisfying two sets of constraints: (1) flow
   constraints and (2) non-collision constraints. Pedestrians move across
   two-directional cells as opposed to one-dimensional lanes as in the case
   of vehicles; therefore, extra caution is considered when modeling the
   shared space between vehicles and pedestrians. The framework is used to
   assess large-scale pedestrian-vehicle conflicts in a highly congested
   ring road in the City of Madinah that carries 20 000 vehicles/hour and
   crossed by 140 000 pedestrians/hour after a major congregational prayer.
   The quantitative and visual results of the simulation exhibits serious
   conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles, resulting in considerable
   delays for pedestrians crossing the road (9 minutes average delay) and
   slow traffic conditions (average speed <10 km/hour). The model is then
   used to evaluate the following three mitigating strategies: (1)
   pedestrian-only phase; (2) grade separation; and (3) pedestrian mall. A
   matrix of operational measures of effectiveness for network-wide
   performance (e. g., average travel time, average speed) and for
   pedestrian-specific performance (e. g., mean speed, mean density, mean
   delay, mean moving time) is used to assess the effectiveness of the
   proposed strategies. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR IMAGING}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The lung remains one of the most challenging organs to image using
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to intrinsic rapid signal decay.
   However, unlike conventional modalities such as computed tomography, MRI
   does not involve radiation and can provide functional and morphologic
   information on a regional basis. Here we demonstrate proof of concept
   for a new MRI approach to achieve substantial gains in a signal to noise
   ratio (SNR) in the lung parenchyma: contrast-enhanced ultrashort echo
   time (UTE) imaging following intravenous injection of a high-relaxivity
   blood-pool manganese porphyrin T-1 contrast agent. The new contrast
   agent increased relative enhancement of the lung parenchyma by over
   10-fold compared to gadolinium diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid
   (Gd-DTPA), and the use of UTE boosted the SNR by a factor of 4 over
   conventional T-1-weighted gradient echo acquisitions. The new agent also
   maintains steady enhancement over at least 60 minutes, thus providing a
   long time window for obtaining high-resolution, high-quality images and
   the ability to measure a number of physiologic parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Algae biofilms were grown in a semicontinuous flat plate biofilm
   photobioreactor to study the effects of light direction and suspended
   algal cell populations on algal biofilm growth. It was determined that,
   under the growth conditions and biofilm thicknesses studied, light
   direction had no effect on long-term algal biofilm growth (26 days);
   however, light direction did affect the concentration of suspended algal
   cells by influencing the photon flux density in the growth medium in the
   photobioreactors. This suspended algal cell population affected
   short-term (7 days) algae cell recruitment and algal biofilm growth, but
   additional studies showed that enhanced suspended algal cell populations
   did not affect biofilm growth rates over the long term (26 days).
   Studying profiles of light transmittance through biofilms as they grew
   showed that most of the light became attenuated by the biomass after
   just a few days of growth (88 \% after 3 days). The estimated biofilm
   thicknesses after these few days of growth were approximately 150 mu m.
   The light attenuation data suggests that, although the biofilms grew to
   700-900 mu m, under these light intensities, only the first few hundred
   micrometers of the biofilm is receiving enough light to be
   photosynthetically active. We postulate that this photosynthetically
   active layer of the biofilm grows adjacent to the light source, while
   the rest of the biofilm is in a stationary growth phase. The results of
   this study have implications for algal biofilm photobioreactor design
   and operation.}},

Abstract = {{Prior to intervention trials in individuals genetically at-risk for
   late-onset Alzheimer's disease, critical first steps are identifying
   where (neuroanatomic effects), when (timepoint in the lifespan) and how
   (gene expression and neuropathology) Alzheimer's risk genes impact the
   brain. We hypothesized that variants in the sortilin-like receptor
   (SORL1) gene would affect multiple Alzheimer's phenotypes before the
   clinical onset of symptoms. Four independent samples were analyzed to
   determine effects of SORL1 genetic risk variants across the lifespan at
   multiple phenotypic levels: (1) microstructural integrity of white
   matter using diffusion tensor imaging in two healthy control samples (n
   = 118, age 18-86; n = 68, age 8-40); (2) gene expression using the
   Braincloud postmortem healthy control sample (n = 269, age 0-92) and (3)
   Alzheimer's neuropathology (amyloid plaques and tau tangles) using a
   postmortem sample of healthy, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
   Alzheimer's individuals (n = 710, age 66-108). SORL1 risk variants
   predicted lower white matter fractional anisotropy in an age-independent
   manner in fronto-temporal white matter tracts in both samples at 5\%
   family-wise error-corrected thresholds. SORL1 risk variants also
   predicted decreased SORL1 mRNA expression, most prominently during
   childhood and adolescence, and significantly predicted increases in
   amyloid pathology in postmortem brain. Importantly, the effects of SORL1
   variation on both white matter microstructure and gene expression were
   observed during neurodevelopmental phases of the human lifespan.
   Further, the neuropathological mechanism of risk appears to primarily
   involve amyloidogenic pathways. Interventions targeted toward the SORL1
   amyloid risk pathway may be of greatest value during early phases of the
   lifespan.}},

Abstract = {{The epicardium supports cardiomyocyte proliferation early in development
   and provides fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells to the
   developing heart. The epicardium has been shown to play an important
   role during tissue remodeling after cardiac injury, making access to
   this cell lineage necessary for the study of regenerative medicine. Here
   we describe the generation of epicardial lineage cells from human
   pluripotent stem cells by stage-specific activation of the BMP and WNT
   signaling pathways. These cells display morphological characteristics
   and express markers of the epicardial lineage, including the
   transcription factors WT1 and TBX18 and the retinoic acid-producing
   enzyme ALDH1A2. When induced to undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal
   transition, the cells give rise to populations that display
   characteristics of the fibroblast and vascular smooth muscle lineages.
   These findings identify BMP and WNT as key regulators of the epicardial
   lineage in vitro and provide a model for investigating epicardial
   function in human development and disease.}},

Abstract = {{The organization of basic functions of the human brain, particularly in
   the right hemisphere, remains poorly understood. Recent advances in
   functional neuroimaging have improved our understanding of cortical
   organization but do not allow for direct interrogation or determination
   of essential (versus participatory) cortical regions. Direct cortical
   stimulation represents a unique opportunity to provide novel insights
   into the functional distribution of critical epicentres. Direct cortical
   stimulation (bipolar, 60 Hz, 1-ms pulse) was performed in 165
   consecutive patients undergoing awake mapping for resection of low-grade
   gliomas. Tasks included motor, sensory, counting, and picture naming.
   Stimulation sites eliciting positive (sensory/motor) or negative (speech
   arrest, dysarthria, anomia, phonological and semantic paraphasias)
   findings were recorded and mapped onto a standard Montreal Neurological
   Institute brain atlas. Montreal Neurological Institute-space functional
   data were subjected to cluster analysis algorithms (K-means, partition
   around medioids, hierarchical Ward) to elucidate crucial network
   epicentres. Sensorimotor function was observed in the pre/post-central
   gyri as expected. Articulation epicentres were also found within the
   pre/post-central gyri. However, speech arrest localized to ventral
   premotor cortex, not the classical Broca's area. Anomia/paraphasia data
   demonstrated foci not only within classical Wernicke's area but also
   within the middle and inferior frontal gyri. We report the first
   bilateral probabilistic map for crucial cortical epicentres of human
   brain functions in the right and left hemispheres, including sensory,
   motor, and language (speech, articulation, phonology and semantics).
   These data challenge classical theories of brain organization (e. g.
   Broca's area as speech output region) and provide a distributed
   framework for future studies of neural networks.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{293-303}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Newton's method is a commonly used algorithm for elasto-plastic finite
   element analysis and has three common variations: the full
   Newton-Raphson method, the modified Newton-Raphson method and the
   initial stiffness method. The Newton-Raphson methods can converge to the
   solution in a small number of iterations when the system is stable;
   however, the methods can be quite computationally expensive in some
   types of problems, for example where the tangent stiffness matrix is
   unsymmetric or the plasticity is highly localized. The initial stiffness
   method is robust in those cases but requires a larger number of
   iterations. This prompted the formulation of many acceleration
   techniques in literature. In this paper, those techniques will be
   briefly discussed. This will be followed by the development of a
   modified acceleration technique for the initial stiffness method. The
   performance of the modified accelerated initial stiffness method will be
   examined in elasto-plastic analyses, using both direct and iterative
   matrix solvers. The results will be compared - in terms of the required
   number of iterations and the computation time - with an existing
   accelerated initial stiffness method, the non-accelerated initial
   stiffness method and the Newton-Raphson tangent stiffness method. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we evaluate nanoparticle-stabilized CO2 foam stability
   and effectiveness in enhanced oil recovery at the pore and micromodel
   scales. The nanoparticle-stabilized CO2 gas-in-brine foams maintain
   excellent stability within microconfined media and continue to be stable
   after 10 days, as compared to less than 1 day for surfactant foam. The
   nanoparticle-stabilized CO2 foams are shown to generate a 3-fold
   increase in oil recovery (an additional 15\% initial oil in place), as
   compared to an otherwise similar CO2 gas flood. Fluorescence imaging is
   applied to quantify emulsion size distribution (down to 1 mu m) in both
   CO2 and nanoparticle-stabilized CO2 foam flood cases.
   Nanoparticle-stabilized CO2 foam flooding results in significantly
   smaller oil-in-water emulsion sizes with an average size of 1.7 mu m
   (similar to 80\% smaller than a CO2 gas flood), with negligible impact
   on water-in-oil emulsions. The effectiveness of nanoparticle-stabilized
   CO2 foam is compared for representative light, medium, and heavy oils.
   All three oils show substantial additional oil recovery and a
   potentially valuable reservoir homogenization effect. Collectively,
   these results highlight the pore-scale dynamics, effectiveness, and
   potential for nanoparticle-stabilized foams in enhanced oil recovery.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS}},

Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{80-85}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background and purpose: Poor device design that fails to adequately
   account for user needs, cognition, and behavior is often responsible for
   use errors resulting in adverse events. This poor device design is also
   often latent, and could be responsible for ``No Fault Found{''} (NFF)
   reporting, in which medical devices sent for repair by clinical users
   are found to be operating as intended. Unresolved NFF reports may
   contribute to incident under reporting, clinical user frustration, and
   biomedical engineering technologist inefficacy. This study uses human
   factors engineering methods to investigate the relationship between NFF
   reporting frequency and device usability.
   Material and methods: An analysis of medical equipment maintenance data
   was conducted to identify devices with a high NFF reporting frequency.
   Subsequently, semi-structured interviews and heuristic evaluations were
   performed in order to identify potential usability issues. Finally,
   usability testing was conducted in order to validate that latent
   usability related design faults result in a higher frequency of NFF
   reporting.
   Results: The analysis of medical equipment maintenance data identified
   six devices with a high NFF reporting frequency. Semi-structured
   interviews, heuristic evaluations and usability testing revealed that
   usability issues caused a significant portion of the NFF reports. Other
   factors suspected to contribute to increased NFF reporting include
   accessory issues, intermittent faults and environmental issues.
   Usability testing conducted on three of the devices revealed 23 latent
   usability related design faults.
   Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that latent usability related
   design faults manifest themselves as an increase in NFF reporting and
   that devices containing usability related design faults can be
   identified through an analysis of medical equipment maintenance data.

Abstract = {{Objective: Whole body vibration has been studied in populations
   experiencing neuromuscular degradation, including the elderly and
   individuals with neurological disorders, but methodological
   standardization is required to clarify its therapeutic effects. The
   characteristics of the vibrations actually delivered by commercial
   platforms are rarely measured or reported. Our objective was to quantify
   the vibrations (frequency, amplitude and peak acceleration) produced by
   several commercial platforms across different settings.
   Methods: Laser and accelerometer recordings were used to measure the
   vibrations of 7 vibration platforms. Four loads (0 kg, 45 kg, 68 kg, 91
   kg) and 3 vibration frequencies were used (30 Hz, 40 Hz, 50 Hz),
   totaling 12 combinations.
   Results: In all platforms, vibration amplitude and peak acceleration
   varied as a function of the load used (p < 0.001 in all cases). In most
   platforms, the actual frequency of vibration differed from the intended
   frequency (actual/intended ratio ranging from 0.83 to 1.19), as a
   function of load and frequency. These results imply that subjects of
   different weights could be receiving different vibrations.
   Conclusion: Investigators should characterize and report the vibrations
   actually delivered in their studies, in order to increase the quality of
   evidence in whole body vibration studies.}},

Abstract = {{Poly (lactic acid) or polylactide (PLA) is an aliphatic thermoplastic
   polyester produced from renewable resources and is compostable in the
   environment. Because of the massive use of foamed products of
   petroleum-based polymers, PLA foams have been considered as substitutes
   for some of these products. Specifically, because of PLA's competitive
   material and processing costs, and its comparable mechanical properties,
   PLA foams could potentially replace polystyrene (PS) foam products in a
   wide array of applications such as packaging, cushioning, construction,
   thermal and sound insulation, and plastic utensils. Due to their
   biocompatibility, PLA foams can also be used in such biomedical
   applications as scaffolding and tissue engineering. But PLA has several
   inherent drawbacks, which inhibit the production of low-density foams
   with uniform cell morphology. These drawbacks are mainly the PLA's low
   melt strength and its slow crystallization kinetics. During the last two
   decades, researchers have investigated the fundamentals of PLA/gas
   mixtures, PLA foaming mechanisms, and the effects of material
   modification on PLA's foaming behavior through various manufacturing
   technologies. This article reviews these investigations and compares the
   developments made thus far in PLA foaming. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{A Randomized, Double Crossover Study to Investigate the Influence of
   Saline Infusion on Sleep Apnea Severity in Men}},
Journal = {{SLEEP}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1699-1705}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Study Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is commoner in patients
   with fluid-retaining states than in those without fluid retention, in
   men than in women, and worsens with aging. In men, OSA severity is
   related to the amount of fluid shifting out of the legs overnight, but a
   cause-effect relationship is not established. Our objective was to test
   the hypothesis that mimicking fluid overload during sleep would increase
   severity of OSA more in older (>= 40 years) than in younger men (< 40
   years).
   Design: Randomized, single-blind, double crossover study.
   Setting: Research sleep laboratory.
   Patients or Participants: Seven older and 10 younger men with non-severe
   or no sleep apnea, matched for body mass index.
   Interventions: During the control arm, normal saline was infused to keep
   the vein open. During intervention, subjects received an intravenous
   bolus of normal saline (22 mL/kg body weight) after sleep onset while
   they were wearing compression stockings to prevent fluid accumulation in
   the legs.
   Measurements and Results: Compared to younger men, infusion of similar
   amounts of saline in older men caused a greater increase in neck
   circumference (P < 0.05) and in the AHI (32.2 +/- 22.1 vs. 2.2 +/- 7.1,
   P = 0.002).
   Conclusions: Older men are more susceptible to the adverse effects of
   intravenous fluid loading on obstructive sleep apnea severity than
   younger men. This may be due to age-related differences in the amount of
   fluid accumulating in the neck or upper airway collapsibility in
   response to intravenous fluid loading. These possibilities remain to be
   tested in future studies.}},

Title = {{Use of screening to recruitment ratios as a tool for planning and

Journal = {{SPINAL CORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{764-768}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Study design: Descriptive report.
   Objectives: To describe screening to recruitment (S:R) ratios and
   discuss their use for planning and implementing research among
   individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI).
   Setting: Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
   Methods: We calculated S:R ratios for SCI research by study methodology
   and nature of the exposure/intervention for 25 studies previously
   conducted in a tertiary SCI rehabilitation facility. Study methodologies
   included ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs), nine cohort studies
   and six panel studies. Exposures included seven rehabilitation
   interventions, and three drug studies, ten telephone interviews/chart
   abstractions (TI/CA) and five surveys. A S:R ratio was calculated for
   each study methodology, and exposure type, by dividing the number of
   consenting individuals who underwent screening by the number of eligible
   recruited participants enrolled in the study.
   Results: In terms of design, RCTs had the highest median S:R ratio
   (3:1), followed by cohort studies (2:1) and panel studies (2:1). In
   terms of intervention type, drug studies had the largest median S:R
   ratio (5:1), followed in descending order by rehabilitation studies
   (2:1), TI/CAs studies (2:1) and surveys (2:1).
   Conclusions: Reported S:R ratios varied substantially with study
   methodology and the associated study intervention exposure. Awareness of
   S:R ratios may assist researchers in estimating recruitment timelines,
   personnel needs and study budgets for a required sample size based on
   the planned study methodology and intended study exposure. We advocate
   for the routine reporting of S:R ratios to inform the success of future
   SCI research.}},

Abstract = {{With the aid of the Internet, both firms and customers have access to
   vast amounts of data. The aim of the proposed model is to provide a
   method that utilizes data to understand and predict how potential
   customers will value innovations, and communicate thoughts in a
   non-fully connected market. Innovation diffusion models have been
   studied extensively, and are often formulated using either macro-level
   approaches that aggregate much of the market behavior, or using
   micro-level approaches that employ microeconomic information pertaining
   to the potential market and the innovation. We propose a two-stage
   integrated model that benefits from both the macro- and micro-level
   approaches, and we add emphasis to modeling when, what, and how
   customers communicate and process information. The proposed model
   incorporates heterogeneous potential customers and adopters, segmented
   Bayesian learning, and the adopter's satisfaction levels to describe
   biasing and word-of-mouth behavior in a non-fully connected market. (C)

Abstract = {{Over the last 2 years a global assessment of stem cell engineering (SCE)
   was conducted with the sponsorship of the National Science Foundation,
   the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health, and
   the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The purpose was to
   gather information on the worldwide status and trends in SCE, that is,
   the involvement of engineers and engineering approaches in the stem cell
   field, both in basic research and in the translation of research into
   clinical applications and commercial products. The study was facilitated
   and managed by the World Technology Evaluation Center. The process
   involved site visits in both Asia and Europe, and it also included
   several different workshops. From this assessment, the panel concluded
   that there needs to be an increased role for engineers and the
   engineering approach. This will provide a foundation for the generation
   of new markets and future economic growth. To do this will require an
   increased investment in engineering, applied research, and
   commercialization as it relates to stem cell research and technology. It
   also will require programs that support interdisciplinary teams, new
   innovative mechanisms for academic-industry partnerships, and unique
   translational models. In addition, the global community would benefit
   from forming strategic partnerships between countries that can leverage
   existing and emerging strengths in different institutions. To implement
   such partnerships will require multinational grant programs with
   appropriate review mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have been proposed as an alternative energy
   resource for the conversion of organic compounds to electricity. In an
   MFC, microorganisms such as Geobacter sulfurreducens form an
   anode-associated biofilm that can completely oxidize organic matter
   (electron donor) to carbon dioxide with direct electron transfer to the
   anode (electron acceptor). Mathematical models are useful in analyzing
   biofilm processes; however, existing models rely on Nernst-Monod type
   expressions, and evaluate extracellular processes separated from the
   intracellular metabolism of the microorganism. Thus, models that combine
   both extracellular and intracellular components, while addressing
   spatial heterogeneity, are essential for improved representation of
   biofilm processes. The goal of this work is to develop a model that
   integrates genome-scale metabolic models with the model of biofilm
   environment. This integrated model shows the variations of electrical
   current production and biofilm thickness under the presence/absence of
   NH4 in the bulk solution, and under varying maintenance energy demands.
   Further, sensitivity analysis suggested that conductivity is not
   limiting electrical current generation and that increasing cell density
   can lead to enhanced current generation. In addition, the modeling
   results also highlight instances such as the transformation into
   respiring cells, where the mechanism of electrical current generation
   during biofilm development is not yet clearly understood.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with a comorbid diagnosis of cerebral palsy and autism
   spectrum disorder can have significant communication deficits. The
   implementation of an alternative and augmentative communication (AAC)
   device is often essential to promote language development and
   participation in school, home and community environments. The present
   study evaluated the impact of introducing a high-tech alternative and
   augmentative device, namely an Apple iPad with the ``GoTalk Now{''}
   communication application to a student diagnosed with cerebral palsy and
   autism spectrum disorder. Integration of the technology focused on
   promoting key elements associated with long term AAC usage, namely,
   targeted training of the student, teacher, educational assistant and
   parents, over the course of the school year. Marked increases in the
   student's communication skills and non-academic school functioning were
   observed. The need for communication partner prompting declined over
   time while the student, teacher and parent remained engaged by the iPad
   solution. This case study supports the classroom implementation of
   high-tech communication devices for those with complex communication
   needs via a comprehensive access delivery protocol that invokes
   systematic student, teacher, educational assistant and parent training.

Abstract = {{The power conversion system for a battery-energy storage system
   typically employs a conventional voltage-source converter with battery
   strings directly connected to the dc bus. This system configuration
   presents several issues, such as limited efficiency of two-level
   converter systems and the limited reliability associated with the use of
   long battery strings. This paper examines three viable multilevel
   converter solutions for integrating battery energy storage that offer
   the potential for enhanced efficiency and reliability. These solutions
   are the modular multilevel converter (MMLC) with battery energy storage
   distributed into its submodules, the cascaded converter, and the MMLC
   with battery energy storage centralized on its dc link. The three
   systems are compared in terms of efficiency, reliability, and module
   redundancy. It is determined that the MMLC with distributed battery
   energy storage must operate differently from conventional MMLC systems.
   Its operation is therefore studied in detail and validated through
   simulation to demonstrate its suitability for distributed energy-storage
   integration. The analysis shows that the MMLC with distributed battery
   energy storage requires the largest number of semiconductor devices for
   a given power level; however, it also provides the most efficient,
   reliable, and versatile solution of energy-storage integration.}},

Abstract = {{Wideband cable models for the prediction of electromagnetic transients
   in power systems require an accurate calculation of the cable series

   recently proposed for systems of round solid conductors, with the

   approach to include tubular conductors, allowing to model realistic
   cables with tubular sheaths, armors, and pipes. We also include the
   effect of a lossy ground. A noteworthy feature of the proposed technique
   is the accurate prediction of proximity effects, which can be of major
   importance in three-phase, pipe-type, and closely packed single-core
   cables. The new approach is highly efficient compared to finite
   elements. In the case of a cross-bonded cable system featuring
   three-phase conductors and three screens, the proposed technique
   computes the required 120 frequency samples in only six seconds of CPU
   time.}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares the delay and area of a comprehensive set of
   processor building block circuits when implemented on custom CMOS and
   FPGA substrates, then uses these results to show how soft processor
   microarchitectures should be different from those of hard processors. We
   find that the ratios of the custom CMOS versus FPGA area for different
   building blocks varies considerably more than the speed ratios, thus,
   area ratios have more impact on microarchitecture choices. Complete
   processor cores on an FPGA use 17-27x more area ({''}area ratio{''})
   than the same design implemented in custom CMOS. Building blocks with
   dedicated hardware support on FPGAs such as SRAMs, adders, and
   multipliers are particularly area-efficient (2-7x), while multiplexers
   and content-addressable memories (CAM) are particularly area-inefficient
   (> 100x). Applying these results, we find out-of-order soft processors
   should use physical register file organizations to minimize CAM size.}},

Abstract = {{The crystallization behavior of polylactide with different D-lactide
   content (1.5, 4.6, and 10.1\%.) was investigated in the presence of
   dissolved CO2 by using a high-pressure differential scanning
   calorimeter. The PLA's crystallization rate was significantly increased
   with the dissolved CO2 and by reducing the D-lactide content. However,
   the PLA with a high D-lactide content did not reveal any crystallization
   during non-isothermal and isothermal melt crystallization, even under 60
   bar CO2 pressure. On the other hand, the final crystallinity of the
   other two PLA samples differed at various CO2 pressures and at different
   cooling rates. This was due to the resultant effects of CO2's
   plasticization and the density of the crystal nuclei on the PLA's
   molecular mobility, a phenomenon consistent with our earlier
   investigations of PLAs with different branching degrees and with PLA
   nano/microcomposites. Moreover, the plasticizing CO2 molecules depressed
   the crystallization and glass transition temperatures of the PLA samples
   similarly.}},

Abstract = {{Kapton membranes have received much attention in the fabrication of
   space inflatable antenna technology in the recent years. While prized
   for their light designs, their delicate nature makes them susceptible to
   various kinds of disturbances in space environments that result in
   structural vibrations or wrinkle formation. In this regard, macro-fiber
   composite actuators have been commonly used for vibration control of
   these membrane structures. However, wrinkle control remains one of the
   major challenges in their designs. Some of the research in the previous
   literature has attempted to quantify the wrinkle behavior of these
   membranes when subject to boundary forces. Yet, in all the previous
   study, the effects of macro-fiber composite patches, a major compartment
   of these structures, on their wrinkle formation have been ignored. The
   presented article studies the effects of these patches on localization
   of wrinkles and their patterns in Kapton membranes. The numerical
   results are validated experimentally using photogrammetry techniques.
   Two membrane configurations are studied: one considers rectangular
   membranes with clamped-sliding boundary conditions and the other
   pertains to square membranes with symmetric corner loadings.}},

Abstract = {{A lotus leaf was used as a template to fabricate superhydrophobic
   biomorphic ZnO on a carbon substrate (ZnO/C). First, a carbon substrate
   with the microstructure of a leaf surface was obtained by sintering a
   lotus leaf in argon. A biomorphic ZnO/C material was then obtained by
   immersing this carbon substrate into a Zn(NO3)(2) solution and
   sintering. Finally, the hydrophobicity of the surfaces of the products
   thus obtained was investigated. This ZnO/C material exhibited excellent
   superhydrophobicity and low adhesion after it was modified with fluorine
   silane. The water contact angle of the resulting product was 162
   degrees, which exceeds that of the lotus leaf (157 degrees) and is much
   higher than that of smooth carbon covered with the same fluorine silane
   (114 degrees). Moreover, this surface displayed a stable
   superhydrophobic performance even after exposure to ambient air for
   several months. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Polypyrrole (PPy) conducting polymers have shown a great potential for
   the fabrication of conjugated polymer-based actuating devices.
   Consequently, they have been a key point in developing many advanced
   emerging applications such as biomedical devices and biomimetic
   robotics. When designing an actuator, taking all of the related decision
   variables, their roles and relationships into consideration is of
   pivotal importance to determine the actuator's final performance.
   Therefore, the central focus of this study is to develop an
   electrochemomechanical constrained multiobjective optimization model of
   a PPy/MWCNTs trilayer actuator. For this purpose, the objective
   functions are designed to capture the three main characteristics of
   these actuators, namely their tip vertical displacement, blocking force
   and response time. To obtain the optimum range of the designated
   decision variables within the feasible domain, a multiobjective
   optimization algorithm is applied while appropriate constraints are
   imposed. The optimum points form a Pareto surface on which they are
   consistently spread. The numerical results are presented; these results
   enable one to design an actuator with consideration to the desired
   output performances. For the experimental analysis, a multilayer
   bending-type actuator is fabricated, which is composed of a PVDF layer
   and two layers of PPy with an incorporated layer of multi-walled carbon
   nanotubes deposited on each side of the PVDF membrane. The numerical
   results are experimentally verified; in order to determine the
   performance of the fabricated actuator, its outputs are compared with a
   neat PPy actuator's experimental and numerical counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{The relationships between leak geometry and detectability are explored
   with a distinction between steady- and unsteady-state based techniques.
   Various criteria to evaluate the size and detectability of a leak are
   first discussed. These criteria can be useful for the benchmarking and
   the comparison of different techniques. Since the test conditions play a
   crucial rule in leak detectability, the proposed criteria take this
   effect into account. Furthermore, they show that while in steady-state
   conditions increases in system pressure enhance leak detectability, in
   transient state, by contrast, higher pressures tend to decrease
   detectability. This effect is also confirmed by experimental tests
   carried out at the Water Engineering Laboratory of the University of

Abstract = {{This paper compares two important downlink multicell interference
   mitigation techniques, namely, large-scale (LS) multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) and network MIMO. We consider a cooperative
   wireless cellular system operating in time-division duplex (TDD) mode,
   wherein each cooperating cluster includes base-stations (BSs), each
   equipped with multiple antennas and scheduling single-antenna users. In
   an LS-MIMO system, each BS employs antennas not only to serve its
   scheduled users, but also to null out interference caused to the other
   users within the cooperating cluster using zero-forcing (ZF)
   beamforming. In a network MIMO system, each BS is equipped with only
   antennas, but interference cancellation is realized by data and channel
   state information exchange over the backhaul links and joint downlink
   transmission using ZF beamforming. Both systems are able to completely
   eliminate intra-cluster interference and to provide the same number of
   spatial degrees of freedom per user. Assuming the uplink-downlink
   channel reciprocity provided by TDD, both systems are subject to
   identical channel acquisition overhead during the uplink pilot
   transmission stage. Further, the available sum power at each cluster is
   fixed and assumed to be equally distributed across the downlink beams in
   both systems. Building upon the channel distribution functions and using
   tools from stochastic ordering, this paper shows, however, that from a
   performance point of view, users experience better quality of service,
   averaged over small-scale fading, under an LS-MIMO system than a network
   MIMO system. Numerical simulations for a multicell network reveal that
   this conclusion also holds true with regularized ZF beamforming scheme.
   Hence, given the likely lower cost of adding excess number of antennas
   at each BS, LS-MIMO could be the preferred route toward interference
   mitigation in cellular networks.}},

Abstract = {{Though network coding is traditionally performed over finite fields,
   recent work on nested-lattice-based network coding suggests that, by
   allowing network coding over certain finite rings, more efficient

   considers the problem of communication over a finite-ring matrix channel
   Y = AX + BE, where X is the channel input, Y is the channel output, E is
   random error, and A and B are random transfer matrices. Tight capacity
   results are obtained and simple polynomial-complexity capacity-achieving
   coding schemes are provided under the assumption that A is uniform over
   all full-rank matrices and BE is uniform over all rank-t matrices,
   extending the work of Silva, Kschischang, and Kotter (2010), who handled
   the case of finite fields. This extension is based on several new
   results, which may be of independent interest, that generalize concepts

Abstract = {{The solid-liquid interface is examined as aluminum solidifies and melts
   onto a circular cylinder in flowing liquid aluminum. Cylinders of
   different elemental composition from aluminum were immersed into liquid
   aluminum flow-fields under conditions which promote the aluminum
   solid-liquid interface to move forward and then in reverse. The
   solidification and melting time (SMT) of the aluminum shell was measured
   by thermocouples located on the surface of the cylinder. These
   thermocouples monitor the point in time where the receding solid-liquid
   interface approaches the surface of the cylinder. The data demonstrate
   that the shell solidifies and melts faster closer to the stagnation
   point. ANSYS Fluent, which incorporates an enthalpy algorithm, was
   utilized to predict this phase change process. When a thermal resistance
   is implemented at the cylinder-aluminum interface, there is good
   agreement between the numerically predicted and the experimentally
   measured aluminum shell SMTs. The effect of various magnitudes of
   thermal resistance at the cylinder-aluminum interface was explored on
   the local aluminum SMTs.}},

Abstract = {{Recently we showed that fluid accumulation in the neck can narrow the
   upper airway (UA) and increase its collapsibility, which may exacerbate
   obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, the available methods for
   measuring neck fluid volume (NFV) are inconvenient and expensive.
   Narrowing of the UA due to fluid accumulation could change acoustic
   characteristics of respiratory sounds. In this study, we developed a
   novel approach for non-invasive estimation of NFV from acoustic
   measurements. Twenty-eight healthy subjects lay awake and supine for 90
   min while NFV and tracheal sounds were measured simultaneously using
   bioimpedance and a microphone, respectively. Sets of tracheal sound
   features were calculated in time and frequency domains and were reduced
   using methods based on regression and
   minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance. The resulting feature sets were
   applied to a multi-linear regression and a mixture-density neural
   network to estimate NFV. Our results show very small relative estimation
   errors of 1.25 and 3.23\%, based on the regression and neural network
   methods, respectively. These results support the practical application
   of this technology in diagnosing fluid accumulation in the neck and its
   possible contributions to the pathogenesis of OSA.}},

Abstract = {{Anticipation of future events is recognized to be a significant element
   of driver competence. Surely, guiding one's behavior through the
   anticipation of future traffic states provides potential gains in
   recognition and reaction times. However, the role of anticipation in
   driving has not been systematically studied. In this paper, we identify
   the characteristics of anticipation in driving and provide a working
   definition. In particular, we distinguish it from driving goals such as
   eco or defensive driving and define it as a high-level competence for
   efficient positioning of the vehicle to facilitate these goals. We also
   present a driving simulator study assessing the relation between driver
   experience and anticipation. Thirty drivers from three different
   experience categories (low, medium, and high) completed five scenarios,
   each involving several pre-event cues designed to allow the anticipation
   of an event. The results showed that more experienced drivers
   demonstrated more pre-event actions compared with less experienced
   drivers. While pre-event actions resulted in improved safety on certain
   occasions, the effects were often not significant. Future research
   should further investigate the mechanisms underlying anticipation,
   particularly how drivers make use of temporal and spatial gains obtained
   through the recognition of pre-event cues.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an analytical framework for characterizing and
   optimizing the power-performance tradeoff in Software-as-a-Service
   (SaaS) cloud platforms. Our objectives are two-folded: 1) We maximize
   the operating revenue when serving heterogeneous SaaS applications with
   unpredictable user requests. 2) We minimize the power consumption when
   processing the user requests. To achieve these objectives, we construct
   a unified profit-maximizing objective to jointly consider revenue and
   cost in an economic view. An offline solution to maximize the supreme
   bound of the objective is first developed, to 1) justify the validity of
   our theoretical model, and 2) establish a benchmark to examine the
   effectiveness of other control solutions. As a highlight of our
   contributions, we take advantage of the Lyapunov optimization techniques
   to design and analyze an optimal yet practical control framework, which
   makes online decisions on request admission control, routing, and
   virtual machine (VMs) scheduling. Our control framework can accommodate
   a variety of design choices and operational requirements in a
   datacenter. Specifically, buffering facilities can be introduced to
   alleviate the bursty admitted requests and to improve the robustness of
   the system, and a power budget can be enforced to improve the datacenter
   performance (dollar) per watt. Our mathematical analyses and simulations
   have demonstrated both the optimality (in terms of the cost-effective
   power-performance tradeoff) and stability (in terms of robustness and
   adaptivity to time-varying and bursty user requests) achieved by our
   proposed control framework.}},

Abstract = {{Retail buildings have a potential for both short-term (customer) and
   long-term (occupational) exposure to indoor pollutants. However, little
   is known about volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations in the
   retail sector and influencing factors, such as ventilation, in-store
   activities, and store type. We measured VOC concentrations and
   ventilation rates in 14 retail stores in Texas and Pennsylvania. With
   the exception of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, VOCs were present in
   retail stores at concentrations well below health guidelines. Indoor
   formaldehyde concentrations ranged from 4.6ppb to 67ppb. The two
   mid-sized grocery stores in the sample had the highest levels of ethanol
   and acetaldehyde, with concentrations up to 2.6ppm and 92ppb,
   respectively, possibly due to the preparation of dough and baking
   activities. Indoor-to-outdoor concentration ratios indicated that indoor
   sources were the main contributors to indoor VOC concentrations for the
   majority of compounds. There was no strong correlation between
   ventilation and VOC concentrations across all stores. However,
   increasing the air exchange rates at two stores led to lower indoor VOC
   concentrations, suggesting that ventilation can be used to reduce
   concentrations for some specific stores.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To conduct a series of focus groups with primary care
   physicians to determine the optimal format of a shortened, focused
   systematic review.
   Materials and methods Prototypes for two formats of a shortened
   systematic review were developed and presented to participants during
   focus group sessions. Focus groups were conducted with primary care
   physicians who were in full- or part-time practice. An iterative process
   was used so that the information learned from the first set of focus
   groups (Round 1) influenced the material presented to the second set of
   focus groups (Round 2). The focus group discussions were recorded,
   transcribed verbatim, and analyzed.
   Results Each of the two rounds of testing included three focus groups. A
   total of 32 physicians participated (Round 1: 16 participants; Round
   2:16 participants). Analysis of the transcripts from Round 1 identified
   three themes including ease of use, clarity, and implementation. Changes
   were made to the prototypes based on the results so that the revised
   prototypes could be presented and discussed in the second round of focus
   groups. After analysis of transcripts from Round 2, four themes were
   identified, including ease of use, clarity, brevity, and implementation.
   Revisions were made to the prototypes based on the results.
   Conclusions Primary care physicians provided input on the refinement of
   two prototypes of a shortened systematic review for clinicians. Their
   feedback guided changes to the format, presentation, and layout of these
   prototypes in order to increase usability and uptake for end-users.}},

Title = {{A Computer Architecture for the Automatic Design of Modular Systems With
   Application to Photovoltaic Reverse Osmosis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Systems such as electronics, cars, computers, and robots are assembled
   from modular components for specific applications. Photovoltaic reverse
   osmosis (PVRO) systems, which can be custom-tailored for the water
   demands and solar properties of particular communities, are an important
   potential application of modular systems. Clearly, to be financially
   viable, such systems must be assembled from commercially available
   components and subsystems (modules). Designing a system from modular
   components for a specific application is not simple. Even for a
   relatively small inventory of modular components, the number of possible
   system configurations that exist is extremely large. For a small
   community, determining the best system configuration is an overwhelming
   task due to lack of expertise. This paper presents a modular design
   architecture that can be implemented on a laptop so nonexperts can
   configure systems from modular components. The method uses a hierarchy
   of filters, which can be provided from an expert system, to limit the
   large design space. Optimization methods and detailed models are then
   used to configure the location-specific system from the reduced design
   space. The method is applied here to community-scale PVRO systems and
   example cases demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores the application of wavelet decomposition as a means
   to distinguish between local and regional sources of ultrafine particles
   (UFP). Particle number concentrations were measured at a central site,
   two downtown sites, and four residential sites located across Toronto,
   Canada. Using a wavelet decomposition algorithm, particle concentration
   time series were separated into two signals: high frequency
   local-to-neighbourhood scale sources and low frequency urban-to-regional
   scale sources and processes. At the field sites, local neighbourhood
   sources contributed between 13 and 32\% of the total particle
   concentration. The urban regional signal at each field site exhibited
   stronger correlation and greater homogeneity with respect to the central
   site than the original concentration time series. In contrast, the high
   frequency local neighbourhood source signals exhibited limited
   correlation and high heterogeneity with respect to the central site.
   Traffic volume within a 2.5 km buffer explained 87\% of the variability
   in the local neighbourhood level signal observed between field sites
   while no significant association with traffic was found for the original
   particle number concentration data. This study has demonstrated that
   wavelet decomposition can be a useful tool for estimating exposure to
   UFP from local neighbourhood and urban regional scale sources and
   processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Interruptions experienced by cardiovascular intensive care unit nurses:
   An observational study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{848-853}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Intensive care unit (ICU) nurses get interrupted frequently.
   Although interruptions take cognitive resources from a primary task and
   may hinder performance, they may also convey critical information.
   Effective management of interruptions in ICUs requires the understanding
   of interruption characteristics, the context in which interruption
   happens, and interruption content.
   Methods: An observational study was conducted in a cardiovascular ICU at
   a Canadian teaching hospital. Four observers (1 PhD and 3 undergraduate
   students) trained in human factors research observed 40 nurses,
   approximately 1 hour each, over a 3-week period. Data were recorded by
   the observers in real time, using touchscreen tablet PCs and special
   software designed for this purpose.
   Results: Although approximately half of the interruptions (similar to
   51\%) happened during high-severity tasks, more than half of these
   interruptions, which happened during high-severity tasks, conveyed
   either work-or patient-related information. Furthermore, the rate of
   interruptions with personal content was significantly higher during
   low-severity tasks compared with medium-and high-severity tasks.
   Conclusions: Mitigation strategies other than blocking should also be
   explored. In addition, interrupters might have evaluated primary task
   severity before interrupting. Therefore, making task severity more
   transparent may help others modulate when and how they interrupt a
   nurse. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of soft tissue sarcoma management in the extremities is limb
   preservation, often combining surgery and external beam radiation. In
   patients who have undergone this therapy in the thigh, pathologic
   fracture is a serious, late complication. Nonunion rates of 80-90\%
   persist. No reliable biologic solution exists. A rat model combining one
   18Gy dose of radiation and diaphyseal periosteal excision reliably
   generates atrophic non-union of femoral fractures. We hypothesized that
   augmentation with OP-1 would increase union rate. Female Sprague-Dawley
   retired breeder rats were randomized to Control, Disease (external beam
   radiotherapy and periosteal stripping), Control + OP-1 (80mg) and
   Disease + OP-1 groups. Animals underwent prophylactic fixation and
   controlled left femur fracture. Twenty-eight, 35, and 42 days
   post-fracture were end-points. Femora were analyzed using MicroCT, Back
   Scattered Electron Microscopy, and Histomorphometry. We observed a 2\%
   union rate in the Disease groups (+/- OP-1 treatment). The union rate in
   Control groups was 97\%. MicroCT demonstrated a lack of callus volume in
   Disease groups. Heterotopic ossification was observed in some OP-1
   treated animals. The ineffectiveness of OP-1 in stimulating fracture
   union in this model suggests the endogenous repair mechanism has been
   compromised beyond the capabilities of osteoinductive biologics. (C)

Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{124-130}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{As heat exchangers are used extensively in many engineering fields the
   increase of their heat transfer rate, while reducing their flow
   resistance has become one the most challenging aspects in heat transfer.
   In this study, heat transfer and flow resistance of alternating
   elliptical axis tubes is investigated both experimentally and
   numerically. The working fluid is heat transfer oil, and the flow's
   Reynolds number ranges from 300 to 2000. The grid and numerical models
   are generated using Gambit 2.4.6 and Fluent 6.3, which are verified by
   the experimental results. The numerical results show that decreasing the
   aspect ratio and pitch length, increases heat transfer and flow
   resistance. However, in order to compare the heat transfer and flow
   resistance simultaneously, the non-dimensional heat transfer enhancement
   ratio is defined. The comparison of this ratio shows that alternating
   elliptical axis tubes perform better than the flattened or circular
   ones. It is observed that this ratio increases with the increase in
   Reynolds number. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Concerns regarding the potential health effects of microorganisms in the
   indoor environment paired with recent advances in DNA sequencing
   technologies have led to a rapid expansion in microbial studies of the
   built environment. The objective of this study is to compare the
   microbial communities recovered from six different samplers placed in
   the same building to assess how sample selection can impact the
   interpretation of the indoor microbiome. To this end, pyrosequencing was
   used to delineate the fungal and bacterial communities recovered from
   six samplers placed in an occupied retail building over two consecutive
   sampling events spaced one week apart. The microbial communities (335K+
   sequences) were much more diverse in the settled dust and heating,
   ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) filter dust samples than the
   communities recovered from the shorter term, composite samples collected
   in four different bioaerosol samplers. The bacterial communities
   recovered from a given sampler were in general more similar to
   communities from the same samplers than to communities recovered during
   the same sampling event. Only 14\% of the bacterial OTUs and 44\% of the
   fungal OTUs detected were shared in all four bioaerosol samplers,
   despite the fact that the samplers were collocated and sampled the
   indoor air simultaneously. These results indicate that sample type
   should be considered when interpreting results, particularly when
   comparing results across multiple studies that use different sampling
   techniques. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A hardware efficient method and system for estimating the time constant
   and measuring the current of the output capacitors in digitally

   emulates the equivalent RC circuit of the output capacitor with a much

   until the two circuits have the same time constant. The adjustment is
   based on a novel zero voltage crossing detection method and on
   synchronization with the digital pulse-width modulator operation. The
   effectiveness of the new estimator is verified with a 5 V to 1 V/5 A,
   500-kHz buck converter prototype utilizing an optimal response
   controller. The experimental results show accuracy within a few tens of
   nanoseconds in the detection of capacitor zero-current crossing points,
   corresponding to a smaller than a 1.5\% error in the time constant
   estimation, and, compared to an imperfectly tuned system, about 40\%
   smaller voltage deviation during transients.}},

Abstract = {{There are many ways to reduce the carbon footprint of concrete including
   reduction in its portland cement clinker content by methods including:
   (a) optimization of total aggregate gradations, (b) use of
   water-reducing admixtures, (c) intergrinding clinker with limestone, and
   (d) use of supplementary cementing materials (SCMs). However, the most
   effective way to improve sustainability of concrete structures is by
   making them last longer through design for durability, and by
   minimization of construction defects. In almost every case, durable
   concretes will include all of the above listed aspects, but from a
   design approach, the emphasis needs to be on durability. Durability
   design includes more than the selection of concrete materials and mix
   proportions. It also requires that construction detailing, temperature
   control, adequate compaction, protection of fresh concrete, and curing
   be detailed in the specification and that inspection and testing be
   carried out to ensure that the specifications are being followed. The
   performance requirements need to be stated explicitly, and the
   objectives made clear. In addition to discussing various aspects of
   concrete durability, this contribution will discuss the merits of
   performance and objective-based specifications as well as the processes
   required to make them work. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {{Cas4 nucleases constitute a core family of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly
   Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) associated proteins, but little
   is known about their structure and activity. Here we report the crystal
   structure of the Cas4 protein Pcal\_0546 from Pyrobaculum calidifontis,
   which revealed a monomeric protein with a RecB-like fold and one
   {[}2Fe-2S] cluster coordinated by four conserved Cys residues.
   Pcal\_0546 exhibits metal-dependent 5' to 3' exonuclease activity
   against ssDNA substrates, whereas the Cas4 protein SSO1391 from
   Sulfolobus solfataricus can cleave ssDNA in both the 5' to 3' and 3' to
   5' directions. The active site of Pcal\_0546 contains a bound metal ion
   coordinated by the side chains of Asp123, Glu136, His146, and the main
   chain carbonyl of Ile137. Site-directed mutagenesis of Pcal\_0546 and
   SSO1391 revealed that the residues of RecB motifs II, III and QhXXY are
   critical for nuclease activity, whereas mutations of the conserved Cys
   residues resulted in a loss of the iron-sulfur cluster, but had no
   effect on DNA cleavage. Our results revealed the biochemical diversity
   of Cas4 nucleases, which can have different oligomeric states, contain
   {[}4Fe-4S] or {[}2Fe-2S] clusters, and cleave single stranded DNA in
   different directions producing single-stranded DNA overhangs, which are
   potential intermediates for the synthesis of new CRISPR spacers.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering frequently involves cells and scaffolds to replace
   damaged or diseased tissue. It originated, in part, as a means of
   effecting the delivery of biomolecules such as insulin or neurotrophic
   factors, given that cells are constitutive producers of such therapeutic
   agents. Thus cell delivery is intrinsic to tissue engineering.
   Controlled release of biomolecules is also an important tool for
   enabling cell delivery since the biomolecules can enable cell
   engraftment, modulate inflammatory response or otherwise benefit the
   behavior of the delivered cells. We describe advances in cell and
   biomolecule delivery for tissue regeneration, with emphasis on the
   central nervous system (CNS). In the first section, the focus is on
   encapsulated cell therapy. In the second section, the focus is on
   biomolecule delivery in polymeric nano/microspheres and hydrogels for
   the nerve regeneration and endogenous cell stimulation. In the third
   section, the focus is on combination strategies of neural
   stem/progenitor cell or mesenchymal stem cell and biomolecule delivery
   for tissue regeneration and repair. In each section, the challenges and
   potential solutions associated with delivery to the CNS are highlighted.

   the point of care. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the Op-KT tool for appropriate disease management by
   physicians.
   Methods: The Op-KT tool was evaluated using an interrupted time series
   design. This involved multiple assessments of the outcomes 12 months
   before (baseline) and 12 months after tool implementation (52 data
   points in total). Inclusion criteria were family physicians and their
   patients at risk for osteoporosis (women aged >= 50 years, men aged >=
   65 years). Primary outcomes were the initiation of appropriate
   osteoporosis screening and treatment. Analyses included segmented linear
   regression modeling and analysis of variance.
   Results: The Op-KT tool was implemented in three family practices in
   Ontario, Canada representing 5 family physicians with 2840 age eligible
   patients (mean age 67 years; 76\% women). Time series regression models
   showed an overall increase from baseline in the initiation of screening
   (3.4\%; P < 0.001), any osteoporosis medications (0.5\%; P = 0.006), and
   calcium or vitamin D (1.2\%; P = 0.001). Improvements were also observed
   at site level for all the three sites considered, but these results
   varied across the sites. Of 351 patients who completed the RAQ
   unprompted (mean age 64 years, 77\% women), the mean time for completing
   the RAQ was 3.43 minutes, and 56\% had any disease management addressed
   by their physician. Study limitations included the inherent
   susceptibility of our design compared with a randomized trial.
   Conclusions: The multicomponent Op-KT tool significantly increased
   osteoporosis investigations in three family practices, and highlights
   its potential to facilitate patient self-management. Next steps include
   wider implementation and evaluation of the tool in primary care.}},

Abstract = {{The authors propose Markovian-based spectrum sensing policies in a
   cognitive radio system that leverages past sensing outcomes of several
   cooperating secondary users (SUs) to decide which channel (of primary
   users -PUs) should be sensed by each SU at a given time. These policies
   are based on a new finite-state channel model that captures the fading
   condition as well as the occupancy state for each primary channel. The
   multiuser extension of this model is useful when multiple spatially
   distributed SUs share their sensing outcomes. The proposed schemes allow
   the asynchronous sensing outcomes obtained by the SUs over different
   slots to be fused together and converted into a posteriori probabilities
   for the current states of the primary channels. As the detection
   threshold in a spectrum detector balances the trade-off between the
   false-alarm and miss probabilities for detecting primary signals in a
   single primary channel, a design parameter is introduced to allow the
   system designer to devise policies with different levels of
   aggressiveness. The authors evaluate the optimality and complexity of
   the proposed sensing policies and show that our schemes significantly
   increase secondary use of the spectrum and/or reduce interference with
   PUs compared to a random selection policy or a cooperative sensing
   policy based on a two-state channel model.}},

Title = {{High-resolution computational fluid dynamics detects flow instabilities
   in the carotid siphon: Implications for aneurysm initiation and rupture?}},

Abstract = {{The carotid siphon is by nature a tortuous vessel segment with sharp
   bends and large area variations, and of relevance to the study of
   intracranial aneurysm initiation and rupture. The aim of this paper was
   to determine whether the siphon might harbor flow instabilities, if care
   is taken to resolve them. This study focused on five consecutive
   internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm cases from the open-source
   Aneurisk dataset. The aneurysm, always downstream of the siphon, was
   digitally removed using previously developed and verified tools.
   Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models included long cervical segments
   upstream, and middle and anterior cerebral arteries downstream.
   High-resolution pulsatile simulations were performed using the
   equivalent of similar to 24 million linear tetrahedra on average (range
   16-32 M) and 30,000 time-steps/cycle. Two of the five cases were laminar
   with mild flow instabilities right after peak systole. One of the cases
   experienced strong periodic vortex shedding at a frequency of around 100
   Hz. The remaining two cases harbored higher frequency flow instabilities
   and complex 3D vortical structures, extending to the cerebral arteries
   downstream. Our findings suggest that the carotid siphon, a conduit to
   the majority of anterior intracranial aneurysms, may experience flow
   instabilities, consistent with in vitro reports, but seemingly at odds
   with the majority of CFD studies, which have been done at lower
   resolutions. This has obvious implications for elucidating the forces
   involved in aneurysm initiation; and propagation of flow instabilities
   into ICA or downstream aneurysms could also impact understanding of the
   forces involved in aneurysm rupture. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The velocity of detectable information (signal velocity) in a medium
   capable of supporting abnormal (superluminal or negative) group
   velocities is calculated. This is carried out by tracking the time
   instant at which the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the detector output
   reaches a predetermined threshold while considering the total classical
   and quantum noise of the channel in addition to the detector noise.
   Furthermore, the method of steepest descent is incorporated to
   systematically study various forms of pulse reshaping associated with
   superluminal propagation and its effect on SNR. By studying the behavior
   of SNR as a function of both space and time, the present analysis
   predicts the existence of a cutoff distance beyond which signal velocity
   of a superluminal pulse is delayed as compared to a companion pulse
   traveling the same distance in vacuum. Finally, the interplay between
   the relative strength of the medium-generated noise and the detector
   noise and its effect on signal velocity is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{When the frequency of the source of vibration of a piezolectric
   generator is significantly different from its eigenfrequency, the
   dielectric power losses become prominent and decrease the amount of
   power which is practically harvested. For off-resonance vibrating
   frequencies, the optimal operating conditions can be obtained with a
   Maximum Power Point Tracking method. This paper introduces complex
   phasors in the study of power conversion for piezoelectric generators.
   These complex phasors are used to describe three strategies which help
   simplify the tracking of the optimal generator output power for
   vibration frequencies which are away from resonance. Experimental
   results obtained on a prototype illustrate and confirm the approach with
   the phasor approaches illustrate and confirm the success of the proposed
   optimal power tracking strategies. Finally, we show that the efficiency
   results of each strategy depend on whether they are used inside or
   outside a frequency bandwidth around the eigenfrequency, and that the
   length of this bandwidth depends on the excitation amplitude. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A previously developed cryogenic abrasive jet micro-machining apparatus
   was used to machine polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), high carbon steel,
   and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) at temperatures between -182 degrees C
   and 17 degrees C. As the machining temperature was lowered, the maximum
   erosion rate of PTFE increased five-fold and was found to occur at
   progressively higher angles of attack, shifting from 15 degrees to 90
   degrees, although the angular dependence weakened and the maximum became
   less pronounced. This was similar to the behavior of PDMS observed in an
   earlier study {[}1]. The dependence of the erosion rate on angle of
   attack in high carbon steel, a useful masking material, was found to be
   insensitive to temperature, but the erosion rate increased approximately
   two-fold as the temperature decreased from 17 degrees C to -182 degrees
   C. The cross-sectional profiles of masked, machined micro-channels in
   PDMS and PTFE had relatively steep sidewalls compared to glass channels,
   even at the lowest temperature of -182 degrees C, which indicates
   erosion was still not fully brittle. Predictions of the evolution of the
   channel cross-sectional profiles generally agreed well with experiments,
   although the channel width in PDMS at -182 degrees C was
   under-predicted, most likely due to thermal effects. None of the
   materials exhibited an erosion incubation period, and there was minimal
   particle embedding in the samples machined below room temperature. (C)

Abstract = {{The sources of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during wintertime
   at a background urban location in Cork city (Ireland) have been
   determined. Aerosol chemical analyses were performed by multiple
   techniques including on-line high resolution aerosol time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry (Aerodyne HR-ToF-AMS), on-line single particle aerosol
   time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TSI ATOFMS), on-line elemental
   carbon-organic carbon analysis (Sunset\_EC-OC), and off-line gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry and ion chromatography analysis of
   filter samples collected at 6-h resolution. Positive matrix
   factorization (PMF) has been carried out to better elucidate aerosol
   sources not clearly identified when analyzing results from individual
   aerosol techniques on their own. Two datasets have been considered:
   on-line measurements averaged over 2-h periods, and both on-line and
   off-line measurements averaged over 6-h periods. Five aerosol sources
   were identified by PMF in both datasets, with excellent agreement
   between the two solutions: (1) regional domestic solid fuel burning
   ``DSF\_Regional,{''} 24-27\%; (2) local urban domestic solid fuel
   burning - ``DSF Urban,{''} 22-23\%; (3) road vehicle emissions -
   ``Traffic,{''} 15-20\%; (4) secondary aerosols from regional
   anthropogenic sources - ``SA\_Regional{''} 9-13\%; and (5) secondary
   aged/processed aerosols related to urban anthropogenic sources -
   ``SA\_Urban,{''} 21-26\%. The results indicate that, despite regulations
   for restricting the use of smoky fuels, solid fuel burning is the major
   source (46-50\%) of PM2.5 in wintertime in Cork, and also likely other
   areas of Ireland. Whilst wood combustion is strongly associated with OC
   and EC, it was found that peat and coal combustion is linked mainly with
   OC and the aerosol from these latter sources appears to be more volatile
   than that produced by wood combustion. Ship emissions from the nearby
   port were found to be mixed with the SA\_Regional factor. The PMF
   analysis allowed us to link the AMS cooking organic aerosol factor
   (AMS\_PMF\_COA) to oxidized organic aerosol, chloride and locally
   produced nitrate, indicating that AMS\_PMF\_COA cannot be attributed to
   primary cooking emissions only. Overall, there are clear benefits from
   factor analysis applied to results obtained from multiple techniques,
   which allows better association of aerosols with sources and atmospheric
   processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Signal velocity is calculated in a medium with negative group delay
   (NGD). By accounting for the medium and the detector noise sources, the
   time varying probability of error at the detector {[}Pe(t)] is evaluated
   in the NGD channel and a normal dispersion channel. The scheme in which
   Pe(t) falls below a threshold at earlier time, implies faster
   information transfer. It is found that the signal velocity depends on
   the detector type and the relative noise strength of the detector with
   respect to the channel. Finally, it is shown that NGD channels can be
   useful in applications that are limited by the detector noise. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Scattering techniques (i.e., static light scattering, small angle
   neutron scattering,(11) or small angle X-ray scattering) are excellent
   tools to study nanoscopic objects in solution. However, to interpret the
   experimental data, one needs to use the appropriate form factor. While
   recent progress has been made in the writing of form factors for complex
   structures, there is still a need to develop a method to evaluate the
   form factor of inhomogeneous elongated scatterers. Here, we propose an
   approach based on the principle of Russian dolls. Multiblock rods are
   represented as multi generations of rods (mother, daughter,
   granddaughter, etc.), where each rod is nested within the rod of the
   previous generation, like Russian dolls. A shift parameter is used to
   introduce asymmetry in the rod along its long axis. This approach not
   only allowed us to write the form factor of multiblock rods, but it also
   gave us the possibility to account for the polydispersity in length of
   each block and of the shift parameter. Finally, we applied these
   equations to the case of a series of solutions of triblock comicelles
   slightly polydisperse in length.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that the use of bis(tri-n-hexylsilyl oxide)
   silicon phthalocyanine ((3HS)(2)-SiPc) as an additive in a P3HT:PC61BM
   cascade ternary bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic (BHJ OPV)
   device results in an increase in the short circuit current (JSC) and
   efficiency (eta(eff)) of up to 25\% and 20\%, respectively. The previous
   studies have attributed the increase in performance to the presence of
   (3HS)(2)-SiPc at the BHJ interface. In this study, we explored the
   molecular characteristics of (3HS)(2)-SiPc which makes it so effective
   in increasing the OPV device JSC and eta(eff). Initially, we synthesized
   phthalocyanine-based additives using different core elements such as
   germanium and boron instead of silicon, each having similar frontier
   orbital energies compared to (3HS)(2)-SiPc and tested their effect on
   BHJ OPV device performance. We observed that addition of
   bis(tri-n-hexylsilyl oxide) germanium phthalocyanine ((3HS)2-GePc) or
   tri-n-hexylsilyl oxide boron subphthalocyanine (3HS-BsubPc) resulted in
   a nonstatistically significant increase in JSC and eta(eff). Secondly,
   we kept the silicon phthalocyanine core and substituted the
   tri-n-hexylsilyl solubilizing groups with pentadecyl phenoxy groups and
   tested the resulting dye in a BHJ OPV. While an increase in JSC and
   eta(eff) was observed at low (PDP)2-SiPc loadings, the increase was not
   as significant as (3HS)(2)-SiPc; therefore, (3HS)2-SiPc is a unique
   additive. During our study, we observed that (3HS)(2)-SiPc had an
   extraordinary tendency to crystallize compared to the other compounds in
   this study and our general experience. On the basis of this observation,
   we have offered a hypothesis that when (3HS)(2)-SiPc migrates to the
   P3HT:PC61BM interface the reason for its unique performance is not
   solely due to its frontier orbital energies but also might be due to a
   high driving force for crystallization.}},

Title = {{White matter lesion filling improves the accuracy of cortical thickness
   measurements in multiple sclerosis patients: a longitudinal study}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that white matter (WM)
   lesions bias automated brain tissue classifications and cerebral volume
   measurements. However, filling WM lesions using the intensity of
   neighbouring normal-appearing WM has been shown to increase the accuracy
   of automated volume measurements in the brain. In the present study, we
   investigate the influence of WM lesions on cortical thickness (CTh)
   measures and assessed the impact of lesion filling on both
   cross-sectional/longitudinal and global/regional measurements of CTh in
   multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
   Methods: Fifty MS patients were studied at baseline as well as after
   three and six years of follow-up. CTh was estimated using a fully
   automated pipeline (CIVET) on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images data
   acquired at 1.5 Tesla without (original) and with WM lesion filling
   (filled). WM lesions were semi-automatically segmented and then filled
   with the mean intensity of the neighbouring voxels. For both original
   and filled T1 images we investigated and compared the main CIVET's
   steps: tissue classification, surfaces generation and CTh measurement.
   Results: On the original T1 images, the majority of WM lesion volume
   (72\%) was wrongly classified as gray matter (GM). After lesion filling
   the accuracy of WM lesions classification improved significantly (p <
   0.001, 94\% of WM lesion volume correctly classified) as well as the WM
   surface generation (p < 0.0001). The mean CTh computed on the original
   T1 images, overall time points, was significantly thinner (p < 0.001)
   compared the CTh estimated on the filled T1 images. The vertex-wise
   longitudinal analysis performed on the filled T1 images showed an
   increased number of vertices in the fronto-temporal region with a
   significantly decrease of CTh over time compared the analysis performed
   on the original images.
   Conclusion: These results indicate that WM lesions bias the CTh
   estimation both cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally. The lesion
   filling approach significantly improved the accuracy of the regional CTh
   estimation and has an impact also on the global estimation of CTh.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, urea-formaldehyde based microcapsules containing linseed
   oil were prepared via in situ polymerization method. Microcapsules with
   a regular spherical shape, 10-300 mu m diameter and an oil content of
   63-77 wt\% were synthesized in various core:shell ratios and different
   mixing speeds. The effect of core:shell ratio and mixing speed on the
   size and morphology of the microcapsule were studied using optical
   microscopy, SEM and particle size analysis. Epoxy-based coatings
   containing various amounts of microcapsules were prepared and the effect
   of microcapsule size and loading on the mechanical properties and
   healing performance were evaluated by measuring the tensile properties
   and corrosion performance of the coatings. The amount of the oil
   released in the scratched coating was determined both practically and
   theoretically and the results were compared.
   The results showed that the addition of microcapsules reduces the
   tensile properties of the coating, the extent of which depends on the
   microcapsule size and loading wt\%. For instance, sample containing 3
   wt\% of the microcapsules with an average particle size of 53 mu m
   showed 8.6\% reduction in tensile modulus. Optical microscopy of the
   scratched sample revealed that with increasing microcapsules' size and
   loading, the crack was filled more effectively and this led to an
   improved corrosion performance. Finally, the optimum combination of
   self-healing and mechanical properties was found to be for the coating
   containing 5 wt\% of microcapsules, with an average particle size of 53
   mu m. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new mechanism for inducing column separation and rejoinder during
   rapid filling of gravity pipe systems is numerically and conceptually
   identified. A shock-fitting model is combined with the discrete gas
   cavity model to compute the resulting water hammer due to column
   rejoinder. Numerical explorations show that column separation may be
   induced during rapid filling when the water column encounters a flow
   restriction such as a partially open valve followed by a ``V-shaped{''}
   pipe profile. Interestingly, the resulting pressure spikes are sometimes
   capable of inducing a new or secondary column separation event near the
   front of the advancing water column front, an event associated with the
   sudden jump in velocity carried by the propagating rejoinder shock wave.
   A physical interpretation of the captured events is provided and model
   results are shown to compare favourably to a previously published set of
   experimental data involving column separation and rejoinder.}},

Abstract = {{It is observed that charged unilamellar vesicles in a suspension can
   spontaneously deflate and subsequently transition to form bilamellar
   vesicles, even in the absence of externally applied triggers such as
   salt or temperature gradients. We provide strong evidence that the
   driving force for this deflation-induced transition is the repulsive
   electrostatic pressure between charged vesicles in concentrated
   suspensions, above a critical effective volume fraction. We use volume
   fraction measurements and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy
   imaging to quantitatively follow both the macroscopic and
   microstructural time-evolution of cationic diC18:1 DEEDMAC vesicle
   suspensions at different surfactant and salt concentrations. A simple
   model is developed to estimate the extent of deflation of unilamellar
   vesicles caused by electrostatic interactions with neighboring vesicles.
   It is determined that when the effective volume fraction of the
   suspension exceeds a critical value, charged vesicles in a suspension
   can experience ``crowding{''} due to overlap of their electrical double
   layers, which can result in deflation and subsequent microstructural
   transformations to reduce the effective volume fraction of the
   suspension. Ordinarily in polydisperse colloidal suspensions, particles
   interacting via a repulsive potential transform into a glassy state
   above a critical volume fraction. The behavior of charged vesicle
   suspensions reported in this paper thus represents a new mechanism for
   the relaxation of repulsive interactions in crowded situations.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we investigate the stress transfer characteristics of a
   novel hybrid hierarchical nanocomposite in which the regularly staggered
   short fuzzy fibers are interlaced in the polymer matrix. The advanced
   fiber augmented with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on its circumferential
   surface is known as ``fuzzy fiber.{''} A three-phase shear lag model is
   developed to analyze the stress transfer characteristics of the short
   fuzzy fiber reinforced composite (SFFRC) incorporating the staggering
   effect of the adjacent representative volume elements (RVEs). The effect
   of the variation of the axial and lateral spacing between the adjacent
   staggered RVEs in the polymer matrix on the load transfer
   characteristics of the SFFRC is investigated. The present shear lag
   model also accounts for the application of the radial loads on the RVE
   and the radial as well as the axial deformations of the different
   orthotropic constituent phases of the SFFRC. Our study reveals that the
   existence of the non-negligible shear tractions along the length of the
   RVE of the SFFRC plays a significant role in the stress transfer
   characteristics and cannot be neglected. Reductions in the maximum
   values of the axial stress in the carbon fiber and the interfacial shear
   stress along its length become more pronounced in the presence of the
   externally applied radial loads on the RVE. The results from the newly
   developed analytical shear lag model are validated with the finite
   element (FE) shear lag simulations and found to be in good agreement.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous total variation (TV) regularizers, engaged in image restoration
   problem, encode the gradients by means of simple {[}-1, 1]
   finite-impulse-response (FIR) filter. Despite its low computational
   processing, this filter severely distorts signal's high-frequency
   components pertinent to edge/discontinuous information and cause several
   deficiency issues known as texture and geometric loss. This paper
   addresses this problem by proposing an alternative model to the TV
   regularization problem via high-order accuracy differential FIR filters
   to preserve rapid transitions in signal recovery. A numerical encoding
   scheme is designed to extend the TV model into multidimensional
   representation (tensorial decomposition). We adopt this design to
   regulate the spatial and temporal redundancy in compressed video sensing
   problem to jointly recover frames from undersampled measurements. We
   then seek the solution via alternating direction methods of multipliers
   and find a unique solution to quadratic minimization step with
   capability of handling different boundary conditions. The resulting
   algorithm uses much lower sampling rate and highly outperforms
   alternative state-of-the-art methods. This is evaluated both in terms of
   restoration accuracy and visual quality of the recovered frames.}},

Abstract = {{In the past few decades, great attention has been focused on uncovering
   the physics of seismic wave attenuation in fluid-saturated rocks.
   However, the relationship among many variables affecting attenuation is
   still not completely clear. For instance, although the role of strain in
   enhancing friction dissipation is relatively well known for dry rocks,
   it remains unclear how and how much it affects attenuation in
   fluid-saturated rocks. We experimentally measured attenuation in the
   extensional mode in Berea sandstone at strains between 7.8 x 10(-7) and
   1.9 x 10(-5), and at frequencies in the seismic bandwidth (1-100 Hz).
   These strains were similar to those typically observed in seismic
   exploration (similar to 10(-6)). We also measured the transient fluid
   pressure caused when a stepwise stress was applied resulting in such
   strains. For the studied strain range, our results indicated that: (1)
   the overall attenuation in dry Berea sandstone increased linearly with
   strain, (2) the frequency-dependent component of attenuation, which was
   associated with fluid saturation, was approximately insensitive to
   strain, and (3) the overall attenuation can be considered as a sum of a
   frequency-independent and a frequency-dependent components.}},

Title = {{Outcome of the upper limb in cervical spinal cord injury: Profiles of
   recovery and insights for clinical studies}},

Abstract = {{Background: Improved appreciation of recovery profiles of sensory and
   motor function as well as complex motor functions (prehension) after
   cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) will be essential to inform clinical
   studies to consider primary and secondary outcome measures for
   interventions and the optimization of dosing and timing of therapies in
   acute and chronic SCI.
   Objectives: (1) To define the sensory, motor, and prehension recovery
   profiles of the upper limb and hand in acute cervical SCI and (2) to
   confirm the impact of AIS severity and conversion on upper limb
   sensorimotor recovery.
   Methods: An observational longitudinal cohort study consisting of serial
   testing of 53 patients with acute cervical SCI was conducted.
   International Standards of Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord
   Injury, Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength Sensibility and
   Prehension (GRASSP), Capabilities of Upper Extremity (CUE-Q)
   Questionnaire, and Spinal Cord Independence Measure III (SCIM-III) were
   administered at 0-10 days, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.
   Analysis: Change over time was plotted using mean and standard deviation
   of the total and subgroups of the sample.
   Results: Individuals with traumatic tetraplegia show distinct patterns
   of recovery. Factors that distinguish homogeneous subgroups of the
   sample are: severity of injury (level of injury, completeness) at
   baseline and conversion from a complete to an incomplete injury.
   Conclusions: In cervical SCI, clinical recovery can be assessed using
   standardized measures that distinguish levels of activity and
   impairment. Specific recovery profiles of the upper limb over the 1-year
   timecourse provide new insights and opportunity for combined analysis of
   recovery profiles for different clinical assessment tools of upper limb
   function which are meaningful to inform the design of study protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Multi-channel surface functional electrical stimulation
   (FES) for walking has been used to improve voluntary walking and balance
   in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI).
   Objective: To investigate short-and long-term benefits of 16 weeks of
   thrice-weekly FES-assisted walking program, while ambulating on a body
   weight support treadmill and harness system, versus a non-FES exercise
   program, on improvements in gait and balance in individuals with chronic
   incomplete traumatic SCI, in a randomized controlled trial design.
   Methods: Individuals with traumatic and chronic (>= 18 months) motor
   incomplete SCI (level C2 to T12, American Spinal Cord Injury Association
   Impairment Scale C or D) were recruited from an outpatient SCI
   rehabilitation hospital, and randomized to FES-assisted walking therapy
   (intervention group) or aerobic and resistance training program (control
   group). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, and after 4, 6, and 12
   months. Gait, balance, spasticity, and functional measures were
   collected.
   Results: Spinal cord independence measure (SCIM) mobility sub-score
   improved over time in the intervention group compared with the control
   group (baseline/12 months: 17.27/21.33 vs. 19.09/17.36, respectively).
   On all other outcome measures the intervention and control groups had
   similar improvements. Irrespective of group allocation walking speed,
   endurance, and balance during ambulation all improved upon completion of
   therapy, and majority of participants retained these gains at long-term
   follow-ups.
   Conclusions: Task-oriented training improves walking ability in
   individuals with incomplete SCI, even in the chronic stage. Further
   randomized controlled trials, involving a large number of participants
   are needed, to verify if FES-assisted treadmill training is superior to
   aerobic and strength training.}},

Title = {{Effect of whole-body vibration on lower-limb EMG activity in subjects

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SPINAL CORD MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{525-536}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) results in substantial
   reductions in lower extremity muscle mass and bone mineral density below
   the level of the lesion. Whole-body vibration (WBV) has been proposed as
   a means of counteracting or treating musculoskeletal degradation after
   chronic motor complete SCI. To ascertain how WBV might be used to
   augment muscle and bone mass, we investigated whether WBV could evoke
   lower extremity electromyography (EMG) activity in able-bodied
   individuals and individuals with SCI, and which vibration parameters
   produced the largest magnitude of effect.
   Methods: Ten male subjects participated in the study, six able-bodied
   and four with chronic SCI. Two different manufacturers' vibration
   platforms (WAVE (R) and Juvent (TM)) were evaluated. The effects of
   vibration amplitude (0.2, 0.6 or 1.2 mm), vibration frequency (25, 35,
   or 45 Hz), and subject posture (knee angle of 140 degrees, 160 degrees,
   or 180 degrees) on lower extremity EMG activation were determined (not
   all combinations of parameters were possible on both platforms). A novel
   signal processing technique was proposed to estimate the power of the
   EMG waveform while minimizing interference and artifacts from the plate
   vibration.
   Results: WBV can elicit EMG activity among subjects with chronic SCI, if
   appropriate vibration parameters are employed. The amplitude of
   vibration had the greatest influence on EMG activation, while the
   frequency of vibration had lesser but statistically significant impact
   on the measured lower extremity EMG activity.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that WBV with appropriate parameters
   may constitute a promising intervention to treat musculoskeletal
   degradation after chronic SCI.}},

Title = {{Failure of spinal paired associative stimulation to induce
   neuroplasticity in the human corticospinal tract}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SPINAL CORD MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{565-574}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Context/Objective: Paired associative stimulation (PAS) involves
   paired-stimulation pulses at both the head (via transcranial magnetic
   stimulation) and the periphery (via peripheral nerve stimulation). The
   purpose of PAS, when applied to the spinal cord, is to induce
   neuroplasticity and upregulate the corticospinal tract leading to
   effector muscles. While limited research has suggested that it is
   possible to produce neuroplasticity through spinal PAS, all such studies
   have provided stimulation at a fixed frequency of 0.1 or 0.2 Hz.
   Design/Interventions: The present study therefore sought to compare the
   effectiveness of a typical 0.1 Hz paradigm with a 1 Hz paradigm, and a
   paradigm which provided stimulation in 5 Hz ``bursts{''}. Two
   inter-stimulus intervals were tested: one which was expected to produce
   synchronous pre- and post-synaptic activation at the spinal synapse, and
   one which was not. The peripheral stimulation was applied at the wrist,
   to induce thumb adduction.
   Results: None of the paradigms were able to successfully induce
   neuroplasticity in a consistent manner.
   Conclusion: The high between-subject variability in this study suggests
   that responses to the spinal PAS treatment may have been highly
   individual. This serves to highlight a potential limitation of the
   spinal PAS treatment, which is that its effectiveness may not be
   universal, but rather dependent on each specific recipient. This may be
   a challenge faced by spinal PAS should it continue to be tested as a
   potential novel therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the effects of intermittent passive standing
   (PS) and whole body vibration (WBV) on the electromyography (EMG)
   activity, cross-sectional area, and density of lower extremity muscles
   in individuals with chronic motor complete spinal cord injury (SCI).
   Design: Case series.
   Methods: Seven adult men with chronic (>= 2 years), thoracic motor
   complete (AIS A-B) SCI completed a 40-week course of thrice-weekly
   intermittent PS-WBV therapy, in a flexed knee posture (160 degrees), for
   45 minutes per session at a frequency of 45 Hz and 0.6-0.7 mm
   displacement using the WAVE (R) Pro Plate, with an integrated EasyStand
   (TM) standing frame. EMG was measured in major lower extremity muscles
   to represent muscle activity during PS-WBV. The cross-sectional area and
   density of the calf muscles were measured using peripheral quantitative
   computed tomography at the widest calf cross-section (66\% of the tibia
   length) at pre- and post-intervention. All measured variables were
   compared between the pre- and post-intervention measurements to assess
   change after the PS-WBV intervention.
   Results: PS-WBV acutely induced EMG activity in lower extremity muscles
   of SCI subjects. No significant changes in lower extremity EMG activity,
   muscle cross-sectional area, or density were observed following the
   40-week intervention.
   Conclusions: Although acute exposure to PS-WBV can induce
   electrophysiological activity of lower extremity muscles during PS in
   men with motor complete SCI, the PS-WBV intervention for 40 weeks was
   not sufficient to result in enhanced muscle activity, or to increase
   calf muscle cross-sectional area or density.}},

Abstract = {{Energy modeling is a useful tool for evaluating the performance of
   contemplated building energy retrofit measures. Traditionally, energy
   models are developed using data collected from building floor plans and
   site visits and are then calibrated using utility bills. In the work
   presented here, an energy model for an existing multi-unit residential
   building (MURB) was developed using this traditional approach. Next, a
   refined approach was taken. Using data gathered from a suite-based
   monitoring program, input data uncertainties in the energy model were
   addressed. Data from one year of monitoring were assembled to
   characterize the actual building performance and to calibrate this
   refined energy model. In order to identify which parameters could be
   used to improve the model accuracy, the output of this refined model was
   compared to the output from the traditional modeling approach. It was
   found that the interior temperature measurements and the sub-metered
   suite electricity use were the most beneficial in refining the energy
   model. However, other data collected including window operation and
   differential air pressures were useful for determining how the building
   was operating. The use of a local weather file generated from a roof-top
   weather station has also been discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Very early cancer detection is the key to improving cure. Our objective
   was to investigate manganese (Mn)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) for very early detection and characterization of breast cancers.
   Eighteen NOD scid gamma mice were inoculated with MCF7, MDA, and LM2
   breast cancer cells and imaged periodically on a 3 T scanner beginning
   on day 6. T-1-weighted imaging and T-1 measurements were performed
   before and 24 hours after administering MnCl2. At the last imaging
   session, Gd-DTPA was administered and tumors were excised for histology
   (hematoxylin-eosin and CD34 staining). All mice, except for two
   inoculated with MCF7 cells, developed tumors. Tumors enhanced uniformly
   on Mn and showed clear borders. Early small tumors (<= 5 mm(3))
   demonstrated the greatest enhancement with a relative R-1 (1/T-1) change
   of 1.57 +/- 0.13. R-1 increases correlated with tumor size (r = -.34, p
   = .04). Differences in R-1 increases among the three tumor subtypes were
   most evident in early tumors. Histology confirmed uniform cancer cell
   distribution within tumor masses and vasculature in the periphery, which
   was consistent with rim-like enhancement on Gd-DTPA. Mn-enhanced MRI is
   a promising approach for detecting very small breast cancers in vivo and
   may be valuable for very early cancer detection.}},

Abstract = {{Transportation system capacity and performance, urban form and
   socio-demographics define the influences and constraints conditioning
   the preferences of urban residents for different transport modes.
   Changes in characteristics of urban areas are likely to lead to changes
   in preferences for alternative modes of transport over time; as a
   consequence, statistical models to forecast mode choice need to be
   sensitive to both purposeful changes to urban systems as well as
   exogenous shocks. We make use of the 1996, 2001 and 2006 household
   surveys conducted in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area to study mode
   preference evolution and model forecasting performance. These repeated
   cross-sectional household surveys provide an opportunity to investigate
   aggregate structural changes in commuting mode preferences over time, in
   a manner sensitive to changes in the urban area. We focus on commuting
   mode choices because these trips are prime determinants of peak period
   congestion and peak spreading. We then address how to combine the three
   cross-sections econometrically in a robust way that allows for use of a
   single mode choice model across the entire period. Using independent
   data from 2012, we are able to compare the individual year and combined
   models in terms of forecasting performance to demonstrate the combined
   model's more robust forecasting performance into the future. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The goal of this study is to develop and apply a new method for
   assessing social equity impacts of distance-based public transit fares.
   Shifting to a distance-based fare structure can disproportionately favor
   or penalize different subgroups of a population based on variations in
   settlement patterns, travel needs, and most importantly, transit use.
   According to federal law, such disparities must be evaluated by the
   transit agency, but the area-based techniques identified by the Federal
   Transit Authority for assessing discrimination fail to account for
   disparities in distances travelled by transit users. This means that
   transit agencies currently lack guidelines for assessing the social
   equity impacts of replacing flat fare with distance-based fare
   structures. Our solution is to incorporate a joint ordinal/continuous
   model of trip generation and distance travelled into a GIS Decision
   Support System. The system enables a transit planner to visualize and
   compare distance travelled and transit-cost maps for different
   population profiles and fare structures. We apply the method to a case
   study in the Wasatch Front, Utah, where the Utah Transit Authority is
   exploring a switch to a distance-based fare structure. The analysis
   reveals that overall distance-based fares benefit low-income, elderly,
   and non-white populations. However, the effect is geographically uneven,
   and may be negative for members of these groups living on the urban
   fringe. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open

Abstract = {{This article presents a magnet-induced buckled-beam piezoelectric
   generator developed for broadband vibration-based energy harvesting at
   low frequencies (<60 Hz) and small excitations (<0.5g). The harvester is
   made of a clamped-clamped piezoelectric beam, with one end movable and
   subjected to a magnet-induced compressive force. Due to the magnetic
   force, the beam becomes buckled and bistable. The harvester works as a
   double-well potential oscillator under excitations, where
   large-amplitude inter-well oscillation is produced to enhance the energy
   harvesting functionality. Numerical simulations show that the proposed
   harvester exhibits strong nonlinearities under harmonic excitations,
   including snap-through motions, large-amplitude voltage outputs, and
   broad frequency bandwidth. A prototype harvester is fabricated and
   experimentally investigated to confirm the findings from numerical
   simulations. It is observed that for a small base excitation of 0.35g,
   the harvester can produce a broad frequency bandwidth of 25.0 Hz
   (24.0-49.0 Hz) to constantly trigger inter-well snap-through motions and
   to maintain a peak-to-peak voltage of <10 V over a 1.3 M Omega load
   resistor. For a relatively larger base excitation of 0.5g, such a
   frequency bandwidth can be further widened to 29.5 Hz.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Human dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) manifests as a profound reduction in
   biventricular cardiac function that typically progresses to death or
   cardiac transplantation. There is no effective mechanism-based therapy
   currently available for DCM, in part because the transduction of
   mechanical load into dynamic changes in cardiac contractility (termed
   mechanotransduction) remains an incompletely understood process during
   both normal cardiac function and in disease states. Here we show that
   the mechanoreceptor protein integrin-linked kinase (ILK) mediates
   cardiomyocyte force transduction through regulation of the key calcium
   regulatory protein sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)ATPase
   isoform 2a (SERCA-2a) and phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) in the
   human heart. A non-oncogenic ILK mutation with a synthetic point
   mutation in the pleckstrin homology-like domain (ILKR211A) is shown to
   enhance global cardiac function through SERCA-2a/PLN. Thus, ILK serves
   to link mechanoreception to the dynamic modulation of cardiac
   contractility through a previously undiscovered interaction with the
   functional SERCA-2a/PLN module that can be exploited to rescue impaired
   mechanotransduction in DCM.}},

Abstract = {{We study broadcasting of two confidential messages to two groups of
   receivers over independent parallel subchannels. One group consists of
   an arbitrary number of receivers, interested in a common message,
   whereas the other group has only one receiver. Each message must be
   confidential from the receiver(s) in the other group. Each of the
   subchannels is assumed to be degraded in a certain fashion. While corner
   points of the capacity region of this setup were characterized in
   earlier works, we establish the complete capacity region, and show the
   optimality of a superposition coding technique. For Gaussian channels,
   we establish the optimality of a Gaussian input distribution by applying
   an extremal information inequality. By extending our coding scheme to
   block-fading channels, we demonstrate significant performance gains over
   a baseline time-sharing scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Routing algorithms for cache-coherent NoCs only have limited VCs at
   their disposal, which poses challenges to the design of routing
   algorithms. Existing fully adaptive routing algorithms apply
   conservative VC re-allocation: only empty VCs can be re-allocated, which
   limits performance. We propose two novel flow control designs. First,
   whole packet forwarding (WPF) re-allocates a nonempty VC if the VC has
   enough free buffers for an entire packet. WPF does not induce deadlock
   if the routing algorithm is deadlock-free using conservative VC
   re-allocation. It is an important extension to several deadlock
   avoidance theories. Second, we extend Duato's theory to apply aggressive
   VC re-allocation on escape VCs without deadlock. Finally, we propose a
   design which maintains maximal routing flexibility with low hardware
   cost. For synthetic traffic, our design performs averagely 88.9 percent
   better than existing fully adaptive routing. Our design is superior to
   partially adaptive and deterministic routing.}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Datacenters have played an increasingly essential role as the underlying
   infrastructure in cloud computing. As implied by the essence of cloud
   computing, resources in these datacenters are shared by multiple
   competing entities, which can be either tenants that rent virtual
   machines (VMs) in a public cloud such as Amazon EC2, or applications
   that embrace data parallel frameworks like MapReduce in a private cloud
   maintained by Google. It has been generally observed that with
   traditional transport-layer protocols allocating link bandwidth in
   datacenters, network traffic from competing applications interferes with
   each other, resulting in a severe lack of predictability and fairness of
   application performance. Such a critical issue has drawn a substantial
   amount of recent research attention on bandwidth allocation in
   datacenter networks, with a number of new mechanisms proposed to
   efficiently and fairly share a datacenter network among competing
   entities. In this article, we present an extensive survey of existing
   bandwidth allocation mechanisms in the literature, covering the
   scenarios of both public and private clouds. We thoroughly investigate
   their underlying design principles, evaluate the trade-off involved in
   their design choices and summarize them in a unified design space, with
   the hope of conveying some meaningful insights for better designs in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an algorithm for assessment of job security with

   frontier analysis methods based on Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy
   Inference System (ANFIS) for measuring human performance with respect to
   job security and HSEE factors. The proposed approach is applied to a set
   of operators in a large petrochemical plant to show its applicability

   questionnaires with respect to job security and HSEE are completed by
   operators. The average results for each category of HSEE are used as
   inputs and job security is used as output variable. Moreover, this
   algorithm ranks operators with respect to job security and HSEE.
   Finally, this algorithm identifies inefficient operators. Superiority
   and advantages of this study versus other studies is also shown. This is
   the first study that introduces an intelligence algorithm for assessment

Abstract = {{A computational model was developed to simulate drug distribution in the
   posterior segment of the eye after intravitreal injection and ocular
   implantation. The effects of important factors in intravitreal injection
   such as injection time, needle gauge and needle angle on the ocular drug
   distribution were studied. Also, the influences of the position and the
   type of implant on the concentration profile in the posterior segment
   were investigated. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) calculations were
   conducted to describe the 3D convective-diffusive transport. The
   geometrical model was constructed based on the human eye dimensions. To
   simulate intravitreal injection, unlike previous studies which
   considered the initial shape of the injected drug solution as a sphere
   or cylinder, the more accurate shape was obtained by level-set method in
   COMSOL. The results showed that in intravitreal injection the drug
   concentration profile and its maximum value depended on the injection
   time, needle gauge and penetration angle of the needle. Considering the
   actual shape of the injected solution was found necessary to obtain the
   real concentration profile. In implant insertion, the vitreous cavity
   received more drugs after intraocular implantation, but this method was
   more invasive compared to the periocular delivery. Locating the implant
   in posterior or anterior regions had a significant effect on local drug
   concentrations. Also, the shape of implant influenced on concentration
   profile inside the eye. The presented model is useful for optimizing the
   administration variables to ensure optimum therapeutic benefits.
   Predicting and quantifying different factors help to reduce the
   possibility of tissue toxicity and to improve the treatment efficiency.

Abstract = {{We introduce a new 3-D flexible microelectrode array for high
   performance electrographic neural signal recording and stimulation. The
   microelectrode architecture maximizes the number of channels on each
   shank and minimizes its footprint. The electrode was implemented on
   flexible polyimide substrate using microfabrication and thin-film
   processing. The electrode has a planar layout and comprises multiple
   shanks. Each shank is three mm in length and carries six gold pads
   representing the neuro-interfacing channels. The channels are used in
   recording important precursors with potential clinical relevance and
   consequent electrical stimulation to perturb the clinical condition. The
   polyimide structure satisfied the mechanical characteristics required
   for the proper electrode implantation and operation. Pad postprocessing
   technique was developed to improve the electrode electrical performance.
   The planar electrodes were used for creating 3-D ``Waterloo Array{''}
   microelectrode with controlled gaps using custom designed stackers.
   Electrode characterization and benchmarking against commercial
   equivalents demonstrated the superiority of the Flex electrodes. The
   Flex and commercial electrodes were associated with low-power
   implantable responsive neuro-stimulation system. The electrodes
   performance in recording and stimulation application was quantified
   through in vitro and in vivo acute and chronic experiments on human
   brain slices and freely-moving rodents. The Flex electrodes exhibited
   remarkable drop in the electric impedance (100 times at 100 Hz),
   improved electrode-electrolyte interface noise (dropped by four times)
   and higher signal-to-noise ratio (3.3 times).}},

Abstract = {{Based on the Gauss-Markov channel model, we investigate the stochastic
   feedback control for transmit beamforming in
   multiple-input-single-output systems and design practical implementation
   algorithms leveraging techniques in dynamic programming and
   reinforcement learning. We first validate the Markov decision process
   formulation of the underlying feedback control problem with a
   4R-variable (4R-V) state, where R is the number of the transmit
   antennas. Due to the high complexity of finding an optimal feedback
   policy under the 4R-V state, we consider a reduced 2-V state. As opposed
   to a previous study that assumes the feedback problem under such a 2-V
   state remaining an MDP formulation, our analysis indicates that the
   underlying problem is no longer an MDP. Nonetheless, the approximation
   as an MDP is shown to be justifiable and efficient. Based on the
   quantized 2-V state and the MDP approximation, we propose practical
   implementation algorithms for feedback control with unknown state
   transition probabilities. In particular, we provide model-based offline
   and online learning algorithms, as well as a model-free learning
   algorithm. We investigate and compare these algorithms through extensive
   simulations and provide their efficiency analysis. According to these
   results, the application rule of these algorithms is established under
   both statistically stable and unstable channels.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the multicast completion and decoding delay
   minimization problems for instantly decodable network coding (IDNC) in
   the case of lossy feedback. When feedback loss events occur, the sender
   falls into uncertainties about packet reception at the different
   receivers, which forces it to perform partially blind selections of
   packet combinations in subsequent transmissions. To determine efficient
   selection policies that reduce the completion and decoding delays of
   IDNC in such an environment, we first extend the perfect feedback
   formulation in our previous works to the lossy feedback environment, by
   incorporating the uncertainties resulting from unheard feedback events
   in these formulations. For the completion delay problem, we use this
   formulation to identify the maximum likelihood state of the network in
   events of unheard feedback and employ it to design a partially blind
   graph update extension to the multicast IDNC algorithm in our earlier
   work. For the decoding delay problem, we derive an expression for the
   expected decoding delay increment for any arbitrary transmission. This
   expression is then used to find the optimal policy that reduces the
   decoding delay in such lossy feedback environment. Results show that our
   proposed solutions both outperform previously proposed approaches and
   achieve tolerable degradation even at relatively high feedback loss
   rates.}},

   in a Cold Climate over Low Permeability Soil}},

Abstract = {{The hydrologic performance of three partial-infiltration permeable
   pavement (PP) systems was evaluated at the Kortright Centre for
   Conservation in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada over 22 months.
   Partial-infiltration systems allow some stormwater to infiltrate into
   native soils and drain excess water by way of underdrains. The native
   soils at Kortright are composed of clayey silt and silty clay till, with
   clay content ranging from 7 to 30\%. Flow restrictors on the underdrains
   were adjusted to the smallest orifice possible to assess the potential
   for stormwater outflow volume reductions. The hydraulic behavior of the
   PP systems was compared with runoff from an asphalt parking lot control.
   Peak outflow rates from PP were 91\% smaller than peak flowrates of
   asphalt runoff on average, and attenuation of stormwater was observed
   during all seasons. Stormwater was found to infiltrate at the surface of
   the PP systems throughout two winters. Although increases in outflow
   were observed during periods of seasonal thawing due to the delayed
   release of infiltrating stormwater, the PP systems (with restricted
   flows from the underdrains) reduced overall stormwater outflow volume by
   43\% and completely captured (i.e., infiltrated and evaporated) most
   rainfall events that were less than 7 mm in depth. The study
   demonstrated that in cold climates and over low permeability soils,
   partial-infiltration permeable pavements reduce the volume, peak flow,
   and frequency of storm flows. These changes to the hydrology of
   stormwater are important for achieving water quality benefits as well as
   sustaining a more natural water balance and flow regime. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The problem of elastic wave propagation in an infinite bar of arbitrary
   cross section is studied via a generalized version of the Fourier
   expansion collocation method. In the current formulation, the exact
   three dimensional solution to Navier's equation in cylindrical
   coordinates is used to obtain the boundary traction vector as a
   periodic, piecewise continuous/differentiable function of the angular
   coordinate. Traction free conditions are then met by setting the Fourier
   coefficients of the boundary traction vector to zero without
   approximating the bounding surface by multi-sided polygons as in the
   method presented by Nagaya. The method is derived for a general cross
   section with no axial planes of symmetry. Using the general formulation
   it is shown that the symmetric and asymmetric modes decouple for cross
   sections having one axial plane of symmetry. An efficient algorithm for
   computing dispersion curves based on the current method is presented and
   used to obtain the fundamental longitudinal and flexural wave speeds for
   a bar of elliptical cross section. The results are compared to those
   obtained by previous researchers using exact and approximate treatments.

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to determine an appropriate glass transition

   mortar and concrete. The glass transition temperature of the polymer,
   which was synthesized as a redispersible acrylic acid ester polymer, and

   showed a lower glass transition temperature as the ratio of unsaturated
   hydrophobic ethylene monomer was increased. A decrease in glass
   transition temperature decreased the tensile strength, compressive
   strength, flexural strength, and volume change; increased the
   elongation, liquidity of polymer cement mortar, and adhesion; and
   delayed condensation. Scanning electron microscope and energy-dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy results confirmed that a polymer film formed inside
   the cement matrix made mostly of carbon around pores and cracks inside
   the cement paste. A glass transition temperature of 0 to -11 degrees C

Abstract = {{This paper builds a meta-model of vehicle ownership choice parameters to
   predict how their values might vary across extended periods as a
   function of macroeconomic variables. Multinomial logit models of vehicle
   ownership are estimated from repeated cross-sectional data between 1971
   and 1996 for large urban centers in Ontario. Three specifications are
   tested: a varying constants (VC) model where the alternative specific
   constants are allowed to vary each year; a varying scales (VS) model
   where the scale parameter varies instead; and a varying scales and
   constants model. The estimated parameters are then regressed on
   macroeconomic variables (e.g., employment rate, gas prices, etc.). The
   regressions yield good fit and statistically significant results,
   suggesting that changes in the macroeconomic environment influence
   household decision making over time, and that macroeconomic information
   could potentially help predict how model parameters evolve. This implies
   that the common assumption of holding parameters constant across
   forecast horizons could potentially be relaxed. Furthermore, using a
   separate validation dataset, the predictive power of the VC and VS
   models outperform conventional approaches providing further evidence
   that pooling data from multiple periods could also produce more robust
   models.}},

Abstract = {{Xylan-debranching enzymes facilitate the complete hydrolysis of xylan
   and can be used to alter xylan chemistry. Here, the family GH62
   alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase from Streptomyces thermoviolaceus
   (SthAbf62A) was shown to have a half-life of 60 min at 60 degrees C and
   the ability to cleave alpha-1,3 L-arabinofuranose (L-Araf) from singly
   substituted xylopyranosyl (Xylp) backbone residues in wheat
   arabinoxylan; low levels of activity on arabinan as well as
   4-nitrophenyl alpha-L-arabinofuranoside were also detected. After
   selective removal of alpha-1,3 L-Araf substituents from disubstituted
   Xylp residues present in wheat arabinoxylan, SthAbf62A could also cleave
   the remaining alpha-1,2 L-Araf substituents, confirming the ability of
   SthAbf62A to remove alpha-L-Araf residues that are (1 -> 2) and (1 -> 3)
   linked to monosubstituted beta-D-Xylp sugars. Three-dimensional
   structures of SthAbf62A and its complex with xylotetraose and
   L-arabinose confirmed a five-bladed beta-propeller fold and revealed a
   molecular Velcro in blade V between the beta 1 and beta 21 strands, a
   disulfide bond between Cys27 and Cys297, and a calcium ion coordinated
   in the central channel of the fold. The enzyme-arabinose complex
   structure further revealed a narrow and seemingly rigid L-arabinose
   binding pocket situated at the center of one side of the beta propeller,
   which stabilized the arabinofuranosyl substituent through several
   hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions. The predicted catalytic
   amino acids were oriented toward this binding pocket, and the catalytic
   essentiality of Asp53 and Glu213 was confirmed by site-specific
   mutagenesis. Complex structures with xylotetraose revealed a shallow
   cleft for xylan backbone binding that is open at both ends and comprises
   multiple binding subsites above and flanking the L-arabinose binding
   pocket.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of a porcine model of early aortic valve sclerosis}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Background: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is associated with
   significant cardiovascular morbidity. While late-stage CAVD is
   well-described, early pathobiological processes are poorly understood
   due to the lack of animal models that faithfully replicate early human
   disease. Here we evaluated a hypercholesterolemic porcine model of early
   diet-induced aortic valve sclerosis.
   Methods: Yorkshire swine were fed either a standard or
   high-fat/high-cholesterol diet for 2 or 5 months. Right coronary aortic
   valve leaflets were excised and analyzed (immuno) histochemically.
   Results: Early human-like proteoglycan-rich onlays formed between the
   endothelial layer and elastic lamina in the fibrosa layer of valve
   leaflets, with accelerated formation associated with
   hypercholesterolemia (P<.05). Lipid deposition was more abundant in
   hypercholesterolemic swine (P<.001), but was present in a minority
   (28\%) of onlays. No myofibroblasts, MAC387-positive macrophages, or
   fascin-positive dendritic cells were detected in 2-month onlays, with
   only scarce myofibroblasts present at 5 months. Cells that expressed
   osteochondral markers Sox9 and Msx2 were preferentially found in dense
   proteoglycan-rich onlays (P<.05) and with hypercholesterolemia (P<.05).
   Features of more advanced human CAVD, including calcification, were not
   observed in this necessarily short study.
   Conclusions: Early aortic valve sclerosis in hypercholesterolemic swine
   is characterized by the formation of proteoglycan-rich onlays in the
   fibrosa, which can occur prior to significant lipid accumulation,
   inflammatory cell infiltration, or myofibroblast activation. These
   characteristics mimic those of early human aortic valve disease, and
   thus the porcine model has utility for the study of early valve
   sclerosis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The widespread use of intensity modulated radiation therapy
   (IMRT) for cervical cancer has been limited by internal target and
   normal tissue motion. Such motion increases the risk of underdosing the
   target, especially as planning margins are reduced in an effort to
   reduce toxicity. This study explored 2 adaptive strategies to mitigate
   this risk and proposes a new, automated method that minimizes replanning
   workload.
   Methods and Materials: Thirty patients with cervical cancer participated
   in a prospective clinical study and underwent pretreatment and weekly
   magnetic resonance (MR) scans over a 5-week course of daily external
   beam radiation therapy. Target volumes and organs at risk (OARs) were
   contoured on each of the scans. Deformable image registration was used
   to model the accumulated dose (the real dose delivered to the target and
   OARs) for 2 adaptive replanning scenarios that assumed a very small PTV
   margin of only 3 mm to account for setup and internal interfractional
   motion: (1) a preprogrammed, anatomy-driven midtreatment replan
   (A-IMRT); and (2) a dosimetry-triggered replan driven by target dose
   accumulation over time (D-IMRT).
   Results: Across all 30 patients, clinically relevant target dose
   thresholds failed for 8 patients (27\%) if 3-mm margins were used
   without replanning. A-IMRT failed in only 3 patients and also yielded an
   additional small reduction in OAR doses at the cost of 30 replans.
   D-IMRT assured adequate target coverage in all patients, with only 23
   replans in 16 patients.
   Conclusions: A novel, dosimetry-triggered adaptive IMRT strategy for
   patients with cervical cancer can minimize the risk of target
   underdosing in the setting of very small margins and substantial
   interfractional motion while minimizing programmatic workload and cost.

Abstract = {{A particle-based distinct element method and its grain-based method are

   rupture zone creation and the rupture mechanism are found to be normal
   stress dependent (progressing from tensile splitting to shear rupture)
   and show partial confirmation of rupture zone creation in nature and in
   experiments from other materials. The normal stress dependent change is
   found to be due to the orientation of the major principal stress and
   local stress concentrations internal to the synthetic specimens being
   deformed. The normal stress dependent rupture creation process results
   in a change to the rupture zone's geometry, shear stress versus

Abstract = {{The influence of mineral grain and grain boundary strength is
   investigated using a calibrated intact (non-jointed) brittle rock
   specimen subjected to direct shear with a particle-based distinct
   element method and its embedded grain-based method. The adopted
   numerical approach allows one to independently control the grain
   boundary and mineral grain strength. The investigation reveals that, in
   direct shear, the normal stress (sigma (n)) applied to a rock specimen
   relative to its uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) determines the
   resulting rupture mechanism, the ultimate rupture zone geometry, and
   thus its shear stress versus horizontal displacement response. This
   allows one to develop a rupture matrix based on this controlling
   parameter (i.e., sigma (n)/UCS). Mineral grain strength reductions
   result in the lowering of the apparent cohesion intercept of the peak
   linear Coulomb strength envelope, while grain boundary strength
   reductions change the peak linear Coulomb strength envelope to a
   bi-linear or curved shape. The impact of grain boundary strength is only
   relevant at sigma (n)/UCS ratios < 0.17 where tensile and dilatant
   rupture mechanisms dominate. Once shear rupture begins to be the
   dominant rupture mechanism in a brittle rock (i.e., at sigma (n)/UCS
   ratios > 0.17), the influence of weakened grain boundaries is minimized
   and strength is controlled by that of the mineral grains.}},

Abstract = {{Seven intermediate-scale slabs were constructed and tested to failure
   under sequential drop-weight impacts. The slabs contained longitudinal
   reinforcing bars, and were constructed with steel fiber contents ranging
   from zero (that is, conventional reinforced concrete) to 1.50\% by
   volume. The data from the testing program were used to further assess
   the performance of steel fiber-reinforced concretes in impact-resistant
   applications and to provide a well-documented dataset pertaining to a
   research area which is currently limited within the literature. The test
   results showed that the addition of the steel fibers was effective in
   increasing slab capacity, reducing crack widths and spacings, and
   mitigating local damage under impact. Although the slabs in the program
   were designed to be flexure-critical under static loading conditions,
   the development of inertial forces under impact loading conditions led
   to observed responses and failure modes that were governed by shear}},

Abstract = {{While the benefits of fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) have been widely
   investigated, much of the literature focuses on steel FRC subjected to
   monotonic loads. Data on the structural behavior of macro-synthetic
   polypropylene FRC or FRC under cyclic loads are scarce.
   A pilot investigation on the shear behavior of polypropylene FRC and on
   the behavior of FRC under reversed cyclic in-plane shear loading was
   undertaken: Five in-plane shear panel tests were performed. The
   parameters under study were the fiber material type (steel or
   polypropylene) and loading protocol. Additionally, a number of
   compression, direct tension, and flexural tests were performed to
   determine the material properties of the concretes for comparison.
   Results show that the material response of 2.0\% by volume of
   polypropylene FRC is nominally similar to that of 1.0\% steel FRC.}},

Abstract = {{Rice straw was pretreated with sodium hydroxide and subsequently
   conditioned to reduce the pH to 5-6 by either: (1) extensive water
   washing or (2) acidification with hydrochloric acid then water washing.
   Alkali pretreatment improved the enzymatic digestibility of rice straw
   by increasing the cellulose accessibility to cellulases. However,
   acidification after pretreatment reversed the gains in cellulose
   accessibility to cellulases and enzymatic digestibility due to
   precipitation of solubilized compounds. Surface composition analyses by
   ToF-SIMS confirmed a reduction in surface lignin by pretreatment and
   water washing, and suggested that acidification precipitated a
   chemically modified form of lignin on the surfaces of rice straw. The
   spin-spin relaxation times (T-2) of the samples indicated increased
   porosity in alkali pretreated rice straw. The acidified pretreated rice
   straw had reduced amounts of water in the longer T-2 proton pools
   associated with water in the pores of the biomass likely due to
   back-filling by the precipitated components. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel bi-directional piezoelectric energy harvester
   which can harvest vibration energy bi-directionally is introduced and
   investigated theoretically and experimentally. The proposed harvester is
   composed of two sub-systems: a main beam to generate electricity and a
   spring-mass oscillator to trigger the vibration of the main beam from an
   additional direction by using magnets to couple the two sub-systems. The
   theoretical model is built on the basis of the Euler-Bernoulli beam
   theory and the magnetic charge model. A prototype is fabricated to test
   the performance of the harvester experimentally. Linear upward and
   downward frequency sweeps are used to obtain the frequency responses.
   The experimental results show good agreement with the theoretical model
   under frequency sweeps. A comparison with a beam-beam bi-directional
   piezoelectric energy harvester is also performed experimentally.
   Although both bi-directional piezoelectric energy harvesters exhibit the
   capability of harvesting vibration energy in two orthogonal directions,
   the beam-spring energy harvester shows a more consistent performance in
   both directions as regards the bandwidth and amplitude of the frequency
   responses.}},

Title = {{Impacts of pre-treatment technologies and co-products on greenhouse gas
   emissions and energy use of lignocellulosic ethanol production}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{104-111}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Life cycle environmental performance of lignocellulosic ethanol produced
   through different production pathways and having different co-products
   has rarely been reported in the literature, with most studies focusing
   on a single pre-treatment and single co-product (electricity). The aim
   of this paper is to understand the life cycle energy use and greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions implications of alternative pretreatment
   technologies (dilute acid hydrolysis, ammonia fiber expansion and
   autohydrolysis) and co-products (electricity, pellet, protein and
   xylitol) through developing a consistent life cycle framework for
   ethanol production from corn stover. Results show that the choices of
   pre-treatment technology and co-product(s) can impact ethanol yield,
   life cycle energy use and GHG emissions. Dilute acid pathways generally
   exhibit higher ethanol yields (20-25\%) and lower net total energy use
   (15-25\%) than the autohydrolysis and ammonia fiber expansion pathways.
   Similar GHG emissions are found for the pretreatment technologies when
   producing the same co-product. Xylitol co-production diverts xylose from
   ethanol production and results in the lowest ethanol yield (200 L per
   dry t of stover). Compared to producing only electricity as a
   co-product, the co-production of pellets and xylitol decreases life
   cycle GHG emissions associated with the ethanol, while protein
   production increases emissions. The life cycle GHG emissions of blended
   ethanol fuel (85\% denatured ethanol by volume) range from -38.5-37.2 g
   CO(2)eq/MJ of fuel produced, reducing emissions by 61-141\% relative to
   gasoline. All ethanol pathways result in major reductions of fossil
   energy use relative to gasoline, at least by 47\%. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The green rigid polyurethane (PU) foam has been developed with 100 \%
   soy polyol after optimization of formulation ingredients and lignin has
   been introduced and isocyanate content reduced in the green rigid PU
   foam. The cellulosic nanofibers have also been successfully incorporated
   and dispersed in green rigid PU foam to improve the rigidity. The
   influence of nano cellulose fiber modification (enzymatic treatment,
   hydrophobic modification with latex) on the foam density, open cell
   content, foam raise height, water vapor, and mechanical properties of
   rigid PU foam were studied. The foamed structures were examined using
   scanning electron microscopy to determine the cell size and shape due to
   the addition of cellulosic nanofibers. The odor test were performed to
   evaluate the odor concentration 100 \% soyol based PU foam including
   lignin and nanofiber and compared to 100 \% synthetic based polyol PU
   foam. The experimental results indicated that the compression and impact
   properties improved due to the modification of nano cellulosic fibers.
   The odor concentration level of nanofiber reinforced rigid PU foam
   reduced significantly compared to 100 \% PU foam due to the replacing of
   isocyanate content. It can be said that with an appropriate combination
   of replacing isocyanate by lignin and addition of nanofiber, rigid PU
   foam properties could be improved.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical study is performed to examine the effect of introducing a
   swirling desolvation gas flow on the flow transport characteristics in
   an electrospray and an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI)
   system. An ion source having three coaxial tubes is considered: (1) an
   inner capillary tube to inject the liquid sample, (2) a center coaxial
   tube to provide a room temperature gas flow to nebulize the liquid,
   referred to as the nebulizing gas flow, and (3) an outer coaxial tube
   having a converging exit to supply a high temperature gas for droplet
   desolvation, referred to as the desolvation gas flow. The results show
   that a swirling desolvation gas flow reduces the dispersion of the
   nebulizing gas and suppresses turbulent diffusion. The effect of
   swirling desolvation flow on the trajectory of a range of droplet sizes
   emitted from a source is also considered.}},

Title = {{Can Fluoroscopy-based Computer Navigation Improve Entry Point Selection

Abstract = {{The entry point is crucial to an accurate reduction in femoral nailing.
   Fluoroscopy-based navigation was developed to aid in reducing femur
   fractures and selecting entry points.
   We asked: (1) Can the piriformis fossa (PF) and tip of the greater
   trochanter (TT) be identified with high reproducibility? (2) What is the
   range of nonneutral images clinically acceptable for entry point
   selection? (3) Does navigation improve accuracy and precision of
   landmarking the TT and PF? And (4) does off-angle fluoroscopy within the
   acceptable range affect landmark accuracy?
   Three orthopaedic surgeons digitized the PF and TT under direct
   visualization on 10 cadaveric femurs, quantifying the reproducibility of
   the targeted PF and TT landmarks. Arcs of acceptable AP and lateral
   images of each femur were acquired in increments of 5A degrees with a
   C-arm. An experienced orthopaedic surgeon rejected or accepted images
   for entry point selection by qualitatively assessing the relative
   positions and sizes of the greater trochanter, lesser trochanter, and
   femoral neck. Entry points were identified on each image using
   fluoroscopy and navigation. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to
   compare accuracy and precision between navigation and fluoroscopy and
   the effects of image angle.
   A 29A degrees average arc of acceptable images was found.
   Reproducibility of the target landmarks for the PF and TT under direct
   visualization was excellent. Navigation had similar accuracy to
   fluoroscopy for PF localization but less for TT. Navigation increased
   precision compared to fluoroscopy for both PF and TT. Image angle
   affected accuracy of the PF and TT under fluoroscopy and navigation.
   Nonorthogonal images reduce accuracy of PF and TT identification with
   both navigation and fluoroscopy. Navigation increased precision but
   decreased accuracy and cannot overcome inaccuracies induced by
   nonorthogonal images.}},

Title = {{Multi-Objective Wind Farm Layout Optimization Considering Energy
   Generation and Noise Propagation With NSGA-II}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Recently, the environmental impact of wind farms has been receiving
   increasing attention. As land is more extensively exploited for onshore
   wind farms, they are more likely to be in proximity with human
   dwellings, increasing the likelihood of a negative health impact. Noise
   generation and propagation remain an important concern for wind farm's
   stakeholders, as compliance with mandatory noise limits is an integral
   part of the permitting process. In contrast to previous work that
   included noise only as a design constraint, this work presents
   continuous-location models for layout optimization that take noise and
   energy as objective functions, in order to fully characterize the design
   and performance spaces of the wind farm layout optimization (WFLOP)
   problem. Based on Jensen's wake model and ISO-9613-2 noise calculations,
   single- and multi-objective genetic algorithms (GAs) are used to solve
   the optimization problem. Results from this bi-objective optimization
   model illustrate the trade-off between energy generation and noise
   production by identifying several key parts of Pareto frontiers. In
   particular, it was observed that different regions of a Pareto front
   correspond to markedly different turbine layouts. The implications of
   noise regulation policy-in terms of the actual noise limit-on the design
   of wind farms are discussed, particularly in relation to the entire
   spectrum of design options.D}},

Abstract = {{Adhesion molecule signaling is critical to human pluripotent stem cell
   (hPSC) survival, self-renewal, and differentiation. Thus, hPSCs are
   grown as clumps of cells on feeder cell layers or poorly defined
   extracellular matrices such as Matrigel. We sought to define a small
   molecule that would initiate adhesion-based signaling to serve as a
   basis for a defined substrate for hPSC culture. Soluble angiopoeitin-1
   (Ang-1)-derived peptide QHREDGS added to defined serum-free media
   increased hPSC colony cell number and size during long- and short-term
   culture when grown on feeder cell layers or Matrigel, i.e. on standard
   substrates, without affecting hPSC morphology, growth rate or the
   ability to differentiate into multiple lineages both in vitro and in
   vivo. Importantly, QHREDGS treatment decreased hPSC apoptosis during
   routine passaging and single-cell dissociation. Mechanistically, the
   interaction of QHREDGS with beta(1)-integrins increased expression of
   integrin-linked kinase (ILK), increased expression and activation of
   extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), and decreased
   caspase-3/7 activity. QHREDGS immobilization to polyethylene glycol
   hydrogels significantly increased cell adhesion in a dose-dependent
   manner. We propose QHREDGS as a small molecule inhibitor of hPSC
   apoptosis and the basis of an affordable defined substrate for hPSC
   maintenance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Abrasive enhanced electrochemical slurry-jet machining (ESJM) is
   presented as a new approach to the micro-machining of metals using a
   combination of abrasive slurry-jet machining (ASJM) and electrochemical
   jet machining (ECJM). A novel ESJM prototype was developed to generate a
   charged slurry jet consisting of a mixture of Al2O3 abrasive particles
   and an electrolytic solution of NaCI and NaNO3. A DC potential of 30V
   was applied between the nozzle and specimen. A series of micro-channels
   were machined in Stellite 12 using ASJM, ECJM and ESJM processes to
   investigate the relative effects of erosion and anodic dissolution on
   the material removal rate and surface finish in the combined process of
   ESJM. The results illustrated that the ESJM process results in
   significantly greater target mass loss rate than the separate erosion
   and corrosion processes. The magnitude of the synergistic effect on the
   rate of mass loss was found to vary from positive to negative as the
   erosion component increased with increasing particle kinetic energy (jet
   pressure) and particle concentration. The roughness of the channels
   machined using ESJM was between that obtained with ASJM and ECJM. The
   roughness decreased as the erosion component of the total mass loss
   increased. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Abrasive slurry jet micro-machining of holes in brittle and ductile

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{214}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1909-1920}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigated the effects of elasticity and viscosity, induced
   by a dilute high-molecular-weight polymer solution, on the shape, depth,
   and diameter of micro-holes drilled in borosilicate glass and in plates
   of 6061-T6 aluminum alloy, 110 copper, and 316 stainless steel using
   low-pressure abrasive slurry jet micro-machining (ASJM). Holes were
   machined using aqueous jets with 1 wt\% 10 mu m Al2O3 particles. The 180
   mu m sapphire orifice produced a 140 mu m diameter jet at pressures of 4
   and 7 MPa. When the jet contained 50 wppm of dissolved 8 million
   molecular weight polyethylene oxide (PEO), the blind holes in glass were
   approximately 20\% narrower and 30\% shallower than holes drilled
   without the polymer, using the same abrasive concentration and pressure.
   The addition of PEO led to hole cross-sectional profiles that had a
   sharper edge at the glass surface and were more V-shaped compared with
   the U-shape of the holes produced without PEO. Hole symmetry in glass
   was maintained over depths ranging from about 80-900 mu m by ensuring
   that the jets were aligned perpendicularly to within 0.2 degrees. The
   changes in shape and size were brought about by normal stresses
   generated by the polymer. Jets containing this dissolved polymer were
   observed to oscillate laterally and non-periodically, with an amplitude
   reaching a value of 20 mu m. For the first time, symmetric ASJM
   through-holes were drilled in a 3-mm-thick borosilicate glass plate
   without chipping around the exit edge.
   The depth of symmetric blind holes in metals was restricted to
   approximately 150 mu m for jets with and without PEO. At greater depths,
   the holes became highly asymmetric, eroding in a specific direction to
   create a sub-surface slot. The asymmetry appeared to be caused by the
   extreme sensitivity of ductile materials to jet alignment. This
   sensitivity also caused the holes in metals to be less circular when PEO
   was included, apparently caused by the random jet oscillations induced
   by the polymer. Under identical conditions, hole depths increased in the
   order: borosilicate glass > 6061-T6 aluminum > 110 copper > 316
   stainless steel. The edges of the holes in glass could be made sharper
   by machining through a sacrificial layer of glass or epoxy. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The majority of laryngectomees use the electrolarynx as their primary
   mode of verbal communication after total laryngectomy surgery. However,
   the archetypal electrolarynx suffers from a monotonous tone and the
   inconvenience of requiring manual control. This paper presents the
   potential of pattern recognition to support electrolarynx use by
   predicting fundamental frequency (F0) and voicing state (VS) from
   surface EMG of the infrahyoid and suprahyoid muscles, as well as from a
   respiratory trace. In this study, surface EMG signals from the
   infrahyoid and suprahyoid muscle groups and respiratory trace were
   collected from 10 able-bodied, adult males (18- 60 years old).
   Participants performed three kinds of vocal tasks tones, legatos and
   phrases. Signal features were extracted from the EMG and respiratory
   trace, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with radial basis
   function kernels was employed to predict F0 and voicing state. An
   average root mean squared error of 2.81 +/- 0.6 semitones was achieved
   for the estimation of vocal frequency in the range of 90-360 Hz. An
   average cross-validation (CV) accuracy of 78.05 +/- 6.3\% was achieved
   for the prediction of voicing state from EMG and 65.24 +/- 7.8\% from
   the respiratory trace. The proposed method has the advantage of being
   non-invasive compared with studies that relied on intramuscular
   electrodes (invasive), while still maintaining an accuracy above chance.
   Pattern classification of neck-muscle surface EMG has merit in the
   prediction of fundamental frequency and voicing state during
   vocalization, encouraging further study of automatic pitch modulation
   for electrolarynges and silent speech interfaces. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Increase in the ionic strength of water that is mediated by the reaction
   of carbon dioxide (CO2) with nitrogenous bases is a promising approach
   toward phase separation in mixtures of water with organic solvents and
   potentially water purification. Conventional macroscale studies of this
   complicated process are challenging, due to its occurrence via several
   consecutive and concurrent steps, mass transfer limitation, and lack of
   control over gas-liquid interfaces. We report a new microfluidic
   strategy for fundamental studies of liquid-liquid phase separation
   mediated by CO2 as well as screening of the efficiency of nitrogenous
   agents. A single set of microfluidic experiments provided qualitative
   and quantitative information on the kinetics and completeness of
   water-tetrahydrofuran phase separation, the minimum amount of CO2
   required to complete phase separation, the total CO2 uptake, and the
   rate of CO2 consumption by the liquid mixture. The efficiency of
   tertiary diamines with different lengths of alkyl chain was examined in
   a time- and labor-efficient manner and characterized with the proposed
   efficiency parameter. A wealth of information obtained using the MF
   methodology can facilitate the development of new additives for
   switchable solvents in green chemistry applications.}},

Abstract = {{The relative positioning of gene loci within a mammalian nucleus is
   non-random and plays a role in gene regulation. Some sub-nuclear
   structures may represent ``hubs{''} that bring specific genetic loci
   into close proximity where co-regulatory mechanisms can operate. The
   identification of loci in proximity to a shared sub-nuclear structure
   can provide insights into the function of the associated structure, and
   reveal relationships between the loci sharing a common association. A
   technique is introduced based on the nano-dissection of DNA from thin
   sections of cells by high-precision nano-tools operated inside a
   scanning electron microscope. The ability to dissect and identify gene
   loci occupying a shared site at a single sub-nuclear structure is
   demonstrated here for the first time. The technique is applied to the
   nano-dissection of DNA in vicinity of a single promyelocytic leukemia
   nuclear body (PML NB), and reveals novel loci from several chromosomes
   that are confirmed to associate at PML NBs with statistical significance
   in a cell population. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that pairs of loci
   from different chromosomes congregate at the same nuclear body. It is
   proposed that this technique is the first that allows the de novo
   determination of gene loci associations with single nuclear
   sub-structures.}},

Abstract = {{Lecithin-linker microemulsions are formulations produced with soybean
   lecithin in combination with a highly lipophilic (lipophilic linker) and
   highly hydrophilic (hydrophilic linkers) surfactant-like additives. In
   this work, lecithin-linker systems were formulated to produce
   self-emulsifying delivery systems for beta-carotene and beta-sitosterol.
   The concentration of the lipophilic linker, sorbitan monooleate, was
   adjusted to minimize the formation of liquid crystals. The concentration
   of hydrophilic linkers, decaglyceryl caprylate/caprate and
   PEG-6-caprylic/capric glycerides, was gradually increased (scanned)
   until single phase clear microemulsions were obtained. For these scans,
   the oil (ethyl caprate) to water ratio was set to 1. The single phase,
   clear microemulsions were diluted with fed-state simulated intestinal
   fluid (FeSSIF) and produced stable emulsions, with drop sizes close to
   200 nm. Using pseudo-ternary phase diagrams to evaluate the process of
   dilution of microemulsion preconcentrates (mixtures of oil, lecithin and
   linkers with little or no water) with FeSSIF, it was determined that
   self-emulsifying systems are obtained when the early stages of the
   dilution produce single phase microemulsions. If liquid crystals or
   multiple phase systems are obtained during those early stages, then the
   emulsification yields unstable emulsions with large drop sizes. An in
   vitro permeability study conducted using a Flow-Thru Dialyzer revealed
   that stable emulsions with drop sizes of 150-300 nm produce large and
   irreversible permeation of b-carotene to sheep intestine. On the other
   hand, unstable emulsions produced without the linker combination
   separated in the dialyzer chamber. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Abstract = {{In typical quantum dot solids used for photovoltaic applications, the
   dominant source of carrier loss is through trap states. Identifying
   pathways for exciton relaxation from these states is important to the
   optimization of energy conversion devices. A generalized variational
   inverse method for the reconstruction of multipath exciton lifetime
   spectra in PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQD) used for solar cells was
   developed which allows for resolving concurrent multipath relaxation
   lifetime mechanisms in the form of Voigt distributions. The variational
   inverse method was applied to high signal-to-noise ratio photocarrier
   radiometric phase frequency responses from coupled CQD assemblies with
   0.5-1.0 nm interdot spacings. Two concurrent deexcitation mechanisms
   with radiative and nonradiative channels were found in the range of 300
   K >= T >= 100 K: Exciton-phonon interaction involving the lowest 1S-1S
   excitonic state splitting and a thermalization broadening model based on
   the exciton trapping probability dominated the temperature range of >=
   200 K Exciton hopping in the form of tunneling from a smaller quantum
   dot in a higher-energy state to a lower-energy state of nearby larger
   quantum dots dominated temperatures <200 K}},

Abstract = {{The reduction and carburization behavior of NiO-WO3 mixtures by CO was

   techniques (TGA-DTA) with the aim of preparing homogenous Ni-WC

   the reaction products using XRD and SEM, the following reaction path is
   suggested. Reduction of NiO with CO begins at 550 degrees C, followed by
   reduction of WO3 to first WO2 by CO, and then to W by carbon. The
   generation of W was accompanied by its carburization through C and CO.
   The reactions were near completion at 850 degrees C, producing clusters
   of Ni-WC in the few micrometer range. Increasing the Ni content of the
   mixture resulted in greater carbon deposition, also appeared to widen
   the temperature range for the reactions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Low-cost paper-based assays are emerging as the platform for diagnostics
   worldwide. Paper does not, however, readily enable advanced
   functionality required for complex diagnostics, such as analyte
   concentration and controlled analyte transport. That is, after the
   initial wetting, no further analyte manipulation is possible. Here, we
   demonstrate active concentration and transport of analytes in fully wet
   paper-based assays by leveraging nanoporous material (mean pore diameter
   approximate to 4 nm) and ion concentration polarization. Two classes of
   devices are developed, an external stamp-like device with the nanoporous
   material separate from the paper-based assay, and an in-paper device
   patterned with the nanoporous material. Experimental results demonstrate
   up to 40-fold concentration of a fluorescent tracer in fully wet paper,
   and directional transport of the tracer over centimeters with
   efficiencies up to 96\%. In-paper devices are applied to concentrate
   protein and colored dye, extending their limits of detection from
   similar to 10 to similar to 2 pmol/mL and from similar to 40 to similar
   to 10 mu M, respectively. This approach is demonstrated in
   nitrocellulose membrane as well as paper, and the added cost of the
   nanoporous material is very low at similar to 0.015 USD per device. The
   result is a major advance in analyte concentration and manipulation for
   the growing field of low-cost paper-based assays.}},

Abstract = {{Many important biomarkers for disease diagnosis are present at low
   concentrations in human serum. These biomarkers are masked in proteomic
   analysis by highly abundant proteins such as human serum albumin (HSA)
   and immunoglobulins (IgGs) which account for up to 80\% of the total
   protein content of serum. Traditional depletion methods using
   macro-scale LC-columns for highly abundant proteins involve slow
   separations which impart considerable dilution to the samples.
   Furthermore, most techniques lack the ability to process multiple
   samples simultaneously. We present a method of protein depletion using
   superparamagnetic beads coated in anti-HSA, Protein A, and Protein G,
   manipulated by digital microfluidics (DMF). The depletion process was
   capable of up to 95\% protein depletion efficiency for IgG and HSA in 10
   min for four samples simultaneously, which resulted in an approximately
   4-fold increase in signal-to-noise ratio in MALDI-MS analysis for a low
   abundance protein, hemopexin. This rapid and automated method has the
   potential to greatly improve the process of biomarker identification.}},

Abstract = {{Alumina-aluminum MMC coatings were deposited by cold gas dynamic
   spraying onto aluminum alloy (Al 7570) substrates. The microstructure,
   phase composition, thermal conductivity, microhardness, and thermal
   optical properties (solar absorptance alpha(s) and thermal emittance
   epsilon) of four types of coating were determined on as-sprayed samples
   and samples subjected to atomic oxygen (AO) plasma, intended to simulate
   conditions in outer space environment. In addition, time-of-flight (ToF)
   secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) was applied to determine the
   responses of the coatings to oxidation by AO plasma. The results
   indicate that the very low thermal conductivity (lambda), low solar
   absorptance (alpha(s)), comparatively high infrared emittance (epsilon)
   and oxidation stability of the investigated coatings may provide
   adequate protection as environmental control coatings of space-bound
   materials against deleterious effects of space environment within the
   Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and beyond. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) show potential as the
   next-generation solid-state lighting technology. A major barrier to
   widespread adoption at this point is the efficiency droop that occurs
   for OLEDs at practical brightness (similar to 5000 cd/m(2)) levels
   necessary for general lighting. We highlight recent progress in highly
   efficient OLEDs at high brightness, where improvements are made by
   managing excitons in these devices through rational device design.
   General design principles for both white and monochrome OLEDs are
   discussed based on recent device architectures that have been
   successfully implemented. We expect that an improved understanding of
   exciton dynamics in OLEDs in combination with innovative device design
   will drive future development. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under

Abstract = {{Pilot-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were used to assess the
   effects of sludge retention time, temperature, and influent phosphorus
   level on floc physicochemical characteristics, effluent quality, and UV
   disinfection kinetics. Increasing the operating temperature from 12 to
   22 degrees C caused an increase in the activated sludge flocs fractal
   dimension from 0.1 to 0.2, and improved the UV disinfection of final
   effluent. Influent phosphorus limitation, i.e., COD:N:P of 100:10:0.3,
   caused the formation of more spherical flocs with higher resistance to
   UV disinfection (by 1 log). However, influent phosphorus starvation,
   i.e., COD:N:P of 100:10:0.03, decreased the average floc size and
   sphericity, increased the final effluent turbidity, and lowered effluent
   UV dose demand. The findings provide useful information in terms of
   modifying wastewater treatment processes in the context of water reuse
   and improving UV disinfection efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of nanoclay (Cloisite 30B) on the foamability of polylactide
   (PLA) were investigated in continuous extrusion foaming using
   supercritical CO2 as the blowing agent. PLA samples containing 0-5 wt\%
   of nanoclay were prepared. The X-ray diffraction and transmission
   electron microscopy images showed a high degree of exfoliation of clay
   nanoparticles within PLA. A single-screw tandem extruder was used to
   produce foams with 5 wt\% and 9 wt\% supercritical CO2. The
   crystallization behavior of the samples was analyzed using regular and
   high-pressure differential scanning calorimeters and using a rotational
   rheometer under small amplitude oscillatory shearing. In the presence of
   dissolved CO2, clay, and shear action, the PLA crystallization kinetics
   was significantly enhanced. The foamed results showed that both the cell
   density and the expansion ratio were greatly promoted with increased
   clay content and the dissolved CO2, as well as by the possibly nucleated
   crystals. By further use of Cloisite 20A nanoclay particles with poor
   disperse-ability in PLA, we also proved that a high degree of dispersion
   significantly promoted the cell density and the expansion ratio of the
   PLA nanocomposites. Further, by varying the temperature profile within
   second extruder of the tandem-line, it was confirmed that the more rapid
   crystallization along the second extruder was responsible for the
   enhanced cell density and expansion ratio. The final crystallinity of
   the foamed samples was also enhanced at higher expansion ratios due to
   the strain induced crystallization. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{16, SI}},
Pages = {{4199-4205}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{We compare the foaming ability of metallocene catalysed polyethylene
   (mPE) with that of mPE containing fibrillated polypropylene (PP) domains
   (mPE/fibrillated-PP) and mPE containing spherical PP domains
   (mPE/spherical-PP). We observe that mPE/fibrillated-PP shows the best
   foam morphology with the highest number of bubbles per unit volume. We
   explain this enhancement in foaming ability through rheological and
   crystallization studies. We identify that the fibrils form a percolated
   network at a fibril content of 4.5 wt\% using the Winter-Chambon
   analysis. The network of entangled fibrils results in strain hardening
   in uniaxial extension. Shear thickening responses are observed in shear
   flow. Such responses are not observed for mPE or mPE/spherical-PP.
   Oscillatory shear flow investigation of the isothermal melt
   crystallization reveals a two decade decrease in the time for the onset
   of crystallization in the mPE/fibrillated-PP and a decade decrease in
   mPE/spherical-PP relative to neat mPE. We attribute the enhancement in
   foaming ability of mPE/fibrillated-PP to the concurrent increase in
   strain-induced hardening response and improved crystallization kinetics.

Abstract = {{We present a simple method, called fluorescence-based assessment of
   plasma-induced hydrophilicity (FAPH), that enables spatial mapping of
   the local hydrophilicity of surfaces normally inaccessible by
   traditional contact angle measurement techniques. The method leverages
   the change in fluorescence of a dye, Nile Red, which is adsorbed on an
   oxygen plasma-treated surface, and its correlation with the contact
   angle of water. Using FAPH, we explored the effect of rnicrochannel
   geometries on the penetration distance of oxygen plasma into a
   microchannel and found that entrance effects prevent uniform treatment.
   We showed that these variations have a significant impact on cell
   culture, and thus the design of cell-based microfluidic assays must
   consider this phenomenon to obtain repeatable and homogeneous results.}},

Title = {{Cyclosporin A enhances neural precursor cell survival in mice through a

Journal = {{DISEASE MODELS \& MECHANISMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{953-961}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Cyclosporin A (CsA) has direct effects on neural stem and progenitor
   cells (together termed neural precursor cells; NPCs) in the adult
   central nervous system. Administration of CsA in vitro or in vivo
   promotes the survival of NPCs and expands the pools of NPCs in mice.
   Moreover, CsA administration is effective in promoting NPC activation,
   tissue repair and functional recovery in a mouse model of cortical
   stroke. The mechanism(s) by which CsA mediates this cell survival effect
   remains unknown. Herein, we examined both calcineurin-dependent and
   calcineurin-independent pathways through which CsA might mediate NPC
   survival. To examine calcineurin-dependent pathways, we utilized FK506
   (Tacrolimus), an immunosuppressive molecule that inhibits calcineurin,
   as well as drugs that inhibit cyclophilin A-mediated activation of
   calcineurin. To evaluate the calcineurin-independent pathway, we
   utilized NIM811, a non-immunosuppressive CsA analog that functions
   independently of calcineurin by blocking mitochondrial permeability
   transition pore formation. We found that only NIM811 can entirely
   account for the pro-survival effects of CsA on NPCs. Indeed, blocking
   signaling pathways downstream of calcineurin activation using nNOS mice
   did not inhibit CsA-mediated cell survival, which supports the proposal
   that the effects are calcinuerin-independent. In vivo studies revealed
   that NIM811 administration mimics the pro-survival effects of CsA on
   NPCs and promotes functional recovery in a model of cortical stroke,
   identical to the effects seen with CsA administration. We conclude that
   CsA mediates its effect on NPC survival through calcineurin-independent
   inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore formation and
   suggest that this pathway has potential therapeutic benefits for
   developing NPC-mediated cell replacement strategies.}},

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{As FPGA capacity increases, a growing challenge is connecting ever-more
   components with the current low-level FPGA interconnect while keeping
   designers productive and on-chip communication efficient. We propose
   augmenting FPGAs with networks-on-chip (NoCs) to simplify design, and we
   show that this can be done while maintaining or even improving silicon
   efficiency. We compare the area and speed efficiency of each NoC
   component when implemented hard versus soft to explore the space and
   inform our design choices. We then build on this component-level
   analysis to architect hard NoCs and integrate them into the FPGA fabric;
   these NoCs are on average 20-23x smaller and 5-6x faster than soft NoCs.
   A 64-node hard NoC uses only similar to 2\% of an FPGA's silicon area
   and metallization. We introduce a new-communication efficiency metric:
   silicon area required per realized communication bandwidth. Soft NoCs
   consume 4960 mm(2)/TBps, but hard NoCs are 84x more efficient at 59
   mm(2)/TBps. Informed design can further reduce the area overhead of NoCs
   to 23 mm(2)/TBps, which is only 2.6x less efficient than the simplest
   point-to-point soft links (9 mm(2)/TBps). Despite this almost comparable
   efficiency, NoCs can switch data across the entire FPGA while
   point-to-point links are very limited in capability; therefore, hard
   NoCs are expected to improve FPGA efficiency for more complex styles of
   communication.}},

Title = {{Benefits of Adding Hardware Support for Broadcast and Reduce Operations
   in MPSoC Applications}},

Abstract = {{MPI has been used as a parallel programming model for supercomputers and
   clusters and recently in Multi-Processor Systems-on-Chip (MPSaC). One
   component of MPI is collective communication and its performance is key
   for certain parallel applications to achieve good speedups. Previous
   work showed that, with synthetic communication-only benchmarks,
   communication improvements of up to 11.4-fold and 22-fold for broadcast
   and reduce operations, respectively, can be achieved by providing
   hardware support at the network level in a Network-on-Chip (NoC).
   However, these numbers do not provide a good estimation of the advantage
   for actual applications, as there are other factors that affect
   performance besides communications, such as computation. To this end, we
   extend our previous work by evaluating the impact of hardware support
   over a set of five parallel application kernels of varying
   computation-to-communication ratios. By introducing some useful
   computation to the performance evaluation, we obtain more representative
   results of the benefits of adding hardware support for broadcast and
   reduce operations. The experiments show that applications with lower
   computation-to-communication ratios benefit the most from hardware
   support as they highly depend on efficient collective communications to
   achieve better scalability. We also extend our work by doing more
   analysis on clock frequency, resource usage, power, and energy. The
   results show reasonable scalability for resource utilization and power
   in the network interfaces as the number of channels increases and that,
   even though more power is dissipated in the network interfaces due to
   the added hardware, the total energy used can still be less if the
   actual speedup is sufficient. The application kernels are executed in a
   24-embedded-processor system distributed across four FPGAs.}},

Abstract = {{A plasmon waveguide resonance (PWR) sensor is designed, fabricated, and
   tested for self-referenced biosensing. The PWR sensor is able to support
   two different polarizations, TM and TE. The TM polarization has a large
   sensitivity to variations in the background refractive index while the
   TE polarization is more sensitive to the surface properties. The ability
   of the PWR sensor to simultaneously operate in both TM and TE modes is
   used to decouple the background index variations (bulk effects) from the
   changes in adlayer thickness (surface effects) via multimode
   spectroscopy. To benchmark the performance of the PWR, a conventional
   surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor is fabricated and tested under
   the same conditions. (C)2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{A scaled-down experimental apparatus was built to examine smelt
   shattering during typical recovery boiler operations. Water-glycerine
   solutions and air were used in place of smelt and steam. A high-speed
   camera and image processing software were used to record and quantify
   liquid shattering in terms of droplet number and size distributions, as
   a function of air velocity, air nozzle position, liquid flow rate, and
   liquid viscosity. The results showed that increasing shatter jet
   velocity reduced average droplet size, increasing the liquid flow rate
   increased droplet size, and placing the shatter jet nozzle closer to the
   liquid stream decreased droplet size. These results were all as
   expected. The effect of liquid viscosity (1-50 cP) depended on the
   shatter jet velocity. At high air velocities, even the viscous liquid
   was well shattered, but at lower velocities, the effect of viscosity on
   shattering was significant.}},

Abstract = {{In kraft recovery boiler operation, fly ash or dust generated from black
   liquor combustion is mixed with the virgin black liquor in a mix tank
   and returned to the boiler with the as-fired black liquor. This internal
   recycled dust stream varies widely from boiler to boiler and from time
   to time and can have a great impact on the as-fired black liquor flow
   and properties and, ultimately, on the boiler thermal performance. A new
   method has been developed to quickly and accurately determine the amount
   of internal recycled dust in recovery boilers. The method is based on
   the difference between the total organic carbon content of the virgin
   black liquor and that of the as-fired black liquor. Tests using the
   method were performed on recovery boilers at three of Fibria's mills in
   Brazil. The results show that while the specific virgin black liquor
   solids produced at these mills were about the same, the internal
   recycled dust load varied widely, from as low as 4 wt\% of as-fired
   black liquor solids fired in the boiler at one mill to as high as 15
   wt\% at another mill. Instead of total organic carbon values, heating
   values may also be used, but the result is not as accurate.}},

Abstract = {{CONSPECTUS: Electrochemical sensors have the potential to achieve
   sensitive, specific, and low-cost detection of biomolecules-a capability
   that is ever more relevant to the diagnosis and monitored treatment of
   disease. The development of devices for clinical diagnostics based on
   electrochemical detection could provide a powerful solution for the
   routine use of biomarkers in patient treatment and monitoring and may
   overcome the many issues created by current methods, including the long
   sample-to-answer times, high cost, and limited prospects for lab-free
   use of traditional polymerase chain reaction, microarrays, and
   gene-sequencing technologies. In this Account, we summarize the advances
   in electrochemical biomolecular detection, focusing on a new and
   integrated platform that exploits the bottom-up fabrication of
   multiplexed electrochemical sensors composed of electrodeposited noble
   metals. We trace the evolution of these sensors from gold nanoelectrode
   ensembles to nanostructured microelectrodes (NMEs) and discuss the
   effects of surface morphology and size on assay performance. The
   development of a novel electrocatalytic assay based on Ru3+ adsorption
   and Fe3+ amplification at the electrode surface as a means to enable
   ultrasensitive analyte detection is discussed. Electrochemical
   measurements of changes in hybridization events at the electrode surface
   are performed using a simple potentiostat, which enables integration
   into a portable, cost-effective device. We summarize the strategies for
   proximal sample processing and detection in addition to those that
   enable high degrees of sensor multiplexing capable of measuring 100
   different analytes on a single chip. By evaluating the cost and
   performance of various sensor substrates, we explore the development of
   practical lab-on-a-chip prototype devices. By functionalizing the NMEs
   with capture probes specific to nucleic acid, small molecule, and
   protein targets, we can successfully detect a wide variety of analytes
   at clinically relevant concentrations and speeds. Using this platform,
   we have achieved attomolar detection levels of nucleic acids with
   overall assay times as short as 2 min. We also describe the adaptation
   of the sensing platform to allow for the measurement of uncharged
   analytes a challenge for reporter systems that rely on the charge of an
   analyte. Furthermore, the capabilities of this system have been applied
   to address the many current and important clinical challenges involving
   the detection of pathogenic species, including both bacterial and viral
   infections and cancer biomarkers. This novel electrochemical platform,
   which achieves large molecular-to-electrical amplification by means of
   its unique redox-cycling readout strategy combined with rapid and
   efficient analyte capture that is aided by nanostructured
   microelectrodes, achieves excellent specificity and sensitivity in
   clinical samples in which analytes are present at low concentrations in
   complex matrices.}},

Abstract = {{Photoacoustic imaging provides high-resolution images at depths beyond
   the optical diffusion limit. To broaden its utility, there is need for
   molecular sensors capable of detecting environmental stimuli through
   alterations in photoacoustic signal. Photosynthetic organisms have
   evolved ingenious strategies to optimize light absorption through
   nanoscale ordered dye aggregation. Here, we use this concept to
   synthesize a stimuli-responsive nanoswitch with a large optical
   absorbance and sensing capabilities. Ordered dye aggregation between
   light harvesting porphyrins was achieved through intercalation within
   thermoresponsive nanovesicles. This causes an absorbance red shift of 74
   nm and a 2.7-fold increase in absorptivity of the Q(y)-band, with
   concomitant changes in its photoacoustic spectrum. This spectral feature
   can be reversibly switched by exceeding a temperature threshold. Using
   this thermochromic property, we noninvasively determined a localized
   temperature change in vivo, relevant for monitoring thermal therapies of
   solid tumors. Similar strategies may be applied alongside photoacoustic
   imaging, to detect other stimuli such as pH and enzymatic activity.}},

Title = {{A study of the efficacy of flashing lights to increase the salience of

Abstract = {{Background: Many interventions have been implemented to improve hand
   hygiene compliance, each with varying effects and monetary costs.
   Although some previous studies have addressed the issue of
   conspicuousness, we found only 1 study that considered improving hand
   hygiene by using flashing lights.
   Method: Our attention theory-based hypothesis tested whether a simple
   red light flashing at 2-3 Hz affixed to the alcohol gel dispensers,
   within the main hospital entrance, would increase hand hygiene
   compliance over the baseline rate. Baseline and intervention
   observations were completed over five 60-minute periods (Monday-Friday)
   from 7:30 to 8:30 AM using a covert observation method.
   Results: Baseline hand hygiene compliance was 12.4\%. Our intervention
   increased compliance to 23.5\% during cold weather and 27.1\% during
   warm weather. Overall, our pooled compliance rate increased to 25.3\% (P
   < .0001).
   Conclusions: A simple, inexpensive flashing red light affixed to alcohol
   gel dispensers was sufficiently salient to approximately double overall
   hand hygiene compliance within the main hospital entrance. We
   hypothesize that our intervention drew attention to the dispensers,
   which then reminded employees and visitors alike to wash their hands.
   Compliance was worse during cold days, presumably related to more
   individuals wearing gloves. Copyright (C) 2014 by the Association for

Abstract = {{The Pressure-Volume-Temperature (PVT) property of polymer nanocomposite
   (PNC)/gas solutions is an important fundamental property in the foaming
   of PNC. However, accurate data have not yet been reported. We examined
   the PVT behaviors of polypropylene (PP) and PP/organoclay polymer
   nanocomposite (PP-PNC) by monitoring the swelling changes of the polymer
   melt in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)). A model was adopted that
   describes the PVT behaviors of PP-PNC with and without dissolved gas.
   Based on the model, a PNC consists of two sections: a hard section (a
   nanoparticle surrounded by solidified polymer) and a soft section (neat
   polymer). It was observed that an infusion of nanoparticles decreased
   the swelling. It seems that the hard section had a minimal free volume
   in which to dissolve the blowing agents, and that the number of hard
   sections increased with the infusion of nanoparticles. As a result, the
   total gas absorption capacity of the system decreased, and consequently,
   the swelling also decreased.}},

Abstract = {{Speckle statistics of flowing scatterers have been well documented in
   the literature. Speckle variance optical coherence tomography exploits
   the large variance values of intensity changes in time caused mainly by
   the random backscattering of light resulting from translational activity
   of red blood cells to map out the microvascular networks. A method to
   map out the microvasculature malformation of skin based on the
   time-domain histograms of individual pixels is presented with results
   obtained from both normal skin and skin containing vascular
   malformation. Results demonstrated that this method can potentially map
   out deeper blood vessels and enhance the visualization of
   microvasculature in low signal regions, while being resistant against
   motion (e.g., patient tremor or internal reflex movements). The overall
   results are manifested as more uniform en face projection maps of
   microvessels. Potential applications include clinical imaging of skin
   vascular abnormalities and wide-field skin angiography for the study of
   complex vascular networks. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a

Abstract = {{In situ Yb-doped amorphous carbon thin films were grown on Si substrates
   at low temperatures (<200 degrees C) by a simple one-step RF-PEMOCVD
   system as a potential photonic material for direct integration with Si
   CMOS back end-of-line processing. Room temperature photoluminescence
   around 1 mu m was observed via direct incorporation of optically active
   Yb3+ ions from the selected Yb(fod)(3) metal-organic compound. The
   partially fluorinated Yb(fod)(3) compound assists the suppression of
   photoluminescence quenching by substitution of C-H with C-F bonds. A
   four-fold enhancement of Yb photoluminescence was demonstrated via
   deuteration of the a-C host. The substrate temperature greatly
   influences the relative deposition rate of the plasma dissociated
   metal-organic species, and hence the concentration of the various
   elements. Yb and F incorporation are promoted at lower substrate
   temperatures, and suppressed at higher substrate temperatures. O
   concentration is slightly elevated at higher substrate temperatures.
   Photoluminescence was limited by the concentration of Yb within the
   film, the concentration of Yb ions in the +3 state, and the relative
   amount of quenching due to the various de-excitation pathways associated
   with the vibrational modes of the host a-C network. The observed wide
   full-width-at-half-maximum photoluminescence signal is a result of the
   variety of local bonding environments due to the a-C matrix, and the
   bonding of the Yb3+ ions to O and/or F ions as observed in the X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy analyses.}},

Title = {{Task-based detectability in CT image reconstruction by filtered
   backprojection and penalized likelihood estimation}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{260-278}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Nonstationarity is an important aspect of imaging performance
   in CT and cone-beam CT (CBCT), especially for systems employing
   iterative reconstruction. This work presents a theoretical framework for
   both filtered-backprojection (FBP) and penalized-likelihood (PL)
   reconstruction that includes explicit descriptions of nonstationary
   noise, spatial resolution, and task-based detectability index. Potential
   utility of the model was demonstrated in the optimal selection of
   regularization parameters in PL reconstruction.
   Methods: Analytical models for local modulation transfer function (MTF)
   and noise-power spectrum (NPS) were investigated for both FBP and PL
   reconstruction, including explicit dependence on the object and spatial
   location. For FBP, a cascaded systems analysis framework was adapted to
   account for nonstationarity by separately calculating fiuence and system
   gains for each ray passing through any given voxel. For PL, the
   point-spread function and covariance were derived using the implicit
   function theorem and first-order Taylor expansion according to Fessler
   {[}{''}Mean and variance of implicitly defined biased estimators (such
   as penalized maximum likelihood): Applications to tomography,{''} IEEE
   Trans. Image Process. 5(3), 493-506 (1996)1. Detectability index was
   calculated for a variety of simple tasks. The model for PL was used in
   selecting the regularization strength parameter to optimize task-based
   performance, with both a constant and a spatially varying regularization
   map.
   Results: Theoretical models of FBP and PL were validated in 2D simulated
   fan-beam data and found to yield accurate predictions of local MTF and
   NPS as a function of the object and the spatial location. The NPS for
   both FBP and PL exhibit similar anisotropic nature depending on the
   pathlength (and therefore, the object and spatial location within the
   object) traversed by each ray, with the PL NPS experiencing greater
   smoothing along directions with higher noise. The MTF of FBP is
   isotropic and independent of location to a first order approximation,
   whereas the MTF of PL is anisotropic in a manner complementary to the
   NPS. Task-based detectability demonstrates dependence on the task,
   object, spatial location, and smoothing parameters. A spatially varying
   regularization ``map{''} designed from locally optimal regularization
   can improve overall detectability bey. ond that achievable with the
   commonly used constant regularization parameter.
   Conclusions: Analytical models for task-based HO and PL reconstruction
   are predictive of nonstationary noise and resolution characteristics,
   providing a valuable framework for understanding and optimizing system
   performance in CT and CBCT. (C) 2014 American Association of Physicists

Abstract = {{The systematic design of unit cells for a Huygens metasurface, a
   particular class of metasurface, is presented here. The design of these
   unit cells uses transmission-line theory. This is validated through
   application to ID refraction and Gaussian-to-Gaussian beam focusing. The
   1D refraction is further validated experimentally. These applications
   demonstrate the practical utility of these Huygens metasurfaces. The
   Huygens metasurfaces presented here are printed on two bonded boards
   instead of many stacked, interspaced layers. This simplifies fabrication
   and enables the scaling down of the metasurfaces to shorter wavelengths.
   These two bonded boards implement a single, collocated layer of electric
   and magnetic dipoles. The electric and magnetic dipoles are synthesized
   using sub-wavelength arrays of printed. elements. These printed elements
   can be manufactured using standard PCB fabrication techniques, and are
   capable of synthesizing the full range of impedances required.
   Furthermore, in contrast to frequency-selective surfaces (FSSs) and
   traditional transmitarrays, which are on the order of a wavelength
   thick, these designs are only lambda/10 thick while incurring minimum
   reflections losses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Targeting-Triggered Porphysome Nanostructure Disruption for Activatable
   Photodynamic Therapy}},

Abstract = {{Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) possess
   advantages over the conventional therapies with additional treatment
   selectivity achieved with local laser irradiation. Comparing to PTT that
   ablates target tissue via thermal necrosis, PDT induces target cell
   death via singlet oxygen without damaging the underling connective
   tissue, thus preserving its biological function. Activatable
   photosensitizers provide an additional level of treatment selectivity
   via the disease-associated activation mechanism. In this study,
   folate-conjugated porphysomes are introduced as targeting-triggered
   activatable nano-sized beacons for PDT. Porphysomes are reported
   previously as the most stable and efficient delivery system of
   porphyrin, but their nanostructure converts the singlet oxygen
   generation mechanism to thermal ablation mechanism. By
   folate-receptor-mediated endocytosis, folate-porphysomes are
   internalized into cells rapidly and resulted in efficient disruption of
   nanostructures, thus switching back on the photodynamic activity of the
   densely packed porphyrins for effective PDT. In both in vitro and in
   vivo studies, folate-porphysomes can achieve folate receptor-selective
   PDT efficacy, which proves the robustness of targeting-triggered PDT
   activation of porphysome nanostructure for highly selective tumor
   ablation. The formulation of porphysomes can be modified with other
   targeting ligands as activatable photosensitizers for personalized
   treatment in future.}},

Abstract = {{Leaky-wave antennas (LWAs) are designed based on supercells which are
   expanded versions of conventional negative-refractive-index transmission
   line (NRI-TL) unit cells. In the proposed LWAs with NRI-TL supercells,
   the number and values of inductors are reduced by half, decreasing the
   complexity of their design and reducing the Ohmic loss, which increases
   the antenna gain and efficiency. Compared with conventional NRI-TL unit
   cells, NRI-TL supercells operate over narrower bandwidth while showing
   proper Bloch impedance behavior over both left-hand (LH) and right-hand
   (RH) regions, leading to broadband impedance matching. Using coplanar
   waveguide (CPW) technology, closed-stopband LWAs based on NRI-TL
   supercells are designed, and their performance compared with that of the
   conventional unit cell LWAs. Finally, by using CPW supercells with a
   backing ground and vias, high-gain LWAs with sharp beams and suppressed
   backlobes are designed and realized.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a new step-up dc-dc converter topology suitable for
   medium voltage, megawatt scale applications. The proposed converter
   interconnects unipolar or bipolar dc networks using a single inductor
   and a modular active switching network. The active switching network
   contains multiple series-connected identical converter modules. Each
   module consists of four switches and one capacitor. The modular nature
   of the switching network allows scalable implementation of the
   converter, and utilisation of low-voltage switches and capacitors. The
   proposed converter avoids the use of medium-frequency isolation
   transformers. Soft switching is utilised to reduce the converter's
   switching losses. An analytical model of the converter is developed to
   facilitate converter design. Theoretical predictions are supported by a
   7.6 kW scaled laboratory prototype achieving an efficiency of as high as
   93.2\%.}},

   salt/lecithin molar ratio, bile salt concentration, total lipid
   concentration, and Ca2+ concentration on the solubility of cholesterol
   were investigated in detail. The results show that the cholesterol
   solubility monotonically increases with the increase of the
   concentration of bile salt or total lipid. The cholesterol solubility
   first increases with the bile salt/lecithin molar ratio when the bile
   salt/lecithin molar ratio is lower than 1 and then decreases when the
   bile salt/lecithin molar ratio further increases. In addition, the
   existence of Ca2+ in the model biles will significantly decrease the

Abstract = {{In this work the solubility of two polymorphic forms A and B of
   erlotinib hydrochloride in isopropanol (IPA) and acetone were determined
   by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the
   temperature range from (273.15 to 303.15) K. The experimental data were
   correlated with the modified Apelblat equation. In particular, the
   effect of the surfactant Tween 80 on the solubility of both polymorphs
   was studied as well. The results show that the solubility of both
   polymorphs generally increases with the temperature, and polymorph A has
   a higher solubility than polymorph B which indicates that polymorph A is
   the metastable form. The modified Apelblat equation shows a good
   agreement with the experimental data with a percent error less than 3
   \%. Furthermore, the solubility of both polymorphs increases in a linear
   fashion with increasing the content of Tween 80 in organic solvents,
   wherein Tween 80 presents a same solubilization capacity to both
   polymorphs and a higher solubilization capacity in acetone than in IPA.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Altered cerebrovascular blood flow has been proposed as a
   mechanism for multiple sclerosis (MS). The primary objective of this
   study was to measure arterial and venous blood flow in adolescent MS
   patients and healthy controls (HC), in whom confounding factors such as
   age and lifestyle are less influential.
   Materials and Methods: Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   was used to measure flow in 26 MS patients and 26 controls aged 17.7 +/-
   1.8 and 17.8 +/- 2.1 years, respectively. Flow was measured in the left
   and right internal carotid arteries (ICA), vertebral arteries (VA),
   internal jugular veins (IJV), and epidural veins (EV). Eighteen MS
   patients returned for a second MRI examination after 6 months. In all
   participants, ultrasound criteria for chronic cerebrospinal venous
   insufficiency (CCSVI) were also evaluated.
   Results: Flows (mL/min) in the MS group versus HC group were as follows:
   right ICA 262 +/- 57 vs. 263 +/- 32, left ICA = 260 +/- 67 vs. 270 +/-
   36, right VA = 96 +/- 50 vs. 103 +/- 30, left VA = 104 +/- 37 vs. 118
   +/- 41, right IJV = 342 +/- 180 vs. 345 +/- 195, left IJV = 190 +/- 131
   vs. 250 +/- 148, right EV = 33 +/- 29 vs. 48 +/- 43, and left EV = 36
   +/- 35 vs. 44 +/- 28 (P > 0.17 for all comparisons). In MS participants,
   a nonsignificant trend to lower flow in the left IJV was observed, and
   the flow pulsatility index in the epidural veins was higher. Two MS
   participants met ultra-sound criteria for CCSVI, but no significant
   difference in flow was detected.
   Conclusion: No population difference in flow rate was detected in
   adolescent MS participants relative to age-matched controls.}},

Abstract = {{In conventional displacement-based finite element formulation, the nodal
   transverse deflections and slopes of a beam element are used to
   approximate its transverse deflection distribution. In this paper, a
   curvature-based finite element formulation is presented for dynamic
   modeling of planar multi-link flexible manipulators. This formulation
   approximates the curvature distribution of the Euler-Bernoulli beam
   element by using its nodal curvatures. Therefore, in the curvature-based
   finite element formulation, fewer numbers of total elastic degrees of
   freedom for the system are needed. In addition, while the
   displacement-based finite element formulation yields discontinuous
   bending stresses at the inter-element nodes, this modeling provides
   continuous bending stress at those nodes. The proposed modeling will be
   verified and the dynamic behavior of the flexible planar manipulators
   will be studied.}},

Abstract = {{The strength of time-dependent correlations known as stride interval
   (SI) dynamics has been proposed as an indicator of neurologically
   healthy gait. Most recently, it has been hypothesized that these
   dynamics may be necessary for gait efficiency although the supporting
   evidence to date is scant. The current study examines over-ground SI
   dynamics, and their relationship with the cost of walking and physical
   activity levels in neurologically healthy children aged nine to 15
   years. Twenty participants completed a single experimental session
   consisting of three phases: 10 min resting, 15 min walking and 10 min
   recovery. The scaling exponent (a) was used to characterize SI dynamics
   while net energy cost was measured using a portable metabolic cart, and
   physical activity levels were determined based on a 7-day recall
   questionnaire. No significant linear relationships were found between a
   and the net energy cost measures (r < .07; p > .25) or between a and
   physical activity levels (r = .01, p = .62). However, there was a marked
   reduction in the variance of a as activity levels increased. Over-ground
   stride dynamics do not appear to directly reflect energy conservation of
   gait in neurologically healthy youth. However, the reduction in the
   variance of a with increasing physical activity suggests a potential
   exercise-moderated convergence toward a level of stride interval
   persistence for able-bodied youth reported in the literature. This
   latter finding warrants further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: Even in a publicly funded health care system, access to care
   may be related to socioeconomic status (SES). For children, delays in
   surgical procedures can have profound functional, social, and
   psychological effects with lifelong impact. The purpose of this study
   was to determine whether SES was related to meeting surgical wait time
   access targets for children. We also assessed the effects of gender,
   age, and distance to hospital on meeting access targets.
   METHODS: Patient addresses, referral wait times, and surgical wait times
   were obtained for 39 287 surgical procedures between 2005 and 2011 at
   the Hospital for Sick Children. Using census data, we derived household
   income quintile, distance to hospital, and indices of social and
   material deprivation. These indices were correlated with the percentage
   of children meeting clinic referral wait time targets and receiving
   surgery within the Pediatric Canadian Access Targets for Surgery.
   RESULTS: Across all SES quintiles, 33\% of children exceeded their
   referral wait time targets, and 28\% of children exceeded their surgical
   wait time targets. Indices of material or social deprivation and age did
   not correlate with the time from referral to clinic consultation (P =
   .54, .40, and .58, respectively). Gender was statistically significant
   (P < .001), but the difference was small (odds ratio = 0.87 for girls).
   Distance was also statistically significant (P = .005), and these
   differences translate into clinically meaningful differences in meeting
   wait time targets. Regarding completion of surgical procedures, material
   deprivation, distance, and gender did not correlate with longer wait
   times for surgery (P = .44, .09, .59, respectively). Social deprivation
   was statistically significant (P = .02) but not clinically significant.
   Increasing patient age was significantly associated with increased
   proportion of out-of-window wait times (P < .001). SES did not affect
   the timeliness of completion of surgery even when the urgency of the
   surgery (priority level based on diagnosis) was considered.
   CONCLUSIONS: SES does not predict the timeliness of delivery for
   pediatric surgical services.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an investigation of the temporal evolution of
   commuting mode choice preference structures. It contributes to two
   specific modelling issues: latent modal captivity and working with
   multiple repeated crossectional datasets. In this paper latent modal
   captivity refers to captive reliance on a specific mode rather than all
   feasible modes. Three household travel survey datasets collected in the
   Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) over a ten-year time period are
   used for empirical modelling. Datasets collected in different years are
   pooled and separate year-specific scale parameters and coefficients of
   key variables are estimated for different years. The empirical model
   clearly explains that there have been significant changes in latent
   modal captivity and the mode choice preference structures for commuting
   in the GTHA. Changes have occurred in the unexplained component of
   latent captivities, in transportation cost perceptions, and in the
   scales of commuting mode choice preferences. The empirical model also
   demonstrates that pooling multiple repeated cross-sectional datasets is
   an efficient way of capturing behavioural changes over time. Application
   of the proposed mode choice model for practical policy analysis and
   forecasting will ensure accurate forecasting and an enhanced
   understanding of policy impacts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objectives. The ester linkages contained within dental resin monomers
   (such as Bisphenol A-glycidylmethacrylate (BisGMA) and triethylene
   glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA)) are susceptible to hydrolytic
   degradation by salivary esterases, however very little is known about
   the specific esterase activities implicated in this process. The
   objective of this work was to isolate and identify the dominant proteins
   from saliva that are associated with the esterase activities shown to be
   involved in the degradation of BisGMA.
   Methods. Human whole saliva was collected and processed prior to
   separation in a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 HR column. The fraction
   with the highest esterase activity was further separated by an anion
   exchange column (Mono-Q (10/100G)). Isolated fractions were then
   separated by gel electrophoresis, and compared to a common bench marker
   esterase, cholesterol esterase (CE), and commercial albumin which has
   been reported to express esterase activity. Proteins suspected of
   containing esterase activity were analyzed by Mass Spectroscopy (MS).
   Commercially available proteins, similar to the salivary esterase
   proteins identified by MS, were used to replicate the enzymatic
   complexes and confirm their degradation activity with respect to BisGMA.
   Results. MS data suggested that the enzyme fraction with the highest
   esterase activity was contained among a group of proteins consisting of
   albumin, Zn-a2-glycoprotein, a-amylase, TALD01 protein, transferrin,
   lipocalin2, and prolactin-induced protein. Studies concluded that the
   main esterase bands on the gels in each fraction did not overlap with CE
   activity, and that albumin activity emerged as a lead candidate with
   significant esterase activity relative to BisGMA degradation,
   particularly when it formed a complex with Zn-a2-glycoprotein, under
   slightly basic conditions.
   Signcance. These enzyme complexes can be used as a physiologically
   relevant formulation to test the biostability of composite resins. (C)

Abstract = {{Access solutions may facilitate communication in children with limited
   functional speech and motor control. This study reviews current trends
   in access solution development for children with cerebral palsy, with
   particular emphasis on the access technology that harnesses a control
   signal from the user (eg, movement or physiological change) and the
   output device (eg, augmentative and alternative communication system)
   whose behavior is modulated by the user's control signal. Access
   technologies have advanced from simple mechanical switches to machine
   vision (eg, eye-gaze trackers), inertial sensing, and emerging
   physiological interfaces that require minimal physical effort.
   Similarly, output devices have evolved from bulky, dedicated hardware
   with limited configurability, to platform-agnostic, highly personalized
   mobile applications. Emerging case studies encourage the consideration
   of access technology for all nonverbal children with cerebral palsy with
   at least nascent contingency awareness. However, establishing robust
   evidence of the effectiveness of the aforementioned advances will

Abstract = {{Photothermal diffusion-wave imaging is a promising technique for the
   analysis of a range of media. However, traditional diffusion-wave
   techniques are limited by the physics of parabolic diffusion and can
   only produce depth-integrated planar images. Here, we report a
   depth-resolved photothermal imaging modality, henceforth termed
   truncated-correlation photothermal coherence tomography (TC-PCT). This
   enables three-dimensional visualization of subsurface features, which is
   not possible with known optical or photothermal imaging techniques.
   Examples include imaging of solids with intricate subsurface structures
   and discontinuities, such as holes in steel, burn depth profiles in
   tissues, and the structure of bone. It is compatible with regulations
   concerning maximum permissible exposure and is the photothermal analogue
   of optical coherence tomography. Axial and lateral resolutions in bone
   are measured to be similar to 25 and 100 mu m, respectively, with a
   depth range of similar to 3.2 mm (approximately four thermal diffusion

Abstract = {{Reconfigurable Machine Tools (RMTs) have been developed in response to
   agile flexible manufacturing demands. Current design methodologies for
   RMTs support modular reconfigurability in which a machine configuration
   is assembled for a given part. In this paper, on the other hand,
   reconfigurability relies on redundancy, namely, a desired RMT
   configuration is obtained through topological reconfiguration by
   locking/unlocking degrees-of-freedom (dof). Thus, in order to design a
   Redundant Reconfigurable Machine Tool (RRMT) with all of its dof already
   included, a new multi-tier optimization based design methodology was
   developed. The design is formulated for the efficient selection of the
   best architecture from a set of serial/parallel/hybrid solutions, while
   considering the redundant reconfigurability effect on performance. The
   viability of the methodology is demonstrated herein via a design test
   case of a Parallel Kinematic Mechanism (PKM)-based Redundant
   Reconfigurable meso-Milling Machine Tool (RRmMT) that can attain high
   stiffness at the high feed-rate required in meso-milling.}},

Abstract = {{Sensory function during the oral processing of liquids is thought to
   play a key role in informing the tailoring of swallowing motor behaviors
   to the flow characteristics of the bolus. In addition to taste
   receptors, the mouth and tongue house trigeminal nerve receptors that
   support the sensory detection of bolus size, shape (stereognosis), mass,
   temperature and movement. Recent studies suggest that healthy adults
   lose tongue strength with advancing age. However, little is known about
   changes in the sensory function of the tongue attributable to age, or
   associated with reductions in strength. In this study, we explored
   lingual tactile acuity in healthy young and older adults, and measured
   the relationship between tactile acuity and measures of tongue strength.
   The results showed an age-related reduction in lingual tactile acuity
   that was not explained by variations in tongue strength.
   PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
   Sensory motor interactions are a topic of interest in understanding the
   processing activities that take place in the mouth during eating and
   swallowing. In this paper, we explore a test of sensory acuity in the
   mouth, in which the tongue is used to ``read{''} embossed letters on
   Teflon strips. Our questions were to determine whether sensory acuity
   for this task declines with age, or with age-related reductions in
   tongue strength. We determined that older people perform this task with
   less accuracy, suggesting some changes in oral sensory function with
   age. However, these changes were not related to tongue strength. The
   findings suggest that strength does not play a major role in the kind of
   sensory discrimination task tested in this study.}},

Title = {{The Effectiveness of Interventions Aimed at Reducing Anxiety in Health
   Care Waiting Spaces: A Systematic Review of Randomized and Nonrandomized
   Trials}},

Volume = {{119}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Reducing waiting anxiety is an important objective of
   patient-centered care. Anxiety is linked to negative health outcomes,
   including longer recovery periods, lowered pain thresholds, and for
   children in particular, resistance to treatment, nightmares, and
   separation anxiety. The goals of this study were (1) to systematically
   review published research aimed at reducing preprocedural waiting
   anxiety, and (2) to provide directions for future research and
   development of strategies to manage preprocedural waiting anxiety in
   health care environments.
   METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature via 151 Web
   of Knowledge, PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Medline. Included in
   this review were studies describing measurable outcomes in response to
   interventions specifically intended to improve the waiting experience of
   patients in health care settings. Primary outcomes of interest were
   stress and anxiety. Exclusion criteria included (a) studies aimed at
   reducing wait times and management of waiting lists only, (b) waiting in
   non health care settings, (c) design of health care facilities with
   nonspecific strategies pertaining to waiting spaces, (d) strategies to
   reduce pain or anxiety during the course of medical procedures, and (e)
   interventions such as massage, acupuncture, or hypnosis that require
   dedicated staff and/or private waiting environments to administer.
   RESULTS: We identified 8690 studies. Forty-one articles met the
   inclusion criteria. In adult populations, 33 studies were identified,
   wherein the effects of music (n = 25), aromatherapy (n = 6), and
   interior design features (n = 2) were examined. Eight pediatric studies
   were identified investigating play opportunities (n = 2), media
   distractions (n = 2), combined play opportunities and media distractions
   (n = 3), and music (n = 1). Based on results from 1129 adult
   participants in the 14 studies that evaluated music and permitted
   meta-analysis, patients who listened to music before a medical procedure
   exhibited a lowered-state anxiety (-5.1 +/- 0.53 points on the State
   Trait Anxiety Scale) than those who received standard care. The efficacy
   of aromatherapy was inconclusive. Studies reporting on the impact of
   improved interior design of waiting areas, while positive, are minimal
   and heterogeneous. For children, insufficient evidence is available to
   corroborate the effectiveness of play opportunities, media distractions,
   and music for mitigating anxiety in children awaiting medical
   procedures.
   CONCLUSIONS: Music is a well-established means of decreasing anxiety in
   adult patients awaiting medical interventions. The effect of music on
   children's anxiety is not known. Limited studies and heterogeneity of
   interventions and methods in the areas of aromatherapy, interior design,
   digital media, and play opportunities (for children) suggest the need
   for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Particles in retail environments can have consequences for the
   occupational exposures of retail workers and customers, as well as the
   energy costs associated with ventilation and filtration. Little is known
   about particle characteristics in retail environments. We measured
   indoor and outdoor mass concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5, number
   concentrations of submicron particles (0.02-1 mu m), size-resolved
   0.3-10 mu m particles, as well as ventilation rates in 14 retail stores
   during 24 site visits in Pennsylvania and Texas. Overall, the results
   were generally suggestive of relatively clean environments when compared
   to investigations of other building types and ambient/occupational
   regulatory limits. PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations (mean +/- s.d.) were 20
   +/- 14 and 11 +/- 10 mu g/m(3), respectively, with indoor-to-outdoor
   ratios of 1.0 +/- 0.7 and 0.88 +/- 1.0. Mean submicron particle
   concentrations were 7220 +/- 7500 particles/cm(3) with an
   indoor-to-outdoor ratio of 1.18 +/- 1.30. The median contribution to
   PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations from indoor sources (vs. outdoors) was
   83\% and 53\%, respectively. There were no significant correlations
   between measured ventilation rates and particle concentrations of any
   size. When examining options to lower PM2.5 concentrations below
   regulatory limits, the required changes to ventilation and filtration
   efficiency were site specific and depended on the indoor and outdoor
   concentration, emission rate, and infiltration level.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) offer promise in flexible electronics,
   light sensing and energy conversion. These applications rely on
   rectifying junctions that require the creation of high-quality CQD
   solids that are controllably n-type (electron-rich) or p-type
   (hole-rich). Unfortunately, n-type semiconductors made using soft matter
   are notoriously prone to oxidation within minutes of air exposure. Here
   we report high-performance, air-stable n-type CQD solids. Using density
   functional theory we identify inorganic passivants that bind strongly to
   the CQD surface and repel oxidative attack. A materials processing
   strategy that wards off strong protic attack by polar solvents enabled
   the synthesis of an air-stable n-type PbS CQD solid. This material was
   used to build an air-processed inverted quantum junction device, which
   shows the highest current density from any CQD solar cell and a solar
   power conversion efficiency as high as 8\%. We also feature the n-type
   CQD solid in the rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of atmospheric
   NO2. This work paves the way for new families of electronic devices that
   leverage air-stable quantum-tuned materials.}},

Abstract = {{Seismic pounding of base-isolated buildings has been mostly studied in
   the past assuming unidirectional excitation. Therefore, in this study,
   the effects of seismic pounding on the response of base-isolated
   reinforced concrete buildings under bidirectional excitation are
   investigated. For this purpose, a three-dimensional finite element model
   of a code-compliant four-story building is considered, where a newly
   developed contact element that accounts for friction and is capable of
   simulating pounding with retaining walls at the base, is used. Nonlinear
   behavior of the superstructure as well as the isolation system is
   considered. The performance of the building is evaluated separately for
   far-fault non-pulse-like ground motions and near-fault pulse-like ground
   motions, which are weighted scaled to represent two levels of shaking
   viz. the design earthquake (DE) level and the risk-targeted maximum
   considered earthquake (MCER) level. Nonlinear time-history analyses are
   carried out considering lower bound as well as upper bound properties of
   isolators. The influence of separation distance between the building and
   the retaining walls at the base is also investigated. It is found that
   if pounding is avoided, the performance of the building is satisfactory
   in terms of limiting structural and nonstructural damage, under DE-level
   motions and MCER-level far-fault motions, whereas unacceptably large
   demands are imposed by MCER-level near-fault motions. In the case of
   seismic pounding, MCER-level near-fault motions are found to be
   detrimental, where the effect of pounding is mostly concentrated at the
   first story. In addition, it is determined that considering
   unidirectional excitation instead of bidirectional excitation for
   MCER-level near-fault motions provides highly unconservative estimates
   of superstructure demands. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the interaction of human circulating angiogenic
   cells (CACs) with a degradable polar hydrophobic ionic polyurethane
   (D-PHI) which has been previously shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory
   character and favorable interactions with human endothelial cells (ECs).
   Given the implication of the CACs in microvessel development it was of
   intrinsic interest to expand our knowledge of D-PHI biocompatibility
   with this relevant primary cell involved in angiogenesis. The findings
   will be compared to a well-established benchmark substrate for CACs,
   fibronectin-coated tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). Immunoblotting
   analysis showed that CACs were a heterogeneous population of cells
   composed mostly of monocytic cells expressing the CD14 marker.
   Assessment of the cytokine release profile, using ELISA, showed that
   D-PHI supported a higher concentration of interleukin-10 (IL-10) when
   compared to the concentration of tumor necrosis factor alpha, which is
   indicative of an anti-inflammatory phenotype, and was different from the
   response with TCPS. It was found that the CACs were attached to D-PHI
   and remained viable and functional (nitric oxide production) during the
   sevendays of culture. However, there did not appear to be any
   significant proliferation on D-PHI, contrary to the CAC growth on
   fibronectin-coated TCPS. It was concluded that D-PHI displayed some of
   the qualities suitable to enable the retention of CACs onto this
   substrate, as well as maintaining an anti-inflammatory phenotype,
   characteristics which have been reported to be important for
   angiogenesis in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Enzymes undergo multiple conformational changes in solution, and these

   Hinge-bending motions, resulting from reciprocal movements of dynamical

   hinge identification and flexibility modification of the regions by
   mutagenesis were conducted to explore the relationship between hinge
   flexibility and catalytic activity. Bacillus circulans xylanase was
   selected for the identification and mutation of the hinge regions. As a
   result, turnover rate (V (max)) was improved approximately twofold in
   mutants that have more rigid hinge structure, despite the decrease in K
   (m) and V (max)/K (m). This result indicates that the rigidly mutated
   hinge has positive effects on B. circulans xylanase activity.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were employed to
   remove benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) from low and
   high salinity water pre-equilibrated with crude oil. The treatment
   endpoint of crude oil-contaminated water is often controlled by BTEX
   compounds owing to their higher aqueous solubility and human-health
   toxicity compared to other hydrocarbons. The MWNT sorbent was
   extensively characterized and the depletion of the organic sorbate from
   the produced water was monitored by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (GC-MS) and total organic carbon (TOC) analyses. The equilibrium
   sorptive removal of BTEX followed the order: ethylbenzene/o-xylene >
   m-xylene > toluene > benzene in the presence of other competing organics
   in produced water. Sorption mechanisms were explored through the
   application of a variety of kinetics and equilibrium models. Pseudo 2nd
   order kinetics and Freundlich equilibrium models were the best at
   describing BTEX removal from produced water. Hydrophobic interactions
   between the MWNTs and BTEX, as well as the physical characteristics of
   the sorbate molecules, were regarded as primary factors responsible for
   regulating competitive adsorption. Salinity played a critical rote in
   limiting sorptive removal, with BTEX and total organic carbon (TOC)
   removal falling by 27\% and 25\%, respectively, upon the introduction of
   saline conditions. Results suggest that MWNTs are effective in removing
   risk-driving BTEX compounds from low-salinity oilfield produced water.}},

Title = {{Retrieving Causally Related Functions From Natural-Language Text for
   Biomimetic Design}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Identifying biological analogies is a significant challenge in
   biomimetic (biologically inspired) design. This paper builds on our
   previous work on finding biological phenomena in natural-language text.
   Specifically, a rule-based computational technique is used to identify
   biological analogies that contain causal relations. Causally related
   functions describe how one function is enabled by another function, and
   support the transfer of functional structure from analogies to design
   solutions. The causal-relation retrieval method uses patterns of
   syntactic information that represent causally related functions in
   individual sentences, and scored F-measures of 0.73-0.85. In a user
   study, novice designers found that of the total search matches,
   proportionally more of the matches obtained with the causal-relation
   retrieval method were relevant to design problems than those obtained
   with a single verb-keyword search. In addition, matches obtained with
   the causal-relation retrieval method increased the likelihood of using
   functional association to develop design concepts. Finally, the
   causal-relation retrieval method enables automatic extraction of
   biological analogies at the sentence level from a large amount of
   natural-language sources, which could support other approaches to
   biologically inspired design that require the identification of
   interesting biological phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To find physiologically arousing stimuli and labile
   physiological channels in a nonverbal adolescent with severe and
   multiple congenital disabilities, who did not have a reliable means of

   Methods: The client was repeatedly presented with visual and audiovisual
   stimuli, representing variations of six contextual factors over three
   sessions in a one month period. For each stimulus, reactions were
   detected in the client's four peripheral autonomic nervous system
   signals using a rule-based classification algorithm.
   Results: During the presentation of audiovisual stimuli, the number of
   physiological reactions significantly differed from that observed in
   baseline (chi(2) = 3.93, p = 0.0476). Aural stimuli articulated in an
   unfamiliar voice, and aural stimuli containing anticipatory patterns
   were also physiologically arousing. Fingertip temperature was the

Abstract = {{Bio-based foams are the solution to environmental concerns raised by
   petrochemical-based open cell foams used in various industries for sound
   absorption. While conventional petrochemical-based polymers take
   centuries to degrade or may not degrade at all, bio-based polymers
   decompose to bio-mass, water, and carbon dioxide in a matter of months
   when exposed to proper environment. To increase the potential of
   replacing current petrochemical foams, mechanical as well as acoustic
   characteristics of bio-based foams need to be improved. This article
   studies the effect of blending two bio-based polymers and physics of the
   blends on acoustic and mechanical properties of resulting polymer
   composite foams. Different blends of polylactide with three grades of
   polyhydroxyalkanoates were foamed and characterized based on acoustic
   and mechanical performance. Rheological properties of pure polymers as
   well as their blends were studied and effect of polymer blends on
   acoustic absorption of the resulting foams was investigated. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{An analytical model of a single line transmission line carrying a
   Stockbridge damper is developed based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam
   theory. The conductor is modeled as an axially loaded beam and the
   messenger is represented as a beam with a tip mass at each end.
   Experiments are conducted to validate the proposed model. An explicit
   expression is presented for the damping ratio of the conductor.
   Numerical examples show that the proposed model is more accurate than
   the models found in the literature. Parametric studies indicate that the
   response of the conductor significantly depends on the excitation
   frequency, the location of the damper, and the damper parameters.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{A nonlinear hybrid discrete-continuous dynamic model is established to
   analyze the steady-state response of a pulley-belt system with a one-way
   clutch and belt bending stiffness. For the first time, the translating
   belt spans in pulley-belt systems coupled with one-way clutches are
   modeled as axially moving viscoelastic beams. Moreover, the model
   considers the rotations of the driving pulley, the driven pulley, and
   the accessory. The differential quadrature and integral quadrature
   methods are developed for space discretization of the nonlinear
   integropartial-differential equations in the dynamic model. Furthermore,
   the four-stage Runge-Kutta algorithm is employed for time discretization
   of the nonlinear piecewise ordinary differential equations. The time
   series are numerically calculated for the driven pulley, the accessory,
   and the translating belt spans. Based on the time series, the fast
   Fourier transform is used for obtaining the natural frequencies of the
   nonlinear vibration. The torque-transmitting directional behavior of the
   one-way clutch is revealed by the steady-state of the clutch torque in
   the primary resonances. The frequency-response curves of the translating
   belt, the driven pulley, and the accessory show that the one-way clutch
   reduces the resonance of the pulley-belt system. Furthermore, the belt
   cross section's aspect ratio significantly affects the dynamic response.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess the effect of forsterite
   nanoparticles on the mechanical properties of glass ionomer cements
   (GICs). So, forsterite nanoparticles were produced by a sol-gel process
   and added to the ceramic component of a commercial glass ionomer cement
   at 1-4 wt\%. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis technique was used to
   characterize the phase composition and the grain size of forsterite
   nanoparticles. Compressive strength (CS), three-point flexural strength
   (FS), and diametral tensile strength (DTS) of the prepared glass
   ionomer-forsterite nanocomposites were measured. Analysis of variance
   (ANOVA) was used to compare the obtained results. Scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) imaging technique was used to study the morphology of
   the fractured surface after performing the mechanical tests. XRD
   analysis confirmed the synthesis of pure nanocrystalline forsterite
   particles. Statistical analysis showed a significant difference between
   the results of mechanical properties of the control specimens and the
   glass ionomer-forsterite nanocomposites. The highest compressive
   strength, flexural strength and diametral tensile strength were obtained
   using 3, 1, and 1 wt\% of forsterite nanoparticles, respectively.
   However, at 1 wt\% forsterite nanoparticles, all three measures of
   strength exhibited a significant increase compared to the commercial
   GIC. Thus, addition of 1 wt\% forsterite nanoparticles to the ceramic
   component of GIC is desired for dental restorations and orthopedic
   implants applications, where the maximum strength in all three modes of
   loading would be beneficial. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group

Abstract = {{The interfacial tension and density of molten polylactide/carbon dioxide
   (PLA/CO2) mixtures were determined by analyzing sessile drops in a
   high-pressure and high-temperature visualization chamber. The
   temperature and pressure ranged from (453 to 473) K and (6.89 to 20.68)
   MPa, respectively. The outcomes showed that the density difference
   between the PLA/CO2 mixture and the CO2 decreased proportionally with
   increased CO2 pressure. Overall, the PLA's interfacial tension decreased
   with an increase in CO2 pressure. The effect of temperature on
   interfacial tension depended on the CO2 pressure level; that is, at a
   lower pressure, the interfacial tension decreased with the temperature
   while at a higher pressure it increased with the temperature. These
   opposing trends were attributed to two competing CO2 mechanisms:
   hydraulic pressure and polymer swelling. The effects of the molecular
   chain configuration (that is, the varying D-content) were also
   investigated. It was found that the PLA's interfacial tension remained
   almost unchanged with a change in the D-content. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In kraft pulp mills, black liquor is concentrated and burned in recovery
   boilers to produce steam and power and to recover pulping chemicals.
   Black liquor contains a large amount of alkali compounds, which form ash
   with low melting temperatures upon combustion. This causes many problems
   in recovery boiler operation, including fouling of the heat transfer
   surfaces, plugging of the flue gas passages, reduction of the heat
   transfer rate, and corrosion of the superheater tubes. This paper
   presents a model for simulating fine fume particles formed as a result
   of condensation of alkali compound vapors in the recovery boiler. The
   modeling method combines CFD modeling, equilibrium chemistry, and fine
   particle dynamics in a way that enables simulation of a full scale
   three-dimensional boiler environment. The model has been partially
   validated with measurements performed in an operating recovery boiler.
   The modeling results, particularly for the fume particle composition,
   agree well with the actual measurements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

   cost, by operating the LLC converter in burst mode, without causing any
   visible disturbance. The converter operates with a regulated average LED
   current, while the burst pulse timing is controlled to minimize the
   current disturbance and reduce the output capacitance. Variable pulse
   position modulation is used to modulate the data, while supporting a
   range of dimming settings. A digital demodulation scheme that supports
   variable frequency transmission is demonstrated. The 80 W, 340-400 to 23
   V converter prototype has an efficiency of 95.1\%. The bit error rate of
   the complete system is fully characterized versus distance and angle.}},

Abstract = {{Parallel Kinematic Mechanisms (PKMs) are well suited for high-accuracy
   applications. However, constraints such as end-effector rotation (i.e.,
   platform tilt angle) and configuration-dependent stiffness often limit
   their usage. A new six degree-of-freedom (dof) PKM architecture based on
   a 3 x PPRS topology that addresses these concerns is presented in this
   paper - specifically, the proposed PKM can achieve high (end-effector)
   tilt angles with enhanced stiffness. The mechanism is also compared with
   similar three known 6-dof architectures, through which it is shown that
   the proposed PKM indeed exhibits higher stiffness relative to these
   three reference PKMs. The static stiffness is derived using matrix
   structural analysis, and the dynamic stiffness is obtained via
   finite-element analysis. A prototype of the proposed PKM that was
   designed and built is presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Pydpiper: a flexible toolkit for constructing novel registration
   pipelines}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUL 30}},
Abstract = {{Using neuroimaging technologies to elucidate the relationship between
   genotype and phenotype and brain and behavior will be a key contribution
   to biomedical research in the twenty-first century. Among the many
   methods for analyzing neuroimaging data, image registration deserves
   particular attention due to its wide range of applications. Finding
   strategies to register together many images and analyze the differences
   between them can be a challenge, particularly given that different
   experimental designs require different registration strategies.
   Moreover, writing software that can handle different types of image
   registration pipelines in a flexible, reusable and extensible way can be
   challenging. In response to this challenge, we have created Pydpiper, a
   neuroimaging registration toolkit written in Python. Pydpiper is an
   open-source, freely available software package that provides multiple
   modules for various image registration applications. Pydpiper offers
   five key innovations. Specifically: (1) a robust file handling class
   that allows access to outputs from all stages of registration at any
   point in the pipeline; (2) the ability of the framework to eliminate
   duplicate stages; (3) reusable, easy to subclass modules; (4) a
   development toolkit written for non-developers; (5) four complete
   applications that run complex image registration pipelines
   ``out-of-the-box.{''} In this paper, we will discuss both the general
   Pydpiper framework and the various ways in which component modules can
   be pieced together to easily create new registration pipelines. This
   will include a discussion of the core principles motivating code
   development and a comparison of Pydpiper with other available toolkits.
   We also provide a comprehensive, line-by-line example to orient users
   with limited programming knowledge and highlight some of the most useful
   features of Pydpiper. In addition, we will present the four current
   applications of the code.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the continuous extrusion foaming of poly(vinyl alcohol)

   Then, they were compounded with an MFC solution to prepare the sample.
   Both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and environmental scanning
   electron microscopy (ESEM) showed that the MFC dispersed well in the
   PVOH/MFC composites. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results
   showed that adding MFC affected the thermal behavior. This, in turn,
   affected cell nucleation and cell growth phenomena during foam
   extrusion. Water also acted as a co-blowing agent, together with
   scCO(2), in creating biodegradable polymer foams with a uniform cell
   structure and a high cell density. The effects of the MFC content,
   scCO(2) content, and die temperature variations on the cell density and
   cellular morphology of the PVOH/MFC composite foams were examined

Abstract = {{Objective: This paper investigates the potential and limitations of
   using relatively low volume fractions of cellulose nanofibre as
   reinforcement in cement pastes.
   Materials and methods: General use limestone (GUL) cement and cellulose
   nanofibre gel suspension were used in the preparation of cement paste.
   Mixture conductivity, hydration, flexural strength, energy absorption
   and fibre dispersion in hardened cement matrix were evaluated.
   Results: Cellulose nanofibre reduced the conductivity and the early age
   hydration of mixtures. However, at 28 days, the cumulative heat of
   hydration and the degree of hydration of cement pastes containing
   cellulose nanofibre were higher than those of the unreinforced reference
   mixture. Optimum mechanical properties were observed for paste
   containing 0.1\% nanofibre. The decrease in mechanical properties at
   higher nanofibre content is as a result of fibre agglomeration. In
   comparison to the reference paste, the flexural strength and energy
   absorption of 0.1\% nanofibre paste increased by approximately 106\% and
   184\%, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lightweight polypropylene/stainless-steel fiber (PP-SSF) composites with
   15-35\% density reduction were fabricated using foam injection molding.
   The electrical percolation threshold, through-plane electrical
   conductivity, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding
   effectiveness (SE) of the PP-SSF composite foams were characterized and
   compared against the solid counterparts. With 3 wt 96 CO2 dissolved in
   PP as a temporary plasticizer and lubricant, the fiber breakage was
   significantly decreased during injection molding, and well-dispersed
   fibers with unprecedentedly large aspect ratios of over 100 were
   achieved. The percolation threshold was dramatically decreased from 0.85
   to 0.21 vol \%, accounting for 7596 reduction, which is highly superior,
   compared to 28\% reduction of the previous PP carbon fiber composite
   foam.(1) Unlike the case of carbon fiber,(1) SSFs were much longer than
   the cell size, and the percolation threshold reduction of PP-SSF
   composite foams was thus primarily governed by the decreased fiber
   breakage instead of fiber orientation. The specific EMI SE was also
   significantly enhanced. A maximum specific EMI SE of 75 dB.g(-1).cm(3)
   was achieved in PP-1.1 vol \% SSF composite foams, which was much higher
   than that of the solid counterpart. Also, the relationships between the
   microstructure and properties were discussed. The mechanism of EMI
   shielding enhancement was also studied.}},

Title = {{User-centered design of a web-based self-management site for individuals

Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Background: To design and test a web-based self-management tool for
   patients with type 2 diabetes for its usability and feasibility.
   Methods: An evidence-based, theory-driven website was created for
   patients with type 2 diabetes. Twenty-three patients with type 2
   diabetes aged >= 25 years were recruited from 2 diabetes care centers in
   Toronto, Canada. We employed focus group methodology to assess
   acceptability, sustainability, strengths and weaknesses of the
   self-management website. Based on these results, revisions were made to
   the website. Three cycles of individual usability testing sessions using
   cognitive task analysis were conducted with patients with type 2
   diabetes. Revisions to the website were made based on results from this
   testing.
   Results: We identified five themes concerning participants' experiences
   of health care and related unmet needs: 1) Desire for information and
   for greater access to timely and personalized care to gain a sense of
   control of their disease; 2) Desire for community (sharing experiences
   with others) to fulfill practical and emotional needs; 3) Potential
   roles of an online self-management website in self-empowerment, behavior
   change, self-management and health care delivery; 4) Importance of a
   patient-centered perspective in presenting content (e.g. common
   assumptions, medical nomenclature, language, messaging, sociocultural
   context); 5) Barriers and facilitators to use of a self-management
   website (including perceived relevance of content, incorporation into
   usual routine, availability for goal-directed use, usability issues).
   Conclusions: Participants outlined a series of unmet health care needs,
   and stated that they wanted timely access to tailored knowledge about
   their condition, mechanisms to control and track their disease, and
   opportunities to share experiences with other patients. These findings
   have implications for patients with type 2 diabetes of diverse ages,
   socioeconomic backgrounds, and disease severity, as well as to the
   design of other computer-based resources for chronic disease management.}},

Abstract = {{A depth profiling technique using photocarrier radiometry (PCR) is
   demonstrated and used for the reconstruction of continuously varying
   electronic transport properties (carrier lifetime and electronic
   diffusivity) in the interim region between the ion residence layer and
   the bulk crystalline layer in H+ implanted semiconductor wafers with
   high implantation energies (similar to MeV). This defect-rich region,
   which is normally assumed to be part of the homogeneous ``substrate{''}
   in all existing two-and three-layer models, was sliced into many virtual
   thin layers along the depth direction so that the continuously and
   monotonically variable electronic properties across its thickness can be
   considered uniform within each virtual layer. The depth profile
   reconstruction of both carrier life time and diffusivity in H+ implanted
   wafers with several implantation doses (3 x 10(14), 3 x 10(15), and 3 x
   10(16) cm(-2)) and different implantation energies (from 0.75 to 2.0
   MeV) is presented. This all-optical PCR method provides a fast
   non-destructive way of characterizing sub-surface process-induced
   electronic defect profiles in devices under fabrication at any
   intermediate stage before final metallization and possibly lead to
   process correction and optimization well before electrical testing and
   defect diagnosis becomes possible. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel computer-aided detection (CAD) framework of breast
   masses in mammography. To increase detection sensitivity for various
   types of mammographic masses, we propose the combined use of different
   detection algorithms. In particular, we develop a region-of-interest
   combination mechanism that integrates detection information gained from
   unsupervised and supervised detection algorithms. Also, to significantly
   reduce the number of false-positive (FP) detections, the new ensemble
   classification algorithm is developed. Extensive experiments have been
   conducted on a benchmark mammogram database. Results show that our
   combined detection approach can considerably improve the detection
   sensitivity with a small loss of FP rate, compared to representative
   detection algorithms previously developed for mammographic CAD systems.
   The proposed ensemble classification solution also has a dramatic impact
   on the reduction of FP detections; as much as 70\% (from 15 to 4.5 per
   image) at only cost of 4.6\% sensitivity loss (from 90.0\% to 85.4\%).
   Moreover, our proposed CAD method performs as well or better (70.7\% and
   80.0\% per 1.5 and 3.5 FPs per image respectively) than the results of
   mammography CAD algorithms previously reported in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a formal optimization methodology for the seismic
   design of multiple tuned-mass-dampers (MTMDs) for the multi-modal
   control of 3D irregular buildings. The total weight of all TMDs is
   minimized while both inter-story drifts and total accelerations are
   constrained to allowable values so as to lead to a
   performance-based-design. A first order optimization method is adopted
   for that purpose while the gradients required are efficiently derived
   analytically. All constraints are first normalized by their allowable
   values and combined to a single constraint on their maximum value. The
   adjoint method is then utilized to efficiently derive its gradient. The
   results reveal that, with the right design, MTMDs can mitigate both
   structural and nonstructural earthquake damage. Hence, they can
   potentially present a multi-hazard strategy to mitigate both winds and
   earthquakes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The cerebellum has classically been linked to motor learning and
   coordination. However, there is renewed interest in the role of the
   cerebellum in non-motor functions such as cognition and in the context
   of different neuropsychiatric disorders. The contribution of
   neuroimaging studies to advancing understanding of cerebellar structure
   and function has been limited, partly due to the cerebellum being
   understudied as a result of contrast and resolution limitations of
   standard structural magnetic resonance images (MRI). These limitations
   inhibit proper visualization of the highly compact and detailed
   cerebellar foliations. In addition, there is a lack of robust algorithms
   that automatically and reliably identify the cerebellum and its
   subregions, further complicating the design of large-scale studies of
   the cerebellum. As such, automated segmentation of the cerebellar
   lobules would allow detailed population studies of the cerebellum and
   its subregions. In this manuscript, we describe a novel set of
   high-resolution in vivo atlases of the cerebellum developed by pairing
   MR imaging with a carefully validated manual segmentation protocol.
   Using these cerebellar atlases as inputs, we validate a novel automated
   segmentation algorithm that takes advantage of the neuroanatomical
   variability that exists in a given population under study in order to
   automatically identify the cerebellum, and its lobules. Our automatic
   segmentation results demonstrate good accuracy in the identification of
   all lobules (mean Kappa {[}kappa] = 0.731; range 0.40-0.89), and the
   entire cerebellum (means kappa = 0.925; range 0.90-0.94) when compared
   to ``gold-standard{''} manual segmentations. These results compare
   favorably in comparison to other publically available methods for
   automatic segmentation of the cerebellum. The completed cerebellar
   atlases are available freely online
   (http://imaging-genetics.camh.ca/cerebellum) and can be customized to
   the unique neuroanatomy of different subjects using the proposed
   segmentation pipeline (https://github.com/pipitone/MAGeTbrain). (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Steam gasification experiments of ash-free coal with and without
   potassium carbonate were performed in a newly designed drop-down
   reactor. The temperature dependency on the carbon conversion and gas
   production rates was investigated in a range of 600-800 degrees C and
   2.5 bar. The gasification rate at 700 degrees C was approximately 20
   times faster in the presence of the potassium catalysts. The
   gasification temperature could be lowered by similar to 125 degrees C.
   For example, at 625 degrees C the catalyzed gasification rate was
   essentially the same as for uncatalyzed rate at 750 degrees C. In
   addition, the catalyst reduced the apparent activation energy from 268
   to 161 kJ mol(-1). The water-gas-shift reaction was in equilibrium for
   both the uncatalyzed and catalyzed gasification of the ash-free coal
   samples. At low temperatures, a considerable amount of methane was
   formed through direct hydrogenation of the carbon substrate. Methane
   formation was decoupled from the COx production. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this study, microfluidic platforms were used to visualize air bubble
   transport in two-dimensional (2D) representations of gas diffusion
   layers (GDLs) to gain insight into how the geometric features of the GDL
   impact multiphase flow in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM)
   electrolyzers. Two-dimensional porous networks were designed using
   volumetric pore space information, including average porosity and
   average throat size obtained from micro-computed tomography (micro CT)
   visualizations. Microfluidic chips were fabricated to represent felt,
   sintered powder, and foam GDLs and used to simulate the transfer of
   oxygen bubbles generated at the catalyst layer, through the GDL towards
   the flow channels of a PEM electrolyzer. The results of this work
   indicate that the use of microfluidic platforms for evaluating PEM
   electrolyzer GDLs is highly promising. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Consideration of Blood Contact Applications}},

Abstract = {{The surface modification of existing polymeric biomaterials represents a
   key strategy for improving the hemocompatibility in long- and short-term
   biomedical materials without altering their bulk properties. Several
   techniques have been widely explored to generate surfaces that can
   prevent the activation of the coagulation system and lead to subsequent
   clot formation on the surfaces of polymeric blood contacting devices. In
   particular, strategies whereby the base polymer is blended with surface
   additives (SMAs) and surface modifying macromolecules (SMMs) are now
   recognized as practical and effective methods to improve surface
   polymeric materials. This review highlights the more recent advances in
   the synthesis of such additives and their blending with base polymers,
   with a specific focus on SMAs and SMMs with a molecular weight in the
   oligomeric range (< M-n similar to 12 kDa). The surface characterization
   of these modified materials is discussed in terms of water contact
   angle, X-ray photoelectron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and the
   blood compatibility behavior, with specific attention to coagulation
   proteins and platelet adhesion. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we discuss the use of the typical electron-donor (donor)

   to act as electron-accepting (acceptor) materials and as replacements
   for Cap when coupled with tetracene and pentacene as the electron-donor
   materials in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). A large decrease in
   photocurrent was observed when C-60 was replaced in the pentacene OPVs,
   although there was evidence of the harvesting of some triplets for the
   pentacene/Cl-Cl(6)BsubPc OPV. Large increases in V-oc, and stability
   were observed. Photoluminescence quenching, electron mobilities, and
   photovoltaic device characteristics are also presented and indicate the

Title = {{Structural and Functional Characterization of DUF1471 Domains of
   Salmonella Proteins SrfN, YdgH/SssB, and YahO}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Bacterial species in the Enterobacteriaceae typically contain multiple
   paralogues of a small domain of unknown function (DUF1471) from a family
   of conserved proteins also known as YhcN or BhsA/McbA. Proteins
   containing DUF1471 may have a single or three copies of this domain.
   Representatives of this family have been demonstrated to play roles in
   several cellular processes including stress response, biofilm formation,
   and pathogenesis. We have conducted NMR and X-ray crystallographic
   studies of four DUF1471 domains from Salmonella representing three
   different paralogous DUF1471 subfamilies: SrfN, YahO, and SssB/YdgH (two
   of its three DUF1471 domains: the N-terminal domain I (residues 21-91),
   and the C-terminal domain III (residues 244-314)). Notably, SrfN has
   been shown to have a role in intracellular infection by Salmonella
   Typhimurium. These domains share less than 35\% pairwise sequence
   identity. Structures of all four domains show a mixed alpha+beta fold
   that is most similar to that of bacterial lipoprotein RcsF. However, all
   four DUF1471 sequences lack the redox sensitive cysteine residues
   essential for RcsF activity in a phospho-relay pathway, suggesting that
   DUF1471 domains perform a different function(s). SrfN forms a dimer in
   contrast to YahO and SssB domains I and III, which are monomers in
   solution. A putative binding site for oxyanions such as phosphate and
   sulfate was identified in SrfN, and an interaction between the SrfN
   dimer and sulfated polysaccharides was demonstrated, suggesting a direct
   role for this DUF1471 domain at the host-pathogen interface.}},

Title = {{Local BMP-SMAD1 Signaling Increases LIF Receptor-Dependent STAT3
   Responsiveness and Primed-to-Naive Mouse Pluripotent Stem Cell
   Conversion Frequency}},
Journal = {{STEM CELL REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 8}},
Abstract = {{Conversion of EpiSCs to naive ESCs is a rare event that is driven by the
   reestablishment of the naive transcription factor network. In mice,
   STAT3 activation is sufficient to drive conversion of EpiSCs to the
   naive pluripotent stem cell (PSC) state. However, the lack of
   responsiveness of EpiSCs to LIF presents a bottleneck in this conversion
   process. Here, we demonstrate that local accumulation of BMP-SMAD1
   signaling, in cooperation with GP130 ligands, enhances the recovery of
   LIF responsiveness by directly controlling transcription of the LIF
   receptor (Lif-r). Addition of BMP and LIF to EpiSCs increases both LIF
   responsiveness and conversion frequencies to naive PSCs.
   Mechanistically, we show that the transcriptional cofactor P300 plays a
   critical role by mediating complex formation between STAT3 and SMAD1.
   This demonstration of how the local microenvironment or stem cell niche
   reactivates dormant signaling responsiveness and developmental potential
   may be applicable to other stem cell niche-containing systems.}},

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Peptidoglycan surrounds the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane to protect
   the cell against osmolysis. The biosynthesis of peptidoglycan, made of
   glycan strands crosslinked by short peptides, is the target of
   antibiotics like beta-lactams and glycopeptides. Nascent peptidoglycan
   contains pentapeptides that are trimmed by carboxypeptidases to
   tetra-and tripeptides. The well-characterized DD-carboxypeptidases
   hydrolyze the terminal D-alanine from the stem pentapeptide to produce a
   tetrapeptide. However, few LD-carboxypeptidases that produce tripeptides
   have been identified, and nothing is known about substrate specificity
   in these enzymes. We report biochemical properties and crystal
   structures of the LD-carboxypeptidases LdcB from Streptococcus
   pneumoniae, Bacillus anthracis, and Bacillus subtilis. The enzymes are
   active against bacterial cell wall tetrapeptides and adopt a
   zinc-carboxypeptidase fold characteristic of the LAS superfamily. We
   have also solved the structure of S. pneumoniae LdcB with a product
   mimic, elucidating the residues essential for peptidoglycan recognition
   and the conformational changes that occur on ligand binding.}},

Title = {{Functional autonomic nervous system profile in children with autism

Journal = {{MOLECULAR AUTISM}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Autonomic dysregulation has been recently reported as a
   feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the nature of
   autonomic atypicalities in ASD remain largely unknown. The goal of this
   study was to characterize the cardiac autonomic profile of children with
   ASD across four domains affected in ASD (anxiety, attention, response
   inhibition, and social cognition), and suggested to be affected by
   autonomic dysregulation.
   Methods: We compared measures of autonomic cardiac regulation in
   typically developing children (n = 34) and those with ASD (n = 40) as
   the children performed tasks eliciting anxiety, attention, response
   inhibition, and social cognition. Heart rate was used to quantify
   overall autonomic arousal, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was
   used as an index of vagal influences. Associations between atypical
   autonomic findings and intellectual functioning (Weschler scale), ASD
   symptomatology (Social Communication Questionnaire score), and co-morbid
   anxiety (Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale) were also
   investigated.
   Results: The ASD group had marginally elevated basal heart rate, and
   showed decreased heart rate reactivity to social anxiety and increased
   RSA reactivity to the social cognition task. In this group, heart rate
   reactivity to the social anxiety task was positively correlated with IQ
   and task performance, and negatively correlated with generalized
   anxiety. RSA reactivity in the social cognition task was positively
   correlated with IQ.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest overall autonomic hyperarousal in ASD and
   selective atypical reactivity to social tasks.}},

Title = {{Temporal transferability of work trip mode choice models in an expanding
   suburban area: the case of York Region, Ontario}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an investigation of the transferability of
   home-based work mode choice models in the context of a rapidly growing
   suburban area: the Regional Municipality of York in the Greater Toronto
   Area. Between 2001 and 2006, York Region experienced a rapid change in
   population and saw the introduction of new transit mode. With a wealth
   of revealed-preference household survey data from the Transportation
   Tomorrow Survey, there is an obvious opportunity to investigate whether
   there were any structural changes in travel behaviour amongst the
   region's residents. Three heteroskedastic generalised extreme value
   (GEV)-class choice models are estimated: one for 2001, one for 2006 and
   a model estimated using data pooled from the 2001 and 2006 data sets.
   Disaggregate and aggregate transferability tests are conducted.
   Disaggregate transferability refers to the ability of a model to predict
   the individual choices observed in the context of application and is
   measured, in absolute terms, by the transfer log-likelihood. Aggregate
   transferability refers to the ability of a model to predict overall
   trends in the data (e.g. mode share). It becomes clear that the sets of
   estimation parameters are statistically different before and after the
   new bus transit system introduction. This implies that even advanced
   heteroskedastic GEV models are not fully transferable. However,
   interestingly, when assessing aggregate transferability, it is found
   that the transferred models perform quite well; in some cases, the
   transferred models fit the data better than the original estimated
   model. This suggests that disaggregate choice models capable of
   addressing both the systematic and random effects of transportation and
   land-use changes on choice-making behaviour should be developed.}},

Title = {{Intra-Class Variation Reduction Using Training Expression Images for

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Automatic facial expression recognition (FER) is becoming increasingly
   important in the area of affective computing systems because of its
   various emerging applications such as human-machine interface and human
   emotion analysis. Recently, sparse representation based FER has become
   popular and has shown an impressive performance. However, sparse
   representation could often produce less meaningful sparse solution for
   FER due to intra-class variation such as variation in identity or
   illumination. This paper proposes a new sparse representation based FER
   method, aiming to reduce the intra-class variation while emphasizing the
   facial expression in a query face image. To that end, we present a new
   method for generating an intra-class variation image of each expression
   by using training expression images. The appearance of each intra-class
   variation image could be close to the appearance of the query face image
   in identity and illumination. Therefore, the differences between the
   query face image and its intra-class variation images are used as the
   expression features for sparse representation. Experimental results show
   that the proposed FER method has high discriminating capability in terms
   of improving FER performance. Further, the intra-class variation images
   of non-neutral expressions are complementary with that of neutral
   expression, for improving FER performance.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been increasingly considered an
   attractive solution for a plethora of applications. The low cost of
   sensor nodes provides a mean to deploy large sensor arrays in a variety
   of applications, such as civilian and environmental monitoring. Most of
   the WSNs operate in unlicensed spectrum bands, which have become
   overcrowded. As the number of the nodes that join the network increases,
   the need for energy-efficient, resource-constrained, and
   spectrum-efficient protocol also increases. Incorporating cognitive
   radio capability in sensor networks yields a promising networking
   paradigm, also known as cognitive radio sensor networks. In this paper,
   a cognitive networking with opportunistic routing protocol for WSNs is
   introduced. The objective of the proposed protocol is to improve the
   network performance after increasing network scalability. The
   performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated through simulations.
   An accurate channel model is built to evaluate the signal strength in
   different areas of a complex indoor environment. Then, a discrete event
   simulator is applied to examine the performance of the proposed protocol
   in comparison with two other routing protocols. Simulation results show
   that when comparing with other common routing protocols, the proposed
   protocol performs better with respect to throughput, packet delay, and
   total energy consumption.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT), a powerful tool in soliton theory
   and exactly solvable models, is a method for solving integrable partial
   differential equations governing wave propagation in certain nonlinear
   media. The NFT decorrelates signal degrees-of-freedom in such models, in
   much the same way that the Fourier transform does for linear systems. In
   this three-part series of papers, this observation is exploited for data
   transmission over integrable channels, such as optical fibers, where
   pulse propagation is governed by the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. In
   this transmission scheme, which can be viewed as a nonlinear analogue of
   orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing commonly used in linear
   channels, information is encoded in the nonlinear frequencies and their
   spectral amplitudes. Unlike most other fiber-optic transmission schemes,
   this technique deals with both dispersion and nonlinearity directly and
   unconditionally without the need for dispersion or nonlinearity
   compensation methods. This paper explains the mathematical tools that
   underlie the method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, numerical methods are suggested to compute the discrete
   and the continuous spectrum of a signal with respect to the
   Zakharov-Shabat system, a Lax operator underlying numerous integrable
   communication channels including the nonlinear Schrodinger channel,
   modeling pulse propagation in optical fibers. These methods are
   subsequently tested and their ability to estimate the spectrum are
   compared against each other. These methods are used to compute the
   spectrum of various signals commonly used in the optical fiber
   communications. It is found that the layer peeling and the spectral
   methods are suitable schemes to estimate the nonlinear spectra with good
   accuracy. To illustrate the structure of the spectrum, the locus of the
   eigenvalues is determined under amplitude and phase modulation in a
   number of examples. It is observed that in some cases, as signal
   parameters vary, eigenvalues collide and change their course of motion.
   The real axis is typically the place from which new eigenvalues
   originate or, are absorbed into after traveling a trajectory in the

Abstract = {{Motivated by the looming capacity crunch in fiberoptic networks,
   information transmission over such systems is revisited. Among numerous
   distortions, interchannel interference in multiuser wavelength-division
   multiplexing (WDM) is identified as the seemingly intractable factor
   limiting the achievable rate at high launch power. However, this
   distortion and similar ones arising from nonlinearity are primarily due
   to the use of methods suited for linear systems, namely WDM and linear
   pulse-train transmission, for the nonlinear optical channel. Exploiting
   the integrability of the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation, a
   nonlinear frequency-division multiplexing (NFDM) scheme is presented,
   which directly modulates noninteracting signal degrees-of-freedom under
   NLS propagation. The main distinction between this and previous methods
   is that NFDM is able to cope with the nonlinearity, and thus, as the
   signal power or transmission distance is increased, the new method does
   not suffer from the deterministic crosstalk between signal components,
   which has degraded the performance of previous approaches. In this
   paper, emphasis is placed on modulation of the discrete component of the
   nonlinear Fourier transform of the signal and some simple examples of
   achievable spectral efficiencies are provided.}},

Abstract = {{The embryonic epidermis displays a remarkable ability to repair wounds
   rapidly. Embryonic wound repair is driven by the evolutionary conserved
   redistribution of cytoskeletal and junctional proteins around the wound.
   Drosophila has emerged as a model to screen for factors implicated in
   wound closure. However, genetic screens have been limited by the use of
   manual analysis methods. We introduce MEDUSA, a novel image-analysis
   tool for the automated quantification of multicellular and molecular
   dynamics from time-lapse confocal microscopy data. We validate MEDUSA by
   quantifying wound closure in Drosophila embryos, and we show that the
   results of our automated analysis are comparable to analysis by manual
   delineation and tracking of the wounds, while significantly reducing the
   processing time. We demonstrate that MEDUSA can also be applied to the
   investigation of cellular behaviors in three and four dimensions. Using
   MEDUSA, we find that the conserved nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Abelson
   (Abl) contributes to rapid embryonic wound closure. We demonstrate that
   Abl plays a role in the organization of filamentous actin and the
   redistribution of the junctional protein beta-catenin at the wound
   margin during embryonic wound repair. Finally, we discuss different
   models for the role of Abl in the regulation of actin architecture and
   adhesion dynamics at the wound margin.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a modified switching strategy for hybrid flow

   situations, representing all the possible states of the HFC, verify its
   performance. The fluctuations of the transferred active power caused by
   switching the HFC might have an adverse effect on the decision of the
   controller as well as the stability of the system. To mitigate the
   fluctuations, a fuzzy logic controller is designed, and also a

   Three groups of numerical simulations are presented, which demonstrate

Journal = {{TAPPI JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{31-39}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The electrical resistivity of ash particles is an important parameter
   that determines the efficiency of electrostatic precipitators. This
   systematic study examines the resistivity of recovery boiler
   precipitator ash as a function of electrical field strength, time of
   exposure, particle composition, and gas composition and temperature.
   Synthetic ash and actual ash samples from several pulp mills are used.
   The results show that most ash samples tested had a resistivity between
   10(9) and 10(10) Omega.cm, but one of the samples had an unusually high
   resistivity, 10(12) Omega.cm. The resistivity increases with temperature
   up to about 140 degrees C, then decreases. At a given temperature, the
   resistivity decreases with increasing moisture and sulfur dioxide
   concentration in the gas. Resistivity also increases with an increase in
   chloride content in the ash, but is not affected by the carbonate,
   sulfate, and potassium contents. The results imply that recovery boilers
   burning liquors with high solids and high chloride contents produce ash
   with higher resistivity, making it more difficult for electrostatic
   precipitators to capture.
   Application: Pulp mills can minimize particulate emissions from recovery
   boilers by better understanding how ash composition and boiler and
   electrostatic precipitator operating conditions affect the electrical
   resistivity of ash particles.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable multi-hop forwarding in vehicular networks is required by many
   critical intelligent transportation system (ITS) safety applications.
   Cooperative vehicular multi-hop schemes achieve reliability using
   broadcast transmissions and multiple forwarding relays at each hop.
   However, packet duplication must be controlled to circumvent the
   broadcast storm problem. This paper presents the cooperative POC-based
   forwarding (CPF) protocol for highway vehicular networks, which extends
   the repetition-based POC-MAC protocol for multi-hop transmissions. At
   each forwarding hop, multiple cooperating relays form a virtual relay
   and schedule their transmissions to correspond to a single POC codeword,
   thereby adhering to the POC-MAC. CPF exploits spatial diversity while
   mitigating the effect of hidden terminals. By allocating separate
   POC-based schedules for multi-hop packets and the periodic broadcast of
   safety heartbeat packets, the CPF protocol reduces the interference
   between the two. The performance of the CPF protocol is studied through
   analysis using a Markov model and through ns-2 simulations.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The hematopoietic system is a distributed tissue that consists of
   functionally distinct cell types continuously produced through
   hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation. Combining genomic and
   phenotypic data with high-content experiments, we have built a
   directional cell-cell communication network between 12 cell types
   isolated from human umbilical cord blood. Network structure analysis
   revealed that ligand production is cell type dependent, whereas ligand
   binding is promiscuous. Consequently, additional control strategies such
   as cell frequency modulation and compartmentalization were needed to
   achieve specificity in HSC fate regulation. Incorporating the in vitro
   effects (quiescence, self-renewal, proliferation, or differentiation) of
   27 HSC binding ligands into the topology of the cell-cell communication
   network allowed coding of cell type-dependent feedback regulation of HSC
   fate. Pathway enrichment analysis identified intracellular regulatory
   motifs enriched in these cell type-and ligand-coupled responses. This
   study uncovers cellular mechanisms of hematopoietic cell feedback in HSC
   fate regulation, provides insight into the design principles of the
   human hematopoietic system, and serves as a foundation for the analysis
   of intercellular regulation in multicellular systems.}},

   assist in the assessment of acceleration sensitive non-structural and
   secondary components. Recently, a new procedure was successfully
   developed and tested for the simplified construction of floor spectra,
   at various levels of elastic damping, atop single-degree-of-freedom
   structures. This paper extends the methodology to
   multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) supporting systems responding in the
   elastic range, proposing a simplified modal combination approach for
   floor spectra over upper storeys and accounting for the limited
   filtering of the ground motion input that occurs over lower storeys. The
   procedure is tested numerically by comparing predictions with floor
   spectra obtained from time-history analyses of RC wall structures of 2-
   to 20-storeys in height. Results demonstrate that the method performs
   well for MDOF systems responding in the elastic range. Future research
   should further develop the approach to permit the prediction of floor
   spectra in MDOF systems that respond in the inelastic range.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to investigate the nonlinear dynamics of a thin-plate
   workpiece during milling process with cutting force nonlinearities. By
   modeling the thin-plate workpiece as a cantilevered thin plate and
   applying the Hamilton's principle, the equations of motion of the
   thin-plate workpiece are derived based on the Kirchhoff-plate theory and
   the von Karman strain-displacement relations. Using the Galerkin's
   approach, the equations of motion are reduced to a two-degree-freedom
   nonlinear system. The method of Asymptotic Perturbation is utilized to
   obtain the averaged equations in the case of 1:1 internal resonance and
   foundational resonance. Numerical methods are used to find the periodic
   and chaotic oscillations of the cantilevered thin-plate workpiece. The
   results show that the cantilevered thin-plate workpiece demonstrate
   complex dynamic behaviors under time-delay effects, the external and
   parametric excitations.}},

Abstract = {{We present a technique to probe the exciton distribution in organic
   light-emitting diodes. Our method involves strategically inserting
   sensing layers at different locations in proximity to the emissive zone.
   In contrast to typical sensing layers that act as a probe of the local
   exciton density, the sensing layers reported here use long-range energy
   transfer to probe a large area around the sensing layer. We highlight
   the importance of material selection, such that exciton distribution
   could be probed without influencing the electrical and optical
   properties of the organic light-emitting diodes. We expect that this
   work will provide an invaluable tool for studying excitons in organic
   light-emitting diodes.}},

Abstract = {{The enzymes involved in the initial steps of anaerobic benzene
   catabolism are not known. To try to elucidate this critical step, a
   metatranscriptomic analysis was conducted to compare the genes
   transcribed during the metabolism of benzene and benzoate by an
   anaerobic benzene-degrading, nitrate-reducing enrichment culture. RNA
   was extracted from the mixed culture and sequenced without prior mRNA
   enrichment, allowing simultaneous examination of the active community
   composition and the differential gene expression between the two
   treatments. Ribosomal and mRNA sequences attributed to a member of the
   family Peptococcaceae from the order Clostridiales were essentially only
   detected in the benzene-amended culture samples, implicating this group
   in the initial catabolism of benzene. Genes similar to each of two
   subunits of a proposed benzene-carboxylating enzyme were transcribed
   when the culture was amended with benzene. Anaerobic benzoate
   degradation genes from strict anaerobes were transcribed only when the
   culture was amended with benzene. Genes for other benzoate catabolic
   enzymes and for nitrate respiration were transcribed in both samples,
   with those attributed to an Azoarcus species being most abundant. These
   findings indicate that the mineralization of benzene starts with its
   activation by a strict anaerobe belonging to the Peptococcaceae,
   involving a carboxylation step to form benzoate. These data confirm the
   previously hypothesized syntrophic association between a
   benzene-degrading Peptococcaceae strain and a benzoate-degrading
   denitrifying Azoarcus strain for the complete catabolism of benzene with
   nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor.}},

Abstract = {{Policy initiatives have motivated a search for environmentally
   sustainable alternatives to fossil-fuel-based electricity generation.
   Agricultural residues such as corn cobs may be a suitable feedstock. A
   life cycle approach was used to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emission impacts associated with the use of pellets produced from corn
   cobs as the sole fuel for the generation of electricity at a
   hypothetically retrofitted coal-fired generating station in Ontario,
   Canada. Pellets are compared with current coal and hypothetical natural
   gas combined cycle (NGCC) facilities. A life cycle model and soil carbon
   model calibrated for the agricultural region of interest were combined
   to quantify the GHG emissions of the biomass product system. The corn
   cob product system's life cycle emissions (240 g CO(2)eq kWh(-1)) are
   40\% and 80\% lower than those of the NGCC and coal product systems,
   respectively. If corn cobs are left in the field to decompose, some
   carbon is sequestered in the soil, thus their removal from the field and
   combustion at the generation station represents a net GHG emission,
   accounting for 60\% of life cycle emissions. In addition to the GHG
   impacts of combustion, removing agricultural residues from fields may
   reduce soil health, increase erosion and affect soil fertility through
   loss of soil organic carbon and nutrients. Their sustainable use should
   therefore consider the maintenance of soil fertility over the long-term.
   Nevertheless, the use of the feedstock in place of coal may provide
   substantial GHG emissions mitigation. (C) 2014 Society of Chemical

Abstract = {{The structural symmetry required for long-range
   surface-plasmon-polariton modes to take place is examined and mapped to
   asymmetric plasmonic structures. This study leads to a design
   methodology that facilitates the realization through systematic design
   of long-range modes in any asymmetric hybrid plasmonic waveguide (AHPW).
   Examining the modal behavior of an AHPW reveals that field symmetry on
   either side of the metal is the only necessary condition for plasmonic
   structures to support long-range propagation. We report that this field
   symmetry condition can be satisfied irrespective of asymmetry in a
   waveguide structure, material, or even field profile. The structure is
   analyzed using the coupled mode theory, transfer matrix method, and
   finite-difference time-domain method. The AHPW supports high-loss
   antisymmetric and long-range symmetric supermodes. Dispersion of these
   supermodes with respect to waveguide dimensions display similar
   anticrossing characteristics to those obtained in two coupled harmonic
   oscillators, where the propagation losses display peaks and troughs in
   the vicinity of the anticrossing region. To place the work in
   perspective, an AHPW with a width of 200 nm was found to support a
   long-range supermode with a subwavelength mode area of 0.23 mu m(2) and
   propagation loss of 0.025 dB . mu m(-1) at the wavelength of 1550 nm,
   providing a radically improved attenuation confinement trade-off
   compared with other common types of plasmonic waveguides. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A new platform is proposed to solve one of the main shortcomings of
   surface plasmon resonance biosensors, namely, the cross sensitivity to

   spectroscopy in which three different modes are excited simultaneously.
   The proposed design consists of an SPR sensor loaded with a dielectric
   grating. The design parameters (dimensions and wavelength) are optimized
   with a genetic algorithm. The optimized design has two resonance modes
   excited with TM polarized light, each sensitive to surface effects, and
   one TE mode mostly sensitive to variations in the bulk fluid refractive
   index. Numerical and analytical methods are used to justify the
   simulation results, which are in good agreement. Finally, it is shown
   that, by applying three-mode spectroscopy, decoupling the properties of
   the attached biomaterial from the background index variations is
   possible with the proposed design. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Fatigue failure is an important failure mode of engineering materials.
   The fatigue behavior of both ductile and brittle materials has been
   under investigation for many years. While the fatigue failure of ductile
   materials is well established, only a few studies have been carried out
   on brittle materials. In addition, most fatigue studies on rocks are
   conducted under quasi-static loading conditions. To address engineering
   applications involving repeated blasting, this paper proposes a method
   to quantify the impact fatigue properties of rocks. In this method, a
   split Hopkinson pressure bar system is adopted to exert impact load on
   the sample, which is placed in a specially designed steel sleeve to
   limit the displacement of the sample and thus to enable the recovery of
   the rock after each impact. The method is then applied to Laurentian
   granite, which is fine-grained and isotropic material. The results
   demonstrate that this is a practicable means to conduct impact fatigue
   tests on rocks and other brittle solids.}},

Abstract = {{Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently engage in
   self-injurious behaviours, often in the absence of reporting pain.
   Previous research suggests that altered pain sensitivity and repeated
   exposure to noxious stimuli are associated with morphological changes in
   somatosensory and limbic cortices. Further evidence from postmortem
   studies with self-injurious adults has indicated alterations in the
   structure and organization of the temporal lobes; however, the effect of
   self-injurious behaviour on cortical development in children with ASD
   has not yet been determined. Thirty children and adolescents (mean age =
   10.6 +/- A 2.5 years; range 7-15 years; 29 males) with a clinical
   diagnosis of ASD and 30 typically developing children (N = 30, mean age
   = 10.7 +/- A 2.5 years; range 7-15 years, 26 males) underwent
   T1-weighted magnetic resonance and diffusion tensor imaging. No
   between-group differences were seen in cerebral volume, surface area or
   cortical thickness. Within the ASD group, self-injury scores negatively
   correlated with thickness in the right superior parietal lobule t = 6.3,
   p < 0.0001, bilateral primary somatosensory cortices (SI) (right: t =
   4.4, p = 0.02; left: t = 4.48, p = 0.004) and the volume of the left
   ventroposterior (VP) nucleus of the thalamus (r = -0.52, p = 0.008).
   Based on these findings, we performed an atlas-based region-of-interest
   diffusion tensor imaging analysis between SI and the VP nucleus and
   found that children who engaged in self-injury had significantly lower
   fractional anisotropy (r = -0.4, p = 0.04) and higher mean diffusivity
   (r = 0.5, p = 0.03) values in the territory of the left posterior limb
   of the internal capsule. Additionally, greater incidence of self-injury
   was associated with increased radial diffusivity values in bilateral
   posterior limbs of the internal capsule (left: r = 0.5, p = 0.02; right:
   r = 0.5, p = 0.009) and corona radiata (left: r = 0.6, p = 0.005; right:
   r = 0.5, p = 0.009). Results indicate that self-injury is related to
   alterations in somatosensory cortical and subcortical regions and their
   supporting white-matter pathways. Findings could reflect use-dependent
   plasticity in the somatosensory system or disrupted brain development
   that could serve as a risk marker for self-injury.}},

Abstract = {{Because the deployable structures are complex multi-loop structures and
   methods of derivation which lead to simpler kinematic and dynamic
   equations of motion are the subject of research effort, the kinematics
   and dynamics of deployable structures with scissor-like-elements are
   presented based on screw theory and the principle of virtual work
   respectively. According to the geometric characteristic of the
   deployable structure examined, the basic structural unit is the common
   scissor-like-element(SLE). First, a spatial deployable structure,
   comprised of three SLEs, is defined, and the constraint topology graph
   is obtained. The equations of motion are then derived based on screw
   theory and the geometric nature of scissor elements. Second, to develop
   the dynamics of the whole deployable structure, the local coordinates of
   the SLEs and the Jacobian matrices of the center of mass of the
   deployable structure are derived. Then, the equivalent forces are
   assembled and added in the equations of motion based on the principle of
   virtual work. Finally, dynamic behavior and unfolded process of the
   deployable structure are simulated. Its figures of velocity,
   acceleration and input torque are obtained based on the simulate
   results. Screw theory not only provides an efficient solution
   formulation and theory guidance for complex multi-closed loop deployable
   structures, but also extends the method to solve dynamics of deployable
   structures. As an efficient mathematical tool, the simper equations of
   motion are derived based on screw theory.}},

Abstract = {{A mm-wave I-Q power-DAC is reported at W-band. The circuit, which is
   fabricated in a 45 nm SOI CMOS technology, employs a series-stacked
   Gilbert-cell output stage with gate finger geometry segmentation to
   directly modulate a 85-95 GHz carrier. The Gilbert-cell provides phase
   inversion and 7 bits for ASK envelope modulation, each of which can be
   switched at speeds up to 15 Gb/s. A ninth bit turns the entire DAC cell
   on and off at 15 Gb/s, as needed to create an arbitrary 15 Gbaud QAM
   constellation in a symmetrical 4x4 I-Q power-DAC transmitter array, with
   free-space power combining and antenna-level segmentation. The measured
   output power and PAE of the I or Q DAC cells are 19 dBm and 8.9\%,
   respectively. Three effective bits of amplitude resolution and one phase
   bit are estimated from the small-signal S-parameter measurements in the
   80-95 GHz range. The envelope amplitude resolution reduces to only two
   effective bits under saturated output power operation. The OOK bit
   provides over 45 dB of measured attenuation and dynamic range, relative
   to the peak output power.}},

   more compact and has fewer elements than any other published planar
   crossover. At the operating frequency, the proposed crossover was
   measured in experiment to have 25 dB isolation (ISO), 25 dB return loss
   (RL), and 0.51 dB insertion loss (IL). The bandwidth (BW) over which the
   return loss and isolation remained above 15 dB was 5.7\% (9.6\% in

Abstract = {{Myocardial infarction results from a blockage of a major coronary artery
   that shuts the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to a region of the
   myocardium, leading to massive cardiomyocytes death and regression of
   microvasculature. Growth factor and cell delivery methods have been
   attempted to revascularize the ischemic myocardium and prevent further
   cell death. Implantable cardiac tissue patches were engineered to
   directly revascularize as well as remuscularize the affected muscle.
   However, inadequate vascularization in vitro and in vivo limits the
   efficacy of these new treatment options. Breakthroughs in cardiac tissue
   vascularization will profoundly impact ischemic heart therapies. In this
   review, we discuss the full spectrum of vascularization approaches
   ranging from biological angiogenesis to microfluidic blood vessels as
   related to cardiac tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{The multi-stage treatment of stable oil-in-water emulsions produced
   during non-enzymatic aqueous processing of dehulled yellow mustard flour
   with cyclic ethers {[}tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 1,4-dioxane] was
   investigated to produce a single-phase oil-solvent-water miscella
   suitable for biodiesel production. While the single-stage treatment of
   yellow mustard emulsion recovered 97 \% and 95 \% of the oil by using
   4:1 THF:oil and 9:1 dioxane:oil weight ratios, respectively, miscella
   phases containing more than 7 \% water formed, which made them
   unsuitable as biodiesel feedstock. Multi-stage treatments of the
   emulsion using lower THF:oil and dioxane:oil weight ratios were further
   developed to produce oil-solvent-water miscella phases with low water
   content. While three-stage extraction of emulsions using 0.5:1, 1:1,
   1.5:1, and 2:1 dioxane:oil weight ratios did not destabilize the
   emulsion, three-stage extraction using 0.5:1 and 0.75:1 THF:oil weight
   ratios effectively recovered over 97 \% of the oil, resulting in the
   production of oil-rich miscella phases containing only 1 \% and 1.5 \%
   water, respectively. These miscella phases were analyzed for free fatty
   acid and phosphorus contents and proved to be excellent feedstocks for
   the preparation of high-purity methyl esters through single-phase

Abstract = {{Background: Prominent regional cortical thickness reductions have been
   shown in schizophrenia. In contrast, little is known regarding
   alterations of structural coupling between regions in schizophrenia and
   how these alterations may be related to cognitive impairments in this
   disorder. Methods: T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired
   in 54 patients with schizophrenia and 68 healthy control subjects aged
   18-55 years. Cortical thickness was compared between groups using a
   vertex-wise approach. To assess structural coupling, seeds were selected
   within regions of reduced thickness, and brain-wide cortical thickness
   correlations were compared between groups. The relationships between
   identified patterns of circuit structure disruption and cognitive task
   performance were then explored. Results: Prominent cortical thickness
   reductions were found in patients compared with controls at a 5\% false
   discovery rate in a predominantly frontal and temporal pattern.
   Correlations of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with
   right prefrontal regions were significantly different in patients and
   controls. The difference remained significant in a subset of 20
   first-episode patients. Participants with stronger frontal
   interhemispheric thickness correlations had poorer working memory
   performance. Conclusions: We identified structural impairment in a
   left-right DLPFC circuit in patients with schizophrenia independent of
   illness stage or medication exposure. The relationship between
   left-right DLPFC thickness correlations and working memory performance
   implicates prefrontal interhemispheric circuit impairment as a
   vulnerability pathway for poor working memory performance. Our findings
   could guide the development of novel therapeutic interventions aimed at
   improving working memory performance in patients with schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Better understanding of the brain regions involved in performing
   laparoscopic surgery is likely to provide important insights for
   improving laparoscopic training and assessment in the future. To our
   knowledge, this is the first study using real Fundamentals of
   Laparoscopy Training (FLS)-based laparoscopic surgery training tasks in
   the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) environment to provide
   extensive characterization of the brain regions involved in this
   specific task execution.
   Nine right-handed subjects practiced five FLS-modified laparoscopic
   surgery-training tasks with a training box for ten sessions in a
   simulated fMRI environment. Following the last practice session, they
   underwent 3 T fMRI while performing each task.
   An increase in the extent of brain activation was observed as the
   complexity of the tasks increased. Activation in the precentral gyrus,
   postcentral gyrus, and premotor regions was observed in the performance
   of all tasks, whereas the superior parietal lobe (SPL) was activated in
   the more complex tasks. The mean score and brain activation for
   performance with the dominant hand were larger than those observed
   during performance with the non-dominant hand.
   Performing more complex tasks requires higher visual spatial ability and
   motor planning. Given the need for ambidextrous skills during
   laparoscopic tasks, the finding that lower scores and smaller brain
   recruitment occurred in executing tasks with the non-dominant hand than
   with the dominant hand suggests designing future training tasks to train
   the non-dominant hand more effectively. This may serve to improve
   overall performance in bi-manual tasks. Studies of this kind may
   facilitate the evidence-based development of strategies to improve the
   quality of laparoscopy training and assessment.}},

Abstract = {{We report a digital microfluidic system designed for droplet-based
   long-term culture and analysis of algae. The system includes unique
   innovations relative to standard devices including an active reservoir
   structure to maintain homogeneous cell density, a customized device
   layout capable of controlling a wide range of different droplet volumes,
   vertical interconnects to collect spent reagents, detection zones
   compatible with parallel-scale optical measurements using a standard
   multiwell plate reader, and optimized features for droplet dispensing in
   parallel. The method allows for automated, multiplexed analysis with
   significant reductions in human intervention, representing a decrease
   from 600 pipette steps (for a conventional screen in multiwell plates)
   to fewer than 20 (for the new microfluidic technique). The system was
   applied to screen conditions favourable for lipid generation in the
   widely used algal model for biofuel production, Cyclotella cryptica. A
   dependence on illumination wavelength was observed, with the best
   conditions (representing a four-fold increase relative to control)
   comprising an alternation between yellow (similar to 580 nm) and blue
   (similar to 450 nm) illumination wavelengths. These effects were
   observed for both micro- and macro-scale cultures, and are consistent
   with a putative mechanism involving photooxidative stress. We propose
   that the microfluidic system described here is an attractive new
   screening tool with potential advantages for applications in renewable
   energy, biotechnology, materials science, and beyond.}},

Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{46-53}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Despite the fact that precursors to reactive oxygen species (ROS) are
   prevalent indoors, the concentration of ROS inside buildings is unknown.
   ROS on PM2.5 was measured inside and outside twelve residential
   buildings and eleven institutional and retail buildings. The mean ( +/-
   s.d.) concentration of ROS on PM2.5 inside homes (1.37 +/- 1.2
   nmoles/m(3)) was not significantly different from the outdoor
   concentration (1.41 +/- 1.0 nmoles/m(3)). Similarly, the indoor and
   outdoor concentrations of ROS on PM2.5 at institutional buildings (1.16
   +/- 0.38 nmoles/m(3) indoors and 1.68 +/- 1.3 nmoles/m(3) outdoors) and
   retail stores (1.09 +/- 0.93 nmoles/m(3) indoors and 1.12 +/- 1.1
   nmoles/m(3) outdoors) were not significantly different and were
   comparable to those in residential buildings. The indoor concentration
   of particulate ROS cannot be predicted based on the measurement of other
   common indoor pollutants, indicating that it is important to separately
   assess the concentration of particulate ROS in air quality studies.
   Daytime indoor occupational and residential exposure to particulate ROS
   dominates daytime outdoor exposure to particulate ROS. These findings
   highlight the need for further study of ROS in indoor microenvironments.

Journal = {{ERGONOMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{959-972}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Query- or probe-based situation awareness (SA) measures sometimes rely
   on process experts to evaluate operator actions and system states when
   used in representative settings. This introduces variability of human
   judgement into the measurements that require inter-rater reliability
   assessment. However, the literature neglects inter-rater reliability of
   query/probe-based SA measures. We recruited process experts to provide
   reference keys to SA queries in trials of a full-scope nuclear power
   plant simulator experiment to investigate the inter-rater reliability of
   a query-based SA measure. The query-based SA measure demonstrated only
   `moderate' inter-rater reliability even though the queries were
   seemingly direct. The level of agreement was significantly different
   across pairs of experts who had different levels of exposure to the
   experiment. The results caution that inter-rater reliability of
   query/probe-based techniques for measuring SA cannot be assumed in
   representative settings. Knowledge about the experiment as well as the
   domain is critical to forming reliable expert judgements.
   Practitioner Summary: When the responses of domain experts are treated
   as the correct answers to the queries or probes of SA measures used in
   representative or industrial settings, practitioners should take caution
   in assuming (or otherwise assess) inter-rater reliability of the
   situation awareness measures.}},

Title = {{Lacunar stroke, deep white matter disease and depression: a
   meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL PSYCHOGERIATRICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1101-1109}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background: Lacunar stroke is a small (<2 cm) infarction that accounts
   for approximately 20\% of all strokes. While a third of all stroke
   patients experience depressive symptoms, the prevalence of depression in
   the lacunar stroke patient population is unclear. This meta-analysis
   aimed to synthesize the evidence on the effect of lacunar stroke and
   deep white matter disease on depressive symptoms.
   Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted,
   resulting in the inclusion of 12 studies. Analyses were performed on the
   effects of lacunar stroke, volume and location of lacunes on depression
   prevalence, and the effect on depression severity. The effects estimates
   were calculated in random-effects models.
   Results: None of the analyses produced statistically significant
   results. Lacunar stroke patients had a non-significantly higher
   prevalence of depression compared to patients with non-lacunar
   cerebrovascular diseases (OR = 1.46, 95\% CI: 0.88-2.43, p = 0.15).
   Neither thalamic (OR = 1.37 (0.85-2.20), p = 0.19), deep white matter
   (RR = 1.16 (0.85-1.57), p = 0.35), multiple lacunes (OR = 1.34
   (0.81-2.22), p = 0.25), or the volume of lacunes (MD = -4.71
   (-351.59-342.18), p = 0.98) had an effect on depression prevalence.
   Lastly, lacunar stroke did not influence depressive symptom severity (MD
   = 0.96 (-1.57-3.48), p = 0.46).
   Conclusions: The pooled group of patients with lacunar stroke and deep
   white matter disease appear to have a similar prevalence of depression
   compared to those with other types of cerebrovascular diseases. However,
   the small number of studies, heterogeneous comparison groups, and high
   statistical heterogeneity between studies posed an obstacle to the
   meta-analysis. To determine appropriate screening and treatment
   approaches, future research will need to separate lacunar stroke and
   deep white matter disease patients, and include larger sample sizes and
   healthy control groups to determine their distinct contributions to
   depression.}},

Abstract = {{Different dental post designs and materials affect the stability of
   restoration of a tooth. This study aimed to analyse and compare the
   stability of two shapes of dental posts (parallel-sided and tapered)
   made of five different materials (titanium, zirconia, carbon fibre and
   glass fibre) by investigating their stress transfer through the finite
   element (FE) method. Ten three-dimensional (3D) FE models of a maxillary
   central incisor restored with two different designs and five different
   materials were constructed. An oblique loading of 100 N was applied to
   each 3D model. Analyses along the centre of the post, the
   crown-cement/core and the post-cement/dentine interfaces were computed,
   and the means were calculated. One-way ANOVAs followed by post hoc tests
   were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the post materials and
   designs (p = 0.05). For post designs, the tapered posts introduced
   significantly higher stress compared with the parallel-sided post (p <
   0.05), especially along the centre of the post. Of the materials, the
   highest level of stress was found for stainless steel, followed by
   zirconia, titanium, glass fibre and carbon fibre posts (p < 0.05). The
   carbon and glass fibre posts reduced the stress distribution at the
   middle and apical part of the posts compared with the stainless steel,
   zirconia and titanium posts. The opposite results were observed at the
   crown-cement/core interface. (C) 2014 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A universal challenge in genetic studies of autism spectrum disorders
   (ASDs) is determining whether a given DNA sequence alteration will
   manifest as disease. Among different population controls, we observed,
   for specific exons, an inverse correlation between exon expression level
   in brain and burden of rare missense mutations. For genes that harbor de
   novo mutations predicted to be deleterious, we found that specific
   critical exons were significantly enriched in individuals with ASD
   relative to their siblings without ASD (P < 1.13 x 10(-38); odds ratio
   (OR) = 2.40). Furthermore, our analysis of genes with high exonic
   expression in brain and low burden of rare mutations demonstrated
   enrichment for known ASD-associated genes (P < 3.40 x 10(-11); OR =
   6.08) and ASD-relevant fragile-X protein targets (P < 2.91 x 10(-157);
   OR = 9.52). Our results suggest that brain-expressed exons under
   purifying selection should be prioritized in genotype-phenotype studies
   for ASD and related neurodevelopmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is routinely employed in the design of
   radiotherapy (RT) treatment plans for many disease sites. It is evident
   that tighter integration of MR imaging into the RT process would
   increase confidence in dose placement and facilitate the integration of
   new MR imaging information (including anatomical and functional imaging)
   into the therapy process. To this end, a dedicated MR-guided RT (MRgRT)
   facility has been created that integrates a state-of-the-art linear
   accelerator delivery system, high-dose rate brachytherapy afterloader,
   and superconducting MR scanner to allow MR-based online treatment
   guidance, adaptive replanning, and response monitoring while maintaining
   the clinical functionality of the existing delivery systems. This system
   is housed within a dedicated MRgRT suite and operates in a coordinated
   fashion to assure safe and efficient MRgRT treatments. (C) 2014

Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Replacement of fossil fuels with sustainably produced biomass crops for
   energy purposes has the potential to make progress in addressing climate
   change concerns, nonrenewable resource use, and energy security. The
   perennial grass Miscanthus is a dedicated energy crop candidate being
   field tested in Ontario, Canada, and elsewhere. Miscanthus could
   potentially be grown in areas of the province that differ substantially
   in terms of agricultural land class, environmental factors and current
   land use. These differences could significantly affect Miscanthus
   yields, input requirements, production practices, and the types of crops
   being displaced by Miscanthus establishment. This study assesses
   implications on life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of these
   differences through evaluating five Miscanthus production scenarios
   within the Ontario context. Emissions associated with electricity
   generation with Miscanthus pellets in a hypothetically retrofitted coal
   generating station are examined. Indirect land use change impacts are
   not quantified but are discussed. The net life cycle emissions for
   Miscanthus production varied greatly among scenarios (-90-170 kg CO(2)eq
   per oven dry tonne of Miscanthus bales at the farm gate). In some cases,
   the carbon stock dynamics of the agricultural system offset the combined
   emissions of all other life cycle stages (i.e., production, harvest,
   transport, and processing of biomass). Yield and soil C of the displaced
   agricultural systems are key parameters affecting emissions. The systems
   with the highest potential to provide reductions in GHG emissions are
   those with high yields, or systems established on land with low soil
   carbon. All scenarios have substantially lower life cycle emissions
   (-20-190 g CO(2)eq kWh(-1)) compared with coal-generated electricity
   (1130 g CO(2)eq kWh(-1)). Policy development should consider the
   implication of land class, environmental factors, and current land use
   on Miscanthus production.}},

Title = {{Implications of emissions timing on the cost-effectiveness of greenhouse
   gas mitigation strategies: application to forest bioenergy systems}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{414-424}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Conventional cost-effectiveness calculations ignore the implications of
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions timing and thus may not properly inform
   decision-makers in the efficient allocation of resources to mitigate
   climate change. To begin to address this disconnect with climate change
   science, we modify the conventional cost-effectiveness approach to
   account for emissions timing. GHG emissions flows occurring over time
   are translated into an `Equivalent Present Emission' based on radiative
   forcing, enabling a comparison of system costs and emissions on a
   consistent present time basis. We apply this `Present
   Cost-Effectiveness' method to case studies of biomass-based electricity
   generation (biomass co-firing with coal, biomass cogeneration) to
   evaluate implications of forest carbon trade-offs on the
   cost-effectiveness of emission reductions. Bioenergy production from
   forest biomass can reduce forest carbon stocks, an immediate emissions
   source that contributes to atmospheric greenhouse gases. Forest carbon
   impacts thereby lessen emission reductions in the near-term relative to
   the assumption of biomass `carbon neutrality', resulting in higher costs
   of emission reductions when emissions timing is considered. In contrast,
   conventional cost-effectiveness approaches implicitly evaluate
   strategies over an infinite analytical time horizon, underestimating
   nearer term emissions reduction costs and failing to identify pathways
   that can most efficiently contribute to climate change mitigation
   objectives over shorter time spans (e. g. up to 100 years). While
   providing only a simple representation of the climate change
   implications of emissions timing, the Present Cost-Effectiveness method
   provides a straightforward approach to assessing the cost-effectiveness
   of emission reductions associated with any climate change mitigation
   strategy where future GHG reductions require significant initial capital
   investment or increase near-term emissions. Timing is a critical factor
   in determining the attractiveness of any investment; accounting for
   emissions timing can better inform decisions related to the merit of
   alternative resource uses to meet near-, mid-, and long-term climate
   change mitigation objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Inhibition of enzyme activity by high concentrations of substrate and/or
   cofactor is a general phenomenon demonstrated in many enzymes, including
   aldehyde dehydrogenases. Here we show that the uncharacterized protein
   BetB (SA2613) from Staphylococcus aureus is a highly specific betaine
   aldehyde dehydrogenase, which exhibits substrate inhibition at
   concentrations of betaine aldehyde as low as 0.15 mM. In contrast, the
   aldehyde dehydrogenase YdcW from Escherichia coli, which is also active
   against betaine aldehyde, shows no inhibition by this substrate. Using
   the crystal structures of BetB and YdcW, we performed a structure-based
   mutational analysis of BetB and introduced the YdcW residues into the
   BetB active site. From a total of 32 mutations, those in five residues
   located in the substrate binding pocket (Val288, Ser290, His448, Tyr450,
   and Trp456) greatly reduced the substrate inhibition of BetB, whereas
   the double mutant protein H448F/Y450L demonstrated a complete loss of
   substrate inhibition. Substrate inhibition was also reduced by mutations
   of the semiconserved Gly234 (to Ser, Thr, or Ala) located in the BetB
   NAD(+) binding site, suggesting some cooperativity between the cofactor
   and substrate binding sites. Substrate docking analysis of the BetB and
   YdcW active sites revealed that the wild-type BetB can bind betaine
   aldehyde in both productive and nonproductive conformations, whereas
   only the productive binding mode can be modeled in the active sites of
   YdcW and the BetB mutant proteins with reduced substrate inhibition.
   Thus, our results suggest that the molecular mechanism of substrate
   inhibition of BetB is associated with the nonproductive binding of
   betaine aldehyde.}},

Title = {{Exceeding the Ontario Building Code for low-rise residential buildings:
   Economic and environmental implications}},
Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{40-49}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The residential sector accounts for approximately one fifth of Canada's
   secondary energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, addressing the
   energy efficiency of residential buildings has a significant role to
   play in reducing the nation's overall greenhouse gas emissions. The
   Ontario Building Code has recently been updated to reflect a more
   stringent energy performance standard. A home built to the prescribed
   minimum requirements will perform at a relatively high standard with
   respect to energy use when compared to homes built less than a decade
   ago. This paper explores three energy efficiency upgrade options which
   improve upon the energy efficiency of the 2012 Ontario Building Code.
   The ``controlled ventilation{''} upgrade involved tightening up the
   building envelope and adding heat recovery to waste air streams, and two
   additional upgrade options were developed to meet the high performance
   targets of the R-2000 standard. While the upgrades explored did not show
   financial benefit for individual homeowners at current utility rates, if
   the benefits to society are considered, the upgrades are an economically
   efficient method of reducing greenhouse gas emissions owed to energy
   consumption. In addition to highlighting the need for a broader approach
   to the cost-benefit analyses associated with these types of upgrades,
   this finding also warrants a discussion about how to transform the
   current housing market so that energy efficient homes are more
   appropriately valued. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Appropriate formulations are developed to allow for the atomistic-based
   continuum modeling of nano-reinforced structural adhesives on the basis
   of a nanoscale representative volume element that accounts for the

   developed representative volume element is then used with analytical and
   computational micromechanical modeling techniques to investigate the
   homogeneous dispersion of the reinforcing element into the adhesive upon
   both the linear and nonlinear properties. Unlike our earlier work where
   the focus was on developing linear micromechanical models for the
   effective elastic properties of nanocomposites, the present approach
   extends these models by describing the development of a nonlinear hybrid
   Monte Carlo Finite Element model that allows for the prediction of the
   full constitutive response of the bulk composite under large
   deformations. The results indicate a substantial improvement in both the
   Young's modulus and tensile strength of the nano-reinforced adhesives

Abstract = {{The integer least squares problem is an important problem that arises in
   numerous applications. We propose a real relaxation-based
   branch-and-bound (RRBB) method for this problem. First, we define a
   quantity called the distance to integrality, propose it as a measure of
   the number of nodes in the RRBB enumeration tree, and provide
   computational evidence that the size of the RRBB tree is proportional to
   this distance. Since we cannot know the distance to integrality a
   priori, we prove that the norm of the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse
   of the matrix of coefficients is a key factor for bounding this
   distance, and then we propose a preconditioning method to reduce this
   norm using lattice reduction techniques. We also propose a set of valid
   box constraints that help accelerate the RRBB method. Our computational
   results show that the proposed preconditioning significantly reduces the
   size of the RRBB enumeration tree, that the preconditioning combined
   with the proposed set of box constraints can significantly reduce the
   computational time of RRBB, and that the resulting RRBB method can
   outperform the Schnorr and Eucher method, a widely used method for
   solving integer least squares problems, on some types of problem data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effectiveness of providing interruption

   in time-critical settings. As interruptions can have detrimental effects
   on task performance, particularly in time-critical work environments,
   there is growing interest in the design of tools to assist people in
   resuming their pre-interruption activity. A user study was conducted to
   evaluate the use of an interactive event timeline that provides
   assistance to human supervisors in time-critical settings. The study was
   conducted in an experimental platform that emulated a team of operators
   and a mission commander performing a time-critical unmanned aerial
   vehicle (UAV) mission. The study results showed that providing
   interruption assistance enabled people to recover from interruptions
   faster and more accurately. These results have implications for
   interface design that could be adopted in similar time-critical
   environments such as air-traffic control, process control, and first

Abstract = {{The pituitary gland is a key structure in the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis it plays an important role in
   sexual maturation during puberty. Despite its small size, its volume can
   be quantified using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here, we study a
   cohort of 962 typically developing adolescents from the Saguenay Youth
   Study and estimate pituitary volumes using a newly developed multi-atlas
   segmentation method known as the MAGeT Brain algorithm. We found that
   age and puberty stage (controlled for age) each predicts adjusted
   pituitary volumes (controlled for total brain volume) in both males and
   females. Controlling for the effects of age and puberty stage, total
   testosterone and estradiol levels also predict adjusted pituitary
   volumes in males and pre-menarche females, respectively. These findings
   demonstrate that the pituitary gland grows during adolescence, and its
   volume relates to circulating plasma-levels of sex steroids in both
   males and females. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the mechanical properties of carbon nanotube reinforced
   epoxy adhesives are investigated experimentally. The investigations are
   intended to characterize the physical and mechanical properties of
   nano-reinforced structural epoxy adhesives and to further highlight some
   of the complex phenomena associated with these materials. We describe
   the dispersion methodology used to disperse the carbon nanotubes into
   the considered adhesive and provide details pertaining to adherent
   surface preparation, bondline thickness control and adhesive curing
   conditions. Furthermore, the following tests are described: (i) dogbone
   tensile testing, (ii) tensile bond testing, (iii) double lap shear and
   (iv) double cantilever beam fracture toughness testing. The experimental
   observations indicate a critical carbon nanotube concentration in the
   vicinity of 1.5 wt\% that results in the largest improvements in the
   measured properties. At concentrations exceeding this critical value,
   the properties begin to degrade, in some cases, to levels below that of
   the pure epoxy. Advanced electron microscopy techniques and rheological
   assessments indicate that this is mainly due to the agglomeration of the
   carbon nanotubes at higher concentrations as a result of increased resin
   viscosity and the consequent resistance to dispersion. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fontainebleau sandstone specimens have been tested in a true-triaxial

   various stress ratios sigma(2)/sigma(3) under varying magnitudes of
   sigma(2) and sigma(3) on 3-D stress-strain responses, 3-D transport, 3-D
   ultrasonic wave velocities, and acoustic emission properties. Comparison
   of the variation of 3-D directional permeability between the specimens
   shows that higher magnitude of sigma(3) and sigma(2) disrupts the 3-D

   The observed permeability anisotropy between the two specimens is a
   function of inherent oriented pores and cracks, stress ratio
   sigma(2)/sigma(3) and the magnitude of applied sigma(3) and sigma(2)
   stresses. Temporal and spatial evolution of the AE hypocenter locations
   combined with the examination of micro-CT and thin section images shows
   the timely development of polymodal fault systems during peak to

Title = {{A highly efficient dilute alkali deacetylation and mechanical (disc)
   refining process for the conversion of renewable biomass to lower cost
   sugars}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: The deconstruction of renewable biomass feedstocks into
   soluble sugars at low cost is a critical component of the biochemical
   conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals. Providing low cost high
   concentration sugar syrups with low levels of chemicals and toxic
   inhibitors, at high process yields is essential for biochemical platform
   processes using pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. In this work, we
   utilize a process consisting of deacetylation, followed by mechanical
   refining in a disc refiner (DDR) for the conversion of renewable biomass
   to low cost sugars at high yields and at high concentrations without a
   conventional chemical pretreatment step. The new process features a low
   temperature dilute alkaline deacetylation step followed by disc refining
   under modest levels of energy consumption.
   Results: The proposed process was demonstrated using a commercial scale
   Andritz double disc refiner. Disc refined and deacetylated corn stover
   result in monomeric glucose yields of 78 to 84\% and monomeric xylose
   yields of 71 to 77\% after enzymatic hydrolysis at process-relevant
   solids and enzyme loadings. The glucose and xylose yields of the disc
   refined substrates in enzymatic hydrolysis are enhanced by 13\% and
   19\%, respectively. Fermentation of the DDR substrates at 20\% total
   solids with Z.mobilis utilized almost all sugars in 20hrs indicating the
   sugar hydrolyzate produced from the DDR process is highly fermentable
   due to low levels of chemical contaminants. The ethanol titer and
   ethanol process yield are approximately 70 g/L and 90\% respectively.
   Conclusions: The proposed new process has been demonstrated using pilot
   scale deacetylation and disc refiners. The deacetylated and disc refined
   corn stover was rapidly deconstructed to monomeric sugars at 20\% wt
   solids with enzymatic hydrolysis. High process sugar conversions were
   achieved, with high concentrations of monomeric sugars that exceeded 150
   g/L. The sugar syrups produced were found to have low concentrations of
   known major fermentation inhibitors: acetic acid, furfural and HMF. The
   low levels of these fermentation inhibitors lead to high fermentation
   yields. The results suggest that this process is a very promising
   development for the nascent cellulosic biofuels industry.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to characterize fibers with near-zero dispersionlength
   products is of considerable practical interest. We introduce dispersive
   virtual reference interferometry (DVRI) as a technique for the
   characterization of short length (< 1m) fibers with near-zero
   disperisonlength. DVRI has an accuracy equivalent to standard balanced
   spectral interferometry (on the order of 10-3 ps and 10-5 ps/nm for the
   group delay and dispersion-length measurements respectively) but does
   not require wide spectral bandwidths or multiple spectral scans.
   Following experimental validation, the DVRI technique is used to
   characterize a 23.3-cm erbiumdoped gain fiber (dispersion-length product
   < 0.002 ps/nm), using a tunable laser with a bandwidth of 145nm.
   Furthermore, the dispersion in a 28.6-cm commercial dispersion shifted
   fiber is characterized across the zerodispersion wavelength and the
   zero-disperison-wavelength and slope were determined to be 1566.7 nm and
   8.57 x 10(-5) ps/(nm(2) . m) with a precision of +/- 0.2 nm and +/- 0.06

Abstract = {{Motivation: Alternative splicing (AS) is a regulated process that
   directs the generation of different transcripts from single genes. A
   computational model that can accurately predict splicing patterns based
   on genomic features and cellular context is highly desirable, both in
   understanding this widespread phenomenon, and in exploring the effects
   of genetic variations on AS.
   Methods: Using a deep neural network, we developed a model inferred from
   mouse RNA-Seq data that can predict splicing patterns in individual
   tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues. Our
   architecture uses hidden variables that jointly represent features in
   genomic sequences and tissue types when making predictions. A graphics
   processing unit was used to greatly reduce the training time of our
   models with millions of parameters.
   Results: We show that the deep architecture surpasses the performance of
   the previous Bayesian method for predicting AS patterns. With the proper
   optimization procedure and selection of hyperparameters, we demonstrate
   that deep architectures can be beneficial, even with a moderately sparse
   dataset. An analysis of what the model has learned in terms of the
   genomic features is presented.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the spring, summer and fall water quality
   performance of three partial-infiltration permeable pavement (PP)
   systems and a conventional asphalt pavement in Ontario. The study,
   conducted between 2010 and 2012, compared the water quality of effluent
   from two Interlocking Permeable Concrete Pavements (AquaPave and
   Eco-Optiloc) and a Hydromedia Pervious Concrete pavement with runoff
   from an Asphalt control pavement. The usage of permeable pavements can
   mitigate the impact of urbanization on receiving surface water systems
   through quantity control and stormwater treatment. The PP systems
   provided excellent stormwater treatment for petroleum hydrocarbons,
   total suspended solids, metals (copper, iron, manganese and zinc) and
   nutrients (total-nitrogen and total phosphorus) by reducing event mean
   concentrations (EMC) as well as total pollutant loadings. The PPs
   significantly reduced the concentration and loading of ammonia (NH4+ +
   NH3), nitrite (NO2-) and organic-nitrogen (Org-N) but increased the
   concentration and loading of nitrate (NO3-). The PP systems had mixed
   performances for the treatment of phosphate (PO43-). The PP systems
   increased the concentration of sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) but EMCs
   remained well below recommended levels for drinking water quality.
   Relative to the observed runoff, winter road salt was released more
   slowly from the PP systems resulting in elevated spring and early-summer
   Cl and Na concentrations in effluent. PP materials were found to
   introduce dissolved solids into the infiltrating stormwater. The release
   of these pollutants was verified by additional laboratory scale testing
   of the individual pavement and aggregate materials at the University of
   Guelph. Pollutant concentrations were greatest during the first few
   months after construction and declined rapidly over the course of the
   study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A kinematic study of energy barriers for crack formation in graphene
   tilt boundaries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{JUN 14}},
Abstract = {{Recent experimental studies have observed a surprisingly wide range of
   strengths in polycrystalline graphene. Previous computational
   investigations of graphene tilt boundaries have highlighted the role of
   interfacial topology in determining mechanical properties. However, a
   rigorous characterization of deformation energy barriers is lacking,
   which precludes direct comparison to the available experimental data. In
   the current study, molecular dynamics tensile simulations are performed
   to quantify kinematic effects on failure initiation in a wide range of
   graphene tilt boundaries. Specifically, the process of crack formation
   is investigated to provide a conservative estimate of strength at
   experimental loading rates. Contrary to previous studies, significant
   strain rate sensitivity is observed, resulting in reductions of crack
   formation stresses on the order of 7\% to 33\%. Energy barriers for
   crack formation are calculated in the range of 0.58 to 2.07 eV based on
   an Arrhenius relation that is fit to the collected simulation data.
   Physically, the magnitude of energy barriers in graphene tilt boundaries
   is found to be linearly correlated to the pre-stress in the critical
   bonds. Predictions reported in the present study provide a possible
   explanation for the wide range of strengths experimentally observed in
   polycrystalline graphene and greatly improve upon current theoretical
   estimates. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We present an analytical method for evaluating the first and second
   moments of the effective exciton spatial distribution in organic
   light-emitting diodes (OLED) from measured emission patterns.
   Specifically, the suggested algorithm estimates the emission zone mean
   position and width, respectively, from two distinct features of the
   pattern produced by interference between the emission sources and their
   images (induced by the reflective cathode): the angles in which
   interference extrema are observed, and the prominence of interference
   fringes. The relations between these parameters are derived rigorously
   for a general OLED structure, indicating that extrema angles are related
   to the mean position of the radiating excitons via Bragg's condition,
   and the spatial broadening is related to the attenuation of the
   image-source interference prominence due to an averaging effect. The
   method is applied successfully both on simulated emission patterns and
   on experimental data, exhibiting a very good agreement with the results
   obtained by numerical techniques. We investigate the method performance
   in detail, showing that it is capable of producing accurate estimations
   for a wide range of source-cathode separation distances, provided that
   the measured spectral interval is large enough; guidelines for achieving
   reliable evaluations are deduced from these results as well. As opposed
   to numerical fitting tools employed to perform similar tasks to date,
   our approximate method explicitly utilizes physical intuition and
   requires far less computational effort (no fitting is involved). Hence,
   applications that do not require highly resolved estimations, e.g.,
   preliminary design and production-line verification, can benefit
   substantially from the analytical algorithm, when applicable. This
   introduces a novel set of efficient tools for OLED engineering, highly
   important in the view of the crucial role the exciton distribution plays
   in determining the device performance. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{A van der Waals density functional theory comparison of metal decorated
   graphene systems for hydrogen adsorption}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{JUN 14}},
Abstract = {{Previous Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies on metal decorated
   graphene generally use local density approximation (LDA) or generalized
   gradient approximation (GGA) functionals which can cause inaccuracies in
   hydrogen binding energies as they neglect van der Waals (vdW)
   interactions and are difficult to compare due to their widely varying
   simulation parameters. We investigated the hydrogen binding ability of
   several metals with a consistent set of simulations using the GGA
   functional and incorporated vdW forces through the vdW-DF2 functional.
   Metal adatom anchoring on graphene and hydrogen adsorption ability for
   both single and double sided decoration were studied for eight metals
   (Al, Li, Na, Ca, Cu, Ni, Pd, and Pt). It was found that the vdW
   correction can have a significant impact on both metal and hydrogen
   binding energies. The vdW-DF2 functional led to stronger metal adatom
   and hydrogen binding for light metals in comparison to GGA results,
   while heavier transition metals displayed the opposite behaviour but
   still produced stronger hydrogen binding energies than light metals.
   Nickel was found to be the best balance between hydrogen binding ability
   for reversible storage and low weight. The effects on hydrogen binding
   energy and maximum achievable hydrogen gravimetric density were analyzed
   for Ni-graphene systems with varying metal coverage. Lower metal
   coverage was found to improve hydrogen binding but decrease hydrogen
   gravimetric density. The highest achieved Ni-graphene system gravimetric
   density was 6.12wt. \%. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive radiation therapy (ART) had been proposed to restore dosimetric
   deficiencies during treatment delivery. In this paper, we developed a
   technique of Geometric reLocation for analyzing anatomical OBjects'
   Evolution (GLOBE) for a numerical model of tumor evolution under
   radiation therapy and characterized geometric changes of the target
   using GLOBE. A total of 174 clinical target volumes (CTVs) obtained from
   32 cervical cancer patients were analyzed. GLOBE consists of three main
   steps; step (1) deforming a 3D surface object to a sphere by parametric
   active contour (PAC), step (2) sampling a deformed PAC on 642 nodes of
   icosahedron geodesic dome for reference frame, and step (3) unfolding 3D
   data to 2D plane for convenient visualization and analysis. The
   performance was evaluated with respect to (1) convergence of deformation
   (iteration number and computation time) and (2) accuracy of deformation
   (residual deformation). Based on deformation vectors from planning CTV
   to weekly CTVs, target specific (TS) margins were calculated on each
   sampled node of GLOBE and the systematic (Sigma) and random (sigma)
   variations of the vectors were calculated. Population based anisotropic
   (PBA) margins were generated using van Herk's margin recipe. GLOBE
   successfully modeled 152 CTVs from 28 patients. Fast convergence was
   observed for most cases (137/152) with the iteration number of 65 +/- 74
   (average +/- STD) and the computation time of 13.7 +/- 18.6 min.
   Residual deformation of PAC was 0.9 +/- 0.7 mm and more than 97\% was
   less than 3 mm. Margin analysis showed random nature of TS-margin. As a
   consequence, PBA-margins perform similarly to ISO-margins. For example,
   PBA-margins for 90\% patients' coverage with 95\% dose level is close to
   13 mm ISO-margins in the aspect of target coverage and OAR sparing.
   GLOBE demonstrates a systematic analysis of tumor motion and deformation
   of patients with cervix cancer during radiation therapy and numerical
   modeling of PBA-margin on 642 locations of CTV surface.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers optimization of the user and base-station (BS)
   association in a wireless downlink heterogeneous cellular network under
   the proportional fairness criterion. We first consider the case where
   each BS has a single antenna and transmits at fixed power and propose a
   distributed price update strategy for a pricing-based user association
   scheme, in which the users are assigned to the BS based on the value of
   a utility function minus a price. The proposed price update algorithm is
   based on a coordinate descent method for solving the dual of the network
   utility maximization problem and it has a rigorous performance
   guarantee. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm as compared to
   an existing subgradient method for price update is that the proposed
   algorithm is independent of parameter choices and can be implemented
   asynchronously. Further, this paper considers the joint user association
   and BS power control problem and proposes an iterative dual coordinate
   descent and the power optimization algorithm that significantly
   outperforms existing approaches. Finally, this paper considers the joint
   user association and BS beamforming problem for the case where the BSs
   are equipped with multiple antennas and spatially multiplex multiple
   users. We incorporate dual coordinate descent with the weighted minimum
   mean-squared error (WMMSE) algorithm and show that it achieves nearly
   the same performance as a computationally more complex benchmark
   algorithm (which applies the WMMSE algorithm on the entire network for
   BS association) while avoiding excessive BS handover.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the uplink of a cloud radio access network (C-RAN)
   where the cell sites are connected to a cloud-computing-based central
   processor (CP) with noiseless backhaul links with finite capacities. We
   employ a simple compress-and forward scheme in which the base stations
   (BSs) quantize the received signals and send the quantized signals to
   the CP using either distributed Wyner-Ziv coding or single-user
   compression. The CP first decodes the quantization codewords and then
   decodes the user messages as if the remote users and the cloud center
   form a virtual multiple-access channel (VMAC). This paper formulates the
   problem of optimizing the quantization noise levels for weighted sum
   rate maximization under a sum backhaul capacity constraint. We propose
   an alternating convex optimization approach to find a local optimum
   solution to the problem efficiently, and more importantly, to establish
   that setting the quantization noise levels to be proportional to the
   background noise levels is near optimal for sum-rate maximization when
   the signal-to-quantization-noise-ratio (SQNR) is high. In addition, with
   Wyner-Ziv coding, the approximate quantization noise level is shown to
   achieve the sum-capacity of the uplink C-RAN model to within a constant
   gap. With single-user compression, a similar constant-gap result is
   obtained under a diagonal dominant channel condition. These results lead
   to an efficient algorithm for allocating the backhaul capacities in
   C-RAN. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated for practical
   multicell and heterogeneous networks. It is shown that multicell
   processing with optimized quantization noise levels across the BSs can
   significantly improve the performance of wireless cellular networks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analytical study of the stable throughput for
   multiple broadcast sessions in a multi-hop wireless tandem network with
   random access. Intermediate nodes leverage on the broadcast nature of
   wireless medium access to perform inter-session network coding among
   different flows. This problem is challenging due to the interaction
   among nodes, and has been addressed so far only in the saturated mode
   where all nodes always have packet to send, which results in infinite
   packet delay. In this paper, we provide a novel model based on
   multi-class queueing networks to investigate the problem in unsaturated
   mode. We devise a theoretical framework for computing maximum stable
   throughput of network coding for a slotted ALOHA-based random access
   system. Using our formulation, we compare the performance of network
   coding and traditional routing. Our results show that network coding
   leads to high throughput gain over traditional routing. We also define a
   new metric, network unbalance ratio (NUR), that indicates the unbalance
   status of the utilization factors at different nodes. We show that
   although the throughput gain of the network coding compared to the
   traditional routing decreases when the number of nodes tends to
   infinity, NUR of the former outperforms the latter. We carry out
   simulations to confirm our theoretical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes a procedure that found a balance between the
   ability of polymer-stabilized nanorods (NRs) to self-assemble and the
   creation of narrow gaps to make reproducibly bright surface-enhanced
   Raman scattering (SERS) nanorod dimers. NRs were end-functionalized with
   polymers, which enabled end-to-end self-assembly of NR chains and
   control over inter-rod separation through polymer molecular weight (MW).
   We found a way to quench the self-assembly, by phospholipid
   encapsulation, reducing the polydispersity of the aggregates while
   rendering them water-soluble. This reduction in polydispersity and
   preferential isolation of short-chain nanorod species is important for
   maximizing SERS enhancement from nanorod chains. We prepared NR
   aggregates that exhibit similar to 5-50 times greater SERS intensity
   than isolated rods (and similar to 750 x greater than bare dye)
   depending on inter-rod separation, when using Oxazine 725 reporter
   molecules. Colloidal stability of NR aggregates and temporal stability
   of the SERS signal in water were observed for 110 days. With enhanced
   SERS intensity, water solubility, and stability, these NR aggregates are
   promising optical probes for future biological applications.}},

Abstract = {{A nanoparticle's physical and chemical properties at the time of cell
   contact will determine the ensuing cellular response. Aggregation and
   the formation of a protein corona in the extracellular environment will
   alter nano particle size, shape, and surface properties, giving it a
   ``biological identity{''} that is distinct from its initial ``synthetic
   identity{''}. The biological identity of a nanoparticle depends on the
   composition of the surrounding biological environment and determines
   subsequent cellular interactions. When studying nanoparticle-cell
   interactions, previous studies have ignored the dynamic composition of
   the extracellular environment as cells deplete and secrete biomolecules
   in a process known as ``conditioning{''}. Here, we show that cell
   conditioning induces gold nanoparticle aggregation and changes the
   protein corona composition in a manner that depends on nanoparticle
   diameter, surface chemistry, and cell phenotype. The evolution of the
   biological identity in conditioned media enhances the cell membrane
   affinity, uptake, and retention of nanoparticles. These results show
   that dynamic extracellular environments can alter nanoparticle-cell
   interactions by modulating the biological identity. The effect of the
   dynamic nature of biological environments on the biological identity of
   nanoparticles must be considered to fully understand nano-bio
   interactions and prevent data misinterpretation.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the principles governing the design of nanopartides for
   tumor targeting is essential for the effective diagnosis and treatment
   of solid tumors. There is currently a poor understanding of how to
   rationally engineer nanoparticles for tumor targeting. Here, we
   engineered different-sized spherical gold nanoparticles to discern the
   effect of particle diameter on passive (poly(ethylene glycol)-coated)
   and active (transferrin-coated) targeting of MDA-MB-435 orthotopic tumor
   xenografts. Tumor accumulation of actively targeted nanoparticles was
   found to be 5 times faster and approximately 2-fold higher relative to
   their passive counterparts within the 60 nm diameter range. For 15,30,
   and 100 nm, we observed no significant differences. We hypothesize that
   such enhancements are the result of an increased capacity to penetrate
   into tumors and preferentially associate with cancer cells. We also use
   computational modeling to explore the mechanistic parameters that can
   impact tumor accumulation efficacy. We demonstrate that tumor
   accumulation can be mediated by high nanoparticle avidity and are weakly
   dependent on their plasma clearance rate. Such findings suggest that
   empirical models can be used to rapidly screen novel nanomaterials for
   relative differences in tumor targeting without the need for animal
   work. Although our findings are specific to MDA-MB-435 tumor xenografts,
   our experimental and computational findings help to enrich knowledge of
   design considerations that will aid in the optimal engineering of
   spherical gold nanoparticles for cancer applications in the future.}},

   Non-Newtonian Liquids in the Nectar- and Honey-Thick Ranges}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Thickened liquids are frequently used in the management of oropharyngeal
   dysphagia. Previous studies suggest that compression of a liquid bolus
   between the tongue and the palate in the oral phase of swallowing serves
   a sensory function, enabling the tuning of motor behavior to match the
   viscosity of the bolus. However, the field lacks information regarding
   healthy oral sensory discrimination ability for small differences in
   liquid viscosity. We undertook to measure oral viscosity discrimination
   ability for five non-Newtonian xanthan gum-thickened liquids in the
   nectar- and honey-thick range. Xanthan gum concentration ranged from 0.5
   to 0.87 \% and increased by an average of 0.1 \% between stimuli in the
   array. This translated to an average apparent viscosity increase of
   0.2-fold between adjacent stimuli at 50 reciprocal seconds (/s). A
   triangle test paradigm was used to study stimulus discrimination in 78
   healthy adults in two, sex-balanced age cohorts. Participants were
   provided 5-ml samples of liquids in sets of three; one liquid differed
   in xanthan gum concentration from the other two. Participants were
   required to sample the liquid orally and indicate which sample was
   perceived to have a different viscosity. A protocol of 20 sets (60
   samples) allowed calculation of the minimum difference in xanthan gum
   concentration detected accurately. On average, participants were able to
   accurately detect a 0.38-fold increase in xanthan-gum concentration,
   translating to a 0.67-fold increase in apparent viscosity at 50/s. The
   data did not suggest the existence of a nonlinear point boundary in
   apparent viscosity within the range tested. No differences in viscosity
   discrimination were found between age cohorts or as a function of sex.
   The data suggest that for xanthan gum-thickened liquids, there may be

Abstract = {{We study the secret message capacity of an ergodic block fading wiretap
   channel with partial channel state information at the transmitter and
   perfect channel state information at the receivers, under both a short
   term power constraint (STPC) and a long term power constraint (LTPC). We
   consider that in addition to the statistics of the main and the
   eavesdropper channel state information (CSI), the sender is provided by
   the legitimate receiver with a q-bit feedback, at the beginning of each
   coherence block, through an error-free public channel, with capacity q
   bits. We establish upper and lower bounds on the secrecy capacity. We
   show that the lower and the upper bounds coincide asymptotically as q ->
   infinity. When applied to Rayleigh fading channels, we show that, a
   4-bit feedback achieves about 90\% of the secrecy capacity when perfect
   main CSI is available at the transmitter. Finally, asymptotic analysis
   at high and low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is presented. It is found
   that the capacity is bounded at high-SNR, whereas at asymptotically
   low-SNR, the lower bounds and the upper bound scale linearly with SNR
   under STPC. Furthermore, subject to LTPC, the capacity at low-SNR is
   equal to the capacity of the main channel without secrecy constraint and
   with perfect CSI at both the transmitter and the receiver, under a mild
   condition on the fading statistics. We also show that a positive secrecy
   rate is achievable even when the feedback is at the end of each
   coherence block and q = 1.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, high-fidelity analysis tools, such as computational
   fluid dynamics and finite element method, have been widely used in
   multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) to enhance the accuracy of
   design results. However, complex MDO problems have many design variables
   and require long computation times. Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is
   proposed to assuage the complexity of design problems by reducing
   dimensionality where variables that have low impact on the objective
   function are neglected. This avoids wasting computational effort and
   time on low-priority variables. Additionally, uncertainty introduced by
   the fidelity of the analysis tools is considered in design optimization
   to increase the reliability of design results. Reliability-based design
   optimization (RBDO) and possibility-based design optimization (PBDO)
   methods are proposed to handle uncertainty in design optimization. In
   this paper, the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test was used for
   GSA, whereas a collaborative optimization-based framework with RBDO and
   PBDO was used to consider uncertainty introduced by approximation
   models. The proposed method was applied to an aero-structural design
   optimization of an aircraft wing to demonstrate the feasibility and
   efficiency of the developed method. The objective function was to
   maximize the lift-to-drag ratio. The proposed process reduced
   calculation efforts by reducing the number of design variables and
   achieved the target probability of failure when it considered
   uncertainty. Moreover, this work evaluated previous research in RBDO
   with MDO for the wing design by comparing it with the PBDO result.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{123-133}},

Abstract = {{Microbial utilization of lignocellulose from plant cell walls is
   integral to carbon cycling on Earth. Correspondingly, secreted enzymes
   that initiate lignocellulose depolymerization serve a crucial step in
   the bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass to fuels and chemicals.
   Genome and metagenome sequencing efforts that span the past decade
   reveal the diversity of enzymes that have evolved to transform
   lignocellulose from wood, herbaceous plants and grasses. Nevertheless,
   there are relatively few examples where `omic' technologies have
   identified novel enzyme activities or combinations thereof that
   dramatically improve the economics of lignocellulose bioprocessing and
   utilization. A likely factor contributing to the discrepancy between
   sequence-based enzyme discovery and enzyme application is the common
   practice to screen enzyme candidates based on activity measurements
   using soluble model compounds. In this context, the development and
   application of imaging, physicochemical, and spectromicroscopic
   techniques that allow direct assessment of enzyme action on relevant
   lignocellulosic substrates is reviewed.}},

Title = {{An Adaptive Approach to Learn Overcomplete Dictionaries With Efficient
   Numbers of Elements}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{Dictionary learning for sparse representation has recently attracted
   attention among the signal processing society in a variety of
   applications such as denoising, classification, and compression. The
   number of elements in a learned dictionary is crucial since it governs
   specificity and optimality of sparse representation. Sparsity level,
   number of dictionary elements, and representation error are three
   correlated factors in which setting each pair of them results in a
   specific value of the third factor. An arbitrary selection of the number
   of dictionary elements affects either the sparsity level or/and the
   representation error. Despite recent advancements in training
   dictionaries, the number of dictionary elements is still heuristically
   set. To avoid the representation's sub-optimality, a systematic approach
   to adapt the elements' number based on input datasets is essential. Some
   existing methods try to address this requirement such as enhanced K-SVD,
   sub-clustering K-SVD, and stage-wise K-SVD. However, it is not specified
   under which sparsity level and representation error criteria their
   learned dictionaries are size-optimized. We propose a new dictionary
   learning approach that automatically learns a dictionary with an
   efficient number of elements that provides both desired representation
   error and desired average sparsity level. In our proposed method, for
   any given representation error and average sparsity level, the number of
   elements in the learned dictionary varies based on content complexity of
   training datasets. The performance of the proposed method is
   demonstrated in image denoising. The proposed method is compared to
   state-of-the-art, and results confirm the superiority of the proposed
   approach.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{35-43}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This study examines the foaming behaviour of polystyrene (PS) blown with
   supercritical CO2-N-2 blends. This is achieved by observing their
   foaming processes in situ using a visualization system within a
   high-temperature/high-pressure view-cell. Through analyzing the cell
   nucleation and growth processes, the foaming mechanisms of PS blown with
   supercritical CO2-N-2 blends have been studied. It was observed that the
   75\% CO2-25\% N-2 blend yielded the highest cell densities over a wide
   processing temperature window, which indicates the high nucleating power
   of supercritical N-2 and the high foam expanding ability of
   supercritical CO2 would produce synergistic effects with that ratio in
   batch foaming. Also, the presence of supercritical CO2 increased the
   solubility of supercritical N-2 in PS, so the concentration of dissolved
   supercritical N-2 was higher than the prediction by the simple mixing
   rule. The additional supercritical N-2 further increased the cell
   nucleation performance. These results provide valuable directions to
   identify the optimal supercritical CO2-N-2 composition for the foaming
   of PS to replace the hazardous blowing agents which are commonly used
   despite their high flammability or ozone depleting characteristics. (C)

Abstract = {{We describe here a bioreactor capable of applying electrical field
   stimulation in conjunction with static strain and on-line force of
   contraction measurements. It consisted of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
   tissue chamber and a pneumatically driven stretch platform. The chamber
   contained eight tissue microwells (8.05 mm in length and 2.5 mm in
   width) with a pair of posts (2.78 mm in height and 0.8 mm in diameter)
   in each well to serve as fixation points and for measurements of
   contraction force. Carbon rods, stimulating electrodes, were placed into
   the PDMS chamber such that one pair stimulated four microwells. For
   feasibility studies, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were seeded in collagen
   gels into the microwells. Following 3 days of gel compaction, electrical
   field stimulation at 3-4 V cm(-1) and 1 Hz, mechanical stimulation of
   5\% static strain or electromechanical stimulation (field stimulation at
   3-4 V cm(-1), 1 Hz and 5\% static strain) were applied for 3 days.
   Cardiac microtissues subjected to electromechanical stimulation
   exhibited elevated amplitude of contraction and improved sarcomere
   structure as evidenced by sarcomeric a-actinin, actin and troponin T
   staining compared to microtissues subjected to electrical or mechanical
   stimulation alone or non-stimulated controls. The expression of atrial
   natriuretic factor and brain natriuretic peptide was also elevated in
   the electromechanically stimulated group.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous solutions combining multiple Keggin type polyoxometalates (POMs)
   were used to modify multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in order to
   fabricate composite electrodes for electrochemical capacitors (ECs).
   Electrodes modified with a mixture of PMO12O403-(PMo) and SiW12O404-
   (SiW) demonstrated electrochemical behavior very similar to that of a
   pure PMo electrode. However, a mixture of PMo with PW12O403- (PW)
   appeared to exhibit a synergistic effect such that the modified
   electrodes displayed very different characteristic redox behavior from
   either of their pure components. The mixed PMo/PW-coated electrode
   showed five times the volumetric capacitance of the bare MWCNT and a
   much more close to ideal capacitive cyclic voltammogram (CV) as compared
   to that of either PMo or PW alone. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Complex networks are becoming an integral tool for our understanding of
   an enormous variety of natural and artificial systems. A number of
   human-designed network generation procedures have been proposed that
   reasonably model specific real-life phenomena in structure and dynamics.
   Consequently, breakthroughs in genetics, medicine, epidemiology,
   neuroscience, telecommunications, and the social sciences have recently
   resulted. A graph model is an algorithm capable of constructing
   arbitrarily sized networks, whose end structure will exhibit certain
   statistical and structural properties. The process of deriving an
   accurate graph model is very time intensive and challenging and may only
   yield highly accurate models for very specific phenomena. An automated
   approach based on genetic programming was recently proposed by the
   authors. However, this initial system suffered from a number of
   drawbacks, including an under-emphasis on creating hub vertices, the
   requirement of user intervention to determine objective weights, and the
   arbitrary approach toward selecting the most representative model from a
   population of candidate models. In this paper, we propose solutions to
   these problems and show experimentally that the new system represents a
   significant improvement and is very capable of reproducing existing
   common graph models from even a single small initial network.}},

   operating in a thermal buffer zone}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{149-159}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Air-source heat pumps (ASHPs) are commonly used in temperate climates
   throughout Europe and Asia to provide energy efficient heating and
   cooling. However, ASHPs have not been widely adopted for heating in
   colder climates because the coefficient of performance (COP) is lower
   when outdoor temperatures are colder. While many researchers are working
   on improving the cold-temperature performance ofASHPs by altering the
   design of the equipment, this work examines an innovative way to improve
   performance by operating an existing `off-the-shelf ASHP within a
   thermal buffer zone. This paper shows that operating an ASHP in a
   thermal buffer zone (TBZ) created by an enclosed balcony space can
   improve the COP in cold temperatures. An ASHP operating in a TBZ was
   tested in a climate chamber where the performance was monitored under a
   variety of climatic conditions. The temperature drawdown of the TBZ and
   the associated impact on the COP were observed. The TBZ solar heat gain
   rates required to improve the COP were identified for a range of
   exterior temperatures. Then, a suite-based energy model was developed
   and calibrated to simulate the performance of the ASHP operating in the
   TBZ. The model provided a reasonable prediction of the ASHP performance
   below 10 degrees C. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This letter investigates the abnormal OFF-current behavior induced by
   hot carrier stress (HCS) in p-channel double diffused drain

   the drain-side corners of the high-voltage n-well (HVNW) adjacent to the
   STI trench is stronger than the electric field in the channel center in
   width direction. Moreover, because a nitride layer acts as a buffer in
   STI, the electrons generated by impact ionization at the corners of the
   HVNW can be easily trapped in the nitride layer or at the liner
   oxide/nitride layer interface. Furthermore, the extension of electron
   trapping in STI from drain to source during HCS forms the OFF-current
   conductive path. Based on the charge pumping measurements at different
   operation conditions, this path formation is further demonstrated by the
   comparisons of charge pumping measurements between initial state and

Title = {{Noise, sampling, and the number of projections in cone-beam CT with a
   flat-panel detector}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the effect of the number of projection views on
   image noise in cone-beam CT (CBCT) with a flat-panel detector.
   Methods: This fairly fundamental consideration in CBCT system design and
   operation was addressed experimentally (using a phantom presenting a
   uniform medium as well as statistically motivated ``clutter{''}) and
   theoretically (using a cascaded systems model describing CBCT noise) to
   elucidate the contributing factors of quantum noise (sigma(Q)),
   electronic noise (sigma(E)), and view aliasing (sigma(view)). Analysis
   included investigation of the noise, noise-power spectrum, and
   modulation transfer function as a function of the number of projections
   (N-proj), dose (D-tot), and voxel size (b(vox)).
   Results: The results reveal a nonmonotonic relationship between image
   noise and N-proj at fixed total dose: for the CBCT system considered,
   noise decreased with increasing N-proj due to reduction of view sampling
   effects in the regime N-proj <similar to 200, above which noise
   increased with N-proj due to increased electronic noise. View sampling
   effects were shown to depend on the heterogeneity of the object in a
   direct analytical relationship to power-law anatomical clutter of the
   form kappa/f(beta)-and a general model of individual noise components
   (sigma(Q), sigma(E), and sigma(view)) demonstrated agreement with
   measurements over a broad range in N-proj, D-tot, and b(vox).
   Conclusions: The work elucidates fairly basic elements of CBCT noise in
   a manner that demonstrates the role of distinct noise components (viz.,
   quantum, electronic, and view sampling noise). For configurations fairly
   typical of CBCT with a flat-panel detector (FPD), the analysis reveals a
   ``sweet spot{''} (i.e., minimum noise) in the range N-proj similar to
   250-350, nearly an order of magnitude lower in N-proj than typical of
   multidetector CT, owing to the relatively high electronic noise in FPDs.
   The analysis explicitly relates view aliasing and quantum noise in a
   manner that includes aspects of the object ({''}clutter{''}) and imaging
   chain (including nonidealities of detector blur and electronic noise) to
   provide a more rigorous basis for commonly held intuition and heurism in
   CBCT system design and operation. (C) 2014 American Association of

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{616-626}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In the present study a parallel three dimensional Volume of Fluid (VOF)
   method is developed to simulate Marangoni convection in immiscible
   fluids with variable surface tension. Conservation equations are solved
   based on cell-averaged one-field volume tracking scheme. Evaluating the
   convective term in the energy equation along the boundary between the
   fluids highly depends on the position and orientation of the interface;
   hence, using average cell values simply ignores the interface shape and
   leads to computational uncertainty. As a remedy to this issue, the
   original idea behind the volume tracking method is used not only to
   advect mass and momentum but also energy across cells. To verify the
   proposed algorithm, results are compared against theoretically predicted
   thermocapillary migration velocity of a droplet at the limit of zero
   Marangoni number. However, at relatively high Marangoni numbers, thermal
   boundary layers are very thin and challenging to resolve. To demonstrate
   the capabilities of the heat transfer module, simulation of a Fluorinert
   droplet moving in silicon oil under applied temperature gradient is
   compared against the available experimental results and the migration
   velocity of the droplet in microgravity is reported. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{The role of local strains from prior cold work on stress corrosion
   cracking of alpha-brass in Mattsson's solution}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{127-137}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The dynamic strain rate ahead of a crack tip formed during stress
   corrosion cracking (SCC) under a static load is assumed to arise from
   the crack propagation. The strain surrounding the crack tip would be
   redistributed as the crack grows, thereby having the effect of dynamic
   strain. Recently, several studies have shown cold work to cause
   accelerated crack growth rates during SCC, and the slip-dissolution
   mechanism has been widely applied to account for this via a supposedly
   increased crack-tip strain rate in cold worked material. While these
   interpretations consider cold work as a homogeneous effect, dislocations
   are generated inhomogeneously within the microstructure during cold
   work. The presence of grain boundaries results in dislocation pile-ups
   that cause local strain concentrations. The local strains generated from
   cold working a-brass by tensile elongation were characterized using
   electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The role of these local strains
   in SCC was studied by measuring the strain distributions from the same
   regions of the sample before cold work, after cold work, and after SCC.
   Though, the cracks did not always initiate or propagate along boundaries
   with pre-existing local strains from the applied cold work, the local
   strains surrounding the cracked boundaries had contributions from both
   the crack propagation and the prior cold work. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Journal = {{MICRON}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{62-69}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Alloy 800 (Fe-21Cr-33Ni) has been found susceptible to cracking in acid
   sulfate environments, but the mechanism is not well understood. Alloy
   800 C-ring samples were exposed to an acid sulfate environment at 315 C
   and cracks were found with depths in excess of 300 pm after 60 h.
   Preparation of a TEM sample containing crack tips is challenging, but
   the ability to perform high-resolution microscopy at the crack tip would
   lend insight to the mechanism of acid sulfate stress corrosion cracking
   (AcSCC). The lift-out technique combined with a focused ion beam sample
   preparation was used to extract a crack tip along the cross-section of
   an acid sulfate crack in an Alloy 800 C-ring. TEM elemental analysis was
   done using EDS and EELS which identified a duplex oxide within the
   crack; an inner oxide consisting of a thin 3-4 nm Cr-rich oxide and an
   outer oxide enriched in Fe and Cr. Preliminary conclusions and
   hypotheses resulted with respect to the mechanism of AcSCC in Alloy 800.

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1438-1449}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Molecular therapeutics often require an effective nanoparticle-based
   delivery strategy to transport them to cytosolic organelles to be
   functional. Recently, a cytosolic delivery strategy based on the
   scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) mediated pathway has shown
   great potential for the effective delivery of theranostics agents into
   the cytoplasm of cells without detrimental endosomal entrapment. This
   study elucidates this unique delivery mechanism for improving cytosolic
   drug delivery.
   Multifluorophore-labeled HDL-mimicking peptide phospholipid scaffold
   (HPPS) nanoparticles were developed. Fluorescence imaging was utilized
   to examine HPPS transporting payloads into cells step by step through
   sequential inhibition studies.
   HPPS specifically recognizes and binds to SR-BI, then interacts with
   SR-BI, which results in direct transport of payload molecules into the
   cell cytoplasm without entire particles internalization. The cytosolic
   transport of payloads occurred through a temperature- and
   energy-independent pathway, and was also different from actin- and
   clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, this transport was
   significantly inhibited by disruption of lipid rafts using filipin or
   methyl-beta-cyclodextrin.
   The cytosolic delivery of payloads by HPPS via SR-BI targeting is
   predominately mediated through a lipid rafts/caveolae-like pathway. This
   cytosolic delivery strategy can be utilized for transporting molecular
   therapeutics that require their action sites to be within cytosolic
   organelles to enhance therapeutic effect.}},

Abstract = {{To optimize the slice thickness/overlap parameters for image
   reconstruction and to study the effect of iterative reconstruction (IR)
   on detectability and characterization of small non-calcified pulmonary
   nodules during low-dose thoracic CT.
   Data was obtained from computer simulations, phantom, and patient CTs.
   Simulations and phantom CTs were performed with 9 nodules (5, 8, and 10
   mm with 100, -630, and -800 HU). Patient data were based on 11 ground
   glass opacities (GGO) and 9 solid nodules. For each analysis the nodules
   were reconstructed with filtered back projection and IR algorithms using
   10 different combinations of slice thickness/overlap (0.5-5 mm). The
   attenuation (CT\#) and the contrast to noise ratio (CNR) were measured.
   Spearman's coefficient was used to correlate the error in CT\#
   measurements and slice thickness. Paired Student's t test was used to
   measure the significance of the errors.
   CNR measurements: CNR increases with increasing slice thickness/overlap
   for large nodules and peaks at 4.0/2.0 mm for smaller ones. Use of IR
   increases the CNR of GGOs by 60 \%.
   CT\# measurements: Increasing slice thickness/overlap above 3.0/1.5 mm
   results in decreased CT\# measurement accuracy.
   Optimal detection of small pulmonary nodules requires slice
   thickness/overlap of 4.0/2.0 mm. Slice thickness/overlap of 2.0/2.0 mm
   is required for optimal nodule characterization. IR improves conspicuity
   of small ground glass nodules through a significant increase in nodule
   CNR.

   nodule detection and characterization.
   aEuro cent Slice thickness a parts per thousand yen3 mm increases the
   risk of misclassifying small nodules.

Abstract = {{In this paper, the combined power management/design optimization problem
   is investigated for a fuel cell/Li-ion battery PHEV. Formulated as a
   constrained multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), the combined
   optimization problem simultaneously minimizes the vehicle cost and fuel
   consumption subject to the vehicle performance requirements. With an
   emphasis on developing a generic optimization algorithm to find the
   Pareto front for the synthesized MOP, the Pareto based multi-objective
   particle swarm optimization (PMOPSO) algorithm is developed, which
   solely depends on the concept of Pareto dominance. Three approaches are
   introduced to the PMOPSO method to address the constrained MOP. They
   are: (i) by incorporating system constraints in the original objective
   functions, the constrained MOP is transformed to an unconstrained MOP;
   (ii) to avoid being trapped in local minima, a disturbance operator with
   a decaying mutation possibility is introduced; (iii) to generate a

Abstract = {{Amber is a polymerized plant resin having remarkable preservation
   potential in the geological record. Numerous analytical techniques have
   been applied to the study of amber organic chemistry in order to extract
   paleobotanical information. However, only exploratory work has been
   conducted using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry
   (ToF-SIMS), despite its immense potential due to the high mass
   resolution and range that can be analyzed concurrently. Detailed
   assessments of ion fragmentation patterns are prerequisite, given that
   amber is comprised of a challenging range of terpenoids, carboxylic
   acids, alcohols, and associated esters. In recent work, we demonstrated
   the applicability and efficiency of ToF-SIMS as a tool to investigate
   amber chemical composition. However, only two diterpene resin acid
   standards were considered in this preliminary study, namely abietic acid
   and communic acid. We now extend this work by documenting the ToF-SIMS
   spectra of ten additional diterpene resin acids and ask whether ToF-SIMS
   analysis can distinguish subtle differences within a larger set of
   diterpenoids. Both positive and negative ToF-SIMS spectra were produced,
   although negative polarity appears particularly promising for
   differentiating diterpene resin acids. Principal component analysis
   (PCA) was used to distill the data and verified that purified diterpenes
   have distinct ToF-SIMS spectra that can be applied to amber
   chemotaxonomy as well as to the analysis of modern resins of known
   botanical origin. While this work is pertinent to the study of the
   composition and histories of ambers, the mass spectra of the 12
   diterpene standards could prove valuable to any system where diterpenoid
   chemistry plays a role. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring and control of primary cell cultures is challenging as they
   are heterogenous and dynamically complex systems. Feedback signaling
   proteins produced from off-target cell populations can accumulate,
   inhibiting the production of the desired cell populations. Although
   culture strategies have been developed to reduce feedback inhibition,
   they are typically optimized for a narrow range of process parameters
   and do not allow for a dynamically regulated response. Here we describe
   the development of a microbead-based process control system for the
   monitoring and control of endogenously produced signaling factors. This
   system uses quantum dot barcoded microbeads to assay endogenously
   produced signaling proteins in the culture media, allowing for the
   dynamic manipulation of protein concentrations. This monitoring system
   was incorporated into a fed-batch bioreactor to regulate the
   accumulation of TGF-1 in an umbilical cord blood cell expansion system.
   By maintaining the concentration of TGF-1 below an upper threshold
   throughout the culture, we demonstrate enhanced ex vivo expansion of
   hematopoietic progenitor cells at higher input cell densities and over
   longer culture periods. This study demonstrates the potential of a fully
   automated and integrated real-time control strategy in stem cell culture
   systems, and provides a powerful strategy to achieve highly regulated
   and intensified in vitro cell manufacturing systems. Biotechnol. Bioeng.

Abstract = {{The Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA)
   Consortium is a collaborative network of researchers working together on
   a range of large-scale studies that integrate data from 70 institutions
   worldwide. Organized into Working Groups that tackle questions in
   neuroscience, genetics, and medicine, ENIGMA studies have analyzed
   neuroimaging data from over 12,826 subjects. In addition, data from
   12,171 individuals were provided by the CHARGE consortium for
   replication of findings, in a total of 24,997 subjects. By
   meta-analyzing results from many sites, ENIGMA has detected factors that
   affect the brain that no individual site could detect on its own, and
   that require larger numbers of subjects than any individual neuroimaging
   study has currently collected. ENIGMA's first project was a genome-wide
   association study identifying common variants in the genome associated
   with hippocampal volume or intracranial volume. Continuing work is
   exploring genetic associations with subcortical volumes (ENIGMA2) and
   white matter microstructure (ENIGMA-DTI). Working groups also focus on
   understanding how schizophrenia, bipolar illness, major depression and
   attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affect the brain. We
   review the current progress of the ENIGMA Consortium, along with
   challenges and unexpected discoveries made on the way.}},

Abstract = {{The notch toughness of cold-formed rectangular hollow sections (RHS), at
   low temperatures or in dynamic loading applications, has been a concern
   in North America for some time. For the assessment of notch toughness of
   RHS, steel product standards normally require testing of Charpy V-notch
   (CVN) coupons taken longitudinally from one of the flat faces not
   containing the weld. This tends to lead to the most optimistic notch
   toughness result for the cross-section. Thus, serious consideration must
   be given to the notch toughness of the corner and weld seam regions when
   low temperature or dynamic loading is a design criterion. In this study,
   a total of 378 CVN coupons were tested and complete CVN
   toughness-temperature curves were generated for the flat face, corner
   and weld seam regions of six North American RHS, to study the effects of
   cold-forming, heat treatment, cross-sectional geometry and welding on
   the CVN toughness around the cross-section of RHS. In particular, the
   CVN toughness properties of RHS cold-formed by different methods
   (direct-forming versus continuous-forming) were directly compared for
   the first time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Cerebral Palsy}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Virtual reality (VR)-based therapy for motor rehabilitation
   of children with cerebral palsy (CP) is growing in prevalence. Although
   mainstream active videogames typically offer children an appealing user
   experience, they are not designed for therapeutic relevance. Conversely,
   rehabilitation-specific games often struggle to provide an immersive
   experience that sustains interest. This study aims to design and
   evaluate two VR-based therapy games for upper and lower limb
   rehabilitation and to evaluate their efficacy with dual focus on
   therapeutic relevance and user experience.
   Materials and Methods: Three occupational therapists, three
   physiotherapists, and eight children (8-12 years old), with CP Level
   I-III on the Gross Motor Function Classification System, evaluated two
   games for the Microsoft (R) (Redmond, WA) Kinect (TM) for Windows and
   completed the System Usability Scale (SUS), Physical Activity Enjoyment
   Scale (PACES), and custom feedback questionnaires.
   Results: Children and therapists unanimously agreed on the enjoyment and
   therapeutic value of the games. Median scores on the PACES were high
   (6.24-0.95 on the 7-point scale). Therapists considered the system to be
   of average usability (50th percentile on the SUS). The most prevalent
   usability issue was detection errors distinguishing the child's
   movements from the supporting therapist's. The ability to adjust
   difficulty settings and to focus on targeted goals (e.g., elbow/shoulder
   extension, weight shifting) was highly valued by therapists.
   Conclusions: Engaging both therapists and children in a user-centered
   design approach enabled the development of two VR-based therapy games
   for upper and lower limb rehabilitation that are dually (a) engaging to
   the child and (b) therapeutically relevant.}},

   functional theory-based gas physisorption}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{47-56}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Nanoporous carbon materials have a wide range of applications in
   environmental and sustainable energy fields. Accurate quantification of
   micropores (<2 nm) is essential to understanding and optimizing the
   performance of carbon materials in applications such as supercapacitors.
   To quantify micropores in carbon materials, the gas physisorption
   technique remains the most common. Despite its long history and
   popularity, the technique is still developing due to the recent progress
   in applying density functional theory (DFT) models to physisorption.
   Because of the complex nature of DFT, it remains a challenging task to
   accurately characterize porous structures of nanoporous carbons. In this
   work we use four distinct carbon samples and quantify the uncertainties
   associated with the DFT models. We demonstrate that more accurate
   interpretation of pore sizes in nanoporous carbons can be achieved by
   selecting the appropriate DFT kernels and adsorbates. We propose a
   procedure that joins two sets of pore size distribution (PSD) data
   provided by application of two DFT models (non-local DFT and quenched
   solid DFT) while using two adsorbates (N-2 and CO2), respectively. It is
   hoped that this paper will serve as a practical guide for researchers
   who use the gas physisorption technique and consider adopting the DFT
   model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 29}},
Abstract = {{Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) has
   been demonstrated in both laboratories and field tests using attenuated
   lasers combined with the decoy-state technique. Although researchers
   have studied various decoy-state MDI-QKD protocols with two or three
   decoy states, a clear comparison between these protocols is still
   missing. This invokes the question of how many types of decoy states are
   needed for practical MDI-QKD. Moreover, the system parameters to
   implement decoy-state MDI-QKD are only partially optimized in all
   previous works, which casts doubt on the actual performance of former
   demonstrations. Here, we present analytical and numerical decoy-state
   methods with one, two, and three decoy states. We provide a clear
   comparison among these methods and find that two decoy states already
   enable a near-optimal estimation and more decoy states cannot improve
   the key rate much in either asymptotic or finite-data settings.
   Furthermore, we perform a full optimization of system parameters and
   show that full optimization can significantly improve the key rate in
   the finite-data setting. By simulating a real experiment, we find that
   full optimization can increase the key rate by more than one order of
   magnitude compared to nonoptimization. A local search method to optimize
   efficiently the system parameters is proposed. This method can be four
   orders of magnitude faster than a trivial exhaustive search to achieve a
   similar optimal key rate. We expect that this local search method could
   be valuable for general fields in physics.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents an investigation on walking-trip generation for
   commuting. It uses advanced econometric models to investigate the
   importance of considering walking distance jointly with walking
   propensity in the walking-trip-generation models. Empirical models are
   estimated by using large-scale household travel survey data collected in
   the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) in 1996, 2001 and 2006.
   Empirical models clearly validate the proposal that for walking, travel
   distance should be considered jointly with the propensity. The
   relationship between auto-ownership and walking-trip generation is
   proved to be very strong, referring that high auto-dependent household

   the baseline walking propensity and distance remain unchanged over the
   years despite significant efforts to encourage active transportation
   through mixed land-use policies in the GTHA. This implies that, in
   addition to land-use policies, more rigorous applications of public

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAY 27}},
Abstract = {{Nucleation and propagation of a shear fault is known to be the result of
   interaction and coalescence of many microcracks. Yet the character and
   rate of the microcracks' interactions, and their dependence on the
   three-dimensional stress state are poorly understood. Here we
   investigate formation of microcracks during sandstone faulting under
   3D-polyaxial stress fields by analyzing multi-stationary acoustic
   waveforms. We show that in a true three-dimensional stress state (a)
   faulting forms in a orthorhombic pattern, and (b) the emitted acoustic
   waveforms from microcracking carry a shorter rapid slip phase. The later
   is associated with microcracking that dominantly develops parallel to
   the minimum stress direction. Our results imply that due to inducing the
   micro-anticracks, the three-dimensional (3D) stress state can quicken
   dynamic weakening and rupture propagation by a factor of two relatively
   to simpler stress states. The results suggest a new nucleation mechanism
   of 3D-faulting with implications for earthquakes' instabilities, as well
   as the understanding of avalanches associated with dislocations.}},

Title = {{A continuum model with a percolation threshold and tunneling-assisted
   interfacial conductivity for carbon nanotube-based nanocomposites}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{MAY 21}},
Abstract = {{A continuum model that possesses several desirable features of the
   electrical conduction process in carbon-nanotube (CNT) based
   nanocomposites is developed. Three basic elements are included: (i)
   percolation threshold, (ii) interface effects, and (iii)
   tunneling-assisted interfacial conductivity. We approach the first one
   through the selection of an effective medium theory. We approach the
   second one by the introduction of a diminishing layer of interface with
   an interfacial conductivity to build a ``thinly coated{''} CNT. The
   third one is introduced through the observation that interface
   conductivity can be enhanced by electron tunneling which in turn can be
   facilitated with the formation of CNT networks. We treat this last issue
   in a continuum fashion by taking the network formation as a statistical
   process that can be represented by Cauchy's probability density
   function. The outcome is a simple and yet widely useful model that can
   simultaneously capture all these fundamental characteristics. It is
   demonstrated that, without considering the interface effect, the
   predicted conductivity would be too high, and that, without accounting
   for the additional contribution from the tunneling-assisted interfacial
   conductivity, the predicted conductivity beyond the percolation
   threshold would be too low. It is with the consideration of all three
   elements that the theory can fully account for the experimentally
   measured data. We further use the developed model to demonstrate that,
   despite the anisotropy of the intrinsic CNT conductivity, it is its
   axial component along the CNT direction that dominates the overall
   conductivity. This theory is also proved that, even with a totally
   insulating matrix, it is still capable of delivering non-zero
   conductivity beyond the percolation threshold. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{The use of enhanced in situ anaerobic bioremediation (EISB) and
   bioaugmentation in fractured bedrock is limited compared to its use in
   granular media. We evaluated EISB for the treatment of trichloroethene
   (TCE)-impacted groundwater in fractured carbonate rock at a site in
   Southern Ontario, Canada, with cool average groundwater temperature
   (similar to 13 degrees C). Borehole-connectivity, contaminant
   concentrations, and groundwater properties were investigated. Changes in
   dechlorinating and nondechlorinating populations (fermenters, acetogens,
   methanogens, and sulfate reducers) were assessed via quantitative PCR
   (qPCR). During biostimulation with ethanol, concentrations of TCE
   daughter products cis-dichloroethene (cDCE) and vinyl chloride (VC)
   decreased in association with an enrichment of vcrA (VC reductive
   dehalogenase)-carrying Dehalococcoides, whereas ethene production was
   only moderate. Following bioaugmentation with the mixed dechlorinating
   culture KB-1, greater concentrations of chloride-a product of
   dechlorination-was observed in most wells; in addition, ethene
   production increased significantly in monitoring well locations that had
   strong hydraulic connectivity to the groundwater recirculation system,
   while Dehalococcoides and vcrA concentrations did not appreciably vary.
   Interestingly, increases of 3-4 orders of magnitude of an
   ethanol-fermenting Bacteroidetes population also present in KB-1 were
   correlated to improved conversion to ethene, an observation which
   suggests there could be a causal relationship-for example, better
   syntrophy and/or synergy among bacterial populations.}},

Title = {{Establishment of a Lung Metastatic Breast Tumor Xenograft Model in Nude
   Rats}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Larger animal models provide relevant tumor burden in the
   development of advanced clinical imaging methods for non-invasive cancer
   detection and diagnosis, and are especially valuable for studying
   metastatic disease. Most available experimental models, however, are
   based on immune-compromised mice. To lay the foundation for studying
   spontaneous metastasis using non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI), this study aims to establish a highly metastatic breast cancer
   xenograft model in nude rats.
   Materials and Methods: A highly metastatic variant of human
   adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 known as LM2 was inoculated into nude rats.
   Orthotopic and subcutaneous (flank) sites were compared, with half of
   the orthotopic injections guided by ultrasound imaging. MRI with
   gadolinium contrast administration was performed weekly beginning on Day
   6 and ending on Day 104. Excised tumors were assessed on histology using
   hematoxylin and eosin and CD34. Fisher's exact test was used to compare
   successful tumor induction amongst different inoculation methods.
   Results: Primary LM2 tumors were established orthotopically in all cases
   under ultrasound-guided injection, and none otherwise (p = 0.0028).
   Contrast-enhanced MRI revealed rapidly progressing tumors that reached
   critical size (15 mm diameter) in 2 to 3 weeks after inoculation. MRI
   and histology findings were consistent: LM2 tumors were characterized by
   low vascularity confined to the tumor rim and large necrotic cores with
   increasing interstitial fluid pressure.
   Conclusions: The metastatic LM2 breast tumor model was successfully
   established in the mammary fat pads of nude rats, using ultrasound
   needle guidance as a non-invasive alternative to surgery. This platform
   lays the foundation for future development and application of MRI to
   study spontaneous metastasis and different stages throughout the
   metastatic cascade.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{244}},
Pages = {{483-492}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a possible industrial scale design for biologically
   inspired (bioinspired) `green' production of precipitated silica using
   either batch or continuous processing. This design allowed a comparison
   based on the economic and environmental factors between the proposed
   green process and an existing process for the production of precipitated
   silica. The proposed green process uses an additive which allows rapid
   silica formation to occur in laboratory experiments in less than five
   minutes at room temperature and neutral pH. The green process hence
   offers significant advantages in terms of production capacity and no
   heat requirements, therefore reducing both running costs and carbon
   dioxide emissions. From the preliminary feasibility study reported
   herein, it appears that the green route may prove economically
   comparative to current processing techniques, especially noting that
   this process can be easily adapted to unit operations in the existing
   silica production, without the need for additional capital investment. A
   sensitivity analysis was conducted which identified that the most
   crucial factors affecting the process economics were the raw material
   costs and the conversion. Furthermore, we have examined and compared
   properties of commercially available precipitated silica samples with
   those obtained by the green process. It appears that the green method
   provides an additional advantage: it can create products with a much
   more diverse range of properties, which can be readily controlled, thus
   allowing them to enter new and unique markets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the first implementation of polarization encoding
   measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), which
   is immune to all detector side-channel attacks. Active phase
   randomization of each individual pulse is implemented to protect against
   attacks on imperfect sources. By optimizing the parameters in the decoy
   state protocol, we show that it is feasible to implement polarization
   encoding MDI-QKD with commercial off-the-shelf devices. A rigorous
   finite key analysis is applied to estimate the secure key rate. Our work
   paves the way for the realization of a MDI-QKD network, in which the
   users only need compact and low-cost state-preparation devices and can
   share complicated and expensive detectors provided by an untrusted
   network server.}},

Journal = {{CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2847-2855}},
Month = {{MAY 13}},
Abstract = {{Polymeric nanoparticle micelles typically comprise amphiphilic block
   copolymers, having a hydrophobic core that is useful for
   chemotherapeutic encapsulation, and a hydrophilic corona for aqueous
   stability. Formulations often require the use of excipients to overcome
   poor particle stability, yet these excipients can be cytotoxic. In order
   to create a stable polymeric nanoparticle micelle without the use of
   excipients, we investigate a series of amphiphilic polymers where the
   hydrophobic core composition and molar mass is maintained and the
   hydrophilic corona is varied. With the graft copolymer,
   poly(D,L-lactide-co-2-methyl-2-carboxy-trimethylenecarbonate)-g-poly(eth
   ylene glycol) (P(LA-co-TMCC)-g-PEG), we demonstrate how PEG density can
   be tuned to improve the stability of the resulting self-assembled
   micelle. Increased PEG density leads to micelles that resist aggregation
   during lyophilization, allowing resuspension in aqueous media with
   narrow distribution. Furthermore, high PEG density micelles resist
   dissociation in serum protein containing media, with almost no
   dissociation seen in serum after 72 h. By changing the number of PEG
   chains per polymer backbone from 0.5 to 6, we observe increased
   stability of the nanoparticle micelles. All formulations are
   cytocompatible, as measured with MDA-MB-231 cells, and show no evidence
   for hemolysis, as measured with red blood cells. Importantly, PEG
   density does not impact drug loading within the nanoparticle micelle
   core, as demonstrated with the potent chemotherapeutic drug, docetaxel,
   confirming the role of the hydrophobic core for encapsulation. The
   surface properties of the polymeric nanoparticle micelles can thus be
   selectively modulated by variation in PEG density, which in turn
   influences stability, obviates the need for excipients and provides key
   insights into the design of drug delivery platforms.}},

Abstract = {{An error-in-variables-model (EVM) framework is presented for the optimal

   experiments, (c) full conversion range experiments and estimation of
   optimal reactivity ratios, and if necessary, (d) design of sequentially
   optimal experiments and re-estimation of reactivity ratios and
   diagnostic checks. This complete methodology should become common
   practice for determining reactivity ratios with the highest possible
   level of confidence. The performance of this framework is verified

Abstract = {{We propose a continuous-variable measurement-device-independent quantum

   derived based on the fact that the entanglement-based scheme of CV-MDI
   QKD is equivalent to the conventional CV QKD with coherent states and
   heterodyne detection. We find that the maximal total transmission
   distance is achieved by setting the untrusted third party close to one
   of the legitimate users. Furthermore, an alternate detection scheme, a
   special application of CV-MDI QKD, is proposed to enhance the security
   of the standard CV QKD system.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing use of nanomaterials raises concerns about the long-term
   effects of chronic nanoparticle exposure on human health. However,
   nanoparticle exposure is difficult to evaluate non-invasively using
   current measurement techniques. Here we show that the skin is an
   important site of nanoparticle accumulation following systemic
   administration. Mice injected with high doses of gold nanoparticles have
   visibly blue skin while quantum dot-treated animals fluoresce under
   ultraviolet excitation. More importantly, elemental analysis of excised
   skin correlates with the injected dose and nanoparticle accumulation in
   the liver and spleen. We propose that skin analysis may be a simple
   strategy to quantify systemic nanoparticle exposure and predict
   nanoparticle fate in vivo. Our results suggest that in the future,
   dermal accumulation may also be exploited to trigger the release of
   ultraviolet and visible light-sensitive therapeutics that are currently
   impractical in vivo due to limits in optical penetration of tissues at
   these wavelengths.}},

Title = {{Engineering colloidal quantum dot solids within and beyond the
   mobility-invariant regime}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dots are attractive materials for efficient, low-cost
   and facile implementation of solution-processed optoelectronic devices.
   Despite impressive mobilities (1-30 cm(2)V(-1) s(-1)) reported for new
   classes of quantum dot solids, it is-surprisingly-the much
   lower-mobility (10(-3)-10(-2) cm(2) V(-1)s(-1)) solids that have
   produced the best photovoltaic performance. Here we show that it is not
   mobility, but instead the average spacing among recombination centres
   that governs the diffusion length of charges in today's quantum dot
   solids. In this regime, colloidal quantum dot films do not benefit from
   further improvements in charge carrier mobility. We develop a device
   model that accurately predicts the thickness dependence and diffusion
   length dependence of devices. Direct diffusion length measurements
   suggest the solid-state ligand exchange procedure as a potential origin
   of the detrimental recombination centres. We then present a novel avenue
   for in-solution passivation with tightly bound chlorothiols that retain
   passivation from solution to film, achieving an 8.5\% power conversion
   efficiency.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{We generalize the standard method of solving inverse optimization
   problems to allow for the solution of inverse problems that would
   otherwise be ill posed or infeasible. In multiobjective linear
   optimization, given a solution that is not a weakly efficient solution
   to the forward problem, our method generates objective function weights
   that make the given solution a near-weakly efficient solution. Our
   generalized inverse optimization model specializes to the standard model
   when the given solution is weakly efficient and retains the complexity
   of the underlying forward problem. We provide a novel interpretation of
   our inverse formulation as the dual of the well-known Benson's method
   and by doing so develop a new connection between inverse optimization
   and Pareto surface approximation techniques. We apply our method to
   prostate cancer data obtained from Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in
   Toronto, Canada. We demonstrate that clinically acceptable treatments
   can be generated using a small number of objective functions and
   inversely optimized weights-current treatments are designed using a
   complex formulation with a large parameter space in a trial-and-error
   reoptimization process. We also show that our method can identify
   objective functions that are most influential in treatment plan
   optimization.}},

Abstract = {{This work seeks to address two questions in cooperative OFDMA networks:
   First, how network coding based cooperative diversity can be exploited
   effectively when overhearing is not readily available. Second, how to
   realize various forms of gains available, including multi-user
   diversity, cooperative diversity, and network coding. The main
   contribution of this paper is an unifying network utility maximization
   framework that jointly considers relay assignment, relay strategy
   selection, channel assignment and power allocation. We formulate the
   optimization problem both with and without XOR-CD, a simple XOR-assisted
   cooperative diversity scheme. We show that the optimization of physical
   layer resource allocation with XOR-CD is equivalent to a weighted 3-set
   packing problem, which is NP-complete, and can be efficiently solved
   with provably the best approximation factor. Without XOR-CD, the problem
   reduces to a weighted bipartite matching problem which can be optimally
   solved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hardware architecture for efficient implementation
   of the well equidistributed long-period linear (WELL) algorithm. Our
   design achieves a throughput of one sample-per-cycle and runs as fast as
   423 MHz on a Xilinx XC5VFX130T field-programmable gate array (FPGA)
   device. This performance is 7.1-fold faster than a dedicated software
   implementation. The proposed architecture is also implemented on
   targeting different devices for the comparison of other types of
   pseudorandom number generators. In addition, we design a
   software/hardware framework that is capable of dividing the WELL stream
   into an arbitrary number of independent parallel substreams. With
   support from software, this framework can obtain speedup roughly
   proportional to the number of parallel cores. The sequences produced by
   the single design are verified to be consistent with the standard
   software generator. In addition, the statistical tests of interleaved
   sequences are also performed to check for correlations between different
   substreams of the parallel framework. We apply our framework to two
   applications. Experimental results verify the correctness of our
   framework as well as the better characteristics of the WELL algorithm
   compared with the Mersenne Twister method.}},

Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes an electrochemical etching technique to fabricate
   tungsten tips. Tips combining well-defined conical shape, a length as
   large as 2 mm, and sharpness with a radius of curvature of around 20 nm
   are fabricated using the proposed technique. These tips are needed in a
   variety of applications including multipoint contact measurements and
   nanomanipulation. The technique consists of three steps: the first is
   static etching, which creates a neck-in phenomenon on the wire; the
   second is dynamic etching, where the wire is oscillated up and down in
   the solution to form a long conical shape; finally, static etching is
   applied again to break the wire, and thus, sharp tips are produced. The
   best operating conditions of the process were experimentally obtained.
   These factors include the position of the cathode, the length of the
   immersed wire, and the applied voltage. The effects of these factors on
   the etching current and tip fidelity were also examined based on the
   measured etching current. In particular, the position of the cathode
   determines the strength of the electrical field near the air/solution
   interface; the immersed wire depth determines mainly the equivalent
   resistance of the process and thus controls the etching current; and the
   applied voltage defines the etching rate of the wire. (C) 2014 American

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the bifurcation and chaos of an axially
   accelerating viscoelastic beam in the supercritical regime. For the
   first time, the nonlinear dynamics of the system under consideration are
   studied via the high-order Galerkin truncation as well as the
   differential and integral quadrature method (DQM \& IQM). The speed of
   the axially moving beam is assumed to be comprised of a constant mean
   value along with harmonic fluctuations. The transverse vibrations of the
   beam are governed by a nonlinear integro-partial-differential equation,
   which includes the finite axial support rigidity and the longitudinally
   varying tension due to the axial acceleration. The Galerkin truncation
   and the DQM \& IQM are, respectively, applied to reduce the equation
   into a set of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the time
   history of the axially moving beam is numerically solved based on the
   fourth-order Runge-Kutta time discretization. Based on the numerical
   solutions, the phase portrait, the bifurcation diagrams and the initial

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to explore the relationship between products
   that mechanically transform and individual environmentally conscious
   behavior (ECB). Our qualitative study led to observations on how each of
   the three transformation principles, expand/collapse, expose/cover, and
   fuse/divide, specifically supports ECBs. As expected, expand/collapse
   enables better portability of products. Increased portability of
   reusable products (e.g., travel mugs and shopping bags) reduces reliance
   on their disposable counterparts. A less expected observation is that
   increased portability also increases the spontaneity by which ECBs could
   be carried out. While there are fewer ECB supporting products that
   incorporate the expose/cover principle, we believe that it enables one
   to include, yet hide potentially unaesthetic, features that support ECB
   in often-used or worn items. Finally, we found fuse/divide to enable
   portability beyond what is possible with expand/collapse alone.
   Fuse/divide may also make possible other product transport and reuse
   strategies. We conclude that mechanically transformable products support
   and enable ECBs, especially when existing infrastructure presents
   obstacles. Such products may increase the rate of participation in ECB,
   which then justifies improvements to the shortfalls in infrastructure
   for which they compensate.}},

Abstract = {{This report is an experimental study on the nano-powdering of fly ash
   and the improvement of cement performance by nano fly ash. Mortars with
   nano fly ash or nano-silica produced by a physical method are compared
   with mortar without a nano-binder. Mortar with nano-silica showed rapid
   setting. However, mortar with fly ash or nano fly ash exhibited delayed
   setting. The smaller the particle sizes, the higher is the compressive
   strength, demonstrating that mortar with nano fly ash shows superior
   performance with higher compressive strength from the beginning.
   Durability assessments revealed that chloride penetration resistance
   increased by 70\% for mortar with nano fly ash or nano-silica. This
   shows that mortar with a smaller particle binder has excellent
   carbonation resistance. Nano-powdering effectively enhances the
   activation of a pozzolanic reaction and provides densely charged
   effects. These changes solve the problem of initial strength reduction -
   the greatest weakness of fly ash.}},

Abstract = {{Quiet standing posture in humans has often been modeled as a single
   inverted pendulum pivoting around the ankle joint. However, recent
   studies have suggested that anti-phase action between leg and trunk
   segments plays a significant role in stabilizing posture by reducing the
   acceleration of the center of mass (COM) of the body. The aim of this
   study is to test the hypothesis that anti-phase action is attenuated in
   the elderly compared to the young. The anterior-posterior movements of
   leg and trunk segments were measured using 4 laser displacement sensors
   from 22 healthy young subjects (age range, 20-35 years) and 38 healthy
   elderly subjects (age range, 57-80 years) standing quietly for 30 s
   twice. To focus on the segmental action between trunk and legs, we
   applied constraints (i.e., wooden splints) on each segment. We found
   that the velocity and acceleration of the COM (standard deviation of the
   time series was evaluated) were significantly higher for the elderly
   subjects than for young subjects. The increase in the acceleration of
   the COM resulted not only from an increase in the angular acceleration
   of the segments but also from the reduction of their anti-phase
   relationship, as demonstrated by an index that quantifies the degree of
   cancelation between both segments. We conclude that the degree of anti-
   phase action between trunk and leg segments during quiet standing is
   smaller for elderly subjects than for young subjects, and that this
   change of the anti-phase action due to aging resulted in increased COM
   acceleration in the elderly subjects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights

   test-pieces such as pipe welds at elevated temperatures of up to 350
   degrees C. Wedges are built from plastics resistant to high-temperature
   degradation and equipped with a cooling jacket around the phased arrays.
   A model of the beam skew pattern due to thermal gradients inside a wedge
   is developed. The model demonstrates how the path of an ultrasonic wave
   will curve according to its alignment with the direction of the
   temperature gradient. The results may be used to modify an ultrasonic
   inspection plan to partially compensate for the effects of elevated

Abstract = {{Rate measurements, carried out after elimination of transport
   corruptions, show that CH3OH partial oxidation on Pt clusters proceeds
   via three distinctly different kinetic regimes defined by the operating
   oxidant-to-reductant (O-2-to-CH3OH) ratio. These kinetic regimes, each
   with unique rate dependencies for HCHO, HCOOCH3, and CO2 formation,
   arise from a dynamic shift in the identity and coverages of reactive
   intermediates on Pt cluster surfaces from saturated with chemisorbed
   oxygen, to uncovered, and then to partially covered with methanol
   derived species as the oxygen chemical potential at cluster surfaces
   decreases with decreasing O-2-to-CH3OH ratio. HCHO formation rates first
   remain insensitive to O-2 on Pt cluster surfaces saturated with
   chemisorbed oxygen (O{*}), then increase proportionally with O-2 as
   cluster surfaces depleted of oxygen and as unoccupied Pt sites become
   the most abundant surface intermediates, and eventually increase more
   than linearly with O-2 on Pt surfaces predominantly covered with CH3OH
   derived intermediates. The transition in rate dependence on O-2 is
   accompanied by a concomitant transition on CH3OH dependence: HCHO
   formation rates are linearly proportional to, then independent of, and
   eventually inhibited by CH3OH as the O-2-to-CH3OH ratio decreases.
   Similar transition in reaction orders is also found for HCOOCH3 and CO2
   formation. The first-order rate coefficient for CH3OH oxidation is a
   single-valued function of the operating O-2-to-CH3OH ratio, because the
   ratio determines the oxygen chemical potential at Pt cluster surfaces
   via the kinetic coupling of O-2 and CH3OH activation steps and, in turn,
   the identity and coverage of reactive intermediates, the nature and
   availability of active sites, and the identity of kinetically-relevant
   steps. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights. reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmonics has attracted a lot of interest in the past few years because
   of its unique features, especially for its ability to confine light in
   extremely small volumes. However, application of plasmonics is
   restricted by the large propagation loss associated with plasmonic
   waveguides. On the other hand, dielectric waveguides enjoy low loss,
   although the mode confinement is relatively weaker. Hybrid plasmonic
   waveguides (HPWGs), which combine these two guiding mechanisms, allow
   one to utilize the benefits of both technologies. Over the past few
   years there have been intense research activities around the world on
   this new guiding scheme. In this work the operating principle of HPWGs,
   various HPWG structures proposed by different research groups, and their
   potentail applications are reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Hand fractures represent a leading cause of morbidity in
   children. However, little information exists correlating the mechanisms
   and environment of injury with outcomes and treatments. We examine the
   demographics, etiology, anatomic location, mechanism, and management of
   pediatric hand fractures in our center's hand unit. Methods We conducted
   a prospective observational study on all children with acute hand
   fractures evaluated in the Plastic Surgery Emergency Clinic during a
   3-month period in 2010. Data pertaining to demographics, referral
   patterns, injury pattern, clinical outcomes, and other factors related
   to hand fractures were then analyzed and interpreted. Results Most
   children were referred by our institution's emergency department. More
   than 60\% were boys, and nearly half were between 10 and 15 years old.
   The right and left hands were injured at equal rates. Most of the
   injuries (90\%) occurred in the afternoon or evening. More than 85\%
   occurred in urban, rather than rural, environments. Crush injuries were
   the leading cause in toddlers, whereas sports-related injuries became
   the major cause of injury in older groups. Proximal phalanges were the
   most common bone injured, and the fifth digit was the most commonly
   injured digit. More than 80\% of the fractures were managed
   nonsurgically. Conclusions The pattern of pediatric hand fracture in
   different age groups is highlighted in this article. The observations
   from this study will hopefully encourage further review with a larger
   cohort and a focus on preventative measures for pediatric hand
   fractures.}},

Abstract = {{A series of new crystal structures for the boron subphthalocyanine
   (BsubPc) derivatives chloro hexachloro BsubPc (Cl-Cl(6)BsubPc), chloro
   dodecachloro BsubPc (Cl-Cl(12)BsubPc), bromo/chloro hexachloro BsubPc
   (Br0.27ICl0.73-Cl(6)BsubPc), bromo dodecachloro BsubPc
   (Br-Cl(12)BsubPc), and pentafluorophenoxy dodecachloro BsubPc
   (F5PhO-Cl(12)BsubPc) are reported. By combining these new crystal
   structures with a series of previously published structures into a
   comprehensive study, we have outlined several new structure crystal
   property/solid-state arrangement relationships for this expanded list of
   BsubPc derivatives. Parameters that were examined to establish the
   relationships include (a) geometric descriptors of the BsubPc molecular
   structure including the bowl shape of the BsubPcs; (b) molar density of
   the crystals; and (c) void volume fraction (Phi). Variations in the
   peripheral substituents (from hydrogen to fluorine and chlorine) were
   found to have a profound effect on the solid-state arrangement. No
   significant changes were noted when the axial substituent was varied
   from chlorine to bromine, whereas replacement of the axial halide with a
   pentafluorophenoxy fragment resulted in a notable change (as expected).
   It was also found that Cl-C(12)BsubPc (and its derivatives) had a high
   tendency to co-crystallize with solvents (form solvates), which resulted
   in a significantly different solid-state arrangement. We believe the
   observations detailed in this paper will lead to routes to engineer the
   crystallization of BsubPcs to facilitate tailored solid-state
   arrangement and properties.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avert potentially disastrous global
   climate change requires substantial redevelopment of infrastructure
   systems(1-4). Cities are recognized as key actors for leading such
   climate change mitigation efforts(6-10). We have studied the greenhouse
   gas inventories and underlying characteristics of 22 global cities.
   These cities differ in terms of their climates, income, levels of
   industrial activity, urban form and existing carbon intensity of
   electricity supply. Here we show how these differences in city
   characteristics lead to wide variations in the type of strategies that
   can be used for reducing emissions. Cities experiencing greater than
   similar to 1,500 heating degree days (below an 18 degrees C base), for
   example, will review building construction and retrofitting for cold
   climates. Electrification of infrastructure technologies is effective
   for cities where the carbon intensity of the grid is lower than similar
   to 600 tCO(2)e GWh(-1); whereas transportation strategies will differ
   between low urban density (< similar to 6,000 persons km(2)) and high
   urban density (> similar to 6,000 persons km(-2)) cities. As nation
   states negotiate targets and develop policies for reducing greenhouse
   gas emissions, attention to the specific characteristics of their cities
   will broaden and improve their suite of options. Beyond carbon pricing,
   markets and taxation, governments may develop policies and target
   spending towards low-carbon urban infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Recently we developed supervisor localization, a top-down approach to
   distributed control of discrete-event systems in the Ramadge-Wonham
   supervisory control framework. Its essence is the decomposition of
   monolithic (global) control action into local control strategies for
   individual agents. In this technical note, we establish a counterpart
   localization theory in the framework of State Tree Structures, known to
   be efficient for control design of very large systems. We prove that the
   collective localized control behavior is identical to the monolithic
   optimal (i.e. maximally permissive) and nonblocking controlled behavior.
   Further, we propose a new and more efficient localization algorithm
   which exploits BDD computation.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional power system security analysis based on multiple case
   studies cannot predict all operational states and hence neither
   guarantees an adequate security margin nor an economical operation for
   the power system. Based on the trend analysis method which is used in
   the field of economics, this paper introduces the concept and a
   methodology for ``trend security analysis{''} of power systems. This
   method utilizes the load profile forecast and the contingency occurrence
   probability and determines the system security trend in the subsequent
   time window. Based on a recursive algorithm which is developed by
   utilizing the higher order derivatives of power flow equations, this
   paper also presents a method for fast determination of the trend
   variations of the system states and security indices. Three IEEE test
   systems are used to demonstrate the applications of the proposed
   concepts, evaluate their performance and verify their accuracy.}},

Volume = {{29}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Demand response programs incentivize loads to actively moderate their
   energy consumption to aid the power system. Uncertainty is an intrinsic
   aspect of demand response because a load's capability is often unknown
   until the load has been deployed. Algorithms must therefore balance
   utilizing well-characterized, good loads and learning about poorly
   characterized but potentially good loads; this is a manifestation of the
   classical tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. We address this
   tradeoff in a restless bandit framework, a generalization of the
   well-known multi-armed bandit problem. The formulation yields index
   policies in which loads are ranked by a scalar index, and those with the
   highest are deployed. The policy is particularly appropriate for demand
   response because the indices have explicit analytical expressions that
   may be evaluated separately for each load, making them both simple and
   scalable. This formulation serves as a heuristic basis for when only the
   aggregate effect of demand response is observed, from which the state of
   each individual load must be inferred. We formulate a tractable,
   analytical approximation for individual state inference based on
   observations of aggregate load curtailments. In numerical examples, the
   restless bandit policy outperforms the greedy policy by 5\%-10\% of the
   total cost. When the states of deployed loads are inferred from
   aggregate measurements, the resulting performance degradation is on the
   order of a few percent for the (now heuristic) restless bandit policy.}},

Abstract = {{Integrating information network into power system is the key for
   realizing the vision of smart grid, but also introduces many security
   problems. Wireless communication offers the benefits of low cost, rapid
   deployment, shared communication medium, and mobility; at the same time,
   it causes many security and privacy challenges. In this paper, the
   concept of dynamic secret is applied to design an encryption scheme for
   smart grid wireless communication. Between two parties of communication,
   the previous packets are coded as retransmission sequence, where
   retransmitted packet is marked as ``1{''} and the other is marked as
   ``0.{''} During the communication, the retransmission sequence is
   generated at both sides to update the dynamic encryption key. Any
   missing or misjudging in retransmission sequence would prevent the
   adversary from achieving the keys. In our experiments, a smart grid
   platform is built, employing the ZigBee protocol for wireless
   communication. And a dynamic secret-based encryption demo system is
   designed based on this platform. The experiment results show that the
   retransmission and packet loss in ZigBee communication are inevitable
   and unpredictable, and it is impossible for the adversary to track the
   updating of the dynamic encryption key.}},

Pages = {{1397-1409}},

Abstract = {{The concept of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) has gained recent interest as more
   and more electric vehicles (EVs) are put to use. In this paper, we
   consider a dynamic aggregator-EVs system, where an aggregator centrally
   coordinates a large number of dynamic EVs to provide regulation service.
   We propose a Welfare-Maximizing Regulation Allocation (WMRA) algorithm
   for the aggregator to fairly allocate the regulation amount among the
   EVs. Compared with previous works, WMRA accommodates a wide spectrum of
   vital system characteristics, including dynamics of EV, limited EV
   battery size, EV battery degradation cost, and the cost of using
   external energy sources for the aggregator. The algorithm operates in
   real time and does not require any prior knowledge of the statistical
   information of the system. Theoretically, we demonstrate that WMRA is
   away from the optimum by, where is a controlling parameter depending on
   EVs' battery size. In addition, our simulation results indicate that
   WMRA can substantially outperform a suboptimal greedy algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{We study the demand side management (DSM) problem when customers are
   equipped with energy storage devices. Two games are discussed: the first
   is a non-cooperative one played between the residential energy
   consumers, while the second is a Stackelberg game played between the
   utility provider and the energy consumers. We introduce a new cost
   function applicable to the case of users selling back stored energy. The
   non-cooperative energy consumption game is played between users who
   schedule their energy use to minimize energy cost. The game is shown to
   have a unique Nash equilibrium, that is also the global system optimal
   point. In the Stackelberg game, the utility provider sets the prices to
   maximize its profit knowing that users will respond by minimizing their
   cost. We provide existence and uniqueness results for the Stackelberg
   equilibrium. The Stackelberg game is shown to be the general case of the
   minimum Peak-to-Average power ratio (PAR) problem. Two algorithms,
   centralized and distributed, are presented to solve the Stackelberg
   game. We present results that elucidate the interplay between storage
   capacity, energy requirements, number of users and system performance

Abstract = {{The paper presents a comprehensive investigation on household level
   commuting mode, car allocation and car ownership level choices of
   two-worker households in the City of Toronto. A joint econometric model
   and a household travel survey dataset are used for empirical
   investigations. Empirical models reveal that significant substitution
   patterns exist between auto driving and all other mode choices in
   two-worker households. It is revealed that, female commuters do not
   prefer auto driving, but in case of a one car (and two commuters with
   driving licenses) household, a female commuter gets more preference for
   auto driving option than the male commuter. Reverse commuting (commuting
   in opposite direction of home to central business district) plays a
   critical role on household level car allocation choices and in defining
   the stability of commuting behaviour of two-worker households. Two
   worker households in higher income zones and with longer commuting
   distances tend to have higher car ownership levels than others. However,
   higher transit accessibility to jobs reduces household car ownership
   levels. The study reveals that both increasing two worker households and
   reverse commuting would increase dependency on private car for
   commuting.}},

Abstract = {{Most natural tissues consist of multi-cellular systems made up of two or
   more cell types. However, some of these tissues may not regenerate
   themselves following tissue injury or disease without some form of
   intervention, such as from the use of tissue engineered constructs.
   Recent studies have increasingly used co-cultures in tissue engineering
   applications as these systems better model the natural tissues, both
   physically and biologically. This review aims to identify the challenges
   of using co-culture systems and to highlight different approaches with
   respect to the use of biomaterials in the use of such systems. The
   application of co-culture systems to stimulate a desired biological
   response and examples of studies within particular tissue engineering
   disciplines are summarized. A description of different analytical
   co-culture systems is also discussed and the role of biomaterials in the
   future of co-culture research are elaborated on. Understanding the
   complex cell cell and cell biomaterial interactions involved in
   co-culture systems will ultimately lead the field towards biomaterial
   concepts and designs with specific biochemical, electrical, and
   mechanical characteristics that are tailored towards the needs of
   distinct co-culture systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Panama recently enacted a new law, which aims to promote wind energy by
   mandating long term power purchase tenders. The implications of this new
   law lend some uncertainty to Panama's electricity development pathway.
   This paper quantitatively analyzes the current status of power
   generation in Panama, and explores various potential future scenarios
   and the associated impacts on the system marginal cost, global warming
   potential, and resource diversity index. To this end, this study applies
   the scenario development methodology developed by Schwartz in the
   context of the energy-economic modeling platform `Long-range Energy
   Alternative Planning' (LEAP). Four scenarios are developed and analyzed.
   The Business as Usual scenario extrapolates the electricity generation
   trend that has been observed over the last decade; it is compared to
   three alternative scenarios which have more specific objectives.
   Scenario 1 encourages climate mitigation without incorporating new
   technologies in the generation mix, Scenario 2 maximizes resource
   diversity, and Scenario 3 minimizes global warming potential. For each
   scenario, the composition of the electricity generation profile, system
   marginal cost, global warming potential, and resource diversity is
   predicted quantitatively. These scenarios to not attempt to forecast
   likely developments, but rather illuminate the tradeoffs that different
   development pathways entail. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we construct a practical framework for efficiently
   allocating long term evolution (LTE) resource blocks (RB) among the
   users in a device-to-device (D2D) network. For such network that
   presumably operates under the LTE cellular network, our aim is to
   improve the overall throughput of D2D connections using opportunistic or
   fairness-based approach. Taking the practical considerations into
   account, our proposed framework allows a number of connections to share
   a single RB whenever possible, thus utilizing the radio resources. To do
   so, our solution first identifies a superior set of the
   interference-free D2D reuse groups via graph modeling and graph coloring
   approach. In particular, we model a D2D network with a two-overlapping
   disk graph for which a suitable coloring algorithm is proposed and its
   performance bound is calculated. Once the reuse groups are known, our
   solution optimizes the RB allocation among these groups based on their
   reported channel condition as well as the scheduling criterion, whether
   it is fairness-based or opportunistic. Through numerical experiments, we
   show that our solution can significantly improve the throughput
   performance of a D2D network.}},

Abstract = {{Substructure hybrid simulation has been the subject of numerous

   assessment of the seismic performance of structures by representing
   critical components with physical specimens and the rest of the
   structure with numerical models. In this study the system level
   performance of a six-storey structure with telescoping self-centering
   energy dissipative (T-SCED) braces is validated through pseudo-dynamic
   (PsD) hybrid simulation. Fragility curves are derived for the T-SCED
   system. This paper presents the configuration of the hybrid simulation,
   the newly developed control software for PsD hybrid simulation, which
   can integrate generic hydraulic actuators into PsD hybrid simulation,
   and the seismic performance of a structure equipped with T-SCED braces.
   The experimental results show that the six-storey structure with T-SCED

Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline microtruss materials are novel cellular hybrids of metal
   and polymer produced by electrodepositing thin coatings of
   nanocrystalline metal over rapid prototyped polymer preforms. This study
   develops an optimisation method for the architectural design of
   electrodeposited metal/polymer composite microtrusses used as cores in
   sandwich beams. For an optimally designed structure employing
   conventional polycrystalline nickel, a direct substitution of
   nanocrystalline nickel will improve structural performance; however, it
   is likely that the structure will also become significantly sub-optimal.
   Achieving optimal design with nanocrystalline nickel entails large
   geometric changes from the conventional polycrystalline case. The same
   applies if the polymer preform is removed after electrodeposition. The
   strong connection between optimal architecture and grain size was
   therefore examined for the limiting cases of polymer-filled and hollow
   microtrusses. It was found that grain size reduction was more important
   than polymer preform removal such that grain size effects dominate over
   the majority of microtruss design space.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents label-free DNA detection using a charge sensitive
   microarray sensor. The microarray sensor, fabricated with a standard
   CMOS process, contains 1024 detector elements integrated together with
   their readout circuit in a single chip. This microarray sensor chip is
   developed for biosensing applications involving label-free detection of
   charged particles and molecules with improved sensitivity. The proposed
   chip is used for the detection of DNA immobilization and hybridization
   by directly sensing the phosphate backbone charge of DNA molecules. The
   sensing part of the chip consists of an array of 7 mu m x 7 mu m
   capacitive metal electrodes arranged in 32 x 32 format with a pitch of
   15 mu m, which allows implementation of a portable and low-cost
   microarray sensor. The sensitivity of the microarray sensor is improved
   compared with other direct charge sensing CMOS biosensors, using
   low-noise detection and amplification circuits, and implementing
   correlated double sampling, which reduces the input referred rms noise
   level down to 6.8 electrons (e(-)). Due to this low noise level,
   detection of DNA having 1 pM concentration is achieved, showing that the
   chip is much more sensitive than its counterparts, and even as sensitive
   as conventional fluorescence or gravimetric detection techniques. A
   dynamic range of 70 dB is achieved, along with the low noise level. The
   tests were performed with 10 base pairs DNA in 13-mu M probe
   (5'-TCTCACCTTC-3') and 1-pM target (3'-AGAGTGGAAG-5') oligomer
   solutions. In both cases, charges of the DNA molecules interacting with

Abstract = {{In this paper, the role of naturally occurring polyphosphate in
   enhancing the ultraviolet disinfection of wastewater flocs is examined.
   It was found that polyphosphate, which accumulates naturally within the
   wastewater flocs in the enhanced biological phosphorus removal process,
   is capable of producing hydroxyl radicals under UV irradiation and hence
   causing the photoreactive disinfection of microorganisms embedded within
   flocs. This phenomenon is likely responsible for the improved UV
   disinfection of the biological nutrient removal (BNR) effluent compared
   to that of conventional activated sludge effluent by as much as 1 log. A
   mathematical model is developed that combines the chemical disinfection
   by hydroxyl radical formation within flocs, together with the direct
   inactivation of microorganisms by UV irradiation. The proposed model is
   able to quantitatively explain the observed improvement in the UV
   disinfection of the BNR effluents. This study shows that the chemical
   composition of wastewater flocs could have a significant positive impact
   on their UV disinfection by inducing the production of oxidative
   species. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   the microstructural evolution caused by foaming action (biaxial

Pages = {{3847-3859}},

Abstract = {{Room temperature tensile testing was performed on a coarse-grained
   polycrystalline Ni (32 mu m), a nanocrystalline Ni (23 nm) and two
   nanocrystalline Ni-Fe (16 nm) electrodeposits at two strain rates of
   10(-1) and 10(-2)/s. Strain localizations and local temperature
   increases were simultaneously recorded during tensile testing. For all
   materials, higher loads or higher strain rate generally resulted in
   higher peak temperature with the highest temperatures recorded in the
   fracture regions. The maximum temperature for the nanocrystalline
   materials was just over 80 A degrees C, which is significantly below the
   reported temperatures for the onset of thermally activated grain growth.
   Therefore, the previously reported grain growth observed on similar
   materials after tensile deformation is likely not thermally activated
   but a stress-induced phenomenon. Despite the wide grain range from 16 nm
   to 32 mu m, all samples exhibited similar strain localization behavior.
   Local strain variations initiated in the early stage of macroscopic
   uniform deformation, subsequent necking and fracture took place in the
   region of initial strain localization. While the coarse-grained
   polycrystalline Ni exhibited little strain rate sensitivity, gradually
   increased strain rate sensitivity was observed for the 23 nm Ni and the
   two 16 nm Ni-Fe samples, suggesting that both dislocation-mediated and
   grain-boundary-controlled mechanisms were operative in the deformation
   of the nanocrystalline Ni and Ni-Fe samples.}},

Abstract = {{Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD),
   leaving the detection procedure to the third partner and thus being
   immune to all detector side-channel attacks, is very promising for the
   construction of high-security quantum information networks. We propose a
   scheme to implement MDI-QKD, but with continuous variables instead of
   discrete ones, i.e., with the source of Gaussian-modulated coherent
   states, based on the principle of continuous-variable entanglement
   swapping. This protocol not only can be implemented with current telecom
   components but also has high key rates compared to its discrete
   counterpart; thus it will be highly compatible with quantum networks.}},

Abstract = {{Target identification is a critical step in the lengthy and expensive
   process of drug development. Here, we describe a genome-wide screening
   platform that uses systematic overexpression of pooled human ORFs to
   understand drug mode-of-action and resistance mechanisms. We first
   calibrated our screen with the well-characterized drug methotrexate. We
   then identified new genes involved in the bioactivity of diverse drugs
   including antineoplastic agents and biologically active molecules.
   Finally, we focused on the transcription factor RHOXF2 whose
   overexpression conferred resistance to DNA damaging agents. This
   approach represents an orthogonal method for functional screening and,
   to our knowledge, has never been reported before.}},
