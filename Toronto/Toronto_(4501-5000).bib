Abstract = {{We propose an artificial-noise alignment scheme for multicasting a
   common-confidential message to a group of legitimate receivers. Our
   scheme transmits a superposition of information and noise symbols. At
   each legitimate receiver, the noise symbols are aligned in such a way
   that the information symbols can be decoded with high probability. In
   contrast, the noise symbols completely mask the information symbols at
   the eavesdroppers. Our proposed scheme does not use the knowledge of the
   eavesdropper's channel gains at the transmitter for alignment, yet it
   achieves the best-known lower bound on the secure degrees of freedom.
   The knowledge of the eavesdropper's channel gains is still necessary
   when selecting the rate of the wiretap code. Our scheme is also a
   natural generalization of the approach of transmitting artificial noise
   in the null-space of the legitimate receiver's channel, previously
   proposed in the literature.}},

   nanoclay intercalation and exfoliation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The foaming behaviors of high-density polypropylene-nanoclay composites
   with intercalated and exfoliated nanoclay particles blown with carbon
   dioxide were examined via in situ observation of the foaming processes
   in a high-temperature/high-pressure view-cell. The intercalated nanoclay
   particles were 300-600 nm in length and 50-200 nm in thickness, while
   the exfoliated nanoclay particles were 100-200 nm in length and 1 nm in
   thickness. Contrary to common belief, it was discovered that
   intercalated nanoclay yielded higher cell density than exfoliated
   nanoclay despite its lower particle density. This was attributed to the
   higher tensile stresses generated around the larger and stiffer
   intercalated nanoclay particles, which led to increase in
   supersaturation level for cell nucleation. Also, the coupling agent used
   to exfoliate nanoclay would increase the affinity between polymer and
   surface of nanoclay particles. Consequently, the critical work needed
   for cell nucleation would be increased; pre-existing microvoids, which
   could act as seeds for cell nucleation, were also less likely to exist.
   Meanwhile, exfoliated nanoclay had better cell stabilization ability to
   prevent cell coalescence and cell coarsening. This investigation
   clarifies the roles of nanoclay in plastic foaming processes and
   provides guidance for the advancement of polymer nanocomposite foaming
   technology.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dot solar cells achieve spectrally selective optical
   absorption in a thin layer of solution-processed, size-effect tuned,
   nanoparticles. The best devices built to date have relied heavily on
   drift-based transport due to the action of an electric field in a
   depletion region that extends throughout the thickness of the quantum
   dot layer. Here we study for the first time the behaviour of the
   best-performing class of colloidal quantum dot films in the absence of
   an electric field, by screening using an electrolyte. We find that the
   action of selective contacts on photovoltage sign and amplitude can be
   retained, implying that the contacts operate by kinetic preferences of
   charge transfer for either electrons or holes. We develop a theoretical
   model to explain these experimental findings. The work is the first to
   present a switch in the photovoltage in colloidal quantum dot solar
   cells by purposefully formed selective contacts, opening the way to new
   strategies in the engineering of colloidal quantum dot solar cells.}},

Journal = {{NPG ASIA MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The impact of halogenation, in particular Cl and F, on the work
   functions of indium tin oxide (ITO) surfaces was studied using density
   functional theory calculations. We found that a strong surface dipole
   layer induced by the halogen, rather than a change in the
   electrochemical potential (that is, Fermi level) of the ITO, led to a
   dramatic increase in the work function. However, the work function for
   F-coated ITO was lower than that of Cl-coated ITO. This result
   contradicts the well-known fact that F is much more electronegative than
   Cl. Detailed computations reveal that both electronegativity and atomic
   size collectively contribute to the extraordinarily high work function
   of Cl-ITO. Additionally, the work function increases linearly with
   increasing surface halogen coverage for both systems, which was
   consistent with experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Abnormal uroflowmetries are common after tubularized incised plate
   urethroplasties (TIP), perhaps due to low compliance. We hypothesized
   that (1) abnormal uroflowmetries after TIP might be caused by segmental
   lower compliance; (2) by adding a graft to the raw area in the incised
   plate (TIPG), compliance might be improved by preventing secondary
   intention healing of the dorsal incision.
   A standardized penectomy was performed in 27 adult male rabbits: 9
   normal non-operated controls (G1), 6 weeks after TIP (G2: n = 9) or TIPG
   (G3: n = 9). A standardized isolated segment (including the whole
   urethroplasty in G1 and G2) was progressively distended with air (1, 2
   and 3 ml) in the 3 groups. The respective intraluminal pressures were
   measured with a tensiometer.
   Pressure measurements were feasible and reproducible for this model.
   Mean pressures tended to be higher in the experimental groups (G1: 59.7
   mmHg vs. G2: 79.6 mmHg vs. G3: 100.1 mmHg for 1 ml injections; G1: 233.1
   mmHg vs. G2: 241 mmHg vs. G3: 308.4 mmHg for 2 ml injections and G1:
   457.3 mmHg vs. G2: 429 mmHg vs. G3: 520 mmHg for 3 ml injections)
   without reaching the statistical significance.
   In this model, the elasticity of the TIP or TIPG neourethras tended to
   be reduced when compared to controls. The placement of an inlay graft on
   the dorsal incised area did not increase the compliance. This model
   allows the measurement of segmental intraluminal urethral pressures
   generated by controlled air distension and may be a useful tool to
   evaluate the experimental urethroplasty models.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in synthetic biology have equipped us with new tools for
   bioprocess optimization at the genetic level. Previously, we have
   presented an integrated in silico design for the dynamic control of gene

   In the present paper, analysis of a serine-producing Escherichia coli
   mutant shows that an instantaneous ON-OFF switch leads to a maximum
   theoretical productivity improvement of 29.6\% compared to the mutant.
   To further the design, global sensitivity analysis is applied here to a
   mathematical model of serine production in E. coli coupled with a
   genetic circuit. The model of the quorum sensing and the toggle switch
   involves 13 parameters of which 3 are identified as having a significant
   effect on serine concentration. Simulations conducted in this reduced
   parameter space further identified the optimal ranges for these 3 key
   parameters to achieve productivity values close to the maximum
   theoretical values. This analysis can now be used to guide the
   experimental implementation of a dynamic metabolic engineering strategy
   and reduce the time required to design the genetic circuit components.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces, formulates and evaluates an approach for damping
   inter-area oscillations of power systems based on supplementary current
   control of a line-commutated HVDC link. The proposed control is based on
   the model predictive control (MPC) strategy. The salient feature of the
   MPC as compared with other optimal control strategies, e. g., the linear
   quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, is that it adjusts the control signal
   to achieve the objectives while explicitly respecting the plant
   constraints. This paper also compares the performance of the MPC with
   that of the LQG control. The two approaches are tested on the Western
   System Coordinating Council (WSCC) 9-bus system and the IEEE 14-bus
   system. Small-signal disturbance and large-signal disturbance stability
   studies are performed to demonstrate and compare the performances of the
   LQG and MPC methodologies. The study results show the effective and
   superior performance of the MPC for damping poorly damped oscillatory
   modes of the test systems.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last several years, significant progress has been made toward
   understanding the mechanisms involved in the mineralization of hard
   collagenous tissues, such as bone and dentin. Particularly notable are
   the identification of transient mineral phases that are precursors to
   carbonated hydroxyapatite, the identification and characterization of
   non-collagenous proteins that are involved in controlling
   mineralization, and significant improvements in our understanding of the
   structure of collagen. These advances not only represent a paradigm
   shift in the way collagen mineralization is viewed and understood, but
   have also brought new challenges to light. In this review, we discuss
   how recent in vitro models have addressed critical questions regarding
   the role of the non-collagenous proteins in controlling mineralization,
   the nature of the interactions between amorphous calcium phosphate and
   collagen during the early stages of mineralization, and the role of
   collagen in the mineralization process. We discuss the significance of
   these findings in expanding our understanding of collagen
   biomineralization, while addressing some of the limitations that are
   inherent to in vitro systems. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SULFUR CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{358-369}},

Abstract = {{To develop novel sorbent materials for capturing vapor mercury from
   industrial flue gases at high temperatures, high-sulfur oil-sands fluid
   coke was activated using 50\% sulfur dioxide (SO2) at 700 degrees C
   under various pre-treatment conditions. Pyrolysis in nitrogen prior to
   activation significantly decreased specific surface area (SSA) of the
   product, which was attributed to the thermoplastic behavior of coke at
   high temperatures. Air pre-oxidation suppressed this effect and provided
   an enhancement over non-pyrolyzed coke, with SSA peaking at 447m(2)/g
   after 5h activation. Acid washing of air pre-oxidized activated coke in
   10\% hydrochloric acid increased SSA by removal of inorganic ash which
   added weight but contributed minimal surface area. Decreasing initial
   particle size range from 212-300 to 53-106m significantly increased SSA,
   which was attributable to an outer porous layer of constant thickness.
   Under optimized conditions, an SSA of 531m(2)/g was achieved - the
   highest reported in literature for physically activated fluid coke. Coke
   activated with SO2 displays a high mesoporous fraction and pore surface
   coverage by sulfur groups that were thermally stable up to 500 degrees
   C.

Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{4875-4883}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The kinetics of K2CO3-catalyzed CO2 gasification of ash-free coal was
   investigated with a thermogravimetric analyzer and compared to raw coal
   and uncatalyzed ash-free coal. At 750 degrees C, the gasification of
   ash-free coal dry mixed with 20 wt \% K2CO3 was approximately 3 and 60
   times faster than the raw coal and ash-free coal without catalyst,
   respectively. Increasing the amount of catalyst from 20 to 45 wt \%
   increased the gasification rate 3-fold. The gasification rate of
   ash-free coal containing potassium catalyst strongly depended upon the
   pretreatment (i.e., heating gas atmosphere and heating time) because it
   directly affected the degree of catalyst reduction. The catalytic
   gasification behavior could only be predicted with the extended random
   pore model, whereas the random pore model and integrated model were
   essentially equal for fitting the gasification rate for raw and ash-free
   coal. The activation energy for the catalyzed ash-free coal gasification
   was approximately 100 kJ mol(-1) larger than for raw coal and the
   uncatalyzed ash-free coal. This increase might be due to the energy
   required for the potassium (i.e., catalyst) transfer to a new carbon
   site or caused by the pyrolysis process, because the formed char might
   have different properties.}},

Abstract = {{SAW devices have been used in a variety of applications including
   high-volume telecommunications, electronic devices, and advanced
   sensors. Recently, high-bit-rate data processing in the gigahertz
   frequency range and ultrahigh-sensitivity sensors have called for the
   development of advanced SAW transducers. Because of its high acoustic
   velocity, ultra-nanocrystalline diamond (UNCD) with a crystal size of 3
   to 5 nm, embedded in an amorphous carbon matrix with grain boundaries of
   1 to 1.5 nm, is integrated with AlN to extend the operating frequency of
   SAW devices. We utilize this attractive property of UNCD through the
   facile synthesis of bilayer architectures consisting of sputtered AlN
   deposited on UNCD film. The UNCD films were synthesized using microwave
   plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The SAW devices were
   fabricated by electron beam lithography and lift off processes. The
   fabricated SAW nanodevices exhibit resonance frequencies up to 15.4 GHz.
   Multiple SAW transducers were fabricated with spatial periods ranging
   from 580 nm to 3.2 mu m.}},

Abstract = {{Walking outdoors is often difficult or impossible for many seniors and
   people with disabilities during winter. We present a novel approach for
   conducting winter accessibility evaluations of commonly used pedestrian
   facilities, including sidewalks, street crossings, curb ramps (curb cuts
   and dropped curbs), outdoor stairs and ramps, building and transit
   entrances, bus stops, and driveways. A total of 183 individuals, aged
   18-85 completed our survey. The results show that cold weather itself
   had little impact on the frequency of outdoor excursions among
   middle-aged and older adults while the presence of snow and/or ice on
   the ground noticeably kept people, especially older adults at home. The
   survey found that the key elements decreasing winter accessibility were
   icy sidewalks and puddles at street crossings and curb ramps. While
   communities have recognized the need to improve snow and ice removal,
   little attention has been paid to curb ramp design which is especially
   ineffective in winter when the bottom of the ramps pool with rain, snow,
   and ice, making it hazardous and inaccessible to nearly all users. We
   conclude that investigations of alternative designs of curb ramp are
   needed.}},

   complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) read-out integrated
   circuit, which digitized the fluorescence signal to achieve
   autofluorescence-limited sensitivity. After surgical implantation of the
   lightweight sensor for two weeks, we obtained continuous and dynamic
   fluorophore measurements while the subject was un-anesthetized and

Abstract = {{Foamed and solid polypropylene/carbon fiber (PP-CF) composites
   containing various CF contents (0-10 vol.\%) were injection-molded.
   Foamed composites were achieved using dissolved pressurized nitrogen
   gas. The effects of foaming on the fibers inter-connectivity and
   orientation, electrical percolation threshold, through-plane electrical
   conductivity, longitudinal and transversal in-plane conductivities,
   dielectric permittivity, and electromagnetic interference (EMI)
   shielding effectiveness (SE) were investigated. Cell growth increased
   the fibers inter-connectivity by biaxial stretching of the matrix and
   also changed the fiber orientation. The introduction of foaming reduced
   the density of the injection-molded samples by 25\%, lowered the volume
   fraction of the percolation threshold from 8.5 to 7 vol.\% CF, enhanced
   the through-plane conductivity up to a maximum of six orders of
   magnitude, increased the dielectric permittivity and resulted in the
   increase of the specific EMI SE up to 65\%. Moreover, the uniformity of
   in-plane and through-plane conductivities as well as EMI SE along the
   injection-molded samples was greatly improved by foaming. The
   relationships between the microstructure and electrical properties were
   also established. The results reveal that lightweight conductive
   products with lower fiber content and enhanced electrical and EMI
   shielding properties can be fabricated with the aid of injection foam
   molding for applications in electronics, aerospace and automotive
   industries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The static and dynamic properties of semiconductor optical parametric
   oscillators (SOPOs) are studied by merging the rate equations of the
   diode pump laser with those of the OPO while taking into account the
   phase and, hence, chirp performance. The static analysis of the SOPO
   shows two stable regimes of operation, namely, an efficient and an
   inefficient regime akin to the case for conventional intracavity OPO.
   The large signal dynamic properties of the SOPO are studied in the two
   static operating regimes. The study shows that there exists enormous
   negative and positive frequency chirp in the signal and idler in the
   order of a few terahertz upon large signal modulation. These
   characteristics are explained through the well-known properties of the
   nonlinear gain medium of the OPO. The limitations on using these devices
   in a directly modulated fashion are discussed. Such limitations are
   found to be determined largely by the SOPO rise time in certain bias
   conditions. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Real-world applications of conventional public transport technologies in
   urban areas might not always be feasible due to several factors that are
   not necessarily attributed to passenger demand, such as the very high
   capital and operating cost of these systems, the limited availability of
   real estate to expand/create new systems, and the presence of
   geographical and topographical barriers (e.g.,mountains, valleys, and
   bodies of water). In such cases, unconventional public transportation
   technologies have found notable success in recent years in many urban
   areas around the world. Aerial ropeway transit (ART) technology, which
   is a type of aerial transportation mode in which passengers are
   transported in cabins that are suspended and pulled by cables, is a
   popular example of these technologies. The recent introduction of this
   technology into the urban environment, in addition to the vendors'
   continuous trials to improve upon existing aerial ropeway technologies,
   has led to several recent advancements and improvements to the
   technology as illustrated by several recent implementations around the
   world. This article sheds some light on some of the most recent
   improvements in the technology specifications as well as the operation
   and safety considerations of ART as observed from several case studies

Abstract = {{Directed differentiation protocols enable derivation of cardiomyocytes
   from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and permit engineering of
   human myocardium in vitro. However, hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes are
   reflective of very early human development, limiting their utility in
   the generation of in vitro models of mature myocardium. Here we describe
   a platform that combines three-dimensional cell cultivation with
   electrical stimulation to mature hPSC-derived cardiac tissues. We used
   quantitative structural, molecular and electrophysiological analyses to
   explain the responses of immature human myocardium to electrical
   stimulation and pacing. We demonstrated that the engineered platform
   allows for the generation of three-dimensional, aligned cardiac tissues
   (biowires) with frequent striations. Biowires submitted to electrical
   stimulation had markedly increased myofibril ultrastructural
   organization, elevated conduction velocity and improved both
   electrophysiological and Ca2+ handling properties compared to
   nonstimulated controls. These changes were in agreement with
   cardiomyocyte maturation and were dependent on the stimulation rate.}},

Abstract = {{A coarse-fine time-to-digital converter (TDC) is presented with a
   calibrated coarse stage followed by a stochastic fine stage. On
   power-up, a calibration algorithm based on a code density test is used
   to minimize nonlinearities in the coarse TDC. By using a balanced mean
   method, the number of registers required for the calibration algorithm
   is reduced by 30\%. Based upon the coarse TDC output, the appropriate
   clock signals are multiplexed into the stochastic fine TDC. The TDC is
   incorporated into a 1.99-2.5-GHz digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) in
   0.13-mu m CMOS. The DPLL consumes a total of 15.2 mW of which 4.4 mW are
   consumed in the TDC. Measurements show an in-band phase noise of - 107
   dBc/Hz which is equivalent to 4-ps TDC resolution, approximately an
   order of magnitude better than an inverter delay in this process
   technology. The integrated random jitter is 213 fs rms for a 2-GHz
   output carrier frequency with 700-kHz loop bandwidth. The calibration
   reduces worst-case spurs by 16 dB.}},

Abstract = {{A wide dynamic range CMOS tunable-color image sensor is presented. The
   sensor integrates an 8x8 array of tunable-color photogates which exploit
   the wavelength-dependent optical absorption properties of the
   polysilicon gate structure. An analysis is presented for the wide
   dynamic range asynchronous self-reset with residue readout architecture
   where photon shot noise is taken into consideration. An implementation
   of this architecture is presented where the (coarse) asynchronous
   self-reset operation and (fine) residue analog-to-digital conversions
   are performed with separate in-pixel and off-pixel circuits,
   respectively, for a noise-optimized design. A prototype was fabricated
   in a standard 0.35 mu m CMOS process and is validated in color light
   sensing which achieves SNRs of 24.3 dB and 28.5 dB in green and red
   light measurements, respectively, under a moderate input light intensity
   of 300 mu W/cm(2). The readout circuit achieves a measured dynamic range
   of 82 dB with a peak SNR of 46.2 dB under broadband illumination. The
   prototype has been integrated with a microfluidic device and
   experimentally validated in fluorescence contact imaging.}},

Abstract = {{A two-transmitter Gaussian multiple access wiretap channel with multiple
   antennas at each of the nodes is investigated. The channel matrices of
   the legitimate users are fixed and revealed to all the terminals,
   whereas the channel matrices of the eavesdropper are arbitrarily varying
   and only known to the eavesdropper. The secrecy degrees of freedom
   (s.d.o.f.) region under a strong secrecy constraint is characterized. A
   transmission scheme that orthogonalizes the transmit signals of the two
   users at the intended receiver, and uses a single-user wiretap code for
   each user, is shown to achieve the s.d.o.f. region. The converse
   involves establishing an upper bound on a weighted-sum-rate expression.
   This is accomplished by using induction, where at each step one combines
   the secrecy and multiple-access constraints associated with an adversary
   eavesdropping a carefully selected group of sub-channels.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the modified couple stress-based strain gradient theory
   is used to provide a unified nonlinear model of the quasistatic and
   dynamic behavior of an electrostatic microelectromechanical systems
   microbeam capacitive switch of the Euler-Bernoulli type. Our model not
   only accounts for the contact between the microbeam and the dielectric
   substrate using nonlinear springs and dampers, but also accounts for the
   system size by introducing an internal material length scale parameter.
   In view of the size of the microbeam and electrostatic gaps involved,
   Casimir and Van der Waals forces, damping force due to the squeeze
   membrane effect and electrostatic force with first-order fringing field
   effects were accounted for in our model. The resulting nonlinear system
   of PDEs was expanded into a coupled system using series expansion and
   integrated into ODEs using weighted residuals of the Galerkin type. To
   overcome the difficulties associated with the determination of the
   contact length, the Heaviside function for deflection was replaced with
   a Heaviside function for the contact length, and an iterative procedure
   was adopted to determine the contact length. To obtain the time
   variation of the microbeam, the dynamic system of equations was solved
   using Newmark's integration scheme. The outcome of our work shows the
   dependence of the pull-in voltage upon the inertia force, slenderness
   ratios of the microbeam, the electrostatic gap and the initial boundary
   conditions of the switch. In addition, we were also able to provide the
   full history of the microbeam past the pull-in threshold.}},

   new model defines the maximum reduction factor for each impurity element
   present in liquid silicon and defines a critical treatment temperature
   value. Evaporation increase constant, with high adaptability for the
   implementation of new process parameters, indicated rapid increase in
   impurity removal at treatment temperatures slightly above melting point
   of silicon. Various statistical parameters for the logistic regression
   method were considerably lower for the 16 studied impurity elements than
   for the linear or logarithmic correlations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Standardized tests to assess movement difficulties in autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD) evaluate motor output, but do not provide
   information about underlying dynamics. The objective of this research is
   to study the statistical persistence and temporal dynamics of a circle
   drawing task in children with ASD.
   Methods: For this study 15 children diagnosed with ASD, aged 4-8 years,
   were asked to draw circles under various conditions using a computerized
   tablet. We then assessed fractal dynamics and global temporal dynamics
   (mean and coefficient of variation) and compared these quantities to
   those of typically developing (TD) controls.
   Results: No difference in statistical persistence was found between
   children with ASD and TD children. Temporal measures showed increased
   variability in the ASD population in the discontinuous task.
   Conclusion: Results support the hypothesis that children with ASD have
   an intact ability to consistently produce continuous movements, but
   increased variability in production of discontinuous movements.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal suspensions containing magnetic nanoparticles placed in
   appropriate carrier liquids present strong magnetic dipoles. These
   suspensions, in general, exhibit normal liquid behaviour coupled with
   super paramagnetic properties. This leads to the possibility of remotely
   controlling the flow of such liquids with a moderate-strength external
   magnetic field. In this study, we numerically investigate the viability
   of controlling and steering a base-fluid with magnetic-sensitive
   nanoparticles into randomly structured fibrous porous media. Three
   dimensional flow simulations are performed using the lattice Boltzmann
   method. The simulation results for the flow front are presented, and the
   effect of the magnetic field strength on the rate of ferrofluid
   penetration is discussed. It is shown that the porosity of the porous
   medium and the size of the fibres have a strong effect on the ferrofluid
   penetration rate.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a multi-objective optimization approach for
   incorporating the conditional probability of fire flow failure into the
   design of branched water networks. To this end, a new analytical
   probabilistic model was developed to quantify the conditional
   probability of fire flow failure in branched networks and incorporated
   into the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The
   optimization sought to minimize capital cost through pipe diameter and
   pump selection and to minimize the conditional probability of fire flow
   failure. The NSGA-II was applied to two branched networks to generate
   Pareto-optimal solutions. Results indicated a strategic allocation of
   pipe and pump capacity with limited fiscal resources and with a
   reduction in uncertainty of fire flow failure. Interestingly,
   optimization results for a real branched network supported the industry
   practice of using a minimum 150 mm distribution main sizing to provide
   fire flow protection.}},

   the fatigue threshold and crack growth behavior of a toughened epoxy

   loading, adhesive thickness, substrate modulus, spew fillet, and surface

Abstract = {{Management of soft tissue sarcoma involves multimodality treatment,
   including surgery and radiotherapy. Pathologic fracture of the femur
   after such treatment in the thigh is one serious, late complication and
   nonunion rates of 80-90\% are reported. We hypothesize that the
   combination of radiotherapy and periosteal stripping (during tumor
   resection) leads to greater impairment of the fracture repair process
   than either intervention alone. Female Wistar retired breeder rats were
   randomized into four treatment groups (control, radiotherapy, surgery,
   and combination of radiotherapy and surgery) and three end-points (21,
   28, and 35 days post-fracture). Designated animals first underwent
   radiotherapy, followed by surgical stripping of the periosteum 3 weeks
   later and femoral fracture with fixation after another 3 weeks. Animals
   were sacrificed and fractures examined using microCT and
   histomorphometry. Simple transverse or short oblique femoral fractures
   were produced. By 35 days, control animals formed unions,
   periosteum-stripped animals formed hypertrophic non-unions and
   irradiated animals formed atrophic non-unions. Histomorphometry revealed
   an absence of chondroid and osteoid production in animals undergoing
   radiotherapy. The relative contribution of periosteal stripping to
   occurrence of non-union was statistically insignificant. Radiation prior
   to fracture reliably resulted in atrophic non-union in our model. The
   contribution of periosteal stripping was negligible. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{We present a theoretical description of slab and ridge waveguides with
   multilayer claddings, such as Bragg reflection waveguides (BRWs), using
   analytical expressions based on Fresnel and Airy formulas. This approach
   simplifies the waveguide calculations in comparison with more
   traditional techniques such as the transfer matrix method or direct
   stitching of plane-wave solutions at layer interfaces. Approximate but
   simple and straightforward analytic relations describing the effective
   indices and group velocities of guided modes in arbitrary 1D BRWs are
   derived. The formalism is then extended to 2D ridge waveguides using the
   effective index method. The approach is employed to engineer BRWs where
   several types of phase matching are present simultaneously at the same
   wavelength, as well as BRWs where photons generated by spontaneous
   parametric downconversion have the maximal degree of polarization
   entanglement. These results promote the use of BRWs as on-chip entangled
   photon sources, and facilitate on-chip generation of multiple optical
   Bell states. The designs are based on the AlGaAs fabrication platform
   and are within reach of experimental realization. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{PROTEIN AND PEPTIDE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Alginate is a biofilm exopolysaccharide secreted by the opportunistic
   pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa that acts to prevent the diffusion of
   antibiotics toward the bacterial cell membrane. Cationic antimicrobial
   peptides (CAPs) have been increasingly recognized as a viable
   alternative for prospective antimicrobial agents. The D-isomer chiral
   counterparts of active L-isomer CAPs tend to show slightly greater
   antimicrobial activities because bacteria lack proteases to hydrolyze
   the unnatural D-isomers. Using an enantiomeric pair of synthetic CAPs
   designed in our laboratory (L-4Leu in the sequence KKKKKKALFALWLAFLA-NH2
   and its D-analog D-4Leu), we studied the binding and interactions of L-
   vs. D-isomers of CAPs with alginate using circular dichroism and Raman
   spectroscopic techniques. We found that the peptide D-4Leu underwent a
   more rapid structural transition over time from an initial
   alginate-induced alpha-helical conformation to a less soluble beta-sheet
   conformation than L-4Leu, indicating that the D-isomer of this peptide
   has a relatively greater affinity for alginate. Through Raman
   spectroscopy it was observed that Raman modes at 1297 cm(-1) and 1453
   cm(-1) wavenumbers were found to differ between the spectra obtained
   from the insoluble complexes formed between L-4Leu vs. D-4Leu and
   alginate. These modes were tentatively assigned to CH, and CH3
   deformation modes, respectively. Our findings reveal previously
   undetected subtleties in the binding of this diastereomeric pair of
   peptides in the microenvironment of a biofilm exopolysaccharide, and
   provide guidelines for future development of antimicrobial peptides.}},

Abstract = {{Particle deposits on indoor surfaces can be as complex and diverse as
   the indoor environments in which they exist. Dust loading can range over
   several orders of magnitude, suggesting the existence of different types
   of particle deposits. These deposits can be broadly classified as either
   a monolayer, in which particles are sparsely deposited on a surface, or
   a multilayer, in which particles are deposited on top of one another and
   there is particle-to-particle adhesion and interaction. Particles within
   these diverse structures of settled indoor dust can become airborne
   through a process known as resuspension, which can occur due to airflow
   in ventilation ducts or human activity indoors. The dust loading and
   deposit structure on an indoor surface may have important implications
   for resuspension in the indoor environment. This literature review
   provides a summary of dust loads found on indoor surfaces in field
   studies and classifies each dust load as either a monolayer or
   multilayer particle deposit. The article highlights the unique
   attributes associated with resuspension from both types of particle
   deposits by summarizing key findings of the experimental resuspension
   literature. The fundamental differences in the resuspension process
   between monolayer and multilayer deposits suggest that resuspension may
   vary considerably among the broad spectrum of dust loads found on indoor

Abstract = {{Resuspension is an important source of indoor particles and the amount
   of dust loading is an important factor in resuspension emission rates.
   Field studies have shown that light to heavy dust loads can be found in
   the indoor environment, on both the surfaces of flooring and ventilation
   ducts. These diverse particle deposits can be broadly classified as
   either a monolayer, in which particles are sparsely deposited on a
   surface, or a multilayer, in which particles are deposited on top of one
   another and there is particle-to-particle adhesion and interaction. This
   experimental wind tunnel study explores the role of the type of particle
   deposit on aerodynamic resuspension from linoleum flooring and
   galvanized sheet metal. Resuspension fractions are reported for both
   monolayer and multilayer deposits exposed to a wide range of air
   velocities. The type of particle deposit is found to strongly influence
   resuspension. In general, the results show that resuspension from
   multilayer deposits can occur at significantly lower velocities compared
   with monolayer deposits. For example, resuspension fractions at an air
   velocity of 5m/s for the canopy layer of multilayer deposits were
   similar to those found for monolayer deposits at 50m/s. Additionally,
   for multilayer deposits, resuspension fractions for the canopy layer
   increased with increasing dust load and negligible resuspension occurred
   along the surface layer. It was found that the relationship between the
   particle deposit height and the viscous sublayer thickness of the
   airflow can help explain the differences in resuspension that were
   observed between the two types of deposits. The impact of the type of
   particle deposit on resuspension may have important implications for
   resuspension in the indoor environment, where a diversity of deposits
   can be found. Copyright 2013 American Association for Aerosol Research}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses a stochastic facility location and vehicle

   The problem consists of simultaneously locating a set of facilities,
   determining the vehicle fleet size at each facility, and allocating

   times. Such travel times can arise, for example, due to daily traffic
   patterns or weather-related disturbances. These various travel time
   conditions are considered as different scenarios with known
   probabilities. A stochastic programming with bounded penalties model is
   presented for the problem. In order to solve the problem, integer
   programming and two-level and three-level logic-based Benders'
   decomposition models are proposed. Computational experiments demonstrate
   that the Benders' models were able to substantially outperform the

Abstract = {{This study deals with the optimal control of hybrid energy storage
   systems for electric vehicle applications. These storage systems can
   capitalize on the high specific energy of Lithium-Ion batteries and the
   high specific power of modern ultracapacitors. The new predictive
   algorithm uses a state-based approach inspired by power systems
   optimization, organized as a probability-weighted Markov process to
   predict future load demands. Decisions on power sharing are made in real
   time, based on the predictions and probabilities of state trajectories
   along with associated system losses. Detailed simulations comparing
   various power sharing algorithms are presented, along with
   converter-level simulations presenting the response characteristics of
   power sharing scenarios. The full hybrid storage system along with the
   mechanical drivetrain is implemented and validated experimentally on a

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that all-fiber cavity ring-down (CRD) evanescent-field
   sensing can be performed using frequency-shifted interferometry (FSI).
   In contrast to conventional CRD schemes, without the need for any
   optical pulse or fast electronics, this FSI-CRD technique allows one to
   monitor the intensity decay of a continuous lightwave traveling inside a
   fiber loop ring-down cavity (RDC), from which the cavity loss
   information can be deduced. By incorporating a fiber taper as the
   sensing element inside a RDC, we carried out FSI-CRD experiments with an
   amplified spontaneous emission source, an acousto-optic modulator, and a
   slow detector, successfully applying the technique to the measurement of
   chemical solution concentration based on absorption, solution refractive
   index change, or a combination of both. A minimum detectable 1-octyne
   concentration of 0.29\% (or 0.020 M) was achieved in decane, while
   refractive index sensitivity of 1 dB/RIU with a measurement error of 1 x
   10(-4) dB was attained in sodium chloride solutions (NaCl in water). The
   1-octyne detection limit is better than previously reported values
   measured by conventional fiber-based CRD techniques. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Creating miniature chip scale implementations of optical quantum
   information protocols is a dream for many in the quantum optics
   community. This is largely because of the promise of stability and
   scalability. Here we present a monolithically integratable chip
   architecture upon which is built a photonic device primitive called a
   Bragg reflection waveguide (BRW). Implemented in gallium arsenide, we
   show that, via the process of spontaneous parametric down conversion,
   the BRW is capable of directly producing polarization entangled photons
   without additional path difference compensation, spectral filtering or
   post-selection. After splitting the twin-photons immediately after they
   emerge from the chip, we perform a variety of correlation tests on the
   photon pairs and show non-classical behaviour in their polarization.
   Combined with the BRW's versatile architecture our results signify the
   BRW design as a serious contender on which to build large scale
   implementations of optical quantum processing devices.}},

Abstract = {{The elasticity of the extracellular matrix profoundly affects biological
   responses of cells, but also their mechanical properties. Single cell
   mechanical properties are often measured by atomic force microscopy
   (AFM), but technical guidelines for AFM measurement of cells grown on
   soft substrates are not well established. In this study, the local and
   global elastic moduli of aortic valve interstitial cells (VICs) cultured
   on soft polyacrylamide substrates (3-144 kPa) were characterized via AFM
   force mapping using pyramidal and spherical tips, respectively. Local
   and global VIC modulus values both increased with substrate stiffness
   (p<0.05), with the average local cell modulus being consistently two to
   three times greater than the global modulus (p<0.05). For local
   measurements, a minimum of four measurements was required to observe the
   trend of increasing cell modulus with substrate stiffness, but there was
   no advantage to testing additional spots. The Hertz model was relatively
   accurate in estimating the global cell elastic modulus (<12\% error,
   based on validated finite element analyses), despite the cells being of
   finite thickness and grown on deformable substrates, neither of which
   are accounted for in the Hertz model. The results of this study provide
   practical guidelines for efficient AFM-based measurement of the
   mechanical properties of cells on gels. They also provide new
   physiologically-relevant data on VIC mechanical properties and their
   correlation with substrate stiffness-dependent cytoskeletal changes,
   with relevance to heart valve mechanobiology and disease. (C) 2013

   introduced through a local magnetic levitation system created by
   neodymium magnets and is capable of triggering the second buckling mode
   that helps the beam easily snap through between equilibriums when
   subjected to excitations. Significant enhancements, along with distinct

Abstract = {{The feasibility of transcranial passive acoustic mapping with
   hemispherical sparse arrays (30 cm diameter, 16 to 1372 elements, 2.48
   mm receiver diameter) using CT-based aberration corrections was
   investigated via numerical simulations. A multi-layered ray acoustic
   transcranial ultrasound propagation model based on CT-derived skull
   morphology was developed. By incorporating skull-specific aberration
   corrections into a conventional passive beamforming algorithm (Norton
   and Won 2000 IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens. 38 1337-43), simulated
   acoustic source fields representing the emissions from
   acoustically-stimulated microbubbles were spatially mapped through three
   digitized human skulls, with the transskull reconstructions closely
   matching the water-path control images. Image quality was quantified
   based on main lobe beamwidths, peak sidelobe ratio, and image
   signal-to-noise ratio. The effects on the resulting image quality of the
   source's emission frequency and location within the skull cavity, the
   array sparsity and element configuration, the receiver element
   sensitivity, and the specific skull morphology were all investigated.
   The system's resolution capabilities were also estimated for various
   degrees of array sparsity. Passive imaging of acoustic sources through
   an intact skull was shown possible with sparse hemispherical imaging
   arrays. This technique may be useful for the monitoring and control of
   transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) treatments, particularly
   non-thermal, cavitation-mediated applications such as FUS-induced
   blood-brain barrier disruption or sonothrombolysis, for which no
   real-time monitoring techniques currently exist.}},

Abstract = {{The attachment of the sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) onto
   iron oxide and various silicate substrates in aqueous solution as a
   function of salt concentration and pH was studied by atomic force
   microscopy-based force spectroscopy (AFM) and quartz-crystal
   microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). Both ionic strength
   and cation valency were found to influence substrate binding. Notably,
   QCM-D experiments strongly suggested that the solubility of CMC is
   directly impacted by the presence of CaCl2. Such data are critical for
   the design of new molecules for stabilizing mineral floc dispersions and
   for assessing the mobility of CMC-coated particles in the subsurface.
   Modeling of AFM data with an extended Ohshima theory showed that van der
   Waals and steric forces played a major role in the interactions between
   CMC and mineral substrates, and that hydration forces were also
   important. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{RNA-binding proteins are key regulators of gene expression, yet only a
   small fraction have been functionally characterized. Here we report a
   systematic analysis of the RNA motifs recognized by RNA-binding
   proteins, encompassing 205 distinct genes from 24 diverse eukaryotes.
   The sequence specificities of RNA-binding proteins display deep
   evolutionary conservation, and the recognition preferences for a large
   fraction of metazoan RNA-binding proteins can thus be inferred from
   their RNA-binding domain sequence. The motifs that we identify in vitro
   correlate well with in vivo RNA-binding data. Moreover, we can associate
   them with distinct functional roles in diverse types of
   post-transcriptional regulation, enabling new insights into the
   functions of RNA-binding proteins both in normal physiology and in human
   disease. These data provide an unprecedented overview of RNA-binding
   proteins and their targets, and constitute an invaluable resource for
   determining post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in eukaryotes.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dot photovoltaics combine low-cost solution processing
   with quantum size-effect tuning to match absorption to the solar
   spectrum. Rapid advances have led to certified solar power conversion
   efficiencies of over 7\%. Nevertheless, these devices remain held back
   by a compromise in the choice of quantum dot film thickness, balancing
   on the one hand the need to maximize photon absorption, mandating a
   thicker film, and, on the other, the need for efficient carrier
   extraction, a consideration that limits film thickness. Here we report
   an architecture that breaks this compromise by folding the path of light
   propagating in the colloidal quantum dot solid. Using this method, we
   achieve a substantial increase in short-circuit current, ultimately
   leading to improved power conversion efficiency.}},

Title = {{Mitochondrial Hyperfusion during Oxidative Stress Is Coupled to a
   Dysregulation in Calcium Handling within a C2C12 Cell Model}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JUL 8}},
Abstract = {{Atrial Fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia
   worldwide harming millions of people every year. Atrial Fibrillation
   (AF) abruptly induces rapid conduction between atrial myocytes which is
   associated with oxidative stress and abnormal calcium handling.
   Unfortunately this new equilibrium promotes perpetuation of the
   arrhythmia. Recently, in addition to being the major source of oxidative
   stress within cells, mitochondria have been observed to fuse, forming
   mitochondrial networks and attach to intracellular calcium stores in
   response to cellular stress. We sought to identify a potential role for
   rapid stimulation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial hyperfusion in
   acute changes to myocyte calcium handling. In addition we hoped to link
   altered calcium handling to increased sarcoplasmic reticulum
   (SR)-mitochondrial contacts, the so-called mitochondrial associated
   membrane (MAM). We selected the C2C12 murine myotube model as it has
   previously been successfully used to investigate mitochondrial dynamics
   and has a myofibrillar system similar to atrial myocytes. We observed
   that rapid stimulation of C2C12 cells resulted in mitochondrial
   hyperfusion and increased mitochondrial colocalisation with calcium
   stores. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission by transfection of mutant
   DRP1K38E resulted in similar effects on mitochondrial fusion, SR
   colocalisation and altered calcium handling. Interestingly the effects
   of `forced fusion' were reversed by co-incubation with the reducing
   agent N-Acetyl cysteine (NAC). Subsequently we demonstrated that
   oxidative stress resulted in similar reversible increases in
   mitochondrial fusion, SR-colocalisation and altered calcium handling.
   Finally, we believe we have identified that myocyte calcium handling is
   reliant on baseline levels of reactive oxygen species as co-incubation
   with NAC both reversed and retarded myocyte response to caffeine induced
   calcium release and re-uptake. Based on these results we conclude that
   the coordinate regulation of mitochondrial fusion and MAM contacts may
   form a point source for stress-induced arrhythmogenesis. We believe that
   the MAM merits further investigation as a therapeutic target in
   AF-induced remodelling.}},

Abstract = {{As digital microfluidics technology evolves, the need for integrating
   additional elements (e. g., sensing/detection and heating elements) on
   the electrode increases. Consequently, electrode area for droplet
   actuation is reduced to create space for accommodating these additional
   elements, which undesirably affects force generation. Electrodes cannot
   simply be scaled larger to compensate for this loss of force, as this
   would also increase droplet volume and thereby compromise the advantages
   thought in miniaturization. Here, we present a study evaluating,
   numerically with preliminary experimental verification, different
   partially filled electrode designs and suggesting designs that combine
   high actuation forces with a large reduction in electrode area. (C) 2013

Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{Experimental control over progenitor cell lineage specification can be
   achieved by modulating properties of the cell's microenvironment. These
   include physical properties of the cell adhesion substrate, such as
   rigidity, topography and deformation owing to dynamic mechanical forces.
   Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) generate contractile forces to
   sense and remodel their extracellular microenvironments and thereby
   obtain information that directs broad aspects of MSC function, including
   lineage specification. Various physical factors are important regulators
   of MSC function, but improved understanding of MSC mechanobiology
   requires novel experimental platforms. Engineers are bridging this gap
   by developing tools to control mechanical factors with improved
   precision and throughput, thereby enabling biological investigation of
   mechanics-driven MSC function. In this review, we introduce MSC
   mechanobiology and review emerging cell culture platforms that enable
   new insights into mechanobiological control of MSCs. Our main goals are
   to provide engineers and microtechnology developers with an up-to-date
   description of MSC mechanobiology that is relevant to the design of
   experimental platforms and to introduce biologists to these emerging
   platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) have undergone
   tremendous growth over the past two decades. Indeed, they are already
   prevalent in the form of mobile displays, and are expected to be used in
   large-area flat panels recently. To become a viable technology for next
   generation solid-state light source however, PHOLEDs face the challenge
   of achieving concurrently a high color rendering index (CRI) and a high
   efficiency at high luminance. To improve the CRI of a standard three
   color white PHOLED, one can use a greenish-yellow emitter to replace the
   green emitter such that the gap in emission wavelength between standard
   green and red emitters is eliminated. However, there are relatively few
   studies on greenish-yellow emitters for PHOLEDs, and as a result, the
   performance of greenish-yellow PHOLEDs is significantly inferior to
   those emitting in the three primary colors, which are driven strongly by
   the display industry. Herein, a newly synthesized greenish-yellow
   emitter is synthesized and a novel device concept is introduced
   featuring interzone exciton transfer to considerably enhance the device
   efficiency. In particular, high external quantum efficiencies (current
   efficiencies) of 21.5\% (77.4 cd/A) and 20.2\% (72.8 cd/A) at a
   luminance of 1000 cd/m(2) and 5000 cd/m(2), respectively, have been
   achieved. These efficiencies are the highest reported to date for
   greenish-yellow emitting PHOLEDs. A model for this unique design is also
   proposed. This design could potentially be applied to enhance the
   efficiency of even longer wavelength yellow and red emitters, thereby
   paving the way for a new avenue of tandem white PHOLEDs for solid-state
   lighting.}},

Abstract = {{This review highlights aspects of calcific aortic valve disease that
   encompass the entire range of aortic valve disease progression from
   initial cellular changes to aortic valve sclerosis and stenosis, which
   can be initiated by changes in blood flow (hemodynamics) and pressure
   across the aortic valve. Appropriate hemodynamics is important for
   normal valve function and maintenance, but pathological blood velocities
   and pressure can have profound consequences at the macroscopic to
   microscopic scales. At the macroscopic scale, hemodynamic forces impart
   shear stresses on the surface of the valve leaflets and cause
   deformation of the leaflet tissue. As discussed in this review, these
   macroscale forces are transduced to the microscale, where they influence
   the functions of the valvular endothelial cells that line the leaflet
   surface and the valvular interstitial cells that populate the valve
   extracellular matrix. For example, pathological changes in blood
   flow-induced shear stress can cause dysfunction, impairing their
   homeostatic functions, and pathological stretching of valve tissue
   caused by elevated transvalvular pressure can activate valvular
   interstitial cells and latent paracrine signaling cytokines (eg,
   transforming growth factor-1) to promote maladaptive tissue remodeling.
   Collectively, these coordinated and complex interactions adversely
   impact bulk valve tissue properties, feeding back to further deteriorate
   valve function and propagate valve cell pathological responses. Here, we
   review the role of hemodynamic forces in calcific aortic valve disease
   initiation and progression, with focus on cellular responses and how
   they feed back to exacerbate aortic valve dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the loading efficiencies of two chemically distinct
   hydrophobic fluorescent probes, pyrene and naphthalene, for
   self-assembly and loading of polystyrene-block-poly(acrylic acid)
   (PS-b-PAA) micelles in gas-liquid segmented microfluidic reactors under
   different chemical and flow conditions. On-chip loading efficiencies are
   compared to values obtained via off-chip dropwise water addition to a
   solution of copolymer and probe. On-chip, probe loading efficiencies
   depend strongly on the chemical probe, initial solvent, water content,
   and flow rate. For pyrene and naphthalene probes, maximum on chip
   loading efficiencies of 73 +/- 6\% and 11 +/- 3\%, respectively, are
   obtained, in both cases using the more polar solvent (DMF), an
   intermediate water content (2 wt \% above critical), and a low flow rate
   (similar to 5 mu L/min); these values are compared to 81 +/- 6\% and 48
   +/- 2\%, respectively, for off chip loading On chip loading shows a
   significant improvement over the off-chip process where shear-induced
   formation of smaller micelles enables increased encapsulation of probe.
   As well, we show that on chip loading allows off chip release kinetics
   to be controlled via flow rate: compared to vehicles produced at similar
   to 5 mu L/min, pyrene release kinetics from vehicles produced at similar
   to 50 mu L/min showed a longer initial period of burst release, followed
   by slow release over a longer total period. These results demonstrate
   the necessity to match probes, solvents, and running conditions to
   achieve effective loading, which is essential information for further
   developing these on chip platforms for manufacturing drug delivery
   formulations.}},

Title = {{BOLD fMRI in the White Matter as a Marker of Aging and Small Vessel
   Disease}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 2}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Determine whether white matter signal fluctuation on T2{*}
   weighted BOLD contrast images are associated with aging and cerebral
   small vessel disease (SVD).
   Methodology: Resting state BOLD data were collected with a 250 ms
   repetition time (TR) to achieve unaliased, ungated cardiac sampled BOLD
   (cs-BOLD) images on 11 young adult controls, 10 healthy older adult
   controls and 7 adults with extensive white matter hyperintensities (WMH)
   from SVD. Tissue classes (WM and GM) were segmented on T1 images. WMH
   were identified on FLAIR images in the SVD group. Raw physiological
   noise (sigma(physio)) and cardiac pulsatility (i.e. fluctuations at the
   cardiac frequency) were calculated voxel wise and group differences were
   tested by ANOVA. It was also possible to calculate sigma(physio) in 2s
   TR cardiac aliased whole-brain BOLD (wb-BOLD) data (N = 84) obtained
   from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping.
   Results: CS-BOLD metrics showed an aging and SVD effects (p<0.0005).
   Covariates such as thermal noise, WM volume and partial volume did not
   influence the significant aging effect seen on the cardiac pulsatility
   metric (p<0.017) but did influence the sigma(physio) (p = 0.184). As a
   verification of the cs-BOLD findings, the wb-BOLD also showed a linear
   aging effect of sigma(physio) in WM. In the SVD adults, cardiac
   pulsatility and sigma(physio) were lower in WMH regions compared to
   normal appearing white matter (NAWM) regions (p<0.0013 and p<0.002,
   respectively). Cardiac pulsatility was better able to distinguish WMH
   regions from NAWM than sigma(physio) as measured by effect size (Cohen's
   d 2.2 and 0.88, respectively).
   Conclusion: NAWM was found to have graded increases in cardiac
   pulsations due to age and SVD, independently. Within SVD participants,
   WMH lesions had reduced physiological noise compared to NAWM. Cardiac
   pulsatility in resting BOLD data may provide a complementary dynamic
   measure of WM integrity to add to static FLAIR anatomical images.}},

Abstract = {{The subgrid-scale terms for different formulations of the energy
   equation are evaluated from a-priori tests using the direct numerical
   simulation (DNS) data of a compressible mixing layer at a moderate Mach
   number of M = 0.65. To extend the generality of the results, the
   simulations were performed with three different initial conditions for
   the velocity fields. To examine the impact of strong temperature
   variations on the subgrid scales, a non-isothermal mixing layer with
   lower to upper free-stream temperature ratio of 3 is also considered.
   For cold simulations, with equal free-stream temperatures, the total
   energy equation is shown to be the best choice in view of the accuracy
   and the subgrid-scale modelling requirements. For hot simulations, with
   the free-stream temperature ratio equal to 3, the total enthalpy
   equation is found to be the best formulation for the energy equation.
   Furthermore, it is shown that the subgrid-scale pressure dilatation
   term, which has been largely neglected so far, is of the same order of
   the subgrid-scale heat flux. Based on the present results, the
   contribution of the subgrid-scale pressure dilatation can be up to 46\%
   of the total sugbrid-scale activity. Moreover, the time evolutions of
   the volume-average mean kinetic energy, turbulent kinetic energy,
   production, dissipation, and pressure dilatation terms are considered.
   Unlike the subgrid-scale pressure dilatation term, the volume-average
   pressure dilatation terms are negligible, and compressibility does not
   affect the large-scale evolutions of the mean and turbulent kinetic
   energies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a low cost and equipment-free blood filtration
   device capable of producing plasma from blood samples with mL-scale
   capacity and demonstrate its clinical application for hepatitis B
   diagnosis. We report the results of in-field testing of the device with
   0.8-1 ml of undiluted, anticoagulated human whole blood samples from
   patients at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi,
   Vietnam. Blood cell counts demonstrate that the device is capable of
   filtering out 99.9\% of red and 96.9\% of white blood cells, and the
   plasma collected from the device contains lower red blood cell counts
   than plasma obtained from a centrifuge. Biochemistry and immunology
   testing establish the suitability of the device as a sample preparation
   unit for testing alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase
   (AST), urea, hepatitis B ``e{''} antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B ``e{''}
   antibody (HBe Ab), and hepatitis B surface antibody (HBs Ab). The device
   provides a simple and practical front-end sample processing method for
   point-of-care microfluidic diagnostics, enabling sufficient volumes for
   multiplexed downstream tests. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Studying the effects of pharmacological agents on human endothelium
   includes the routine use of cell monolayers cultivated in multi-well
   plates. This configuration fails to recapitulate the complex
   architecture of vascular networks in vivo and does not capture the
   relationship between shear stress (i.e. flow) experienced by the cells
   and dose of the applied pharmacological agents. Microfluidic platforms
   have been applied extensively to create vascular systems in vitro;
   however, they rely on bulky external hardware to operate, which hinders
   the wide application of microfluidic chips by non-microfluidic experts.
   Here, we have developed a standalone perfusion platform where multiple
   devices were perfused at a time with a single miniaturized peristaltic
   pump. Using the platform, multiple micro-vessel networks, that contained
   three levels of branching structures, were created by culturing
   endothelial cells within circular micro-channel networks mimicking the
   geometrical configuration of natural blood vessels. To demonstrate the
   feasibility of our platform for drug testing and validation assays, a
   drug induced nitric oxide assay was performed on the engineered
   micro-vessel network using a panel of vasoactive drugs (acetylcholine,
   phenylephrine, atorvastatin, and sildenafil), showing both flow and drug
   dose dependent responses. The interactive effects between flow and drug
   dose for sildenafil could not be captured by a simple straight
   rectangular channel coated with endothelial cells, but it was captured
   in a more physiological branching circular network. A monocyte adhesion
   assay was also demonstrated with and without stimulation by an
   inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha. (C) 2013 AIP

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Ubiquitous bacteria from the genus Oleispira drive oil degradation in
   the largest environment on Earth, the cold and deep sea. Here we report
   the genome sequence of Oleispira antarctica and show that compared with
   Alcanivorax borkumensis-the paradigm of mesophilic hydrocarbonoclastic
   bacteria-O. antarctica has a larger genome that has witnessed massive
   gene-transfer events. We identify an array of alkane monooxygenases,
   osmoprotectants, siderophores and micronutrient-scavenging pathways. We
   also show that at low temperatures, the main protein-folding machine
   Cpn60 functions as a single heptameric barrel that uses larger proteins
   as substrates compared with the classical double-barrel structure
   observed at higher temperatures. With 11 protein crystal structures, we
   further report the largest set of structures from one psychrotolerant
   organism. The most common structural feature is an increased content of
   surface-exposed negatively charged residues compared to their mesophilic
   counterparts. Our findings are relevant in the context of microbial
   cold-adaptation mechanisms and the development of strategies for
   oil-spill mitigation in cold environments.}},

Abstract = {{Lanthanides adsorbed on clay minerals were easily recovered by ion
   exchange leaching with inorganic monovalent salt solutions under ambient
   conditions. The leaching efficiency (as per cent extraction) of various
   salts at 0.5M and 25 degrees C was investigated as a function of cation
   type and salt system (sulphates versus chlorides). The selected
   lixiviant concentration was based on a 3 : 1 stoichiometric ratio
   between total lanthanide content and the exchange cation. Leaching
   efficiency decreased in the order Cs+>NH4+>Na+>Li+, from 90\% to similar
   to 60\% respectively, with sulphates exhibiting similar to 10\% higher
   extraction than chlorides; differences in lanthanide desorption were
   explained in terms of differences in cation hydration energies.
   (NH4)(2)SO4 was identified as the optimum lixiviant and a procedure was
   established to investigate the influence of temperature, pH and
   agitation on desorption kinetics and lanthanide extraction levels. It
   was determined that maximum extraction required pH below 5 and moderate
   temperatures (<50 degrees C).}},

Abstract = {{GeneMANIA (http://www.genemania.org) is a flexible user-friendly web
   interface for generating hypotheses about gene function, analyzing gene
   lists and prioritizing genes for functional assays. Given a query gene
   list, GeneMANIA extends the list with functionally similar genes that it
   identifies using available genomics and proteomics data. GeneMANIA also
   reports weights that indicate the predictive value of each selected data
   set for the query. GeneMANIA can also be used in a function prediction
   setting: given a query gene, GeneMANIA finds a small set of genes that
   are most likely to share function with that gene based on their
   interactions with it. Enriched Gene Ontology categories among this set
   can sometimes point to the function of the gene. Seven organisms are
   currently supported (Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans,
   Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus, Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus
   and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and hundreds of data sets have been
   collected from GEO, BioGRID, IRefIndex and I2D, as well as
   organism-specific functional genomics data sets. Users can customize

Abstract = {{Field-effect transistors have been widely used to study electronic
   transport and doping in colloidal quantum dot solids to great effect.
   However, the full power of these devices to elucidate the electronic
   structure of materials has yet to be harnessed. Here, we deploy
   nanodielectric field-effect transistors to map the energy landscape
   within the band gap of a colloidal quantum dot solid. We exploit the
   self-limiting nature of the potentiostatic anodization growth mode to
   produce the thinnest usable gate dielectric, subject to our voltage
   breakdown requirements defined by the Fermi sweep range of interest.
   Lead sulfide colloidal quantum dots are applied as the active region and
   are treated with varying solvents and ligands. In an analysis
   complementary to the mobility trends commonly extracted from
   field-effect transistor studies, we focus instead on the subthreshold
   regime and map out the density of trap states in these nanocrystal
   films. The findings point to the importance of comprehensively mapping
   the electronic band- and gap-structure within real quantum solids, and
   they suggest a new focus in investigating quantum dot solids with an aim
   toward improving optoelectronic device performance.}},

Abstract = {{Self-assembly of gold nanorods (NRs) in linear, polymer-like chains
   offers the ability to test and validate theoretical models of molecular
   polymerization. Practically, NR chains show multiple promising
   applications in sensing of chemical and biological species. Both areas
   of research can strongly benefit from the development of a quantitative
   tool for characterization of the structure of NR chains in the course of
   self-assembly, based on the change in ensemble-averaged optical
   properties of plasmonic polymers; however, quantitative correlation
   between the extinction spectra and the structural characteristics of NR
   chains has not been reported. Here, we report such a tool by a
   quantitatively correlating the red shift of the longitudinal surface
   plasmon band of gold NRs and the average aggregation number of NR
   chains. The generality of the method is demonstrated for NRs with
   different aspect ratios, for varying inter-rod distances in the chains,
   and for varying initial concentrations of NRs in solution. We modeled
   the extinction spectra of the NR chains by combining the theory of
   step-growth polymerization with finite-difference time-domain
   simulations and a resistor-inductor-capacitor model, and obtained
   agreement between the theoretical and experimental results. In addition
   to capturing quantitatively the ensemble physics of the polymerization,
   the proposed plasmonic counter approach provides a real-time cost- and
   labor-efficient method for the characterization of self-assembly of
   plasmonic polymers.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells combine solution-processability
   with quantum-size-effect tunability for low-cost harvesting of the sun's
   broad visible and infrared spectrum. The highest-performing colloidal
   quantum dot solar cells have, to date, relied on a
   depleted-heterojunction architecture in which an n-type transparent
   metal oxide such as TiO2 induces a depletion region in the p-type CQD
   solid. These devices have, until now, been limited by a modest depletion
   region depth produced in the CQD solid owing to limitations in the
   doping available in TiO2. Herein we report a new device geometry-one
   based on a donor-supply electrode (DSE)-that leads to record-performing
   CQD photovoltaic devices. Only by employing this new charge-extracting
   approach do we deepen the depletion region in the CQD solid and thereby
   extract notably more photocarriers, the key element in achieving record
   photocurrent and device performance. With the use of optoelectronic
   modeling corroborated by experiment, we develop the guidelines for
   building a superior CQD solar cell based on the DSE concept. We confirm
   that using a shallow-work-function terminal electrode is essential to
   producing improved charge extraction and enhanced performance.}},

Abstract = {{The mitigation of intercell interference is an importance issue for
   current and next-generation wireless cellular networks where frequencies
   are aggressively reused and hierarchical cellular structures may heavily
   overlap. The paper examines the benefit of coordinating transmission
   strategies and resource allocation schemes across multiple base-stations
   for interference mitigation. Two different wireless cellular
   architectures are studied: a multicell network where base-stations
   coordinate in their transmission strategies, and a mixed macrocell and
   femtocell/picocell deployment with coordination among macro and
   femto/pico base-stations. For both scenarios, this paper proposes a
   heuristic joint proportionally fair scheduling, spatial multiplexing,
   and power spectrum adaptation algorithm that coordinates multiple
   base-stations with an objective of optimizing the overall network
   utility. The proposed scheme optimizes the user schedule, transmit and
   receive beamforming vectors, and transmit power spectra jointly, while
   taking into consideration both the intercell and intracell interference
   and the fairness among the users. System-level simulation results show
   that coordination at the transmission strategy and resource allocation
   level can already significantly improve the overall network throughput
   as compared to a conventional network design with fixed transmit power
   and per-cell zero-forcing beamforming.}},

Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{A simplified version of the Diverse Embedment Model (DEM) for steel
   fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) is derived by eliminating the double
   numerical integration, which complicates the calculation procedure of
   the DEM. To simplify the DEM, fiber slip on the longer embedded side is
   not considered in the calculation of the fiber tensile stress at a
   crack, while coefficients for frictional bond behavior and mechanical
   anchorage effect are incorporated to prevent overestimation of the
   tensile stress attained by fibers. The tensile stress behavior of SFRC
   predicted by the Simplified DEM (SDEM) shows good agreement with that
   obtained from the DEM; hence, the model's accuracy has largely been
   retained despite the simplification. In comparisons with test results
   reported in the previous literature, the SDEM is shown to simulate not
   only the direct tensile behavior but also the flexural behavior of SFRC
   members. The SDEM can easily be implemented in currently available
   analysis models so that it can be useful in the modeling of structural
   behavior of SFRC members or structures.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable high-temperature CMOS oscillators are required for clock or
   time-base generation in several applications including data acquisition
   for aerospace, automotive control, oil field instrumentation, and pulp
   and paper digesters. In this paper, we present low-complexity resistive
   and capacitive temperature-compensation techniques for CMOS relaxation
   oscillators. In such oscillators, the frequency of oscillation is a
   function of a resistor-capacitor product. The resistive compensation
   technique employs a recently proposed monolithic resistor with a given
   temperature coefficient (TC) that uses contacts to adjust the TC of the
   resistor. The capacitive compensation technique is based on using a
   varactor to adjust the value of the timing capacitance over temperature
   to compensate for the high-temperature junction leakage current and to
   keep the oscillation frequency relatively constant. A prototype
   oscillator based on the proposed techniques is implemented in a standard
   0.13-mu m CMOS process and reliably operates over 25 to 180 degrees C.
   Measured results show that over the temperature range of interest the
   compensated oscillator achieves a temperature coefficient of 108
   ppm/degrees C. The oscillator along with its output drivers occupies
   7200 mu m(2) (2.3 x to 114 x smaller than state-of-the-art designs) and
   consumes 428 mu W from a 2.5 V supply. For supply variations between 2
   and 3 V, the frequency variation is +/- 1.09\%/V.}},

Abstract = {{An ontology is a claim on/for knowledge that attempts to model what is
   known about a domain of discourse. A domain ontology does not aim to
   exhaustively list all concepts in a domain, but rather to build an
   abstract (yet extendable) philosophical (yet practical)
   conceptualization of the essence of knowledge in a domain. At the core
   of any ontology is an ontological modelan architecture of how the world
   (in a domain) behaves (or becomes). The ontology categorizes
   construction knowledge across three main dimensions: concept, modality,
   and context. Concept encompasses five key terms: entity (further
   subdivided into generic and secondary), environmental element, abstract
   concept, attribute, and system (combinations of the previous four
   types). Modality is a means for generating a variety of types for each
   of the described concepts. Context allows for linking concepts in a
   variety of ways-creating different worlds. (C) 2013 American Society of

Abstract = {{Real-time monitoring of heavy equipment can help practitioners improve
   machine-intensive and cyclic earthmoving operations. It can also provide
   reliable data for future planning. Surface earthmoving job sites are
   among the best candidates for vision-based systems due to relatively
   clear sightlines and recognizable equipment. Several cutting-edge
   computer vision algorithms are integrated with spatiotemporal
   information, and background knowledge to develop a framework, called
   server-customer interaction tracker (SCIT), which recognizes and
   measures the dirt loading cycles. The SCIT system detects dirt loading
   plants, including excavator and dump trucks, tracks them, and then uses
   captured spatiotemporal data to recognize loading cycles. A novel hybrid
   tracking algorithm is developed for the SCIT system to track dump trucks
   under visually noisy conditions of loading zones. The developed
   framework was evaluated using videos taken under various conditions. The
   SCIT system with novel hybrid tracking engine demonstrated reliable
   performance as the comparison of the machine-generated and ground truth
   data showed high accuracy. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   Steel Frames}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of semirigid partial-strength connections has been
   investigated through either experimental component testing or detailed
   three-dimensional (3D) finite-element (FE) models of beam-column
   subassemblies. Previous experiments on semirigid partial-strength
   connections were conducted under idealized loads and boundary
   conditions, which do not represent real situations. In addition, the
   developed 3D FE models are computationally expensive and have primarily
   been used under monotonic loadings. Evaluating the full potential of any
   connection requires a system-level investigation, whereby the effect of
   the local behavior of the connection on the global response of the
   structural system is considered. Moreover, the connection should be
   tested under realistic load and boundary conditions and/or analyzed
   using an accurate yet computationally affordable analytical model. This
   paper represents a new system-level hybrid simulation application aimed
   at investigating the seismic performance of semirigid partial-strength
   steel frames with top and seat angles with double web-angle connections.
   The analytical component of the simulation comprises a detailed
   two-dimensional nonlinear FE model. The experimental component of the
   simulation consists of a full-scale beam-column subassembly with loading
   and boundary conditions that are in full interaction with the rest of
   the frame. The paper provides an overview of the hybrid simulation
   application and highlights the major results. The simulations were
   conducted at the Multi-Axial Full-Scale Sub-Structured Testing and
   Simulation Facility at the University of Illinois, which is part of the
   National Science Foundation Network for Earthquake Engineering
   Simulation. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of extensional

   foaming processes using a view-cell system. The foaming processes of
   polypropylene blown with supercritical carbon dioxide have been observed
   under static conditions as well as dynamic conditions where extensional
   strains were applied. A bubble growth-induced cell nucleation
   phenomenon, where existing cells triggered the generation of cells
   around them, was observed under static conditions due to the presence of
   crystals. In the dynamic cases, the applied extensional stresses caused
   foaming to occur in a more dispersed manner. The bubble growth-induced
   cell nucleation phenomenon was also observed, but it occurred at a later
   stage and the effect was less dominant. These fundamental understandings
   will provide guidance to improve processing strategies of plastic

Journal = {{NPG ASIA MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Thin-film metal oxides are among the key materials used in organic
   semiconductor devices. As there are no intrinsic charge carriers in a
   typical organic semiconductor, all charges in the device must be
   injected from electrode/organic interfaces, whose energetic structure
   consequentially dictates the performance of devices. The energy barrier
   at the interface depends critically on the work function of the
   electrode. For this reason, various types of thin-film metal oxides can
   be used as a buffer layer to modify the electrode work function. This
   paper provides a review on recent progress in metal oxide/organic
   interface energetics, oxide valence structure and work function, as well
   as the impact of defects and interfacial reactions on oxide work
   functions. This review provides a rational guide to process engineers in
   selecting the best suitable electrode/oxide structures for a targeted
   applications.}},

Pages = {{33-41}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The formation of pirssonite is commonly believed to be the cause of
   hard-scale buildup in green liquor handling systems in kraft pulp mills.
   The precipitation occurs when the concentration of sodium carbonate in
   the liquor exceeds the solubility of pirssonite. A laboratory study was
   conducted to systematically determine the causticizing conditions under
   which pirssonite precipitates. The results confirmed literature data
   showing that the solubility of pirssonite increases with temperature but
   decreases with increased concentrations of sodium carbonate and other
   sodium salts present in the green liquor. The solubility data obtained
   were used to create a database for pirssonite formation in OLI, a
   thermodynamic program for predicting phase stabilities of alkali salts
   in aqueous solutions. The OLI program, with the newly created database,
   was subsequently used to generate a series of pirssonite solubility
   curves in terms of saturated total titratable alkali that can be used as
   operational guidelines to prevent pirssonite precipitation and
   hard-scale formation in green liquor handling systems. A case study was
   performed using these solubility curves to explain the occurrence of the
   pirssonite deposition problem at a kraft pulp mill.}},

Abstract = {{In native tissues, different cell types are organized into defined
   structures and architectures that are critical for correct tissue
   function. In vitro cellular patterning methods enable control over the
   spatial organization of cells, permitting, to some extent, the
   reproduction of native tissue structures and the generation of a more
   ``in vivo-like{''} culture platform. While this is advantageous for
   applications such as drug screening, existing patterning methods are
   time-consuming, labor-intensive, and low-throughput. Here, we describe a
   novel medium-throughput patterning strategy for generating spatially
   controlled co-cultures of two cell types based on differential
   deposition of BSA solution in a tilted plate. Our method allows
   generation of homotypic and heterotypic co-cultures that are stable for
   at least seven days in culture. The reproducibility and consistency of
   this patterning technique, together with its low cost and ease of use,
   make it a promising cell culture platform for medium- to high throughput
   screening using high-content imaging.}},

Abstract = {{The seismic performance of a typical 1960s Type 2 construction steel

   program determined that the connections had considerable inherent
   ductility and were stable up to 2.0\% interstorey drift, despite not
   having been designed for a ductile cyclic response. The structure was
   numerically modelled using advanced strength degradation considerations.
   A nonlinear time-history analysis was conducted using Montreal and
   Vancouver ground motions and the structure's performance was found to be
   inadequate under the considered design hazard levels. Retrofits were
   proposed for the two orthogonal frames using a performance-based
   approach and supplemental damping, rather than local interventions to
   increase the ductility of these connections, and the performance of the
   final retrofit designs were investigated numerically to confirm that the

Abstract = {{The two-user Gaussian interference channel with a shared out-of-band
   relay is considered. The relay observes a linear combination of the
   source signals and broadcasts a common message to the two destinations,
   through a perfect link of fixed limited rate bits per channel use. The
   out-of-band nature of the relay is reflected by the fact that the common
   relay message does not interfere with the received signal at the two
   destinations. A general achievable rate is established, along with upper
   bounds on the capacity region for the Gaussian case. For values below a
   certain threshold, which depends on channel parameters, in achievable
   rates asymptotically in regimes where joint a two-for-one gain is
   achievable by the capacity region of this channel is determined in this
   paper to within a constant gap of bits. We identify interference regimes
   where a two-for-one gain in achievable rates is possible for every bit
   relayed, up to a constant approximation error. Instrumental to these
   results is a carefully designed quantize-and-forward type of relay
   strategy along with a joint decoding scheme employed at destination
   ends. Further, we also study successive decoding strategies with optimal
   decoding order (corresponding to the order at which common, private, and
   relay messages are decoded), and identify interference regimes where
   with an optimal decoding order, successive decoding may also achieve
   two-for-one gains similar to joint decoding; yet, in general, successive
   decoding produces unbounded loss asymptotically when compared to joint
   decoding.}},

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{575-584}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Cellular concrete consists of cement, water, aggregate and air voids.
   Cellular concrete can have between 10\% and 70\% air, which results in a
   material that is lightweight but may compromise the compressive strength
   and durability properties. Although it has been shown in the literature
   that less connected air voids yield a lower reduction in compressive
   strength, few studies have reported a detailed characterization of the
   microstructure of cellular concrete. It is critical to understand the
   impact of the microstructure and its implications on the development of
   strength, elastic modulus and transport properties in order to fully
   benefit from the lightweight properties, and this is the focus of this
   paper. Thirteen batches of cellular concrete were designed, prepared and
   tested. The air content varied, ranging from 6\% to 35\%. Three
   different foaming agents were used, one of which was protein-based and
   the other two were synthetic. Fresh properties such as slump, plastic
   air content and plastic density were measure for each batch of concrete
   as well as other properties, including hardened density, compressive
   strength, static elastic modulus, sorptivity, hardened air void
   distribution and thermal resistance. Key outcomes revealed that cellular
   concrete has good potential to be used for lightweight structural
   applications owing to its evolution of mechanical properties, transport
   properties and thermal resistance, but it is very sensitive to the type
   of foaming agent that is used. Outcomes showed that the foaming agent
   type had a noticeable effect on the thermal resistance and sorptivity
   coefficient but less of an effect on the mechanical properties. This is
   significant because the type of foaming agent used will directly
   influence the applications for which cellular concrete can be used. For
   example, cellular concrete designed with foaming agent B, which yields
   the greatest capillary pore volume is least suited for outdoor
   applications where the concrete may be exposed to moisture and or ions.

Abstract = {{Aqueous extraction is an emerging alternative to hexane-based oilseed
   extraction since it eliminates the dangers associated with processing,
   and allows the simultaneous recovery of high-quality protein products
   and vegetable oils. Five different successive non-enzymatic and
   enzymatic aqueous extraction processes (AEPs/EAEPs) were developed for
   dehulled yellow mustard flour with the aim of producing food-grade
   protein and yellow mustard oil for industrial applications. The oil
   released in these processes was tied up in oil-in-water emulsions that
   must be destabilized to recover free oil prior to industrial
   utilization. This study endeavored to ascertain the extraction
   parameters that increase oil and protein extraction yields and reduce
   emulsion stability during successive AEPs/EAEPs for dehulled yellow
   mustard flour. The remarkable stability of the emulsions was due to the
   presence of protein emulsifiers of high molecular weight along with the
   mixed phospholipid-oleosin layer. pH adjustment for emulsion
   destabilization was relatively inefficient; therefore, enzymatic
   demulsification treatments with different proteases and phospholipases
   were evaluated for their ability to release free oil by hydrolyzing the
   targeted emulsifiers. Although protease treatments with Protex 6 L at a
   concentration of 2.5 wt.\% were effective in recovering over 91\% of the
   oil in the emulsions, phospholipase treatments did not modify the free
   oil recovery from the emulsions. The results indicated that the
   enzymatic aqueous extraction of dehulled yellow mustard flour did not
   offer sufficient improvement in usable protein recovery to warrant the
   extra effort and cost. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   circuits and transistors fabricated on silicon integrated circuits at
   millimeter-wave frequencies. We compare contact-pad designs and develop
   fixed-fill contacts that achieve both repeatable and low contact-pad
   capacitances. We develop a fill-free and mesh-free transmission line
   structure for the calibration kit and compare it to similar transmission
   lines with meshed ground plane. We also develop a gold plating process
   that greatly improves contact repeatability, permitting the use of
   redundant multiline calibrations. This in turn simplifies the
   development of an error analysis. Finally, we apply the technique to
   state-of-the-art transistor characterization, and present measured
   results with uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{The current transformer (CT) is prone to the magnetic core saturation
   during the power system faults. The CT saturation can prolong and/or
   miscoordinate operation of relays and thus may result in the system
   stability problems and equipment damage. This paper proposes a new

   proposed approach is based on adding a controllable resistor at the CT
   secondary circuit which dynamically generates a flux to oppose the time
   varying flux associated with the decaying dc component of the fault
   current. Part I of this two-part paper presents the concept, the
   controllable-switch operational strategy, the design steps, and the
   parameters of the controllable resistor. Part II provides a
   comprehensive evaluation of the controllable resistor based on offline

Abstract = {{Ultrasound imparted air-recoil resonance (UIAR), a new method for
   acoustic power estimation, is introduced with emphasis on therapeutic
   high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) monitoring applications.
   Advantages of this approach over existing practices include fast
   response; electrical and magnetic inertness, and hence MRI
   compatibility; portability; high damage threshold and immunity to
   vibration and interference; low cost; etc. The angle of incidence should
   be fixed for accurate measurement. However, the transducer-detector pair
   can be aligned in any direction with respect to the force of gravity. In
   this sense, the operation of the device is orientation independent. The
   acoustic response of a pneumatically coupled pair of Helmholtz
   resonators, with one of them acting as the sensor head, is used for the
   estimation of acoustic power. The principle is valid in the case of
   pulsed/burst as well as continuous ultrasound exposure, the former being
   more sensitive and accurate. An electro-acoustic theory has been
   developed for describing the dynamics of pressure flow and resonance in
   the system considering various thermo-viscous loss mechanisms.
   Experimental observations are found to be in agreement with theoretical
   results. Assuming the window damage threshold (similar to 10 J.mm(-2))
   and accuracy of RF power estimation are the upper and lower
   scale-limiting factors, the performance of the device was examined for
   an RF power range of 5 mW to 100 W with a HIFU transducer operating at
   1.70 MHz, and an average nonlinearity of similar to 1.5\% was observed.
   The device is also sensitive to sub-milliwatt powers. The frequency
   response was analyzed at 0.85, 1.70, 2.55, and 3.40 MHz and the results
   are presented with respective theoretical estimates. Typical response
   time is in the millisecond regime. Output drift is about 3\% for
   resonant and 5\% for nonresonant modes. The principle has been optimized
   to demonstrate a general-purpose acoustic power meter.}},

   processed by steam-chest molding was used in the experiment. After a UV
   laser beam was irradiated on the face of the foam, the cell type formed
   was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The experiment was
   carried out to verify the effectiveness of the UV LAMO method by
   analyzing the sound-absorbing characteristics and the types of micro
   channels of the EPP beam foam to the changes of the expansion ratio of
   the EPP bead foam.}},

Journal = {{NEURAL COMPUTING \& APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{141-159}},

Abstract = {{Information signal from real case and natural complex dynamical systems
   such as traffic flow are usually specified by irregular motions. Chaotic
   nonlinear dynamics approach is now the most powerful tool for scientists
   to deal with complexities in real cases, and neural networks and
   neuro-fuzzy models are widely used for their capabilities in nonlinear
   modeling of chaotic systems more than the traditional methods. As
   mentioned, the traffic flow conditions caused the forecasting values of
   traffic flow to lack robustness and accuracy. In this paper, the traffic
   flow forecasting is analyzed with emotional concepts and multi-agent
   systems (MASs) points of view as a new method in this field. The
   findings enabled the researchers to develop a newly object-oriented
   method of forecasting traffic flow. Its architecture is based on a
   temporal difference (TD) Q-learning with a neuro-fuzzy structure, which
   is the nonparametric approach. The performance of TD Q-learning is
   improved by emotional learning. The proposed method on the present
   conditions and the action of the system according to the criteria could
   forecast traffic signals so that the objectives are reached in minimum
   time. The ability of presented learning algorithm to prospect gains from
   future actions and obtain rewards from its past experiences allows
   emotional TD Q-learning algorithm to improve its decisions for the best
   possible actions. In addition, to study in a more practical situation,
   the neuro-fuzzy behaviors could be modeled by MAS. The proposed method
   (intelligent/nonparametric approach) is compared by parametric approach,
   autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method, which is
   implemented by multi-layer perceptron neural networks and called
   ARIMANN. Here, the ARIMANN is updated by backpropagation and temporal
   difference backpropagation for the first time. The simulation results
   revealed that the studied forecaster could discover the optimal
   forecasting by means of the Q-learning algorithm. Difficult to handle
   through parametric and classic methods, the real traffic flow signals
   used for fitting the algorithms is obtained from a two-lane street I-494
   in Minnesota City.}},

Abstract = {{Swallowing accelerometry is a promising noninvasive approach for the
   detection of swallowing difficulties. In this paper, we propose an
   approach for classification of swallowing accelerometry recordings
   containing either healthy swallows or penetration-aspiration (entry of
   material into the airway) in dysphagic patients. The proposed algorithm
   is based on the wavelet packet decomposition of swallowing accelerometry
   signals in combination with linear discriminant analysis as a feature
   reduction method and Bayes classification. The proposed algorithm was
   tested using swallowing accelerometry signals collected from 40 patients
   during the regularly scheduled videoflouroscopy exam. The participants
   were instructed to swallow several 5-mL sips of thin liquid barium in a
   head neutral position. The results of our numerical analysis showed that
   the proposed algorithm can differentiate healthy swallows from
   aspiration swallows with an accuracy greater than 90\%. These results
   position swallowing accelerometry as a valid approach for the detection
   of swallowing difficulties, particularly penetration-aspiration in
   patients suspected of dysphagia.}},

Abstract = {{The growing density of integration and the increasing percentage of
   system-on-chip area occupied by embedded memories has led to an increase
   in the expected number of memory faults. The soft memory repair strategy
   proposed in this paper employs existing forward error correction at the
   system level and mitigates the impact of memory faults through
   permutation of high-sensitivity regions. The effectiveness of the
   proposed repair technique is evaluated on a multi-megabit de-interleaver
   static random access memory of an ISDB-T digital baseband orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing receiver in 65-nm CMOS. The proposed
   technique introduces a single multiplexer delay overhead and a
   configurable area overhead of inverted right perpendicularM/iinverted
   left perpendicular bits, where M is the number of memory rows and i is
   an integer from 1 to M, inclusive. The repair strategy achieves a
   measured 0.15 dB gain improvement at 2x10(-4) quasi-error-free bit error
   rate in the presence of stuck-at memory faults for an additive white
   Gaussian noise channel.}},

Abstract = {{Polylactide (PLA) suffers from poor processability due to its low melt
   strength and slow crystallization kinetics and it is thus very
   challenging to achieve uniformly distributed fine-celled PLA foams with
   high void fractions in injection molding process. In this work, the
   low-pressure structural foam molding of linear PLA with a relatively
   high void fraction of approximate to 30\% was conducted and by fine
   tuning the talc content and the foaming and processing parameters, a
   relatively uniform fine-celled structure with improved cell size and
   cell density was successfully produced. The effects of twin-screw
   compounding and the addition of talc on the foaming behavior, structural
   uniformity, crystallinity, and mechanical properties of the solid and
   foamed PLA samples were investigated. The results showed that the
   addition of 5wt.\% talc significantly improved the foaming properties
   such as cell density, cell size, structural uniformity, and consequently
   improved the mechanical properties of foams. The twin-screw compounding
   before injection molding did not significantly change the foaming
   behavior, but adversely affected the mechanical properties of the solid
   and foamed PLA samples due to mechanical and thermal degradation. The
   changes in the mechanical properties were discussed in terms of the
   crystallinity, talc toughening effect, and foam quality.}},

Title = {{Modeling the impact of public access defibrillator range on public
   location cardiac arrest coverage}},
Journal = {{RESUSCITATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Background: Public access defibrillation with automated external
   defibrillators (AEDs) can improve survival from out-of-hospital cardiac
   arrests (OHCA) occurring in public. Increasing the effective range of
   AEDs may improve coverage for public location OHCAs.
   Objective: To quantify the relationship between AED effective range and
   public location cardiac arrest coverage.
   Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study using the Resuscitation
   Outcomes Consortium Epistry database. We included all public-location,
   atraumatic, EMS-attended OHCAs in Toronto, Canada between December 16,
   2005 and July 15, 2010. We ran a mathematical model for AED placement
   that maximizes coverage of historical public OHCAs given pre-specified
   values of AED effective range and the number of locations to place AEDs.
   Locations of all non-residential buildings were obtained from the City
   of Toronto and used as candidate sites for AED placement. Coverage was
   evaluated for range values from 10 to 300 m and number of AED locations
   from 10 to 200, both in increments of 10, for a total of 600 unique
   scenarios. Coverage from placing AEDs in all public buildings was also
   measured.
   Results: There were 1310 public location OHCAs during the study period,
   with 25,851 non-residential buildings identified as candidate sites for
   AED placement. Cardiac arrest coverage increased with AED effective
   range, with improvements in coverage diminishing at higher ranges. For
   example, for a deployment of 200 AED locations, increasing effective
   range from 100 m to 200 m covered an additional 15\% of cardiac arrests,
   whereas increasing range further from 200 m to 300 m covered an
   additional 10\%. Placing an AED in each of the 25,851 public buildings
   resulted in coverage of 50\% and 95\% under assumed effective ranges of
   50 m and 300 m, respectively.
   Conclusion: Increasing AED effective range can improve cardiac arrest
   coverage. Mathematical models can help evaluate the potential impact of
   initiatives which increase AED range. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Title = {{An Investigation of Discontinuity Roughness Scale Dependency Using

Journal = {{ROCK MECHANICS AND ROCK ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{657-681}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The influence of roughness on the hydro-mechanical behavior of rock
   discontinuities has long been recognized. As a result, several
   definitions and measures of roughness have been developed. According to
   the ISRM (Int J Rock Mech Min Sci Geomech Abstr 15(6):319-368, 1978),
   discontinuity roughness comprises large-scale (waviness) and small-scale
   (unevenness) components. However, the division between these scales is
   not clear and most investigations of surface roughness have been
   restricted to small fracture surfaces (< 1 m(2)). Hence, the large-scale
   components of roughness are often neglected. Furthermore, these
   investigations typically define roughness using two-dimensional profiles
   rather than three-dimensional surfaces, which can lead to biased
   estimates of roughness. These limitations have led to some contradictory
   findings regarding roughness scale dependency (scale effects). This
   paper aims to provide some explanation of these contradictory findings.
   Through the in situ digitization and analysis of two adjacent
   large-scale (2 x 3 m(2) and 2 x 2 m(2)) migmatitic-gneiss fracture
   surfaces, the influence of sample size on roughness estimates are
   investigated. In addition, the influence of measurement resolution on
   roughness estimates is investigated by digitizing small-scale (100 x 100
   mm(2)) samples from the same fracture with varying resolution. The
   findings show roughness to increase as a function of the sampling window
   size, in contrast to what is commonly assumed. That is, the combined
   waviness and unevenness of a discontinuity relative to its mean plane
   increases with scale. Compared to the sampling window size, the
   resolution of surface measurements is shown to have a far greater
   influence on roughness estimates. This influence of measurement
   resolution may explain some of the contradictory roughness scale
   relationships that have been published previously. It is important to
   note that the observed decrease in shear strength with increasing scale,
   as observed in many prior studies, is not being questioned; rather, a
   clarification of the role of roughness in this phenomenon is sought.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The results of hydro-mechanical and thermo-hydro-mechanical experiments
   on Cobourg limestone are presented here. Experiments were performed
   within geophysically instrumented Hoek-type cell under hydrostatic and
   deviatoric stresses, controlled at ambient temperature (25 degrees C)
   and elevated in-situ temperatures up to 150 degrees C. Variations and
   differences in the evolution of V-P and V-S during various stages of
   each experiment correspond to the heterogeneous and anisotropic nature
   of tested specimens. V-S is influenced by micro-thermal damages caused
   by the heating stage more than V-P. Whereas the latter proves to be more
   sensitive to the progressive fracture growth leading to rock failure
   during deviatoric loading stage. Both the elastic wave velocities are a
   better means to recognize earlier effect of dilatancy than what is shown
   by volumetric strain curve. The permeability decreases after heating
   stage and starts to increase beyond compaction and after emergence of
   axial cracking. This study shows that there exists a self-consistent
   behavior among the evolution of seismic wave velocities with the
   hydrostatic stresses, heating stages, deviatoric stress increments,
   deformational patterns, and transport properties of tested specimens.
   These complicated experiments are crucial to model various stages of HM
   and THM conditions and understand the relationships between various
   types of stress in relation to the deformational responses of
   argillaceous rocks. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new model for availability maximization
   under partial observations for maintenance applications. Compared with
   the widely studied cost minimization models, few structural results are
   known about the form of the optimal control policy for availability
   maximization models. We consider a failing system with unobservable
   operational states. Only the failure state is observable. System
   deterioration is driven by an unobservable, continuous-time homogeneous
   Markov process. Multivariate condition monitoring data which is
   stochastically related to the unobservable state of the system is
   collected at equidistant sampling epochs and is used to update the
   posterior state distribution for decision making. Preventive maintenance
   can be carried out at any sampling epoch, and corrective maintenance is
   carried out upon system failure. The objective is to determine the form
   of the optimal control policy that maximizes the long-run expected
   average availability per unit time. We formulate the problem as an
   optimal stopping problem with partial information. Under standard
   assumptions, we prove that a control limit policy is optimal. A
   computational algorithm is developed, illustrated by numerical results.}},

Title = {{An integrated modelling approach to estimate urban traffic emissions}},

Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{81-91}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{An integrated modelling approach is adopted to estimate microscale urban
   traffic emissions. The modelling framework consists of a traffic
   microsimulation model developed in PARAMICS, a microscopic emissions
   model (Comprehensive Modal Emissions Model), and two dispersion models,
   AERMOD and the Quick Urban and Industrial Complex (QUIC). This framework
   is applied to a traffic network in downtown Toronto, Canada to evaluate
   summer time morning peak traffic emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and
   nitrogen oxides (NOx) during five weekdays at a traffic intersection.
   The model predicted results are validated against sensor observations
   with 100\% of the AERMOD modelled CO concentrations and 97.5\% of the
   QUIC modelled NOx concentrations within a factor of two of the
   corresponding observed concentrations. Availability of local estimates
   of ambient concentration is useful for accurate comparisons of predicted
   concentrations with observed concentrations. Predicted and sensor
   measured concentrations are significantly lower than the hourly
   threshold Maximum Acceptable Levels for CO (31 ppm, similar to 90 times
   lower) and NO2 (0.4 mg/m(3), similar to 12 times lower), within the
   National Ambient Air Quality Objectives established by Environment

Abstract = {{Accurate alignment of femoral shaft fractures treated with
   intramedullary nailing remains a challenge for orthopaedic surgeons. The
   aim of this study is to develop and validate a cone-beam CT-based,
   semi-automated algorithm to quantify the malalignment in six degrees of
   freedom (6D0F) using a surface matching and principal axes-based
   approach. Complex comminuted diaphyseal fractures were created in nine
   cadaveric femora and cone-beam Cr images were acquired (27 cases total).
   Scans were cropped and segmented using intensity-based thresholding,
   producing superior, inferior and comminution volumes. Cylinders were fit
   to estimate the long axes of the superior and inferior fragments. The
   angle and distance between the two cylindrical axes were calculated to
   determine flexion/extension and varus/valgus angulation and
   medial/lateral and anterior/posterior translations, respectively. Both
   surfaces were unwrapped about the cylindrical axes. Three methods of
   matching the unwrapped surface for determination of periaxial rotation
   were compared based on minimizing the distance between features. The
   calculated corrections were compared to the input malalignment
   conditions. All 6DOF were calculated to within current clinical
   tolerances for all but two cases. This algorithm yielded accurate
   quantification of malalignment of femoral shaft fractures for fracture
   gaps up to 60 mm, based on a single CBCT image of the fractured limb.

Abstract = {{A procedure for estimating the peak response of SDOF systems equipped

   readily implemented in a computer script. Nonlinear time-history
   analyses demonstrated that the proposed method makes significantly more
   reliable predictions than other common equivalent linearization methods
   for systems with supplemental dampers. Using the proposed procedure,
   performance spectra, which are plots of normalized response of SDOF
   systems with dampers, can be generated for practical performance-based
   design. To obtain a more complete description of the system performance,
   a simplified method for estimating the residual drift is also verified
   using results of extensive nonlinear time-history analyses. Copyright

Abstract = {{Security issues in cyber-physical systems are of paramount importance
   due to the often safety critical nature of its associated applications.
   A first step in understanding how to protect such systems requires an
   understanding of emergent weaknesses, in part, due to the cyber-physical
   coupling. In this paper, we present a framework that models a class of
   cyber-physical switching vulnerabilities in smart grid systems. Variable
   structure system theory is employed to effectively characterize the
   cyber-physical interaction of the smart grid and demonstrate how
   existence of the switching vulnerability is dependent on the local
   structure of the power grid. We identify and demonstrate how through
   successful cyber intrusion and local knowledge of the grid an opponent
   can compute and apply a coordinated switching sequence to a circuit
   breaker to disrupt operation within a short interval of time. We
   illustrate the utility of the attack approach empirically on the Western
   Electricity Coordinating Council three-machine, nine-bus system under
   both model error and partial state information.}},

Abstract = {{The hippocampus is a neuroanatomical structure that has been widely
   studied in the context of learning, memory, stress, and
   neurodegeneration. Neuroanatomically, the hippocampus is subdivided into
   several subfields with intricate morphologies and complex
   three-dimensional relationships. Recent studies have demonstrated that
   the identification of different subfields is possible with
   high-resolution and -contrast image volumes acquired using ex vivo
   specimens in a small bore 9.4 T scanner and, more recently, in vivo, at
   7 T. In these studies, the neuroanatomical definitions of boundaries
   between subfields are based upon salient differences in image contrast.
   Typically, the definition of subfields has not been possible using
   commonly available magnetic resonance (MR) scanners (i.e.: 15 or 3 T)
   due to resolution and contrast limitations. To overcome the limited
   availability of post-mortem specimens and expertise in state-of-the-art
   high-field imaging, we propose a coupling of MR acquisition and detailed
   segmentation techniques that allow for the reliable identification of
   hippocampal anatomy (including subfields). High-resolution and -contrast
   T1- and T2-weighted image volumes were acquired from 5 volunteers (2
   male; 3 female; age range: 29-57, avg. 37) using a clinical
   research-grade 3 T scanner and have final super-sampled isotropic voxel
   dimensions of 0.3 mm. We demonstrate that by using these acquisition
   techniques, our data results in contrast-to-noise ratios that compare
   well with high-resolution images acquired with long scan times using
   post-mortem data at higher field strengths. For the subfields, the
   cornus ammonis (CA) 1, CA2/CA3, CA4/dentate gyrus, stratum
   radiatum/stratum lacunosum/stratum moleculare, and subiculum were all
   labeled as separate structures. Hippocampal volumes are reported for
   each of the substructures and the hippocampus as a whole (range for
   hippocampus: 2456.72-3325.02 mm(3)). Intra-rater reliability of our
   manual segmentation protocol demonstrates high reliability for the whole
   hippocampus (mean Dice Kappa of 0.91; range 0.90-0.92) and for each of
   the subfields (range of Dice Kappas: 0.64-0.83). We demonstrate that our
   reliability is better than the Dice Kappas produced by simulating the
   following errors: a translation by a single voxel in all cardinal
   directions and 1\% volumetric shrinkage and expansion. The completed
   hippocampal atlases are available freely online
   (info2.camh.net/kf-tigr/index.php/Hippocampus) and can be coupled with
   novel computational neuroanatomy techniques that will allow for them to
   be customized to the unique neuroanatomy of different subjects, and
   ultimately be utilized in different analysis pipelines. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this work, Cu-Co-gadolinia doped ceria (GDC) anode coatings were
   fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) of agglomerated CuO,
   Co3O4, and GDC feedstock powders. Screening tests were conducted to
   identify the effect of plasma gas composition on the coating phases,
   microstructure, and absolute deposition efficiency of each material.
   Based on screening tests, optimized plasma energy conditions were
   identified. Using the absolute deposition efficiency, feedstock powder
   mixing ratios were determined to produce anode coatings with Cu-Co
   weight ratios of Cu(100)-Co(0), Cu(90)-Co(10), Cu(70) -Co(30), and
   Cu(50)-Co(50), with 40 vol\% of metal phases in the coating and 60 vol\%
   of GDC. After reduction of the coatings, porosity and gas permeability
   were determined. Finally, carbon deposition behavior was examined by
   measuring the weight gain of the coatings after exposure to CH4 at 700
   degrees C for 3 h. The coatings demonstrated good resistance to carbon
   deposition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Detailed chemical characterization of unresolved complex mixtures in
   atmospheric organics: Insights into emission sources, atmospheric
   processing, and secondary organic aerosol formation}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies suggest that semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) are
   important precursors to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in urban
   atmospheres. However, knowledge of the chemical composition of SVOCs is
   limited by current analytical techniques, which are typically unable to
   resolve a large number of constitutional isomers. Using a combination of
   gas chromatography and soft photoionization mass spectrometry, we
   characterize the unresolved complex mixture (UCM) of semivolatile
   aliphatic hydrocarbons observed in Pasadena, California (similar to 16km
   NE of downtown Los Angeles), and Bakersfield, California, during the
   California Research at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change 2010.
   To the authors' knowledge, this work represents the most detailed
   characterization of the UCM in atmospheric samples to date. Knowledge of
   molecular structures, including carbon number, alkyl branching, and
   number of rings, provides important constraints on the rate of
   atmospheric processing, as the relative amounts of branched and linear
   alkanes are shown to be a function of integrated exposure to hydroxyl
   radicals. Emissions of semivolatile branched alkanes from fossil
   fuel-related sources are up to an order of magnitude higher than those
   of linear alkanes, and the gas-phase OH rate constants of branched
   alkanes are similar to 30\% higher than their linear isomers. Based on a
   box model considering gas/particle partitioning, emissions, and reaction
   rates, semivolatile branched alkanes are expected to play a more
   important role than linear alkanes in the photooxidation of the UCM and
   subsequent transformations into SOA. Detailed speciation of semivolatile
   compounds therefore provides essential understanding of SOA sources and
   formation processes in urban areas.}},

Title = {{Quantum hacking of a continuous-variable quantum-key-distribution system
   using a wavelength attack}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{The security proofs of continuous-variable quantum key distribution are
   based on the assumptions that the eavesdropper can neither act on the
   local oscillator nor control Bob's beam splitter. These assumptions may
   be invalid in practice due to potential imperfections in the
   implementations of such protocols. In this paper, we consider the
   problem of transmitting the local oscillator in a public channel and
   propose a wavelength attack which allows the eavesdropper to control the
   intensity transmission of Bob's beam splitter by switching the
   wavelength of the input light. Specifically we target
   continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems that use the
   heterodyne detection protocol using either direct or reverse
   reconciliation. Our attack is proved to be feasible and renders all of
   the final keys shared between the legitimate parties insecure, even if
   they have monitored the intensity of the local oscillator. To prevent
   our attack on commercial systems, a simple wavelength filter should be
   randomly added before performing monitoring detection.}},

   network in nanocomposites}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the effect of carbon nanotube (CNT) geometry upon
   the electrical properties of the corresponding functionalized
   nanocomposites. Specifically, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are conducted
   to evaluate the effect of CNT length non-uniformity and waviness upon
   tunneling. Three aspects of the work are considered. The first is
   concerned with the application of periodic boundary condition that
   ensures periodic connectivity of the percolating paths via the use of an
   improved connective percolating network recognition scheme. The second
   is concerned with the determination of the electrical conductivity of
   the percolated system rather than the critical percolation threshold for
   varied CNT geometries using Weibull distribution to statistically
   account for the geometry variations. The third is concerned with the
   validation of our MC simulations. Our results reveal that (i) the CNT
   geometry, as determined by CNT length variability and waviness, plays a
   more dominant role in percolation threshold rather than tunneling
   barrier height and (ii) higher CNT loading beyond a critical percolation
   significantly influences the role of tunneling barrier height upon the
   electrical conductivity. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},

Abstract = {{Quantum random-number generators (QRNGs) can offer a means to generate
   information-theoretically provable random numbers, in principle. In
   practice, unfortunately, the quantum randomness is inevitably mixed with
   classical randomness due to classical noises. To distill this quantum
   randomness, one needs to quantify the randomness of the source and apply
   a randomness extractor. Here, we propose a generic framework for
   evaluating quantum randomness of real-life QRNGs by min-entropy, and
   apply it to two different existing quantum random-number systems in the
   literature. Moreover, we provide a guideline of QRNG data postprocessing
   for which we implement two information-theoretically provable randomness
   extractors: Toeplitz-hashing extractor and Trevisan's extractor.}},

Abstract = {{A stochastic fuzzy multi-objective programming model is developed for

   stochastic data and fuzzy set theory is used to handle fuzzy data. An
   algorithm is designed to solve the proposed integrated model. The new
   model is solved using the proposed algorithm for a three stage supply
   chain example. Computation suggests an analysis of risk averse and
   procurement behavior, which indicates that a more risk-averse customer
   prefers to order less under uncertainty and risk. Trade-off game
   analysis yields supported points on the trade-off curve, which can help
   decision makers to identify proper weighting scheme where Pareto optimum

Abstract = {{Steam is commonly used in polymer bead foam sintering due to its high
   heat transfer capacity. However, the pressure loss unavoidable during
   flow through the beads causes a temperature decrease and thereby
   negatively affects the sintering behavior. In order to reduce the
   sensitivity of the temperature to the pressure variation, hot air was
   added to the steam line. The effects of the flow rate, the pressure, and
   the temperature of the hot air on the surface roughness, thermal
   properties, and mechanical properties of the molded products were
   studied. The results showed that the introduction of hot air at a flow
   rate of 120 L/min decreased the total steaming time by about 32\%.
   Further, a decrease of 16 degrees C in the processing temperature was

Abstract = {{Designers of electronic devices and telecommunications equipment have
   used different methods (e.g., three-dimensional chip architecture,
   comprised of a vertically integrated stack of chips) to increase the
   number of transistors on integrated circuits. These latest chips
   generate excessive amounts of heat and thus can reach unacceptably high
   temperatures. In this context, this research aims to develop thermally
   conductive liquid crystal polymer (LCP)-hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)
   composite films to replace the traditionally used Kapton films that
   satisfy the electrical insulation requirements for the attachment of
   heat sinks to the chips without compromising the heat dissipation
   performance. Experimental simulations show that the maximum temperature
   of the heater mounted with a hybrid heat sink reduced with increased hBN
   content. Furthermore, a sufficient slow cooling process in the
   fabrication stage of the LCP/hBN composite films promotes the
   fibrillation of LCP matrix, leading to highly ordered structure and
   promoted the composite's heat dissipation ability.}},

Abstract = {{Reactions between ozone and terpenoids produce numerous products, some
   of which may form secondary organic aerosol (SOA). This work
   investigated the contribution to gas-phase SOA formation of ozone
   reactions with surface-sorbed D-limonene, which is common indoors. A
   model framework was developed to predict SOA mass formation because of
   ozone/terpenoid surface reactions,, and it was used with steady state
   experiments in a 283 L chamber to determine the aerosol mass fraction of
   SOA resulting from surface reactions, xi(s) (the ratio of mass of SOA
   formed and mass of ozone consumed by ozone/terpenoid surface reactions),
   for ozone/D-limonene reactions on stainless steel. The xi(s) =
   0.70-0.91, with lower relative humidity leading to both higher mass and
   number formation. Also, surface reactions promoted nucleation more than
   gas phase reactions, and number formation due to surface reactions and
   gas phase reactions were 126-339 and 51.1-60.2 no./cm(3) per mu g/m(3)
   of formed SOA, respectively. We also used the model framework to predict
   that indoor spaces in which ozone/D-limonene surface reactions would
   likely lead to meaningful gas phase SOA formation are those with
   surfaces that have low original reactivity with ozone, such as glass,
   sealed materials, or smooth metals.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogels are used to create 3D microenvironments with properties that
   direct cell function. The current study demonstrates the versatility of
   hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogels with independent control over
   hydrogel properties such as mechanics, architecture, and the spatial
   distribution of biological factors. Hydrogels were prepared by reacting
   furan-modified HA with bis-maleimide-poly(ethylene glycol) in a
   Diels-Alder click reaction. Biomolecules were photopatterned into the
   hydrogel by two-photon laser processing, resulting in spatially defined
   growth factor gradients. The Young's modulus was controlled by either
   changing the hydrogel concentration or the furan substitution on the HA
   backbone, thereby decoupling the hydrogel concentration from mechanical
   properties. Porosity was controlled by cryogelation, and the pore size
   distribution, by the thaw temperature. The addition of galactose further
   influenced the porosity, pore size, and Young's modulus of the cryogels.
   These HA-based hydrogels offer a tunable platform with a diversity of
   properties for directing cell function, with applications in tissue
   engineering and regenerative medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Abrasive jet micro-machining (AJM) uses a high velocity particle jet to
   erode features in target substrates for a variety of applications,
   including micro-electro-mechanical and micro-fluidic device fabrication.
   The roughness of micro-channels for micro-fluidic applications made
   using AJM can affect fluid flow phenomena such as separation efficiency,
   electro-osmotic mobility and solute dispersion. Moreover, surface
   roughness plays a major role in micro-scale adhesion contact in MEMS and
   light scattering in optoelectronics devices.
   This paper presents experimental data on the effect of particle size,
   velocity, and angle of attack on the roughness of unmasked channels
   machined in borosilicate glass using AJM. Single impact experiments were
   conducted to quantify the damage due to the individual alumina
   particles. Based on these observations, the assumed location of lateral
   crack initiation in a relatively simple analytical model from the
   literature was modified, and used to predict the roughness and erosion
   rate. The previous model, which calculated an areal roughness, was also
   modified to yield a 20 linear value of R-a so that it could be compared
   with linear profilometer scans. This modified model predicted the
   steady-state roughness and erosion rate of unmasked channels with
   average errors of 36\% and 73\%, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Abrasive jet micro-machining (AJM) utilizes the impact of particles in
   high-speed air jets to erode ductile or brittle target surfaces and
   produce micro-scale features such as channels and holes, as well as
   planar areas of controlled depth. The roughness of micro-channels for
   micro-fluidic applications made using AJM can affect fluid flow
   phenomena such as separation efficiency, electro-osmotic mobility and
   solute dispersion. Moreover, surface roughness plays a major role in
   microscale adhesion contact in MEMS and light scattering in
   optoelectronics devices. A numerical model was developed to simulate the
   brittle erosion process leading to the creation of unmasked channels as
   a function of particle size, velocity, dose, impact angle and target
   material properties. For the first time, erosion was simulated using
   models of two damage mechanisms: crater removal due to the formation and
   growth of lateral cracks, and edge chipping. Accuracy was further
   enhanced by simulating the actual relationship between particle size,
   velocity and radial location within the jet using distributions measured
   with high-speed laser shadowgraphy. Comparisons with experimental data
   showed that the model can predict the average roughness of the
   centerline of channels machined on borosilcate glass with 9\% average
   error over a wide range of particle kinetic energies. The simulation
   also allowed for the first time the prediction of surface profile
   waviness and the transient roughness leading to a steady-state. The
   numerical model predicted the glass erosion rate with an average error
   of 29\% for a broad range of AJM process conditions. The results
   indicated that the main erosion mechanism in the AJM of borosilicate
   glass was chip removal by lateral cracking. Edge chipping normally
   occurred when the impact angle was small and a particle impact occurred
   on an eroded surface near the apex of a peak, resulting in the removal
   of a relatively small portion of the peak. Thus, edge chipping
   contributed to profile smoothing and less so to erosion. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We have successfully developed a C60:LiF/BCP (bathocuproine)
   bilayer-buffer structure to optimize both the light absorption
   enhancement and the exciton-blocking at the cathode interface of a small
   molecular photovoltaic cell based on the archetypical CuPc/C60
   structure. The function of the C60:LiF layer is to serve as an optical
   spacer and is found to yield a peak power conversion efficiency (PCE)
   with a 50 wt.\% LiF at a thickness of 30 nm. A BCP layer is added
   between the optimized C60:LiF layer and the Al metal electrode to
   function as a barrier for excitons. This combined bilayer-buffer
   structure yields an optimal performance in short circuit current (Jsc)
   and PCE. A detailed study using a single carrier electron-only structure
   and a numerical simulation of optical electric-field distribution
   suggests that C60:LiF layer enhances light absorption at long
   wavelengths. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{FGFRL1 is a newly identified member of the fibroblast growth factor
   receptor (FGFR) family expressed in adult pancreas. Unlike canonical
   FGFRs that initiate signaling via tyrosine kinase domains, the short
   intracellular sequence of FGFRL1 consists of a putative Src homology
   domain-2 (SH2)-binding motif adjacent to a histidine-rich C terminus. As
   a consequence of nonexistent kinase domains, FGFRL1 has been postulated
   to act as a decoy receptor to inhibit canonical FGFR ligand-induced
   signaling. In pancreatic islet beta-cells, canonical FGFR1 signaling
   affects metabolism and insulin processing. This study determined
   beta-cell expression of FGFRL1 as well as consequent effects on FGFR1
   signaling and biological responses. We confirmed FGFRL1 expression at
   the plasma membrane and within distinct intracellular granules of both
   primary beta-cells and beta TC3 cells. Fluorescent protein-tagged FGFRL1
   (RL1) induced a significant ligand-independent increase in MAPK
   signaling. Removal of the histidine-rich domain (RL1-Delta His) or
   entire intracellular sequence (RL1-Delta C) resulted in greater
   retention at the plasma membrane and significantly reduced
   ligand-independent ERK1/2 responses. The SHP-1 phosphatase was
   identified as an RL1-binding substrate. Point mutation of the
   SH2-binding motif reduced the ability of FGFRL1 to bind SHP-1 and
   activate ERK1/2 but did not affect receptor localization to insulin
   secretory granules. Finally, overexpression of RL1 increased cellular
   insulin content and matrix adhesion. Overall, these data suggest that
   FGFRL1 does not function as a decoy receptor in beta-cells, but rather
   it enhances ERK1/2 signaling through association of SHP-1 with the
   receptor's intracellular SH2-binding motif.}},

Abstract = {{Previous investigations of the core gene regulatory circuitry that
   controls the pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells have largely
   focused on the roles of transcription, chromatin and non-coding RNA
   regulators(1-3). Alternative splicing represents a widely acting mode of
   gene regulation(4-8), yet its role in regulating ES-cell pluripotency
   and differentiation is poorly understood. Here we identify the
   muscleblind-like RNA binding proteins, MBNL1 and MBNL2, as conserved and
   direct negative regulators of a large program of cassette exon
   alternative splicing events that are differentially regulated between ES
   cells and other cell types. Knockdown of MBNL proteins in differentiated
   cells causes switching to an ES-cell-like alternative splicing pattern
   for approximately half of these events, whereas overexpression of MBNL
   proteins in ES cells promotes differentiated-cell-like alternative
   splicing patterns. Among the MBNL-regulated events is an
   ES-cell-specific alternative splicing switch in the forkhead family
   transcription factor FOXP1 that controls pluripotency(9). Consistent
   with a central and negative regulatory role for MBNL proteins in
   pluripotency, their knockdown significantly enhances the expression of
   key pluripotency genes and the formation of induced pluripotent stem
   cells during somatic cell reprogramming.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the observation of a non-uniform dark count rate in
   Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors (SNSPDs), specifically
   focusing on an afterpulsing effect present when the SNSPD is operated at
   a high bias current regime. The afterpulsing exists for real detection
   events (triggered by input photons) as well as for dark counts (no laser
   input). In our standard set-up, the afterpulsing is most likely to occur
   at around 180 ns following a detection event, for both real counts and
   dark counts. We characterize the afterpulsing behavior and speculate
   that it is not due to the SNSPD itself but rather the amplifiers used to
   boost the electrical output signal from the SNSPD. We show that the
   afterpulsing indeed disappears when we use a different amplifier with a
   better low frequency response. We also examine the short-lived
   enhancement of detection efficiency during the recovery of the SNSPD due
   to temporary perturbation of the bias and grounding conditions. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Solving linear systems of equations is ubiquitous in all areas of

   be intractable for classical computers, as the best known classical
   algorithms require a time proportional to the number of variables N. A
   recently proposed quantum algorithm shows that quantum computers could
   solve linear systems in a time scale of order log(N), giving an
   exponential speedup over classical computers. Here we realize the
   simplest instance of this algorithm, solving 2 x 2 linear equations for
   various input vectors on a quantum computer. We use four quantum bits
   and four controlled logic gates to implement every subroutine required,
   demonstrating the working principle of this algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{A method combining life cycle assessment (LCA) and real options analyses
   is developed to predict project environmental and financial performance
   over time, under market uncertainties and decision-making flexibility.
   The method is applied to examine alternative uses for oil sands coke, a
   carbonaceous byproduct of processing the unconventional petroleum found
   in northern Alberta, Canada. Under uncertainties in natural gas price
   and the imposition of a carbon price, our method identifies that selling
   the coke to China for electricity generation by integrated gasification
   combined cycle is likely to be financially preferred initially, but
   eventually hydrogen production in Alberta is likely to be preferred.
   Compared to the results of a previous study that used life cycle costing
   to identify the financially preferred alternative, the inclusion of real
   options analysis adds value as it accounts for flexibility in
   decision-making (e.g., to delay investment), increasing the project's
   expected net present value by 25\% and decreasing the expected life
   cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 11\%. Different formulations of the
   carbon pricing policy or changes to the natural gas price forecast alter
   these findings. The combined LCA/real options method provides
   researchers and decision-makers with more comprehensive information than
   can be provided by either technique alone}},

Title = {{Solution-based circuits enable rapid and multiplexed pathogen detection}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Electronic readout of markers of disease provides compelling simplicity,
   sensitivity and specificity in the detection of small panels of
   biomarkers in clinical samples; however, the most important emerging
   tests for disease, such as infectious disease speciation and
   antibiotic-resistance profiling, will need to interrogate samples for
   many dozens of biomarkers. Electronic readout of large panels of markers
   has been hampered by the difficulty of addressing large arrays of
   electrode-based sensors on inexpensive platforms. Here we report a new
   concept-solution-based circuits formed on chip-that makes highly
   multiplexed electrochemical sensing feasible on passive chips. The
   solution-based circuits switch the information-carrying signal readout
   channels and eliminate all measurable crosstalk from adjacent,
   biomolecule-specific microsensors. We build chips that feature this
   advance and prove that they analyse unpurified samples successfully, and
   accurately classify pathogens at clinically relevant concentrations. We
   also show that signature molecules can be accurately read 2 minutes
   after sample introduction.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum dot (QD) barcoded microbeads are a promising technology for
   high-throughput biodetection applications. Here we developed QD barcodes
   of a novel formulation to improve the bead stability, fluorescence
   consistency, targeting agents loading, and analytical sensitivity as
   well as to simplify the conjugation process. This novel formulation
   contains a mixed-polymer system in preparing the barcodes and a
   seed-mediated strategy to grow metal nanoshells on the surface of QD
   barcodes. The newly designed barcodes exhibited enhanced stability and a
   two-order improvement in analytical sensitivity compared with barcodes
   without any metal coating. This sensitivity enabled the barcodes to be
   used for multiplexed biosensing, for example, to differentiate the
   deadly malaria pathogen strain Plasmodium falciparum from the less
   lethal Plasmodium vivax specie in a single vial. Such improvements in QD
   barcodes properties will allow this multiplexed detection platform to
   emerge from academic development into broad practical applications. (c)

   Solids}},
Journal = {{ACS NANO}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are attractive materials for inexpensive,
   room-temperature-, and solution-processed optoelectronic devices. A high
   carrier diffusion length is desirable for many OD device applications.
   In this work we develop two new experimental methods to investigate
   charge carrier diffusion in coupled CQD solids under charge-neutral,
   i.e., undepleted, conditions. The methods take advantage of the
   quantum-size-effect tunability of our materials, utilizing a
   smaller-bandgap population of quantum dots as a reporter system. We
   develop analytical models of diffusion in 1D and 3D structures that
   allow direct extraction of diffusion length from convenient parametric
   plots and purely optical measurements. We measure several CQD solids
   fabricated using a number of distinct methods and having significantly
   different doping and surface ligand treatments. We find that CQD
   materials recently reported to achieve a certified power conversion
   efficiency of 7\% with hybrid organic-inorganic passivation have a
   diffusion length of 80 +/- 10 nm. The model further allows us to extract
   the lifetime, trap density, mobility, and diffusion coefficient
   independently in each material system. This work will facilitate further
   progress in extending the diffusion length, ultimately leading to
   high-quality CQD solid semiconducting materials and improved CQD
   optoelectronic devices, including CQD solar cells.}},

Title = {{Mode use and trip length of seniors in Montreal}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{89-99}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Rapid demographic aging in countries around the world has prompted an
   interest in understanding the mobility patterns of seniors. While much
   research has been conducted in terms of motorized modes, the promotion
   of healthy aging argues for new research to investigate the multi-modal
   travel behavior of seniors including active travel. The objective of
   this paper is to investigate the factors that influence the use of two
   motorized and one active mode of transportation, and their corresponding
   trip length. A joint discrete-continuous modeling framework allows us to
   examine the tendency to travel by different modes using a multinomial
   structure, and trip length using a hazard formulation. Data are drawn
   from Montreal's Household Travel Survey of 2008. A broad array of
   covariates related to individual and household attributes and urban form
   are used. The results of the analysis reveal a significant degree of
   geographical variability in the travel behavior of seniors in Montreal.
   In particular, estimates for seniors with different socio-economic and
   demographic profiles show substantial intra-urban variability in walking
   behavior, and the role of neighborhood design attributes in influencing
   the mobility of seniors. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   have driven this impressive performance progress. The highest-efficiency
   approaches rely on a fabrication process that starts with nanocrystals
   in solution, initially capped with long organic molecules. This solution
   is deposited and the resultant film is treated using a solution
   containing a second, shorter capping ligand, leading to a cross-linked,
   non-redispersible, and dense layer. This procedure is repeated, leading
   to the widely employed layer-by-layer solid-state ligand exchange. We
   will review the properties and features of this process, and will also

Abstract = {{Type 304L stainless steel (SS) samples were used to investigate the
   correlation between carbide precipitation and triple junction structure
   derived from crystallographic data obtained by the orientation imaging
   microscopy associated with electron backscattered diffraction. The
   samples were solution treated and annealed at different sensitization
   temperatures/time to introduce various degrees of carbide precipitation
   at the interface region, thus different degrees of selectivity toward
   triple junctions. Four models were used to characterize triple junction
   microstructures: (i) the I-line and U-line model, (ii) the coincident
   axial direction (CAD) model, (iii) the coincident site lattice
   (CSL)/grain boundary (GB) model and (iv) the plane matching (PM)/GB
   model. Among them, the I-line and U-line model is the most effective in
   identifying special triple junctions, i.e., those exhibiting the
   beneficial property of high resistance to carbide precipitation. The
   results showed that the percentage of special triple junctions (I-lines)
   immune to carbide precipitation, increased from 35 to 80\%, as the
   precipitation became more selective toward triple junction structures
   due to the corresponding sensitization heat treatment conditions,
   whereas more than 80\% of random triple junctions (U-lines) exhibited
   susceptibility to carbide precipitation regardless of the sensitization
   conditions.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{465-473}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A novel affinity biosensor is proposed based on the hybrid plasmonic
   platform. The proposed biosensor benefits from the high sensitivity of
   the surface plasmon resonance (SPR), while at the same time, it is
   capable of performing measurements in both the TM and TE polarizations
   (p- and s-polarizations). Unlike the conventional SPR biosensors, the
   polarization diversity of the hybrid sensor allows for decoupling of the
   bulk index variations in the fluidic channels (due to variations in
   concentration, decomposition, temperature, and so on) from the surface
   properties of the attached molecules. Compatibility of the proposed
   hybrid plasmonic biosensor with standard Si-processing techniques and
   the simplicity of its design are other advantages of the sensor which
   makes its fabrication straightforward. The best figure of merit for the
   biosensor is defined based on the minimum detection limit and a genetic
   algorithm is used to optimize the device. A method of de-convolving the
   surface and bulk effects is also discussed.}},

Pages = {{19-27}},

Abstract = {{A systematic study was performed in the laboratory and in the field to
   examine the effect of magnesium oxide additive on deposit accumulation
   and removal. Laboratory results show that the additive has little effect
   on the amount of deposits collected on a probe, but it can make deposits
   easy to remove if a coating layer thicker than 30 mu m can be
   effectively applied on the probe surface. The results also show that
   mixing the additive with black liquor or injecting it separately has no
   significant effect on deposit accumulation and removal. Tests performed
   in a recovery boiler where the additive was continuously injected show
   no evidence for the existence of the coating layer. The magnesium oxide
   content in the boiler deposits varied between 0.1 and 0.4 wt\%, which is
   several times lower than the amount that was found to be effective in
   laboratory tests. Nonetheless, the additive was shown to be effective in
   facilitating deposit removal if it can form a coating layer on
   deposit/tube surfaces. This may be possible by periodically injecting a
   large amount of additive into the boiler for a short period and reducing
   the black liquor firing rate at the same time.}},

   BEAM UNDER TWO-FREQUENCY EXCITATIONS}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This study focuses on the steady-state periodic response and the chaotic
   behavior in the transverse motion of an axially moving viscoelastic
   tensioned beam with two-frequency excitations. The two-frequency
   excitations come from the external harmonic excitation and the
   parametric excitation from harmonic fluctuations of the moving speed. A
   dynamic model is established to include the finite axial support
   rigidity, the material derivative in the viscoelastic constitution
   relation, and the longitudinally varying tension due to the axial
   acceleration. The derived nonlinear integro-partial-differential
   equation of motion possesses space-dependent coefficients. Applying the
   differential quadrature method (DQM) and the integral quadrature method
   (IQM) to the equation of the transverse motion, a set of nonlinear
   ordinary differential equations is obtained. Based on the Runge-Kutta
   time discretization, the time history of the axially moving beam is
   numerically solved for the case of the primary resonance, the
   super-harmonic resonance, and the principal parametric resonance. For
   the first time, the nonlinear dynamics is studied under various
   relations between the forcing frequency and the parametric frequency,
   such as equal, multiple, and incommensurable relationships. The stable
   periodic response and its sensitivity to initial conditions are
   determined using the bidirectional frequency sweep. Furthermore, chaotic
   motions are identified using different methods including the Poincare
   map, the maximum Lyapunov exponent, the fast Fourier transforms, and the
   initial value sensitivity. Numerical simulations reveal the
   characteristics of the periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic motion of a
   nonlinear axially moving beam under two-frequency excitations.}},

Abstract = {{Periodontal diseases cause the breakdown of the tooth-supporting
   gingival tissue. In treatments aimed at gingival tissue regeneration,
   tissue engineering is preferred over the common treatments such as
   scaling. Perfused (dynamic) culture has been shown to increase cell
   growth in tissue-engineered scaffolds. Since gingival tissues are highly
   vascularized, it was desired to investigate the influence of perfusion
   on the function of human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) when cultured in a
   degradable/polar/hydrophobic/ionic polyurethane scaffold during the
   early culture phase (4 weeks) of engineering gingival tissues. It was
   observed that the growth of HGF was continuous over 28 days in dynamic
   culture (3-fold increase, p < 0.05), while it was reduced after 14 days
   in static culture (i.e. no flow condition). Cell metabolic activity, as
   measured by a WST-1 assay, and total protein production show that HGF
   were in different metabolic states in the dynamic vs. static cultures.
   Observations from scanning electron microscopy and type I collagen (Col
   I) production measured by Western blotting suggest that medium perfusion
   significantly promoted collagen production in HGF after the first 4
   weeks of culture (p < 0.05). The different proliferative and metabolic
   states for HGF in the perfused scaffolds suggest a different cell
   phenotype which may favour tissue regeneration. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{We propose a new field-programmable gate array (FPGA) routing approach,
   which, when combined with a low-cost architecture change, results in a
   40\% reduction in router runtime, at the cost of a 6\% area overhead and
   with no increase in critical path delay. Our approach begins with
   PathFinder-style routing, which we run on a coarsened representation of
   the routing architecture. This leads to fast generation of a partial
   routing solution where the signals are assigned to groups of wire
   segments rather than individual wire segments. A Boolean satisfiability
   (SAT)-based stage follows, generating a legal routing solution from the
   partial solution. We explore approximately 165 000 FPGA switch block
   architectures, showing that the choice of the architecture has a
   significant impact on the complexity of the SAT formulation, and by
   extension, on routing runtime. Our approach points to a new research
   direction, namely, reducing FPGA computer-aided design runtime by
   exploring FPGA architectures and algorithms together.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: The targeting efficiency of folate receptor-alpha
   (FR-alpha)-targeted high-density lipoprotein nanoparticles (HDL NPs) was
   evaluated in a syngeneic mouse model of ovarian cancer. Materials \&
   methods: Folic acid was conjugated to the surface of fluorescent-labeled
   HDL NPs. In vivo tumor targeting of folic acid-HDL NPs and HDL NPs were
   evaluated in mice with metastatic ovarian cancer following intravenous
   or intraperitoneal (ip.) administration. Results \& discussion:
   Intravenous FR-alpha-targeted HDL resulted in high uptake of the
   fluorescent nanoparticle in host liver and spleen. The ip. injection of
   fluorescent HDL produced moderate fluorescence throughout the abdomen.
   Conversely, animals receiving the ip. FR-alpha-targeted HDL showed a
   high fluorescence signal in ovarian tumors, surpassing that seen in all
   of the host tissues. Conclusion: The authors' findings demonstrate that
   the combination of local-regional ip. administration and
   FR-alpha-directed nanoparticles provides an enhanced approach to
   selectively targeting ovarian cancer cells for drug treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The esterases and lipases from the alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily
   exhibit an enormous sequence diversity, fold plasticity, and activities.
   Here, we present the comprehensive sequence and biochemical analyses of
   seven distinct esterases and lipases from the metagenome of Lake Arreo,
   an evaporite karstic lake in Spain (42 degrees 46' N, 2 degrees 59' W;
   altitude, 655 m). Together with oligonucleotide usage patterns and
   BLASTP analysis, our study of esterases/lipases mined from Lake Arreo
   suggests that its sediment contains moderately halophilic and
   cold-adapted proteobacteria containing DNA fragments of distantly
   related plasmids or chromosomal genomic islands of plasmid and phage
   origins. This metagenome encodes esterases/lipases with broad substrate
   profiles (tested over a set of 101 structurally diverse esters) and
   habitat-specific characteristics, as they exhibit maximal activity at
   alkaline pH (8.0 to 8.5) and temperature of 16 to 40 degrees C, and they
   are stimulated (1.5 to 2.2 times) by chloride ions (0.1 to 1.2 M),
   reflecting an adaptation to environmental conditions. Our work provides
   further insights into the potential significance of the Lake Arreo
   esterases/lipases for biotechnology processes (i.e., production of
   enantiomers and sugar esters), because these enzymes are salt tolerant
   and are active at low temperatures and against a broad range of
   substrates. As an example, the ability of a single protein to hydrolyze
   triacylglycerols, (non) halogenated alkyl and aryl esters, cinnamoyl and
   carbohydrate esters, lactones, and chiral epoxides to a similar extent
   was demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a three-terminal Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) and

   Transfer Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) cell. The
   proposed cell is shown to have guaranteed read-disturbance immunity;
   during a read operation, the net torque acting on the storage cell
   always acts in a direction to refresh the data stored in the cell. A
   simulation study is then performed to compare the merits of the proposed
   device against a conventional 1-Transistor-1-MTJ (1T1MTJ) cell, as well
   as a differential 2-Transistor 2-MTJ (2T2MTJ) cell. We also investigate
   In-Plane Anisotropy (IPA) and Perpendicular-to-Plane Anisotropy (PPA)
   versions of the proposed device. Simulation results confirm that the
   proposed device offers disturbance-free read operation while still
   offering significant performance advantages over the conventional 1T1MTJ

Abstract = {{We study a joint replenishment and delivery scheduling (JRD) problem in
   which a central warehouse serves n-retailers in the presence of vague
   operational conditions such as ordering cost and inventory holding cost.
   In the proposed fuzzy set-based approach, an exact membership function
   is not assumed and instead can be approximated using piecewise linear
   functions based on alpha level sets because of their easy handling and
   efficiency. Subsequently, the fuzzy total cost is defuzzified by the
   widely used signed distance method to ranking fuzzy numbers. However,
   due to the JRD's difficult mathematical properties, efficient and
   effective solution procedures for the problem have eluded researchers.
   To find an optimal solution, an effective and efficient differential
   evolution (DE) algorithm is designed. After determining the appropriate
   parameters of the DE by parameter tuning test, the effectiveness of the
   DE is verified by numerical examples. We compare the DE with the
   available best approach and results show that DE can solve this
   non-deterministic polynomial hard problem in a robust way with a high
   convergence rate and low average error.}},

Title = {{Impact of T2 decay on carotid artery wall thickness measurements}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the impact of T2 relaxation of the carotid wall
   on measurements of its thickness. Materials and Methods: The common
   carotid artery wall was imaged using a spin echo sequence acquired at
   four echo times (17 ms to 68 ms) in 65 participants as part of VALIDATE
   study. Images were acquired transverse to the artery 1.5 cm proximal to
   the flow divider. Mean wall thickness, mean wall signal intensity, lumen
   area, and outer wall area were measured for each echo. Contours were
   also traced on the image from the fourth echo and then propagated to the
   images from the preceding echoes. This was repeated using the image from
   the first echo. Mean wall signal intensity measurements at the four echo
   times were fit to a mono-exponential decay curve to derive the mean T2
   relaxation time for each set of contours. Results: Mean wall thickness
   decreased with increasing echo time, with an average thickness reduction
   of 8.6\% between images acquired at the first and last echo times (TE)
   (0.93 mm at TE 17 ms versus 0.85 mm at TE 68 ms, P < 0.001). Average T2
   relaxation time of the carotid wall decreased by 3\% when the smaller
   contours from the last echo were used, which excluded the outer-most
   layer (54.3 +/- 7.6 ms versus 52.7 +/- 6.6 ms, P = 0.03). Conclusion:
   Carotid wall thickness measurements decrease with echo time as expected
   by the fast T2 relaxation time of the outer-most layer, namely the
   adventitia. A short echo time is needed for thickness measurements to
   include adventitia, which plays an important role in plaque development.

Abstract = {{Generating synthetic physiological signals using information extracted
   from real world physiological signals plays an important role in the
   field of medical device development and education. Most of the existing
   approaches are limited in the sense that they either focus on a
   particular physiological signal or lack flexibility in generating
   signals that mimic real world scenarios. In this paper, we present a
   cubic B-Spline interpolator-based flexible signal generator intended for
   simulating a variety of physiological signals. A simulated artifact
   generator (SAG) is also included in the proposed scheme to add artifacts
   to the physiological signals mimicking signal deviations associated with
   real world scenarios. In addition, the proposed method offers the
   ability to easily present a parametric representation to model a
   case-specific physiological signal. To demonstrate the ability of the
   proposed method, case studies on electromyogram (EMG), electro-oculogram
   (EOG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) during ventricular fibrillation are
   presented. Using a database of 20 ECG signals, the proposed approach was
   compared with an existing-model-based method and the results confirm the
   flexibility of our proposed approach as well as higher signal
   reproduction accuracy (a mean root mean square error improvement of
   47.9\% for waveform-based modeling and 4.3\% for parametric-based
   modeling).}},

Abstract = {{Non-ideal or fractional wettability conditions may exist at field sites.
   It was hypothesized that fractional wettability could cause larger
   entrapped LNAPL saturations and unexpected soil interactions during
   surfactant remediation. Soil wettability effects during entrapped LNAPL
   recovery by surfactant flooding in coarse-grained sand were investigated
   through a comparative study. The main objective was to identify the
   impacts of soil wettability on LNAPL removal via submicellar
   concentration surfactant flooding to remobilize entrapped LNAPL.
   A baseline for comparison was established by testing an ideal water-wet
   soil (silica sand) along with a fractionally wet soil. Two LNAPLs were
   tested: LNAPL from a contaminated field site and heptane, which
   represented an ideal lab-grade fluid. Contact angle, interfacial
   tension, capillary pressure-saturation, and column tests were performed
   to characterize wettability and identify the effects of soil wettability
   during entrapped LNAPL recovery. Two anionic surfactants were used for
   the column experiments: sodium dodecyl-benzene-sulfonate and a field
   site anionic surfactant. To further investigate the effects of LNAPL
   contact time within the soil, columns tests were performed at two
   different LNAPL contact times.
   Contact angle measurements and column tests conducted with the field
   LNAPL revealed its potential to establish non water-wet wettability
   conditions. Column test results indicated that fluid entrapment was
   independent of fluid type, and the wettability and contact time
   conditions studied. Entrapped LNAPL saturations after water flooding
   were approximately 19 \%. Entrapped LNAPL removal by mobilization
   occurred at the predetermined submicellar surfactant concentration (0.5
   g/L) with a maximum removal of 43 \%. Entrapped LNAPL removal from
   fractionally wet columns was higher in comparison to water-wet columns
   and was found to increase with contact time.
   Entrapped LNAPL saturations after water imbibition were not impacted by
   the wettability conditions studied. The fractionally wet soil behaved
   differently during the surfactant-flood; higher LNAPL removal was
   achieved suggesting that non-ideal wettability had a positive impact.
   The presence of NAPL-wet mineral grains might have favored pore scale
   interactions causing NAPL redistribution and increasing NAPL-surfactant
   solution interfacial areas contributing to LNAPL removal. Pore scale
   studies and subsequent testing is recommended to further this study's
   findings.}},

   33\% for the diffusion layer and 23\% porosity for the functional layer.
   A power density of 630 mW/cm(2) was obtained at 750 degrees C in
   humidified H-2 with cells having the bi-layer anode deposited on the

Abstract = {{This paper is focused on nonlinear dynamics of a shell-shaped workpiece
   during high speed milling. The shell-shaped workpiece is modeled as a
   double-curved cantilevered shell subjected to a cutting force with time
   delay effects. Equations of motion are derived by using the Hamilton
   principle based on the classical shell theory and von Karman
   strain-displacement relation. The resulting nonlinear partial
   differential equations are reduced to a two-degree-of-freedom nonlinear
   system by applying the Galerkin approach. The averaging method is used
   to obtain four-dimensional averaged equations for the case of
   foundational parametric resonance and 1:2 internal resonance. Using a
   numerical method, the dynamics of the cantilevered shell-shaped
   workpiece is studied under time-delay effects, parametric excitation,
   and forcing excitation. It is found that time-delay parameters have
   great impact on chaotic motion. With increasing amplitude of forcing and
   parametric excitations, the shell-shaped workpiece exhibits different
   dynamic behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Aldehyde dehydrogenases are found in all organisms and play an important
   role in the metabolic conversion and detoxification of endogenous and
   exogenous aldehydes. Genomes of many organisms including Escherichia
   coli and Salmonella typhimurium encode two succinate semialdehyde
   dehydrogenases with low sequence similarity and different cofactor
   preference (YneI and GabD). Here, we present the crystal structure and
   biochemical characterization of the NAD(P)+-dependent succinate
   semialdehyde dehydrogenase YneI from S. typhimurium. This enzyme shows
   high activity and affinity toward succinate semialdehyde and exhibits
   substrate inhibition at concentrations of SSA higher than 0.1 mM. YneI
   can use both NAD+ and NADP+ as cofactors, although affinity to NAD+ is
   10 times higher. High resolution crystal structures of YneI were solved
   in a free state (1.85 angstrom) and in complex with NAD+ (1.90 angstrom)
   revealing a two domain protein with the active site located in the
   interdomain interface. The NAD+ molecule is bound in the long channel
   with its nicotinamide ring positioned close to the side chain of the
   catalytic Cys268. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that this
   residue, as well as the conserved Trp136, Glu365, and Asp426 are
   important for activity of YneI, and that the conserved Lys160
   contributes to the enzyme preference to NAD+. Our work has provided
   further insight into the molecular mechanisms of substrate selectivity
   and activity of succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenases. (c) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common and is associated
   with increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However, most patients
   remain undiagnosed due to lack of access to sleep laboratories. We
   therefore tested the validity of a single-channel monitoring setup that
   captures and analyzes breath sounds (BSs) to detect SDB.
   Methods: BS were recorded from 50 patients undergoing simultaneous
   polysomnography (PSG). Using custom-designed automatic software, BS were
   subjected to a set of pattern recognition rules to identify apneas and
   hypopneas from which the acoustic apnea-hypopnea index (AHI-a) was
   calculated. Apneas and hypopneas from PSG were scored blindly by three
   technicians according to two criteria; one relying solely on the drop of
   the respiratory signal by >90\% for an apnea and by 50\% to 90\% for a
   hypopnea (TV50 criteria), and another that also required a desaturation
   or an arousal for a hypopnea (American Association of Sleep Medicine
   {[}AASM] criteria). PSG AHI (AHI-p) was calculated for each technician
   according to both criteria.
   Results: There was no significant difference between AHI-p scores
   according to TV50 and AASM criteria. AHI-a was strongly correlated with
   AHI-p according to both TV50 (R = 94\%) and AASM criteria (R = 93\%).
   Bland-Altman plot analysis revealed that 98\% and 92\% of AHI-a fell
   within the limits of agreement for AHI-p according to TV50 and AASM
   criteria, respectively. Based on a diagnostic cutoff of AHI-pP10 for
   SDB, overall accuracy of AHI-a reached 88\% and negative predictive
   value reached 100\%.
   Conclusion: Acoustic analysis of BS is a reliable method for quantifying
   AHI and diagnosing SDB compared to simultaneous PSG. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Lighting consumes a significant amount of generated electrical power in

   light-emitting diode (OLED) has received huge worldwide attention in
   recent years, partially driven by its success in the flat-panel display
   market and partially driven by its technology virtues such as an unique
   thin, flat, foldable form factor. In this review, we will provide an
   overview on the current status of OLEDs for lighting applications.
   Specifically, a detailed overview of the state-of-the-art white OLED
   design concepts including their working principles will be presented. A
   brief overview on the current status of out-coupling techniques suitable

   continuous-time projected neural network, and the corresponding
   discrete-time projected neural network are both given to tackle this
   problem iteratively. The convergence of the neural networks are proven
   in theory. The effectiveness of the proposed neural networks are tested
   and compared with others via its applications in the range-free
   localization of wireless sensor networks. Simulations demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{We present Anchor, a general resource management architecture that uses
   the stable matching framework to decouple policies from mechanisms when
   mapping virtual machines to physical servers. In Anchor, clients and
   operators are able to express a variety of distinct resource management
   policies as they deem fit, and these policies are captured as
   preferences in the stable matching framework. The highlight of Anchor is
   a new many-to-one stable matching theory that efficiently matches VMs
   with heterogeneous resource needs to servers, using both offline and
   online algorithms. Our theoretical analyses show the convergence and
   optimality of the algorithm. Our experiments with a prototype
   implementation on a 20-node server cluster, as well as large-scale
   simulations based on real-world workload traces, demonstrate that the
   architecture is able to realize a diverse set of policy objectives with

   test market (the Mexican market) through reviewing pertinent literature
   in conjunction with conducting interviews with experts in this domain.
   The analysis shows that six major processes have to be undertaken: (1)
   analysis of market conditions (preventure analysis); (2) assessing
   competencies; (3) evaluation of product and service; (4) analysis of
   proper distribution channels (supply chain); (5) evaluation of marketing

Abstract = {{Since the end of the 1990s, there has been an increasing interest in the

   detailed knowledge elicitation, engineering, and management. A
   systematic design process in which Knowledge and Requirements
   Engineering tools play a fundamental role is necessary in such

   consequently in the study of Knowledge Engineering in AI planning, has
   been the analysis of requirements and their subsequent transformation
   into an input-ready model for planners. itSIMPLE is a research project
   dedicated to the study of a project process to support the design phases

Abstract = {{Controlled rocking steel frames have been proposed as an efficient way
   to avoid the structural damage and residual deformations that are
   expected in conventional seismic force resisting systems. Although the
   base rocking response is intended to limit the force demands, higher
   mode effects can amplify member design forces, reducing the viability of
   the system. This paper suggests that seismic forces may be limited more
   effectively by providing multiple force-limiting mechanisms. Two
   techniques are proposed: detailing one or more rocking joints above the
   base rocking joint and providing a self-centring energy dissipative
   (SCED) brace at one or more levels. These concepts are applied to the
   design of an eight-storey prototype structure and a shake table model at
   30\% scale. A simple numerical model that was used as a design tool is
   in good agreement with frequency characterization and low-amplitude
   seismic tests of the shake table model, particularly when multiple
   force-limiting mechanisms are active. These results suggest that the
   proposed mechanisms can enable better capacity design by reducing the
   variability of peak seismic force demands without causing excessive
   displacements. Similar results are expected for other systems that rely
   on a single location of concentrated nonlinearity to limit peak seismic
   loads. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of 56 large-amplitude shake table tests
   of a 30\% scale eight-storey controlled rocking steel frame. No
   significant damage or residual deformations were observed after any of
   the tests. The frame had four possible configurations on the basis of
   combinations of two higher mode mitigation mechanisms. The first
   mitigation mechanism was formed by allowing the upper section of the
   frame to rock, so as to better control the mid-height overturning
   moment. The second mitigation mechanism was formed by replacing the
   conventional first-storey brace with a self-centering energy dissipative
   (SCED) brace, so as to better control the base shear. The mechanisms had
   little effect during records where higher mode effects were not
   apparent, but they substantially reduced the shear and overturning
   moment envelopes, as well as the peak floor accelerations, during more
   demanding records. The reduction in storey shears led to similarly
   reduced brace force demands. Although the peak force demands in the
   columns were not reduced by as much as the frame overturning moments,
   using an upper rocking joint allowed the column demands to be estimated
   without the need to assume a lateral force distribution. The tests
   demonstrated that multiple force-limiting mechanisms can be used to
   provide better control of peak seismic forces without excessive
   increases in drift demands, thus enabling more reliable capacity design.
   These results are expected to be widely applicable to structures where
   the peak seismic forces are significantly influenced by higher mode
   effects. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In the current era of cloud computing, data stored in the cloud is being
   generated at a tremendous speed, and thus the cloud storage system has
   become one of the key components in cloud computing. By storing a
   substantial amount of data in commodity disks inside the data center
   that hosts the cloud, the cloud storage system must consider one
   question very carefully: how do we store data reliably with a high
   efficiency in terms of both storage overhead and data integrity? Though
   it is easy to store replicated data to tolerate a certain amount of data
   losses, it suffers from a very low storage efficiency. Conventional
   erasure coding techniques, such as Reed-Solomon codes, are able to
   achieve a much lower storage cost with the same level of tolerance
   against disk failures. However, it incurs much higher repair costs, not
   to mention an even higher access latency. In this sense, designing new
   coding techniques for cloud storage systems has gained a significant
   amount of attention in both academia and the industry. In this paper, we
   examine the existing results of coding techniques for cloud storage
   systems. Specifically, we present these coding techniques into two
   categories: regenerating codes and locally repairable codes. These two
   kinds of codes meet the requirements of cloud storage along two
   different axes: optimizing bandwidth and I/O overhead. We present an
   overview of recent advances in these two categories of coding
   techniques. Moreover, we introduce the main ideas of some specific
   coding techniques at a high level, and discuss their motivations and
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Datacenters have become increasingly important to host a diverse range
   of cloud applications with mixed workloads. Traditional applications
   hosted by datacenters are throughput-oriented without delay
   requirements, but newer generations of cloud applications, such as web
   search, recommendations, and social networking, typically employ a
   tree-based Partition-Aggregate structure, which may incur bursts of
   traffic. As a result, flows in these applications have stringent latency
   requirements, i. e., flow deadlines need to be met in order to achieve a
   satisfactory user experience. To meet these flow deadlines, research
   efforts in the recent literature have attempted to redesign flow and
   congestion control protocols that are specific to datacenter networks.
   In this paper, we focus on the new array of deadline-sensitive flow
   control protocols, thoroughly investigate their underlying design
   principles, analyze the evolution of their designs, and evaluate the
   tradeoffs involved in their design choices.}},

   processing algorithms were developed to provide controllers with
   real-time visual feedback and to accurately measure cell deformation

Abstract = {{Barre granite exhibits strong anisotropy due to its pre-existing
   microcracks induced by long-term tectonic loading. The quantification of
   rock anisotropy in fracture properties such as mode-I fracture toughness
   under a wide range of loading rates is critical to a variety of rock
   engineering applications. To quantify fracture toughness of Barre
   granite, notched semi-circular bend (NSCB) fracture tests are conducted
   statically with an MTS hydraulic servo-control testing machine and
   dynamically with a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system. Barre
   granite samples are prepared based on the three principal directions,
   resulting in six orientation sample groups. For dynamic tests, pulse
   shaping technique is used to achieve dynamic force balance. The finite
   element method is then implemented to formulate equations relating the
   failure load to the mode-I fracture toughness using an orthotropic
   elastic material model. For samples in the same orientation group, the
   fracture toughness shows clear loading rate dependence, with the
   fracture toughness increasing with the loading rate. The fracture
   toughness anisotropy is characterized by the ratio of the largest
   fracture toughness over the smallest one at a given loading rate. The
   mode-I fracture toughness anisotropy exhibits a pronounced rate
   dependence, being strong under static loading while diminishing as the
   loading rate increases. The mode-I fracture toughness anisotropy may be
   understood by considering the preferentially oriented microcracks, which
   will be fully explored in the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A large class of modern structural alloys derives its strength from
   precipitation hardening. Precipitates obstruct the motion of
   dislocations and thereby increase alloy strength. This paper examines
   the process using an atomistic-based hierarchical multiscale modeling
   framework. Atomistic modeling is employed to (1) compute
   solute-dislocation interaction energies for input into a semi-analytic
   solute hardening model and (2) evaluate precipitate strengths for use in
   dislocation line tension simulations. The precipitate microstructure in
   the dislocation line tension simulations is obtained from simple
   analytic precipitation kinetics relations. Fitting only the rate
   constants in the precipitation kinetics model, the macroscopic strength
   predictions of the hierarchical multiscale model are found to correspond
   reasonably well with experiments. By analyzing the potential sources of
   discrepancy between the model's macroscopic predictions and experiments,
   this work illuminates the importance of specific atomic-scale processes
   and highlights important challenges that remain before truly predictive
   mechanism-based plasticity modeling can be realized. DOI:

Title = {{Synthesis of high-complexity rhythmic signals for closed-loop electrical
   neuromodulation}},
Journal = {{NEURAL NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{62-73}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We propose an approach to synthesizing high-complexity rhythmic signals
   for closed-loop electrical neuromodulation using cognitive rhythm
   generator (CRG) networks, wherein the CRG is a hybrid oscillator
   comprised of (1) a bank of neuronal modes, (2) a ring device (clock),
   and (3) a static output nonlinearity (mapper). Networks of coupled CRGs
   have been previously implemented to simulate the electrical activity of
   biological neural networks, including in silico models of epilepsy,
   producing outputs of similar waveform and complexity to the biological
   system. This has enabled CRG network models to be used as platforms for
   testing seizure control strategies. Presently, we take the application
   one step further, envisioning therapeutic CRG networks as rhythmic
   signal generators creating neuromimetic signals for stimulation
   purposes, motivated by recent research indicating that stimulus
   complexity and waveform characteristics influence neuromodulation
   efficacy. To demonstrate this concept, an epileptiform CRG network
   generating spontaneous seizure-like events (SLEs) was coupled to a
   therapeutic CRG network, forming a closed-loop neuromodulation system.
   SLEs are associated with low-complexity dynamics and high phase
   coherence in the network. The tuned therapeutic network generated a
   high-complexity, multi-banded rhythmic stimulation signal with prominent
   theta and gamma-frequency power that suppressed SLEs and increased
   dynamic complexity in the epileptiform network, as measured by a
   relative increase in the maximum Lyapunov exponent and decrease in phase
   coherence. CRG-based neuromodulation outperformed both low and
   high-frequency periodic pulse stimulation, suggesting that
   neuromodulation using complex, biomimetic signals may provide an
   improvement over conventional electrical stimulation techniques for
   treating neurological disorders such as epilepsy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The effect of extraction of wood components on wood anatomy and

   wood porosity after conventional and microwave extraction. The method
   was also used as an indirect means for the determination of temperature
   generated inside the fibers. Original porosity of birch wood was 18.5
   +/- 1.5\%, and porosity increased with both extractions. The increase in
   wood porosity after 10 minutes of microwave extraction was double that
   of wood after conventional method of extraction at 90 degrees C for two
   hours (42\% vs. 26\%), indicating a sudden rupture of the wood structure
   due to the volumetric heating effect produced by the microwave heating.
   Comparison of porosities of the conventionally extracted samples at
   different temperatures for the same duration indicated that the
   temperature generated inside the fibers during 10 minutes of microwave

Journal = {{COGNITIVE SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22-23}},
Pages = {{78-88}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This is a review of a large body of work undertaken during the past 3-4
   decades, by the author, who has worked in both the physical and the
   biological sciences. We begin with two assumed principles that are taken
   to be fundamental to the process of perception. The first is termed the
   reflexive property, and the second the uncertainty property. The former
   implies that the perceived world always mirrors a property of the
   perceiving system. The latter means that perception, both in the
   physical and biological worlds, always implies making a choice from
   among alternatives. We integrate these principles to develop equations
   diagrammatically, essentially using a set of cartoons. The equations are
   not derived rigorously - that can be found in other publications - but
   rather take shape pictorially, to give the reader the gist of the idea.
   The result is a single equation that has a good deal of scope in
   predicting events within sensory science. This single equation, suitably
   constrained, can be used to derive many of the hitherto empirical
   equations found in sensory science. By rooting perception in the
   physical, rather than the biological realm, this equation tells us about
   sensory systems that may be present throughout our universe, since the
   universe operates everywhere using the same laws of physics. (c) 2012

   increase the stability of the method, a two-step predictorcorrector time
   integration scheme is employed. At each step, the projection method is
   used to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure and to satisfy the
   continuity equation. The robustness and accuracy of the method is
   illustrated with a series of numerical experiments including thermally

Abstract = {{Striped phases of ethylthiolate monolayers, corresponding to surface
   coverage in between 0.2 ML and 0.27 ML, were studied using
   high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy. Striped phases consist of
   rows of Au-adatom-diethythiolate (AAD) aligned along the {[}11 (2) over
   bar] direction. In the perpendicular {[}1 (1) over bar0] direction, the
   AAD rows adjust their spacing according to the surface coverage. A (5
   root 3 x root 3)-R30 degrees striped phase with 0.27 ML thiolate and a
   (6 root 3 x root 3)-R30 degrees striped phase with 0.23 ML thiolate,
   both with long-range order, are found. A localized (5 x root 3)-rect.
   phase is also found as a minority phase embedded in the 5 root 3 x root
   3)-R30 degrees phase. This (5 x v 3)-rect. phase can be constructed
   using di-Au-adatom-tri-thiolate species. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The exceptionally low adhesion of superhydrophobic surfaces is
   contingent on drops remaining in the Cassie (suspended) state of
   wetting. It is therefore important to understand the relationship
   between the structure of a rough surface and the energy barriers
   separating the Cassie and Wenzel (collapsed) states of wetting. Using a
   two-dimensional, free energy-based model, energy barriers are calculated
   for superhydrophobic surfaces composed of random, self-affine roughness.
   It is shown that energy barriers arise from mismatches between the local
   and global values of the Wenzel roughness parameter. Comparisons are
   made between models of vertical and lateral liquid motion, and between
   external disturbances of energy and of pressure. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The removal of toxic arsenic species from contaminated waters by
   zero-valent iron (ZVI) has drawn considerable attention in recent years.
   In this approach, arsenic ions are mainly removed by adsorption to the
   iron corrosion products. Reduction to zero-valent arsenic on the ZVI
   surface is possible in the absence of competing oxidants and can reduce
   arsenic mobility and sludge formation. However, associated removal rates
   are relatively low. In the current study, simultaneous high reduction
   and removal rates of arsenite (H3AsO3), the more toxic and mobile
   environmentally occurring arsenic species, was demonstrated by reacting
   it with ZVI under limited aeration and relatively low pH. 90\% of the
   removed arsenic was attached to the ZVI particles and 60\% of which was
   in the elemental state. Under the same non-acidic conditions, only
   40-60\% of the removed arsenic was attached to the ZVI with no change in
   arsenic oxidation state. Under anaerobic conditions, reduction occurred
   but total arsenic removal rate was significantly lower and ZVI demand
   was higher. The effective arsenite removal under acidic oxygen-limited
   conditions was explained by formation of Fe(II)-solid intermediate on
   the ZVI surface that provided high surface area and reducing power. (c)

Abstract = {{The evolution of shear rupture fronts in laboratory earthquakes is

   each phase of the rupture evolution. The classified rupture fronts in
   network states-obtained from a saw-cut fault and natural faulted
   Westerly granite - show a clear separation into three main groups,
   indicating different states of rupture fronts. With respect to the
   scaling of local ruptures' durations with the networks' parameters, we
   show that the gap in the classified fronts could be related to the
   possibility of a separation between slow and regular fronts.}},

Title = {{Assessment of the Holland model for silicon phonon-phonon relaxation
   times using lattice dynamics calculations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{We assess the ability of the Holland model to accurately predict
   phonon-phonon relaxation times from bulk thermal conductivity values.
   First, lattice dynamics calculations are used to obtain phonon-phonon
   relaxation times and thermal conductivities for temperatures ranging
   from 10K to 1000K for Stillinger-Weber silicon. The Holland model is
   then fitted to these thermal conductivities and used to predict
   relaxation times, which are compared to the relaxation times obtained by
   lattice dynamics calculations. We find that fitting the Holland model to
   both total and mode-dependent thermal conductivities does not result in
   accurate mode-dependent phonon-phonon relaxation times. Introduction of
   Umklapp scattering for longitudinal modes resulted in improved
   prediction of mode-dependent relative contributions to thermal
   conductivity, especially at high temperatures. However, assumptions made
   by Holland regarding the frequency-dependence of phonon scattering
   mechanisms are found to be inconsistent with lattice dynamics data.
   Instead, we introduce a simple method based on using cumulative thermal
   conductivity functions to obtain better predictions of the
   frequency-dependence of relaxation times. (C) 2013 Author(s). All

Abstract = {{Grip kinetics and their variation are emerging as important
   considerations in the clinical assessment of handwriting pathologies,
   fine motor rehabilitation, biometrics, forensics and ergonomic pen
   design. This study evaluated the intra- and inter-participant
   variability of grip shape kinetics in adults during signature writing.
   Twenty (20) adult participants wrote on a digitizing tablet using an
   instrumented pen that measured the forces exerted on its barrel.
   Signature samples were collected over 10 days, 3 times a day, to capture
   temporal variations in grip shape kinetics. A kinetic topography (i.e.,
   grip shape image) was derived per signature by time-averaging the
   measured force at each of 32 locations around the pen barrel. The
   normalized cross correlations (NCC) of grip shape images were calculated
   within- and between-participants. Several classification algorithms were
   implemented to gauge the error rate of participant discrimination based
   on grip shape kinetics. Four different grip shapes emerged and several
   participants made grip adjustments (change in grip shape or grip height)
   or rotated the pen during writing. Nonetheless, intra-participant
   variation in grip kinetics was generally much smaller than
   inter-participant force variations. Using the entire grip shape images
   as a 32-dimensional input feature vector, a K-nearest neighbor
   classifier achieved an error rate of 1.2 +/- 0.4\% in discriminating
   among participants. These results indicate that writers had unique grip
   shape kinetics that were repeatable over time but distinct from those of
   other participants. The topographic analysis of grip kinetics may inform
   the development of personalized interventions or customizable grips in
   clinical and industrial applications, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{In this study the highly ordered corneal nanonipple structure observed
   on the Mourning Cloak butterfly (Nymphalis antiopa) is analyzed with a
   particular emphasis on the high-angle grain-boundary-like defects that
   are observed between individual nanonipple crystals. It is shown that
   these grain boundaries are generated by rows of topological coordination
   defects, which create very specific misorientations between adjacent
   crystals. These specific orientations form coincidence site lattices,
   which (i) have unit cells larger than the unit cell in each individual
   crystal and (ii) extend from one crystal to the next, effectively
   creating order over areas larger than the individual crystals. A
   comparison to similar coincidence site lattices in engineering materials
   is made and the importance of such arrangements in terms of nipple
   packing density, corneal lens curvature and potential optical properties
   is discussed.}},

Title = {{Catalytic reforming of activated sludge model compounds in supercritical

Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL}},

Abstract = {{We report the catalytic supercritical water reforming of model compounds
   of activated sludge at 380 degrees C using Raney nickel, Ni/alpha-Al2O3,
   Ru/C, and Ru/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts. The model compounds were glucose,
   glycine, glycerol, lauric acid and humic acid, representing
   carbohydrates, proteins, alcohols, fatty acids and humic substances,
   respectively. Using Raney nickel as the catalyst, the carbon conversions
   decreased with the following order: glycerol > glucose > glycine >
   lauric acid > humic acid. The conversion generally increased with
   reduction in the number of C-C bonds presented per unit mass of the
   molecules, except for the glycine that contains a nitrogen atom in its
   structure. Comparison of the experimental yields of methane with the
   equilibrium values calculated at the corresponding conversions revealed
   that, in the presence of Raney nickel, methane is almost at a
   quasi-equilibrium state. Moreover, using binary mixtures of the above
   model compounds as feedstock, the interactions between these model
   compounds were investigated. At low catalyst loadings, the presence of
   humic acid in the binary mixtures resulted in lower carbon conversions
   compared to the expected values based on the rule of mixtures. Higher
   gas yields were obtained from the decomposition of these model compounds
   compared to an activated sludge feedstock. Addition of sludge ash
   decreased the gasification yields of glucose and glycerol and increased
   the yields obtained from glycine. Furthermore, since algae are comprised
   of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates, the findings of this study also
   provide a better understating of the catalytic gasification of such
   feedstock in supercritical water. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We formulate mixed-integer conic approximations to AC transmission
   system planning. The first applies lift-and-project relaxations to a
   nonconvex model built around a semidefinite power flow relaxation. We
   then employ a quadratically constrained approximation to the DistFlow
   equations in constructing a second-order cone model that is convex
   without relaxation. We solve mixed integer linear and second-order cone
   programs using commercial software and assess their performance on two
   benchmark problems. As with DC power flow models and linear AC
   relaxations, the new models usually produce solutions which are
   infeasible under the original constraints. However, they are nearer to
   feasibility, and therefore represent stronger alternatives.}},

   these modes result from the coupling of the surface plasmons, supported
   by the metal-dielectric interface, and the dielectric waveguide mode,
   supported by the high-index slab. The method of analysis is very general

Abstract = {{In a previous investigation, a combined addition of zirconium and

   alone. The present experimental study confirmed this result. However, in
   this study, the microstructure was examined with more attention to the
   form of the zirconium-rich coring in the grain refined structures. It
   was concluded that although the average apparent grain size decreases
   with an addition of lanthanum, this is in part because grain growth
   takes place in the Mg-Zr alloy, while the suppression of grain growth
   occurs with an addition of lanthanum as small as 0.5\%.}},

Abstract = {{A high-efficiency, large output-power, mm-wave digital transmitter
   architecture is proposed for high data rate m-ary QAM transmission.
   Because it operates entirely in digital mode, without any matching
   networks, it is scalable in frequency up to at least 50 GHz and portable
   to future generations of CMOS technologies. It consists of n broadband
   mm-wave IQ power-DAC pairs directly modulated in amplitude and phase by
   4 x n independent digital data streams. The output signals combine in
   free space to form a programmable ASK, BPSK, QPSK, and m-ary QAM mm-wave
   transmitter. Several proof-of-concept circuits with one DAC cell, and
   with one and two IQ pairs of DAC cells were fabricated in 45-nm SOI
   CMOS. Using a series-stacked differential output stage with four
   cascoded n-MOSFETs driven in saturation by a CMOS-inverter chain, each
   power- DAC cell demonstrates a 24.3 dBm output power with 21.3\% drain
   efficiency and 14.6\% PAE, at 45 GHz directly into 50-Omega loads. The
   peak drain efficiency is 30\% at 22.5 dBm output power and 19.4\% PAE.
   Experiments show 5-Gb/s BPSK, and simultaneous 2-Gb/s BPSK and 2-Gb/s
   ASK modulation per DAC cell in the 44-48 GHz range. Eye diagrams at 28
   Gb/s further demonstrate the broadband operation of the DAC cell and its
   suitability as a large-swing NRZ modulator driver in fiberoptic links.}},

Abstract = {{Complex tissues contain multiple cell types that are hierarchically
   organized within morphologically and functionally distinct compartments.
   Construction of engineered tissues with optimized tissue architecture
   has been limited by tissue fabrication techniques, which do not enable
   versatile microscale organization of multiple cell types in tissues of
   size adequate for physiological studies and tissue therapies. Here we
   present an `Intaglio-Void/Embed-Relief Topographic molding' method for
   microscale organization of many cell types, including induced
   pluripotent stem cell-derived progeny, within a variety of synthetic and
   natural extracellular matrices and across tissues of sizes appropriate
   for in vitro, pre-clinical, and clinical studies. We demonstrate that
   compartmental placement of non-parenchymal cells relative to primary or
   induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes, compartment
   microstructure, and cellular composition modulate hepatic functions.
   Configurations found to sustain physiological function in vitro also
   result in survival and function in mice for at least 4 weeks,
   demonstrating the importance of architectural optimization before
   implantation.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic control problems that arise in reliability and maintenance
   optimization typically assume that information used for decision-making
   is obtained according to a predetermined sampling schedule. In many real
   applications, however, there is a high sampling cost associated with
   collecting such data. It is therefore of equal importance to determine
   when information should be collected and to decide how this information
   should be utilized for maintenance decision-making. This type of joint
   optimization has been a long-standing problem in the operations research
   and maintenance optimization literature, and very few results regarding
   the structure of the optimal sampling and maintenance policy have been
   published. In this paper, we formulate and analyze the joint
   optimization of sampling and maintenance decision-making in the
   partially observable Markov decision process framework. We prove the
   optimality of a policy that is characterized by three critical
   thresholds, which have practical interpretation and give new insight
   into the value of condition-based maintenance programs in life-cycle
   asset management. Illustrative numerical comparisons are provided that
   show substantial cost savings over existing suboptimal policies.}},

Abstract = {{To gain an understanding of the vertebral cortical endplate and factors
   that may affect the ability to achieve skeletal attachment to
   intervertebral implants and fusion, this study aimed to characterize the
   hypermineralized tissue on the cortical endplate of the vertebral body
   on a commonly used animal model. Skeletally mature sheep were injected
   with tetracycline prior to euthanasia and the C2-C3, T5-T6, and L2-L3
   spinal motion segments were excised and prepared. Vertebral tissues were
   imaged using backscatter electron (BSE) imaging, histology, and
   tetracycline labeling was used to assess bone remodeling within
   different tissue layers. It was determined that the hypermineralized
   tissue layer was calcified fibrocartilage (CFC). No tetracycline labels
   were identified in the CFC layer, in contrast to single and double
   labels that were present in the underlying bone, indicating the CFC
   present on the cortical endplate was not being actively remodeled. The
   average thickness of the CFC layer was 146.3 +/- 70.53 mu m in the
   cervical region, 98.2 +/- 40.29 mu m in the thoracic region, and 150.89
   +/- 69.25 mu m in the lumbar region. This difference in thickness may be
   attributed to the regional biomechanical properties of the spine.
   Results from this investigation indicate the presence of a nonremodeling
   tissue on the cortical endplate of the vertebral body in sheep spines,
   which attaches the intervertebral disc to the vertebrae. This tissue, if
   not removed, would likely prevent successful bony attachment to an
   intervertebral device in spinal fusion studies and total disc
   replacement surgeries. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a parameter estimation procedure for a
   condition-based maintenance model under partial observations. Systems
   can be in a healthy or unhealthy operational state, or in a failure
   state. System deterioration is driven by a continuous time homogeneous
   Markov chain and the system state is unobservable, except the failure
   state. Vector information that is stochastically related to the system
   state is obtained through condition monitoring at equidistant sampling
   times. Two types of data histories are available data histories that end
   with observable failure, and censored data histories that end when the
   system has been suspended from operation but has not failed. The state
   and observation processes are modeled in the hidden Markov framework and
   the model parameters are estimated using the expectation-maximization
   algorithm. We show that both the pseudolikelihood function and the
   parameter updates in each iteration of the expectation-maximization
   algorithm have explicit formulas. A numerical example is developed using
   real multivariate spectrometric oil data coming from the failing
   transmission units of 240-ton heavy hauler trucks used in the Athabasca
   oil sands of Alberta, Canada. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Most metamaterial unit cells are designed for a single polarization
   only. Those that do work for multiple polarizations are often difficult
   to fabricate as they require a three-dimensional arrangement of circuit
   boards. To get around this trade-off a new volumetric transmission-line
   metamaterial unit cell is introduced which supports two polarizations.
   The two-dimensional transmission-line network found in the unit cell
   contains both series-node and shunt-node grids, making it the first unit
   cell to combine these two configurations. This allows the unit cell to
   be fabricated by simply stacking printed circuit boards. This
   series-node/shunt-node configuration allows the unit cell to support two
   polarizations and makes the unit cell isotropic and polarization
   independent for cylindrical waves. Another unique feature of this
   proposed unit cell is that it achieves dual-polarized behaviour without
   using symmetry. To verify this concept an example unit cell is designed,
   exhibiting a negative index of refraction for two polarizations.
   Full-wave dispersion analysis is used to verify the presence of
   overlapping backward-wave modes at the same frequency range. Then the
   S-parameters for a finite number of unit cells are analyzed to determine
   the effective index of refraction. Multi-conductor transmission-line
   theory (MTL) is also used to model the dispersion curves of the unit
   cell for both polarizations. Finally, using full-wave simulations,
   dual-polarized negative refraction is demonstrated using a slab that is
   five unit-cells thick.}},

Abstract = {{An aqueous extraction process was developed consisting of aqueous
   contact with dehulled yellow mustard flour to recover protein followed
   by dissolution of the released emulsion in dimethylformamide (DMF) or
   isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to recover the released oil in the form of
   single-phase oil-solvent miscellae suitable for industrial applications.
   Only some 38 +/- 3 \% of the oil in the yellow mustard emulsion was
   extracted using DMF even at high weight ratios since DMF is widely
   miscible with water, preventing separation of the oil from the emulsion.
   A ternary phase diagram of DMF/oil/water was prepared and confirmed the
   limited solubility of the oil in DMF in the presence of water. The use
   of 31: 1 IPA: oil weight ratio could effectively recover over 94 \% of
   the oil in the emulsion; however, multiple-stage treatment of the
   emulsion was proven to be more efficient with lower volumes of IPA
   required to achieve high oil extraction yields. The results suggest that
   the optimal conditions for multiple-stage process were four stages using
   2: 1 IPA: oil weight ratio, with 96 +/- 1 \% oil recovery from the

   distribution becomes more uniform across the spray sheet. Criteria were

Abstract = {{An algae biofilm growth system was developed to study the growth
   kinetics and neutral lipid productivities of Scenedesmus obliquus and
   Nitzschia palea, and to determine if algal biofilms can be starved of
   key nutrients to increase their neutral lipid concentrations. Linear
   growth curves were determined for each species until nutrient starvation
   commenced, at which point growth ceased and/or biofilms sloughed from
   their substratum. Nutrient starvation did not increase neutral lipid
   concentrations in any of the biofilms; however, it approximately doubled
   their lipid concentrations when grown in suspension. Biomass
   productivities of 2.8 and 2.1 g/m(2)/d and lipid productivities of 0.45
   and 0.18 g/m(2)/d were determined for N. palea and S. obliquus,

   is not a desirable method of lipid production for algae biofilm biofuel
   production systems, but that lipid production rates compare favorably
   with conventional terrestrial biofuel sources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

   power consumption. The conventional ADC has similar performance but
   dissipates 241 mu W. The energy required per conversion-step for the CP

Abstract = {{We study the resource allocation problem in an OFDMA-based cooperative

   users in order to gain access to the spectrum. In light of user and
   channel diversity, we first propose FLEC, a novel flexible channel
   cooperation scheme. It allows secondary users to freely optimize the use
   of channels for transmitting primary data along with their own, in order
   to maximize performance. Further, we formulate a unifying optimization
   framework based on Nash bargaining solutions to fairly and efficiently
   allocate resources between primary and secondary networks, in both
   decentralized and centralized settings. We present an optimal
   distributed algorithm and a suboptimal centralized heuristic, and verify
   their effectiveness via realistic simulations. Under the same framework,
   we also study conventional identical channel cooperation as the
   performance benchmark, and propose algorithms to solve the corresponding
   optimization problems.}},

Title = {{Nucleotide degradation and ribose salvage in yeast}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Nucleotide degradation is a universal metabolic capability. Here we
   combine metabolomics, genetics and biochemistry to characterize the
   yeast pathway. Nutrient starvation, via PKA, AMPK/SNF1, and TOR,
   triggers autophagic breakdown of ribosomes into nucleotides. A protein
   not previously associated with nucleotide degradation, Phm8, converts
   nucleotide monophosphates into nucleosides. Downstream steps, which
   involve the purine nucleoside phosphorylase, Pnp1, and pyrimidine
   nucleoside hydrolase, Urh1, funnel ribose into the nonoxidative pentose
   phosphate pathway. During carbon starvation, the ribose-derived carbon
   accumulates as sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, whose consumption by
   transaldolase is impaired due to depletion of transaldolase's other
   substrate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Oxidative stress increases
   glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, resulting in rapid consumption of
   sedoheptulose-7-phosphate to make NADPH for antioxidant defense.
   Ablation of Phm8 or double deletion of Pnp1 and Urh1 prevent effective
   nucleotide salvage, resulting in metabolite depletion and impaired
   survival of starving yeast. Thus, ribose salvage provides means of
   surviving nutrient starvation and oxidative stress.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of reactive compatibilization on the foaming behavior of
   thermoplastic olefin blends of polypropylene and a metallocene-catalyzed
   ethylene octene copolymer was investigated. A batch setup was used to
   foam the samples using carbon dioxide as blowing agent. Solubility
   measurements were performed to determine the relative amount of gas
   concentration in the pressurized polymers before foaming. A microscopic
   method based on the back-scattered electron imaging technique was used
   to determine the respective locations of the bubbles and the dispersed
   elastomeric domains in the polypropylene matrix. It was shown that the
   bubbles are preferentially formed in the dispersed elastomeric domains.
   A clear relationship was established between the microstructure of the
   blends prepared with different levels of compatibilizer and the final
   cellular morphology of the microcellular thermoplastic olefin foams. The
   initial morphology of the blends was also altered by quiescent
   coarsening as well as shear-induced phase coalescence, and the impact of
   the morphological transitions on the cellular structure of the resulting
   foams was investigated. Dynamic shear and transient measurements of
   elongation were performed to characterize the viscoelastic behavior of
   the thermoplastic olefins. It was shown that the addition of a
   compatibilizer resulted in enhanced viscoelastic properties at low
   frequencies as well as increased levels of strain hardening, especially
   at low strain rates. The reactive compatibilization could significantly
   improve the melt foamability through control of the blend microstructure
   as well as enhancement of the melt rheological properties.}},

Abstract = {{Study objective: Automated external defibrillator use by lay bystanders
   during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest rarely occurs but can improve
   survival. We seek to estimate risk for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest by
   location type and evaluate current automated external defibrillator
   deployment in a Canadian urban setting to guide future automated
   external defibrillator deployment.
   Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of a population-based
   out-of-hospital cardiac arrest database. We included consecutive public
   location, nontraumatic, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occurring in
   Toronto from January 1, 2006, to June 30, 2010, captured in the
   Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Epistry database. Two investigators
   independently categorized each out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and
   automated external defibrillator location into one of 38 categories.
   Total site counts in each location category were used to estimate
   average annual per-site cardiac arrest incidence and determine the
   relative automated external defibrillator coverage for each location
   type.
   Results: There were 608 eligible out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases.
   The top 5 location categories by average annual out-of-hospital cardiac
   arrests per site were race track/casino (0.67; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}Cl] 0 to 1.63), jail (0.62; 95\% Cl 0.3 to 1.06), hotel/motel (0.15;
   95\% Cl 0.12 to 0.18), hostel/shelter (0.14; 95\% Cl 0.067 to 0.19), and
   convention center (0.11; 95\% Cl 0 to 0.43). Although schools were
   relatively lower risk for cardiac arrest, they represented 72.5\% of
   automated external defibrillator covered locations in the study region.
   Some higher-risk location types such as hotel/motel, hostel/shelter, and
   rail station were severely underrepresented with respect to automated
   external defibrillator coverage.
   Conclusion: We have identified types of locations with higher per-site
   risk for cardiac arrest relative to others. We have also identified
   potential mismatches between cardiac arrest risk by location type and
   registered automated external defibrillator distribution in a Canadian
   urban setting.}},

Abstract = {{The cost of cellulases remains a key issue in the production of
   cellulosic ethanol, and the impact of enzymes on greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions of cellulosic ethanol has received little attention. This
   study evaluates life cycle emissions and cellulase production costs for
   bioethanol production, considering on-site and off-site production
   options. A complete enzyme production process was simulated using
   AspenPlus, generating mass and energy balance information required to
   calculate GHG emissions and financial metrics. GHG emissions for
   cellulase production range from 10.2 to 16.0 g CO2 eq g1 enzyme protein,
   depending on on-site or off-site production and the method of
   transportation. Enzyme GHG emissions are predicted to be 258 g CO2 eq.
   L1 of ethanol for on-site production, versus 403 g CO2 eq. L1 for
   off-site production, based on a 150 MMLY ethanol plant using 11.5 mg
   enzyme g1 substrate and a cellulase fermentation yield of 90\%.
   Cellulase production costs were estimated for a range of conditions,
   including ethanol plant size, enzyme dose and protein yield for on-site
   production, and enzyme plant size, protein yield and return on
   investment for off-site production. On-site production costs range
   between \$3.80 and \$6.75 kg1 protein, versus \$4.00 to \$8.80 kg1 for
   off-site production. In both scenarios, the lowest cost corresponds to a
   90\% protein yield, and a high enzyme demand and production capacity. An
   enzyme production cost of \$4.70 USD kg1 corresponds to an enzyme cost
   of 0.46 USD gal1 (\$0.12 L1) of ethanol in a 150 MMLY plant using 11.5
   mg enzyme g1 substrate. (c) 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John

Abstract = {{Unilateral hearing in childhood restricts input along the bilateral
   auditory pathways, possibly causing permanent reorganization. In this
   study we asked: (i) do the auditory pathways develop abnormally in
   children who are bilaterally deaf and hear with a unilateral cochlear
   implant? and (ii) can such differences be reversed by restoring input to
   the deprived ear? We measured multichannel electroencephalography in 34
   children using cochlear implants and seven normal hearing peers. Dipole
   moments of activity became abnormally high in the auditory cortex
   contralateral to the first implant as unilateral cochlear implant use
   exceeded 1.5 years. This resulted in increased lateralization of
   activity to the auditory cortex contralateral to the stimulated ear and
   a decline in normal contralateral activity in response to stimulation
   from the newly implanted ear, corresponding to poorer speech perception.
   These results reflect an abnormal strengthening of pathways from the
   stimulated ear in consequence to the loss of contralateral activity
   including inhibitory processes normally involved in bilateral hearing.
   Although this reorganization occurred within a fairly short period
   (similar to 1.5 years of unilateral hearing), it was not reversed by
   long-term (3-4 years) bilateral cochlear implant stimulation. In
   bilateral listeners, effects of side of stimulation were assessed;
   children with long periods of unilateral cochlear implant use prior to
   bilateral implantation showed a reduction in normal dominance of
   contralateral input in the auditory cortex ipsilateral to the stimulated
   ear, further confirming an abnormal strengthening of pathways from the
   stimulated ear. By contrast, cortical activity in children using
   bilateral cochlear implants after limited or no unilateral cochlear
   implant exposure normally lateralized to the hemisphere contralateral to
   side of stimulation and retained normal contralateral dominance of
   auditory input in both hemispheres. Results demonstrate that the
   immature human auditory cortex reorganizes, potentially permanently,
   with unilateral stimulation and that bilateral auditory input provided
   with limited delay can protect the brain from such changes. These
   results indicate for the first time that there is a sensitive period for
   bilateral auditory input in human development with implications for
   functional hearing.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic properties of soils can be inferred via curve fitting of the
   transfer function between the excitation and the induced strain using a
   resonant column device. The shape of the measured transfer function is
   distorted and differs from that of the theoretical transfer function
   because of different shear strain levels at different frequencies in the
   specimen. The difference becomes more pronounced with increasing shear
   strain levels. This study presents a new methodology for the evaluation
   of dynamic properties from an improved transfer function. In this
   methodology, the soil specimen is excited using a sinusoidal carrier
   excitation at the desired strain level coupled with simultaneous
   excitation of a very small strain random noise. The desired strain level
   induced by the fixed sine controls the resonant frequency of the
   specimen, whereas the small strain random noise (always kept small)
   determines the shape of the transfer function and thus the damping
   coefficient. The results indicate excellent matching of the transfer
   function obtained from the proposed method and the theoretical transfer
   function at all shear strain levels. The new methodology also shows good
   potential for the evaluation of dynamic properties of soils as a
   function of frequency in resonant column testing.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{21}},
Pages = {{506-523}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Our severe dependence on fossil resources for the production of fuels
   and chemicals is responsible for two major global challenges: declining
   the fuel supply and increasing the anthropogenic greenhouse gas
   emissions. Conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals can be a part of
   the low-carbon solution to both issues. Among various biomass species,
   inedible biomass such as lignocellulosics is the preferred choice for
   such applications due to their minimal impact on the food security.
   While technologies for the conversion of carbohydrates to value-added
   materials such as pulp, sugar monomers, and ethanol are
   well-established, lignin upgrading and valorization processes are
   significantly less-developed, and technical lignins are almost entirely
   burnt to generate heat and steam. The economic viability of
   biorefineries - which will receive significant amounts of lignin in
   future - can potentially improve significantly when advanced
   technologies are available that aid the conversion of lignin to
   value-added compounds. In this paper we assess how thermochemical
   processes can be used to isolate lignin from the lignocellulosic
   biomass, and subsequently convert it to liquid fuels, hydrogen, and
   aromatic monomers. To this end, different depolymerization, gasification
   and upgrading technologies for lignin conversion will be considered.
   Finally, the foreseeable applications of lignin-based products, the
   future directions for development, and the potential supportive
   interventions from policy makers are critically assessed. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We explore using pulsed latches for timing optimization in
   field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Pulsed latches are transparent
   latches driven by a clock with a nonstandard (i.e., not 50\%) duty
   cycle. As latches are already present on commercial FPGAs, their use for
   timing optimization can avoid the power or area drawbacks associated
   with other techniques such as clock skew and retiming. We propose
   algorithms that automatically replace certain flip-flops with latches
   for performance gains. Under conservative short path or minimum delay
   assumptions, our latch-based optimization, operating on already routed
   designs, provides all the benefit of clock skew in most cases and
   increases performance by 9\%, on average, without area penalties or
   significant netlist changes. We show that short paths greatly hinder the
   ability of using pulsed latches, and that further improvements in
   performance are possible by increasing the delay of certain short paths.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies incremental relay strategies for a two-user Gaussian
   relay-interference channel with an in-band-reception and
   out-of-band-transmission relay, where the link between the relay and the
   two receivers is modelled as a degraded broadcast channel. It is shown
   that generalized hash-and-forward (GHF) can achieve the capacity region
   of this channel to within a constant number of bits in a certain
   weak-relay regime, where the transmitter-to-relay link gains are not
   unboundedly stronger than the interference links between the
   transmitters and the receivers. The GHF relaying strategy is ideally
   suited for the broadcasting relay because it can be implemented in an
   incremental fashion, i.e., the relay message to one receiver is a
   degraded version of the message to the other receiver. A
   generalized-degree-of-freedom (GDoF) analysis in the high
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime reveals that in the symmetric channel
   setting, each common relay bit can improve the sum rate roughly by
   either one bit or two bits asymptotically depending on the operating
   regime, and the rate gain can be interpreted as coming solely from the
   improvement of the common messages rate, or alternatively in the very
   weak interference regime as solely coming from the rate improvement of
   the private messages. Further, this paper studies an asymmetric case in
   which the relay has only a single link to one of the destinations. It is
   shown that with only one relay-destination link, the approximate
   capacity region can be established for a larger regime of channel
   parameters. Further, from a GDoF point of view, the sum-capacity gain
   due to the relay can now be thought as coming from either signal
   relaying only or interference forwarding only.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the first silicon-proven implementation of a lattice
   reduction (LR) algorithm, which achieves maximum likelihood diversity.
   The implementation is based on a novel hardware-optimized due to the
   Lenstra, Lenstra, and Lovasz (LLL) algorithm, which significantly
   reduces its complexity by replacing all the computationally intensive
   LLL operations (multiplication, division, and square root) with
   low-complexity additions and comparisons. The proposed VLSI design
   utilizes a pipelined architecture that produces an LR-reduced matrix set
   every 40 cycles, which is a 60\% reduction compared to current
   state-of-the-art LR field-programmable gate array implementations. The
   0.13-mu m CMOS LR core presented in this paper achieves a clock rate of
   352 MHz, and thus is capable of sustaining a throughput of 880 Mb/s for

Abstract = {{Microcephaly-capillary malformation (MIC-CAP) syndrome is characterized
   by severe microcephaly with progressive cortical atrophy, intractable
   epilepsy, profound developmental delay and multiple small capillary
   malformations on the skin. We used whole-exome sequencing of five
   patients with MIC-CAP syndrome and identified recessive mutations in
   STAMBP, a gene encoding the deubiquitinating (DUB) isopeptidase STAMBP
   (STAM-binding protein, also known as AMSH, associated molecule with the
   SH3 domain of STAM) that has a key role in cell surface
   receptor-mediated endocytosis and sorting. Patient cell lines showed
   reduced STAMBP expression associated with accumulation of
   ubiquitin-conjugated protein aggregates, elevated apoptosis and
   insensitive activation of the RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways. The
   latter cellular phenotype is notable considering the established
   connection between these pathways and their association with vascular
   and capillary malformations. Furthermore, our findings of a congenital
   human disorder caused by a defective DUB protein that functions in
   endocytosis implicates ubiquitin-conjugate aggregation and elevated
   apoptosis as factors potentially influencing the progressive neuronal
   loss underlying MIC-CAP syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{We sought to deconvolute the effects of sub-micron topography and
   microtopography on the phenomena of bone bonding and interfacial
   stability of endosseous implants. To address this experimentally, we
   implanted custom-made titanium alloy implants of varying surface
   topographical complexity in rat femora, for 6, 9 or 12 days. The five
   surfaces were polished, machined, dual acid etched, and two forms of
   grit blasted and acid etched; each surface type was further modified
   with the deposition of nanocrystals of calcium phosphate to make a total
   of 10 materials groups (n = 10 for each time point; total 300 implants).
   At sacrifice, we subjected the bone implant interface to a mechanical
   disruption test. We found that even the smoothest surfaces, when
   modified with sub-micron scale crystals, could be bone-bonding. However,
   as locomotor loading through bone to the implant increased with time of
   healing, such interfaces failed while others, with sub-micron features
   superimposed on surfaces of increasing microtopographical complexity
   remained intact under loading. We demonstrate here that higher order,
   micron or coarse-micron, topography is a requirement for longer-term
   interfacial stability. We show that each of these topographical
   scale-ranges represents a scale-range seen in natural bone tissue. Thus,
   what emerges from an analysis of our findings is a new means by which
   biologically-relevant criteria can be employed to assess the importance
   of implant surface topography at different scale-ranges. (C) 2013

Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART A-APPLIED SCIENCE AND MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{181-191}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The effect of the adherend thickness, h, on mode-I fatigue behavior of a
   toughened epoxy adhesive system was examined in terms of the substrate
   global stiffness and curing residual stress. It was found that a change
   in adherend thickness from 1.6 mm to 12.7 mm caused a reduction in the
   fatigue performance; i.e. the threshold energy release rate decreased
   and the crack growth rate increased for a given applied energy release
   rate. Finite element modeling showed that the fatigue results could be
   explained in terms of an increase in the crack tip stresses and an
   enlarged plastic zone due to the greater global stiffness of thicker
   joints. No difference in fatigue behavior was observed for mixed-mode
   loading at relatively small phase angles; however, it is expected that
   at higher phase angles the adverse effect of h would be observed. (C)

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{A new direct performance-based design method utilizing design tools
   called performance-spectra (P-Spectra) for low-rise to medium-rise frame
   structures incorporating supplemental damping devices is presented.
   P-Spectra are graphic tools that relate the responses of nonlinear SDOF
   systems with supplemental dampers to various damping parameters and
   dynamic system properties that structural designers can control. These
   tools integrate multiple response quantities that are important to the
   performance of a structure into a single compact graphical format to
   facilitate direct comparison of different potential solutions that
   satisfy a set of predetermined performance objectives under various
   levels of seismic hazard. An SDOF to MDOF transformation procedure that
   defines the required supplemental damping properties for the MDOF
   structure to achieve the response defined by the target SDOF system is
   also presented for hysteretic, linear viscous and viscoelastic damping
   devices. Using nonlinear time-history analyses of idealized shear
   structures, the accuracy of the transformation procedure is verified. A
   seismic performance upgrade design example is presented to demonstrate
   the usefulness of the proposed method for achieving design performance
   goals using supplemental damping devices. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley

Title = {{Suspensions of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Stabilized by Anionic

Abstract = {{Two common anionic surfactants, sodium oleate (SO) and sodium dodecyl
   benzene sulfonate (SDBS) were used to re-suspend iron oxide
   nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. At certain SO concentrations, the SO
   formulations produced highly stable suspensions. In contrast,
   SDBS-stabilized nanoparticles exhibited poor stability at all
   concentrations. The adsorption isotherm of SO on iron oxide
   nanoparticles revealed that stable suspensions were obtained when the
   equilibrium SO concentration (after adsorption) reached its critical
   micelle concentration (CMC). At this ``optimal{''} condition, the
   maximum SO adsorption was reached, and the zeta-potential of the
   particles was highly negative (similar to -50 mV). According to the SO
   isotherm, this optimal formulation coincided with the formation of a
   highly compact SO bilayer. The SDBS isotherm, on the other hand,
   revealed that SDBS is not strongly adsorbed on the surface of iron oxide
   nanoparticles and that is likely that a patchy, loosely packed bilayer,
   is formed on the surface of the iron oxide nanoparticles when the
   equilibrium SDBS concentration reaches its CMC. The DLVO theory
   confirmed the connection between formulation conditions and the
   corresponding stability. This works confirmed that the formation of a
   surfactant bilayer is an important element in producing stable
   nanoparticle suspensions with anionic surfactants. It was also confirmed
   that for anionic surfactants, electrostatic repulsions are an important
   factor in establishing an energy barrier against flocculation. This work
   also introduced two more elements into the design of nanoparticle
   suspensions. The first element is that, in order to ensure the best
   possible dispersion, the surfactant concentration in solution at
   equilibrium with the adsorbed surfactant should be close or slightly
   above its CMC. The second element is that the molecular structure of the
   surfactant should facilitate the formation of closely packed bilayers.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in drinking water is most
   commonly associated with the chloramination of amine-based precursors.
   One option to control the NDMA formation is to remove the precursors via
   pre-oxidation, and prechlorination is among the most effective options
   in reducing NDMA formation. However, most of the findings to-date are
   based on single-precursor scenarios using the model precursor
   dimethylamine (DMA) and natural organic matter (NOM), while few studies
   have considered the potential interactions between water matrix
   components and the target precursors when investigating the
   prechlorination impact. Specifically, little is known for the behaviour
   of amine-based pharmaceuticals which have recently been reported to
   contribute to NDMA formation upon chloramination. This work demonstrates
   that pre-chlorination can affect both the ultimate NDMA conversion and
   the reaction kinetics from selected pharmaceuticals, and the nature and
   extent of the impact was compound-specific and matrix-specific. In the
   absence of NOM, the NDMA formation from most pharmaceuticals was reduced
   upon prechlorination, except for sumatriptan which showed a consistent
   increase in NDMA formation with increasing free chlorine contact time.
   In the presence of NOM, prechlorination was shown to enhance initial
   reactions by reducing the binding between NOM and pharmaceuticals, but
   prolonged prechlorination broke down NOM into smaller products which
   could then form new bonds with pharmaceuticals and thus inhibit their
   further conversion into NDMA. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Multi-scale mechanical improvement produced in carbon nanotube fibers by
   irradiation cross-linking}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Fibers and yarns based on carbon nanotubes (CNT) are emerging as a
   possible improvement over more traditional high strength carbon fibers
   used as reinforcement elements in composite materials. This is driven by
   a desire to translate the exceptional mechanical properties of
   individual CNT shells to achieve high performance macroscopic fibers and
   yarns. One of the central limitations in this approach is the weak shear
   interactions between adjacent CNT shells and tubes within macroscopic
   fibers and yarns. Furthermore, the multiple levels of interaction, e.g.,
   between tubes within a multi-walled CNT or between bundles within a
   fiber, compound the problem. One promising direction to overcome this
   limitation is the introduction of strong and stiff cross-linking bonds
   between adjacent carbon shells. A great deal of research has been
   devoted to studying such cross-linking by the irradiation of CNT based
   materials using either high energy particles, such as electrons, to
   directly covalently cross-link CNTs, or electromagnetic irradiation,
   such as gamma rays to strengthen polymer cross-links between CNT shells
   and tubes. Here we review recent progress in the field of
   irradiation-induced cross-linking at multiple levels in CNT based fibers
   with a focus on mechanical property improvements. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A pneumatic droplet generator to produce molten metal droplets smaller
   than the nozzle diameter is described. The generator consists of a
   heated cylinder in which a cavity is machined. A nozzle is fit into a
   stainless steel nozzle holder and attached to the bottom plate of the

   valve. Opening the valve for a preset time creates a pulse of
   alternating negative and positive pressure in the gas above the surface
   of the molten metal, and a droplet is ejected through the nozzle. The
   effect of various parameters such as the ejection frequency, nozzle
   diameter, pulse width and secondary gas flow on droplet formation is
   investigated. This method made it possible to produce droplets as small
   as 60\% the nozzle diameter. An approximate analytical method is studied
   to understand the liquid behavior within the nozzle, estimate the
   droplet size, and investigate the effect of the secondary gas flow

Abstract = {{A number of tendon transfers have been described for opponensplasty.
   Transfer of the palmaris longus (PL) tendon with a palmar fascial

   median neuropathy with atrophy of the thenar muscles. However, the
   Camitz transfer has not been previously described in the setting of
   pediatric median nerve injury. We report 4 cases of Camitz transfer in
   pediatric patients with median nerve injuries. Four children (all
   female; age range 3-15 yrs) underwent PL tendon transfer following
   median nerve injury. The causes of injury included trauma, iatrogenic
   injury, and neuritis of the brachial plexus. The Camitz procedure was
   performed at the time of median nerve decompression and/or
   reconstruction. All patients had excellent early return of function.
   Transfer of the palmaris longus tendon reliably restores palmar
   abduction, with minimal to no additional morbidity, in carefully
   selected pediatric patients with median nerve injury undergoing release

Abstract = {{This study reports the diurnal, seasonal, and annual variation of
   ultrafine particle size distributions in downtown Toronto. The k-means
   clustering algorithm was applied to five years of size-resolved data for
   particles with diameters less than 100 nm. Continuous particle number
   concentrations were measured 16 m from a major arterial roadway between
   March 2006 and May 2011 using a Fast Mobility Particle Sizer. Eight
   particle size distribution (PSD) types were identified. The PSD types
   exhibited distinct weekday-weekend and diurnal patterns. The relative
   frequency that each PSD occurred varied with season and wind direction
   and was correlated with other pollutants. These temporal patterns and
   correlation helped in elucidating the sources and processes that each of
   the eight PSD represent. Finally, similar PSD types were observed in
   residential areas located 6 and 15 km away from the central monitoring
   site suggesting that these PSD types may be generalizable to other
   sites. Identification of PSD types was found to be a valuable tool to
   support the interpretation of PSD data so as to elucidate the sources

Abstract = {{Traumatic injury to the spinal cord causes cell death, demyelination,
   axonal degeneration, and cavitation resulting in functional motor and
   sensory loss. Stem cell therapy is a promising approach for spinal cord
   injury (SCI); however, this strategy is currently limited by the poor
   survival and uncontrolled differentiation of transplanted stem cells. In
   an attempt to achieve greater survival and integration with the host
   tissue, we examined the survival and efficacy of adult brain-derived
   neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) injected within a hydrogel blend of
   hyaluronan and methyl cellulose (HAMC) into a subacute, clinically
   relevant model of rat SCI. Prior to use, HAMC was covalently modified
   with recombinant rat platelet-derived growth factor-A (rPDGF-A) to
   promote oligodendrocytic differentiation. SCI rats transplanted with
   NSPCs in HAMC-rPDGF-A showed improved behavioral recovery compared to
   rats transplanted with NSPCs in media. Rats with NSPC/HAMC-rPDGF-A
   transplants had a significant reduction in cavitation, improved graft
   survival, increased oligodendrocytic differentiation, and sparing of
   perilesional host oligodendrocytes and neurons. These data suggest that
   HAMC-rPDGF-A is a promising vehicle for cell delivery to the injured
   spinal cord. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new approach that enables investors to seek a reasonably
   robust policy for portfolio selection in the presence of rare but
   high-impact realization of moment uncertainty. In practice, portfolio
   managers face difficulty in seeking a balance between relying on their
   knowledge of a reference financial model and taking into account
   possible ambiguity of the model. Based on the concept of
   Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), we introduce a new penalty
   framework that provides investors flexibility to define prior reference
   models using the distributional information of the first two moments and
   accounts for model ambiguity in terms of extreme moment uncertainty. We
   show that in our approach a globally-optimal portfolio can in general be
   obtained in a computationally tractable manner. We also show that for a
   wide range of specifications our proposed model can be recast as
   semidefinite programs. Computational experiments show that our penalized
   moment-based approach outperforms classical DRO approaches in terms of
   both average and downside-risk performance using historical data.}},

   WAVEFORMS DERIVED FROM MAXIMUM DOPPLER SPECTRAL VELOCITY}},

Abstract = {{Given evidence that fully developed axisymmetric flow may be the
   exception rather than the rule, even in nominally straight arteries,
   maximum velocity (V-max) can lie outside the Doppler sample volume (SV).
   The link between V-max and derived quantities, such as volume flow (Q),
   may therefore be more complex than commonly thought. We performed
   idealized virtual Doppler ultrasound on data from image-based
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of the normal human carotid
   artery and investigated how velocity profile skewing and choice of
   sample volume affected V-max waveforms and derived Q variables,
   considering common assumptions about velocity profile shape (i.e.,
   Poiseuille or Womersley). Severe velocity profile skewing caused
   substantial errors in V-max waveforms when using a small, centered SV,
   although peak V-max was reliably detected; errors with a long SV
   covering the vessel diameter were orientation dependent but lower
   overall. Cycle-averaged Q calculated from V-max was typically within
   +/-15\%, although substantial skewing and use of a small SV caused
   10\%-25\% underestimation. Peak Q derived from Womersley's theory was
   generally accurate to within +/-10\%. V-max pulsatility and resistance
   indexes differed from Q-based values, although the Q-based resistance
   index could be predicted reliably. Skewing introduced significant error
   into V-max-derived Q waveforms, particularly during mid-to-late systole.
   Our findings suggest that errors in the V-max and Q waveforms related to
   velocity profile skewing and use of a small SV, or orientation-dependent
   errors for a long SV, could limit their use in wave analysis or for
   constructing characteristic or patient-specific flow boundary conditions
   for model studies. (E-mail: steinman@mie.utoronto.ca) (C) 2013 World

Abstract = {{The majority of bioengineering strategies to promote peripheral nerve
   regeneration after injury have focused on therapies to bridge large
   nerve defects while fewer therapies are being developed to treat other
   nerve injuries, such as nerve transection. We constructed delivery
   systems using fibrin gels containing either free GDNF or
   polylactideglycolic acid (PLGA) microspheres with GDNF to treat delayed
   nerve repair, where ELISA verified GDNF release. We determined the
   formulation of microspheres containing GDNF that optimized nerve
   regeneration and functional recovery in a rat model of delayed nerve
   repair. Experimental groups underwent delayed nerve repair and treatment
   with GDNF microspheres in fibrin glue at the repair site or control
   treatments (empty microspheres or free GDNF without microspheres).
   Contractile muscle force, muscle mass, and MUNE were measured 12 weeks
   following treatment, where GDNF microspheres (2 weeks formulation) were
   superior compared to either no GDNF or short-term release of free GDNF
   to nerve. Nerve histology distal to the repair site demonstrated
   increased axon counts and fiber diameters due to GDNF microspheres (2
   weeks formulation). GDNF microspheres partially reversed the deleterious
   effects of chronic nerve injury, and recovery was slightly favored with
   the 2 weeks formulation compared to the 4 weeks formulation. Biotechnol.

Abstract = {{No effective clinical treatment currently exists for traumatic spinal
   cord injury. Cell replacement therapy holds promise for attaining
   functional repair. Cells may be delivered directly or near the injury
   site; however, this strategy requires a delivery vehicle to maintain
   cell viability. We have identified an injectable, biocompatible, and
   biodegradable hydrogel scaffold composed of hyaluronan (HA) and
   methylcellulose (MC) that may be an effective scaffold for therapeutic
   cell delivery. The purpose of the present study was to determine the
   effects of polymer concentration on HAMC mechanical strength, gelation
   time, and cell viability. The yield stress of HAMC, a measure of
   mechanical stiffness, was tunable via manipulation of MC and HA content.
   Measurement of the elastic and storage moduli as functions of time
   revealed that HAMC gels in less than 5 min at physiological
   temperatures. Human umbilical tissue-derived cells encapsulated in HAMC
   were homogenously and stably distributed over 3 days in culture and
   extended processes into the scaffold. Cell viability was stable over
   this period in all but the most concentrated HAMC formulation. Because
   of its strength-tunability, rapid gelation, and ability to maintain cell
   viability, HAMC is a promising vehicle for cell delivery and is being
   tested in ongoing in vivo studies. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Abstract = {{In this study, composites were fabricated with four types of pulp fibers
   and two types of thermoset polymers. Four pulp fibers included hardwood
   and softwood high-yield pulp (HYP), Kraft pulp, and Whatman cellulose
   fibers and two polymers included unsaturated polyester (UPE) and vinyl
   ester (VE). FTIR and TGA results showed the chemical differences among
   the four pulp fibers and confirmed the existence of lignin on the HYP
   pulp fibers. The two HYP fibers were more compatible to the UPE resin,
   while the Kraft and Whatman cellulose fibers were more compatible to the
   VE resin as indicated by the tensile properties. Lignin on the two HYP
   fibers acted as a natural coupling agent for the natural fiber and the
   more hydrophobic UPE resin. The two cellulose-rich pulp fibers performed
   better when the VE resin was used. Composite storage moduli were
   significantly improved as compared with those of the neat UPE and VE
   resins. Only a slight increase in glass transition temperature was noted
   for the composites. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of multimodal imaging as a tool to assess the in vivo

   understanding the nature of their in vivo transport. The current study
   reports the development of a nano-sized liposomal computed tomographic

   micro-CT and optical imaging to quantitatively assess the whole-body
   (macroscopic), intratumoral, and microscopic distribution over a period
   of 8 days. These multimodal liposomes have a vascular half-life of 30.3
   +/- 8.9 hours in mice bearing subcutaneous H520 non-small cell lung
   cancer tumors, with the maximum liposome accumulation in tumor achieved
   48 hours postinjection. The in vivo liposome distribution and stability
   were quantitatively assessed using both micro-CT and fluorescence
   molecular tomography. The combination of CT and optical imaging enables
   visualization of the liposomes at the whole-body, tumor, and cellular
   scales with high sensitivity. Such noninvasive tracking of therapeutic
   vehicles at the macro-and microscale is important for informed and

Abstract = {{Background-Geospatial methods using mathematical optimization to
   identify clusters of cardiac arrests and prioritize public locations for
   defibrillator deployment have not been studied. Our objective was to
   develop such a method and test its performance against a
   population-guided approach.
   Methods and Results-All public location cardiac arrests in Toronto,
   Ontario, Canada, from December 16, 2005, to July 15, 2010, and all
   automated external defibrillator (AED) locations registered with Toronto
   Emergency Medical Services as of September 2009 were plotted
   geographically. Current AED coverage was quantified by determining the
   number of cardiac arrests occurring within 100 m of a registered AED.
   Clusters of cardiac arrests without a registered AED within 100 m were
   identified. With the use of mathematical optimization techniques,
   cardiac arrest coverage improvements were computed and shown to be
   superior to results from a population-guided deployment method. There
   were 1310 eligible public location cardiac arrests and 1669 registered
   AEDs. Of the eligible cardiac arrests, 304 were within 100 m of at least
   1 registered AED (23\% coverage). The average distance from a cardiac
   arrest to the closest AED was 281 m. With AEDs deployed in the top 30
   locations, an additional 112 historical cardiac arrests would be covered
   (32\% total coverage), and the average distance to the closest AED would
   be 262 m.
   Conclusions-Geographic clusters of cardiac arrests can be easily
   identified and prioritized with the use of mathematical modeling.
   Optimized AED deployment can increase cardiac arrest coverage and
   decrease the distance to the closest AED. Mathematical modeling can
   augment public AED deployment programs. (Circulation.

Abstract = {{The impact of detecting multiple infectious diseases simultaneously at
   point-of-care with good sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility
   would be enormous for containing the spread of diseases in both
   resource-limited and rich countries. Many barcoding technologies have
   been introduced for addressing this need as barcodes can be applied to
   detecting thousands of genetic and protein biomarkers simultaneously.
   However, the assay process is not automated and is tedious and requires
   skilled technicians. Barcoding technology is currently limited to use in
   resource-rich settings. Here we used magnetism and microfluidics
   technology to automate the multiple steps in a quantum dot barcode
   assay. The quantum dot-barcoded microbeads are sequentially (a)
   introduced into the chip, (b) magnetically moved to a stream containing
   target molecules, (c) moved back to the original stream containing
   secondary probes, (d) washed, and (e) finally aligned for detection. The
   assay requires 20 min, has a limit of detection of 1.2 nM, and can
   detect genetic targets for HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis. This study
   provides a simple strategy to automate the entire barcode assay process
   and moves barcoding technologies one step closer to point-of-care
   applications.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{Optical microscopy suffers from a fundamental resolution limitation
   arising from the diffractive nature of light. While current solutions to
   sub-diffraction optical microscopy involve combinations of near-field,
   non-linear and fine scanning operations, we hereby propose and
   demonstrate the optical super-microscope (OSM) - a
   superoscillation-based linear imaging system with far-field working and
   observation distances which can image an object in real-time and with
   sub-diffraction resolution. With our proof-of-principle prototype we
   report a point spread function with a spot size clearly reduced from the
   diffraction limit, and demonstrate corresponding improvements in
   two-point resolution experiments. Harnessing a new understanding of
   superoscillations, based on antenna array theory, our OSM achieves
   far-field, sub-diffraction optical imaging of an object without the need
   for fine scanning, data post-processing or object pre-treatment. Hence
   the OSM can be used in a wide variety of imaging applications beyond the
   diffraction limit, including real-time imaging of moving objects.}},

Abstract = {{While 3-D tissue models have received increasing attention over the past
   several decades in the development of traditional anti-cancer therapies,
   their potential application for the evaluation of advanced drug delivery
   systems such as nanomedicines has been largely overlooked. In
   particular, new insight into drug resistance associated with the 3-D
   tumor microenvironment has called into question the validity of 2-D
   models for prediction of in vivo anti-tumor activity. In this work, a
   series of complementary assays was established for evaluating the in
   vitro efficacy of docetaxel (DTX) -loaded block copolymer micelles
   (BCM+DTX) and Taxotere (R) in 3-D multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS)
   cultures. Spheroids were found to be significantly more resistant to
   treatment than monolayer cultures in a cell line dependent manner.
   Limitations in treatment efficacy were attributed to mechanisms of
   resistance associated with properties of the spheroid microenvironment.
   DTX-loaded micelles demonstrated greater therapeutic effect in both
   monolayer and spheroid cultures in comparison to Taxotere (R). Overall,
   this work demonstrates the use of spheroids as a viable platform for the
   evaluation of nanomedicines in conditions which more closely reflect the
   in vivo tumor microenvironment relative to traditional monolayer
   cultures. By adaptation of traditional cell-based assays, spheroids have
   the potential to serve as intermediaries between traditional in vitro
   and in vivo models for high-throughput assessment of therapeutic
   candidates.}},

   data rates > 2x the rate attainable by conventional intracavity phase
   modulation. We propose to use DC-balanced encoding to mitigate the
   inter-symbol interference in coupling modulation. Analysis shows that
   coupling modulation can be more efficient than intracavity modulation
   for large output swings and high-Q resonators. Coupling modulation
   enables very high-Q resonant modulators to be simultaneously low-power
   and high-speed, features which are mutually incompatible in typical
   resonant modulators studied to date. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{75}},

Abstract = {{The semi-empirical Kozeny-Carman (KC) equation is a commonly-used
   relationship for determining permeability as a function of porosity for
   granular porous materials. This model features a material-specific
   fitting parameter, C-KC, which is generally treated as a constant
   coefficient. Recent studies, however, have shown that C-KC is not
   constant and could be a varying function of porosity. We used
   lattice-Boltzmann (LB) modeling to calculate the absolute permeability
   of two simulated porous structures: periodic arrays of (a) staggered
   parallel infinite cylinders and (b) spheres. We then identified various
   functional forms of C-KC, and for each form, we performed a regression
   analysis in order to fit the function to the permeability values
   determined from the LB simulations. From this analysis, we extracted
   optimal fitting parameters for each function that minimized the error
   between permeability values obtained from the KC model and the LB
   simulations. All linear and non-linear functional forms proposed in this
   work improve the predictability of the KC model. An algebraic function
   for C-KC provided the most accurate prediction of the KC
   porosity-permeability relationship for the geometries examined. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper reports the effects of various additives (i.e., micro-sized
   talc, nanosilica, and nanoclay) with different sizes and aspect ratios
   on the crystallization kinetics of polylactide (PLA) using a
   high-pressure differential scanning calorimeter, a polarized optical
   microscope, and a wide-angle X-ray Diffractometer. Regardless of the CO2
   content, the micro-sized talc particles enhanced the PLA's
   crystallization rate effectively through fast nucleation and a high
   growth rate with more perfect crystals. In contrast, the large number of
   nano-sized particles delayed the initial crystal growth especially with
   the long-aspect-ratio nanoclay, most likely due to the reduced mobility
   of PLA molecules. However, the final number of crystal nuclei was
   increased and these crystals, together with the dispersed nanoparticles,
   further hindered crystal growth by molecular entanglement. This resulted
   in a lower final crystallinity than for the PLA-talc system. An
   increased CO2 pressure further expedited the PLA's crystallization
   kinetics by increasing the molecular mobility. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Organohalide respiration is an anaerobic bacterial respiratory process
   that uses halogenated hydrocarbons as terminal electron acceptors during
   electron transport-based energy conservation. This dechlorination
   process has triggered considerable interest for detoxification of
   anthropogenic groundwater contaminants. Organohalide-respiring bacteria
   have been identified from multiple bacterial phyla, and can be
   categorized as obligate and non-obligate organohalide respirers. The
   majority of the currently known organohalide-respiring bacteria carry
   multiple reductive dehalogenase genes. Analysis of a curated set of
   reductive dehalogenases reveals that sequence similarity and substrate
   specificity are generally not correlated, making functional prediction
   from sequence information difficult. In this article, an
   orthologue-based classification system for the reductive dehalogenases
   is proposed to aid integration of new sequencing data and to unify
   terminology.}},

Abstract = {{Two novel reductive dehalogenases (RDases) that are highly similar to
   each other but catalyse distinct dechlorination reactions were
   identified from Dehalobacter-containing mixed cultures. These two RDases
   were partially purified from crude protein extracts of anaerobic
   dechlorinating enrichment cultures using blue native polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis. Gel slices were assayed for dechlorinating activity,
   and associated proteins were identified using liquid chromatography
   tandem mass spectrometry with the metagenome of the parent culture as
   the reference database. The two RDases identified, annotated as CfrA and
   DcrA, share an amino acid identity of 95.2 per cent, but use different
   substrates: CfrA dechlorinates chloroform (CF) and 1,1,1-trichloroethane
   (1,1,1-TCA), but not 1,1-dichloroethane; DcrA dechlorinates
   1,1-dichloroethane, but not CF or 1,1,1-TCA. These two novel RDases
   share no more than 40 per cent amino acid identity to any other known or
   putative RDases, but both have a twin-arginine motif and two iron-sulfur
   binding motifs conserved in most RDases. Peptides specific to two
   putative membrane anchor proteins, annotated as CfrB and DcrB, were also
   detected in gel slices.}},

Abstract = {{We report the first digital microfluidic (DMF) system capable of
   impedance sensing of mammalian cells. The new system was validated in
   three assays: calibration, proliferation, and serum sensing. In the
   first assay, three cell lines (HeLa, CHO-K1, and NIH-3T3) were seeded at
   different densities to determine the relationship between impedance and
   cell number, which was found to be linear for each type of cell. In the
   proliferation assay, cells were grown for four days and their
   proliferation rates were determined by regular impedance measurements.
   In the serum sensing assay, a dilution series of cell media containing
   different concentrations of serum was evaluated using impedance
   measurements to determine the optimum conditions for proliferation. The
   DMF impedance system is label-free, does not require imaging, and is
   compatible with long-term cell culture. We propose that this system will
   be useful for the growing number of scientists who are seeking methods
   other than fluorescence or cell sorting to analyze adherent cells in
   situ. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a technique for single-cell electrical property
   (specific membrane capacitance and cytoplasm conductivity)
   characterization at a speed of 5-10 cells/s (vs. minutes/cell using
   existing techniques such as patch clamping and electrorotation). When a
   cell flows through a microfluidic constriction channel which is
   marginally smaller than the diameter of tested cells, electrical
   impedance at multiple frequencies is measured. Electrical and
   geometrical models are developed to interpret the impedance data and to
   determine the specific membrane capacitance and cytoplasm conductivity
   of individual cells. Results from testing 3249 AML-2 cells and 3398
   HL-60 cells reveal different specific membrane capacitance and cytoplasm
   conductivity values between AML-2 (12.0 +/- 1.44 mF/m(2), 0.62 +/- 0.10
   S/m) and HL-60 (14.5 +/- 1.75 mF/m(2), 0.76 +/- 0.12 S/m) cells. The

   results since these parameters contain information additional to cell

   shear yield stress was significantly strain dependent, being 0.23 and
   0.57, after 1 and 4 passes, respectively. The high SRS index of 0.57 is
   indicative of a superplastic deformation behavior dominated by grain
   boundary sliding. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Boron subphthalocyanines (BsubPcs) are macrocyclic aromatic small
   molecules containing a chelated boron atom. BsubPcs have interesting
   optoelectronic and physical properties, justifying their use in various
   organic electronic devices such as organic solar cells and organic
   light-emitting diodes. However, our group has only recently reported the
   first incorporation of a BsubPc moiety into a polymer using a two-step
   post-polymerization procedure. This communication outlines the use of
   acrylic acid as a method for obtaining carboxylic acid functional
   copolymers for the facile coupling to BsubPc post polymerization. In
   addition, the observations and the proposed mechanism of a side product
   unique to the copolymerization of acrylic acid and styrene due to
   autoinitiation are presented.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an approach to overcome the well-known
   ``diffraction limit{''} when imaging sources several wavelengths away.
   We employ superdirectivity antenna concepts to design a well-controlled
   superoscillatory filter (SOF) based on the properties of Tschebyscheff
   polynomials. The SOF is applied to the reconstructed images from
   holographic algorithms which are based on the back-propagation
   principle. We demonstrate the capability of this approach when imaging
   point-sources several wavelengths away in one-, two-, and
   three-dimensional imaging with super-resolution. We also investigate the
   robustness of the proposed algorithm with the sharpness of the SOF, the
   presence of noise, the imaging distance, and the size of the scanning
   aperture. (c) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

   simpler geometries. For acute angle wedges, it is shown that the
   thermal-wave field near the edge exhibits confinement behavior and
   increased amplitude compared to a flat (reference) solid with theta =
   pi. For obtuse angle wedges, it is shown that the opposite is true and
   relaxation of confinement occurs leading to lower amplitude thermal-wave
   fields. The theory provides a basis for quantitative thermophysical
   characterization of wedge-shaped objects and it is tested using an AISI
   304 steel wedge and photothermal radiometry detection. (C) 2013 American

Abstract = {{A high ion flux parallel electrode plasma is proposed and studied in its
   DC configuration. By cascading a diode source region which supplies
   electrons and a saddle field region where these seed electrons are
   energized and amplified, the energy of ion bombardment on the substrate
   can be decoupled from the plasma density. The sufficiently large density
   of electrons and holes in the vicinity of the substrate raises the
   possibility to perform plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition on
   insulating materials, at low sheath voltages (around 40 V in the
   configuration studied), at low temperatures in which the surface
   mobility of film growth species may be provided by the bombardment of
   moderate energy ions. As a benchmarking exercise, experiments are
   carried out on silane discharge characteristics and deposition of
   hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) on both silicon wafer and glass.
   The films grown at low anode voltages have excellent microstructures
   with predominantly monohydride bonds, sharp band tails, but relatively
   high integrated defect density in the mid 10(16)/cm(3) range for the
   particular substrate temperature of 180 degrees C, indicating that
   further optimizations are necessary if the electrode configuration is to
   be used to create a-Si:H devices. (C) 2013 American Institute of

Title = {{Investigating the Autonomic Nervous System Response to Anxiety in
   Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{Assessment of anxiety symptoms in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a
   challenging task due to the symptom overlap between the two conditions
   as well as the difficulties in communication and awareness of emotions
   in ASD. This motivates the development of a physiological marker of
   anxiety in ASD that is independent of language and does not require
   observation of overt behaviour. In this study, we investigated the
   feasibility of using indicators of autonomic nervous system (ANS)
   activity for this purpose. Specially, the objectives of the study were
   to 1) examine whether or not anxiety causes significant measurable
   changes in indicators of ANS in an ASD population, and 2) characterize
   the pattern of these changes in ASD. We measured three physiological
   indicators of the autonomic nervous system response (heart rate,
   electrodermal activity, and skin temperature) during a baseline (movie
   watching) and anxiety condition (Stroop task) in a sample of typically
   developing children (n = 17) and children with ASD (n = 12). The anxiety
   condition caused significant changes in heart rate and electrodermal
   activity in both groups, however, a differential pattern of response was
   found between the two groups. In particular, the ASD group showed
   elevated heart rate during both baseline and anxiety conditions.
   Elevated and blunted phasic electrodermal activity were found in the ASD
   group during baseline and anxiety conditions, respectively. Finally, the
   ASD group did not show the typical decrease in skin temperature in
   response to anxiety. These results suggest that 1) signals of the
   autonomic nervous system may be used as indicators of anxiety in
   children with ASD, and 2) ASD may be associated with an atypical
   autonomic response to anxiety that is most consistent with sympathetic
   over-arousal and parasympathetic under-arousal.}},

Abstract = {{Anonymous probe vehicle monitoring systems are being developed to
   measure travel times on highways and arterials based on wireless signals
   available from technologies such as Bluetooth. Probe vehicle data can
   provide accurate measurements of current traffic speeds and travel times
   due to their excellent spatial coverage. However, presently probe
   vehicles are only a small portion of the vehicles that make up all of
   the traffic in the network. Alternatively, data from conventional loop
   detectors cover almost all the vehicles that have traveled along a road
   section, resulting in excellent temporal coverage. Unfortunately, loop
   detector measurements can be imprecise; their spatial sampling depends
   on the loop detector spacing, and they typically only represent traffic
   speed at the location of the detector and not over the entire road
   segment. With this complementarity in mind, this article explores
   several data fusion techniques for fusing data from these sources
   together. All methods are implemented and compared in terms of their
   ability to fuse data from loop detectors and probe vehicles to
   accurately estimate freeway traffic speeds. Data from a Bluetooth
   traffic monitoring system are fused with corresponding loop detector
   data and compared against GPS collected probe vehicle data on a stretch
   of Highway 401 in Toronto, Canada. The analysis shows that through data
   fusion, even a few probe vehicle measurements from a Bluetooth traffic
   monitoring system can improve the accuracy of traffic speed estimates
   traditionally obtained from loop detectors.}},

Abstract = {{Using scanning tunneling microscopy we observed reaction products of two
   chemisorbed thiolate species, methylthiolate and phenylthiolate, on the
   Au(111) surface. Despite the apparent stability, organometallic
   complexes of methyl- and phenylthiolate with the gold-adatom (RS-Au-SR,
   with R as the hydrocarbon group) undergo a stoichiometric exchange
   reaction, forming hybridized CH3S-Au-SPh complexes. Complementary
   density functional theory calculations suggest that the reaction is most
   likely mediated by a monothiolate RS-Au complex bonded to the gold
   surface, which forms a trithiolate RS-Au-(SR)-Au-SR complex as a key
   intermediate. This work therefore reveals the novel chemical reactivity
   of the low-coverage ``striped{''} phase of alkanethiols on gold and
   strongly points to the involvement of monoadatom thiolate intermediates
   in this reaction. By extension, such intermediates may be involved in
   the self-assembly process itself, shedding new light on this
   long-standing problem.}},

Abstract = {{A non-linear damage model is developed for the prediction of stiffness
   degradation in composite laminates due to transverse matrix cracking.
   The model follows the framework of a recently developed synergistic
   damage mechanics (SDM) approach which combines the strengths of
   micro-damage mechanics and continuum damage mechanics (CDM) through the
   so-called constraint parameters. A common limitation of the current CDM
   and SDM models has been the tendency to over-predict stiffness changes
   at high crack densities due to linearity inherent in their
   stiffness-damage relationships. The present paper extends this SDM
   approach by including higher order damage terms in the characterization
   of ply cracking damage inside the material. Following the SDM procedure,
   predictions are aided by suitable micromechanical computations of crack
   opening displacements. A nonlinear SDM model is developed and applied
   for multiple classes of composite laminate layups. Stiffness predictions
   for damaged laminates using the developed model are compared with the
   experimental data for cross-ply ({[}0(m)/90(n)](s)), angle-ply
   ({[}+/-theta(m)/90(n)](s)), off-axis ({[}0/+/-theta(4)/0(1/2)](s)) and
   quasi-isotropic ({[}0/90/ -/+ 45](s)) laminates. A comparison with
   current linear damage models showcases the usefulness of the proposed
   nonlinear SDM approach.}},

Abstract = {{A considerable amount of waste slag from the pyrite roasting process is
   produced every year. Recovery of iron from the waste slag is of great
   interest for maximum use of mineral resource, reduction of environment
   impact and improvement of economical benefits to the related companies.
   The objectives of the present work are focused on: compare various
   options for recovery of iron from the waste slag and select the most
   advantageous option for industrial trial which is roasting of the waste
   slag under reducing condition followed by magnetic separation;
   investigate the optimum conditions for maximum recovery of iron from the
   waste slag. The experimental results show that under the treatment
   condition in this work about 70\% of the iron was recovered from the
   waste slag, where the iron content in the concentrate is 57\%. After the
   further treatment with chlorinated segregation-magnetic separation, the
   iron content in the recovered slag can reach 83\%. After the treatment,
   sulphur content in the concentrate was reduced significantly and gangue
   materials, such as SiO2, Al2O3 and TiO2, were reduced effectively. This
   paper is mainly focused on the results of reduction roasting-magnetic

Abstract = {{In-pipe robots are used to carry sensors and some other repairing
   instruments to perform inspection and maintenance jobs inside pipelines.
   In this paper, a self-locking mechanism is presented to improve the
   traction ability of in-pipe robots and avoid their traditional
   limitations. The structure of this type of in-pipe robot is presented
   and some critical design issues on the principle of self-locking
   mechanism are discussed. Prototypes of 19 mm diameter were produced, and
   related experiments were performed on specially designed test platform.
   The traction ability of the proposed in-pipe robot was measured
   experimentally to be 15.2 N, far beyond its maximum static friction of
   0.35 N with the inner surface of pipeline. It means that this
   development has broken the traditional limitation of in-pipe robot whose
   traction ability was smaller than its maximum static friction with the
   pipeline.}},

Abstract = {{The reconfigurable-hardware real-time power system simulator (RH-RTS) is
   a field-programmable gate-array (FPGA)-based real-time simulator that is
   developed based on the concept of simulators hardware reconfigurability
   (i.e., to change the underlying hardware architecture of the simulator
   to accommodate various power system topologies). The uniqueness of the
   RH-RTS is the underlying hardware architecture. The RH-RTS has a
   massively parallel customized hardware architecture that is tailored to
   the solution of the mathematical model of the power system under
   consideration. The RH-RTS enables the simulation of large power systems
   with a computation-time per simulation time-step in the range of tens of
   nanoseconds. Not only does the RH-RTS provide a means for real-time
   operation (e. g., for closed-loop testing of physical control/protection
   platforms in hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) configuration), it also provides
   a means for faster-than-real-time operation (e.g., for statistical
   switching studies). This paper provides validation and evaluation of the
   performance of the RH-RTS. This paper presents a case study involving
   the simulation of a power system in both real time and faster than real
   time. The computation time per simulation time-step is as low as 24 ns,
   for realistic size systems, which is, by far, the lowest computation
   time reported in the technical literature.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces and evaluates an auxiliary control strategy for
   downstream fault current interruption in a radial distribution line by
   means of a dynamic voltage restorer (DVR). The proposed controller
   supplements the voltage-sag compensation control of the DVR. It does not
   require phase-locked loop and independently controls the magnitude and
   phase angle of the injected voltage for each phase. Fast least error
   squares digital filters are used to estimate the magnitude and phase of
   the measured voltages and effectively reduce the impacts of noise,
   harmonics, and disturbances on the estimated phasor parameters, and this
   enables effective fault current interrupting even under arcing fault
   conditions. The results of the simulation studies performed in the
   PSCAD/EMTDC software environment indicate that the proposed control
   scheme: 1) can limit the fault current to less than the nominal load
   current and restore the point of common coupling voltage within 10 ms;
   2) can interrupt the fault current in less than two cycles; 3) limits
   the dc-link voltage rise and, thus, has no restrictions on the duration
   of fault current interruption; 4) performs satisfactorily even under
   arcing fault conditions; and 5) can interrupt the fault current under
   low dc-link voltage conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Recent findings suggest that rapid perturbation-evoked reach-to-grasp
   balance-recovery reactions can be (and often are) guided by visuospatial
   information stored in working memory. To further our understanding, the
   present study examined the influence of memory-decay and concurrent
   cognitive-task performance on the speed, accuracy and effectiveness of
   these reactions by using liquid-crystal goggles to initiate occlusion of
   vision at various ``recall-delay{''} times prior to perturbation-onset,
   in ten healthy young-adults. A small handhold was moved unpredictably to
   one of four locations 2 s prior to vision-occlusion; reactions to
   recover balance by grasping the handhold were evoked by unpredictable
   antero-posterior platform-translation perturbations. Recall-delay time
   (0 s/2 s/5 s/10 s) was randomized, and subjects performed a spatial- or
   non-spatial-memory task during the delay-time in a subset of trials.
   Consistent with studies of volitional reach-to-grasp, recall-delay led
   to some reduction in endpoint accuracy; however, unlike those studies,
   the present results showed no evidence that recall-delay led to slowing
   of the arm movement. Both spatial and non-spatial cognitive tasks had
   similar effects (slowing of movement initiation and execution),
   suggesting these effects were related to generic attentional demands
   rather than competition for specific resources related to spatial
   working memory. Further work is needed to determine effects of
   age-related impairments in visuospatial memory and attentional capacity.

Abstract = {{Several lines of evidence, including remote triggering of earthquakes
   and modulation of seismic tremor by Earth tides, suggest that faults
   weaken when subject to shaking and dynamic stresses associated with the
   passage of seismic waves. However, the origin of such dynamic weakening
   is poorly understood. Here we explore the role of acoustic resonance for
   dynamic fault weakening using laboratory measurements. Experiments were
   conducted using a split Hopkinson pressure bar assembly, with dynamic
   stressing via impact loading. Samples were composed of crushed rock
   particles from mine tailings with a particle size distribution similar
   to that found in a natural fault gouge. We used pulse-shaper techniques
   and carefully evaluated dynamic stresses recorded at the front and rear
   of the sample to ensure that dynamic force balance was satisfied. Our
   experiments document acoustic-induced fluidization and dramatic dynamic
   weakening. Frictional strength and elastic modulus of a simulated fault
   gouge are reduced by a factor of 510 via acoustic fluidization. We find
   a threshold acoustic pressure for fluidization that varies
   systematically with gouge zone properties. Our observations could help
   explain dynamic fault weakening and triggering of earthquake fault slip
   by dynamic stressing.}},

Abstract = {{Research and development of low CO2 binders for building material
   applications is warranted in efforts to reduce the negative
   environmental impacts associated with the cement and concrete industry.
   The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of carbonation
   curing on the mineralogy, morphology, microstructure and evolution of
   compressive strength of mortars comprised of general use (GU) cement,
   ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), and reactive MgO used as
   cement replacement. This study investigates binary (GU-Mg0) and ternary
   (GU-GGBFS-Mg0) blends exposed to atmosphere curing (0.0038\%CO2) and
   carbonation curing (99.9\%CO2). Carbonation-cured mortars exhibited
   greater compressive strengths than atmosphere mortars at all ages (7 d,
   28 d, and 56 d). Increasing percentages of reactive MgO decreased the
   compressive strength markedly less for carbonation-cured mortars than
   atmosphere-cured mortars particularly due to magnesium calcite
   formations. Magnesium calcite influenced the morphology of carbonates
   and promoted the carbonate agglomeration resulting in a dense and
   interconnected microstructure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   constricting protein leads to conversion of the particle from a disc- to
   a vesicle-shaped structure and provides further evidence that the
   apolipoprotein serves a functional role on the nanodisc. Fluorescence
   measurements of these nanodiscs in a detergent show that fluorescence is
   over 99\% quenched in the intact state with a 12-fold increase in
   singlet oxygen generation upon disruption. Cellular fluorescence
   unquenching and dose-dependent phototoxicity demonstrate that these
   nanodiscs can be internalized and unquenched intracellularly. Finally,
   nanodiscs were found to display a 5-fold increase in diffusion
   coefficient when compared with the protein-free control ((3.5 +/- 0.1) x
   10(-7) vs (0.7 +/- 0.03) x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1)). The ability to
   incorporate large amounts of photosensitizer drugs into its compact
   structure allows for phototherapeutic action, fluorescence diagnostic
   applications, and the potential to effectively deliver photosensitizes
   deep into poorly permeable tumors.}},

Abstract = {{By the delivery of specific natural or engineered proteins, mammalian
   cells can be programmed to perform increasingly sophisticated and useful
   functions. Here, we introduce a set of proteins that has potential value
   in cell-based therapies by programming a cell to target tumor cells.
   First, the delivery of VSV-G (vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein)
   allowed the cell to undergo membrane fusion with adjacent cells to form
   syncytia (i.e., a multinucleated cell) in conditions of low pH typically
   occurring at a tumor site. The formation of syncytia caused the
   clustering of nuclei along with an integration of the microtubule
   network and ER. Interestingly, the formation of syncytia between cells
   that are dynamically blebbing, a mode of migration preferred during
   tumor metastasis, resulted in the loss Of these morphology changes.
   Lastly, the codelivery of VSV-G with L57R (an engineered photoactivated
   caspase-7) allowed cells to undergo low pH-dependent, membrane fusion
   followed by blue light-dependent apoptosis. In cell-based therapies, the
   clearance of syncytia between tumor cells might further trigger an
   immune response against the tumor.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a microfluidic approach to measure liquid
   solvent diffusivity in Athabasca bitumen. The method has three
   distinguishing features: (a) a sharp initial condition enabled by the
   high wettability of the solvent; (b) one-dimensional diffusive transport
   (in the absence of convection) ensured by microscale confinement; and
   (c) visible-light-based measurement enabled by the partial transparency
   of the bitumen at small scales. The method is applied to measure the
   diffusion of toluene into bitumen by imaging transmitted light profiles
   over time, and relating intensities to the mass fractions. Plotting
   toluene mass fraction versus distance/sqrt(time), results in a tight
   superposition of all curves (time-dependent mass fractions)
   demonstrating the diffusion dominated nature of the system and the
   robustness of the method. The diffusion transport equations were solved
   and fit to a constant diffusion coefficient as well as a variety of
   concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient relations found in the
   literature. For intermediate toluene mass fractions (0.2-0.8), a
   constant diffusion coefficient of 2.0 X 10(-10) m(2)/s provides an
   appropriate representation. However, at low toluene mass fractions
   (<0.2), significantly reduced diffusive transport is observed, and
   endpoint analysis indicates diffusion coefficients trending toward 4.3 X
   10(-11) At high toluene mass fractions (>0.8), the values trend toward
   1.5 X 10(-10) m(2)/s. This microfluidic method provides an inexpensive
   and rapid mutual diffusion coefficient evaluation, with significantly
   improved spatial/composition resolution vis-a-vis competing measurement
   methods.}},

Title = {{Annulus fibrosus cells can induce mineralization: an in vitro study}},
Journal = {{SPINE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{443-453}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: There is still no consensus as to whether the
   calcification observed in degenerate intervertebral discs (IVDs) is a
   cause or a consequence of disc degeneration.
   PURPOSE: To investigate the mineralization potential of healthy
   (independent of other associated changes) annulus fibrosus (AF) cells
   under controlled in vitro conditions.
   STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: In vitro study to investigate the mineralization
   potential of the AF cells.
   METHODS: Annulus fibrosus cells, isolated from bovine IVDs, were grown
   in monolayer. The effect of cell density, culture time, age of cell
   source, and passage on the percentage of AF cells with alkaline
   phosphatase activity (ALPa) was evaluated. Gene expression of
   mineralization-associated markers was determined. Cells were
   immunostained for Type I, II, and X collagens. To study mineralization
   potential, AF cells and AF cells that were sorted into two populations,
   high (top 5\%+/- 1\%) or low (bottom 5\%+/- 1\%) ALPa expressors, were
   grown in the presence of beta-glycerophosphate for 2 weeks.
   RESULTS: The percentage of AF cells that express ALPa changes with time
   in culture and seeding density for primary immature and mature cell
   sources but not for passaged cells. Gene expression of ALP, matrix
   metallopeptidase-13 (MMP-13), osteopontin, and runt-related
   transcription factor 2 was upregulated by Day 7. Under
   mineralization-inducing conditions, high ALPa expressors and unsorted AF
   cells formed von Kossa-positive nodules, composed of hydroxyapatite as
   determined by electron diffraction analysis. Low ALPa expressors had
   significantly fewer von Kossa-positive nodules (p<.01) compared with
   high ALPa expressors. Cells showed colocalization of Type I collagen and
   ALPa. No Type II collagen was detected suggesting that these were AF
   cells and not chondrocytes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Annulus fibrosus cells have mineralizing capability and
   form hydroxyapatite crystalline deposits when cultured under appropriate
   conditions. This system could be used to investigate mineralization
   mechanisms in the AF during pathological calcification and at the
   AF-bone interface in disc degeneration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Few quantitative diagnostic and monitoring, tools are available to
   clinicians treating patients with Alzheimer's disease. Further, many of

   specificity toward different types of Amyloid-beta (A beta) pathology
   such as vascular or oligomeric species. Antibodies offer an opportunity
   to image specific types of A beta pathology because of their excellent
   specificity. In this study, we developed a method to translate a panel
   of anti-A beta antibodies, which show excellent histological
   performance, into live animal imaging contrast agents. In the TgCRND8
   mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, we tested two antibodies, M64 and
   M116, that target parenchyma aggregated A beta plaques and one antibody,
   M31, that targets vascular A beta. All three antibodies were
   administered intravenously after labeling with both poly(ethylene
   glycol) to enhance circulation and Cu-64 to allow detection via positron
   emission tomography (PET) imaging. We were clearly able to differentiate
   TgCRND8 mice from wild type controls by PET imaging using either M116,
   the anti-A beta antibody targeting parenchymal A beta or M31, the

   and showed clear evidence of binding to A beta plaques.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{113-118}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background: In Canadian hospitals, which are typically financed by
   global annual budgets, overuse of operating rooms is a financial risk
   that is frequently managed by cancelling elective surgical procedures.
   It is uncertain how different scheduling rules affect the rate of
   elective surgery cancellations.
   Methods: We used discrete event simulation modelling to represent
   perioperative processes at a hospital in Toronto, Canada. We tested the
   effects of the following 3 scenarios on the number of surgical
   cancellations: scheduling surgeons' operating days based on their
   patients' average length of stay in hospital, sequencing surgical
   procedures by average duration and variance, and increasing the number
   of post surgical ward beds.
   Results: The number of elective cancellations was reduced by scheduling
   surgeons whose patients had shorter average lengths of stay in hospital
   earlier in the week, sequencing shorter surgeries and those with less
   variance in duration earlier in the day, and by adding up to 2
   additional beds to the postsurgical ward.
   Conclusion: Discrete event simulation modelling can be used to develop
   strategies for improving efficiency in operating rooms.}},

   utilized to isolate and enhance the internal boundaries between
   craniofacial cortical and trabecular bone. Subsequently, the shell-like
   nature of cortical bone was exploited using boundary-tracking level-set
   methods with optimized parameters determined from large-scale
   sensitivity analysis. The process was applied to clinical CT images
   acquired from two cadaveric CFSs. The accuracy of the automated
   segmentations was determined based on their volumetric concurrencies
   with visually optimized manual segmentations, without statistical
   appraisal. The full CFSs demonstrated volumetric concurrencies of 0.904
   and 0.719; accuracy increased to concurrencies of 0.936 and 0.846 when
   considering only the maxillary region. The highly automated approach
   presented here is able to segment the cortical shell and trabecular
   boundaries of the CFS in clinical CT images. The results indicate that
   initial scan resolution and cortical trabecular bone contrast may impact
   performance. Future application of these steps to larger data sets will
   enable the determination of the method's sensitivity to differences in
   image quality and CFS morphology. Dentomaxillofacial Radiology (2013)

Abstract = {{The sequestration of carbon in underground brine-filled reservoirs is a
   promising approach for reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions.
   However, accurately estimating the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) that
   can be captured remains a challenge. One difficulty lies in predicting
   the effects of capillary pressure variations on CO2 saturation arising
   from mineral contact angle heterogeneity inherent in geological
   formations. To determine the impact of these effects, the invasion of
   brine-filled porous media by supercritical CO2 was simulated using a
   three-dimensional regular-lattice pore network model. The effects of
   contact angle heterogeneity on CO2 saturation involving quartz and mica
   were modeled over a range of viscosity ratios (M) and capillary numbers
   (C-a) relevant to carbon sequestration. At C-a similar to 10(-4), CO2
   saturation was 20\% higher for heterogeneous contact angle
   distributions, compared to similar networks with homogeneous
   distributions. To quantify these results, we present power-law
   correlations for CO2 saturations in terms of M, whereby the introduction
   of contact angle heterogeneity affected both the coefficient and
   exponent of the best-fit power-law functions, at lower values of C-a.
   These results highlight the importance of micro-scale contact angle
   heterogeneity when sequestering CO2. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The re-centering phenomenon of superelastic Shape Memory Alloy (SMA)
   reinforced concrete is a unique characteristic that is appealing for
   structural applications, along with the ability to respond with stable
   hystereses and achieve similar strength and ductility to concrete
   reinforced with conventional deformed bars. The objective of this study
   was to investigate the structural performance of superelastic SMA
   reinforced concrete and to develop a preliminary constitutive model
   applicable to nonlinear finite element algorithms. Seven simply
   supported flexure-critical concrete beams, reinforced with either SMA
   bars in the critical region or conventional deformed reinforcement, were
   subjected to monotonic, cyclic, and reverse cyclic loading. The
   experiment results demonstrated the superior capacity of the SMA beams
   to recover inelastic displacements. The SMA beams sustained displacement
   ductility and strength capacity comparable to the conventional beams.
   Crack widths and crack spacing were larger in the SMA beams; however,
   upon removal of load, the crack openings were recovered. Energy
   dissipation was lower in the SMA beams, particularly when subjected to
   reverse cyclic loading. The constitutive model based on a trilinear
   backbone envelope response and linear unloading and reloading rules
   provided satisfactory simulations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Modelling departure time choices by a Heteroskedastic Generalized Logit

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents an econometric model for departure time choice
   modelling. The proposed model is a discrete choice model with latent
   choice sets. As per the formulation of the mode, the model falls in the
   general category of Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) models with choice
   set formation, which is also known as a Generalized Logit (GenL) model.
   However, the proposed modelling framework uses a scale parameterization
   approach to capture heteroskedasticity in departure time choices. Hence,
   the model presented in the paper is a Heteroskedastic Generalized Logit
   (Het-GenL) model in general or specifically a heteroskedastic Paired
   Combinatorial Logit Model (Het-PCL). Empirical models are developed for
   the departure time choices for home-based commuting trips in the Greater
   Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA). The datasets from the Transportation
   Tomorrow Survey, a 5 percent household based trip diary survey conducted
   in 2006 is used for empirical model estimation. Separate models are
   estimated for private car and transit users' departure time choices. It
   becomes evident that transportation level-of-service attributes enter
   into the systematic utility function as well as the scale parameter
   function with significant coefficients. The proposed econometric
   approach captures the normalization effect of different variables in
   terms of simultaneously influencing systematic utility as well as the
   scale parameter and thereby correctly explains the elasticity of
   corresponding variables. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous metal complexes of 1,3-bis(2-pyridylimino)isoindoline (BPI) are
   known, but coordination to this ligand has been limited to transition
   metals. Herein, we report on the synthesis of group 13 (boron, aluminum,
   gallium, and indium) complexes of BPI and their basic spectroscopic
   properties. In its deprotonated monoanionic form, the BPI ligand
   chelates to boron via a bidentate (NN)-N-boolean AND interaction,
   forming a non-symmetric molecule. Coordination to aluminum, gallium, and
   indium occurs via a tridendate (NNN)-N-boolean AND-N-boolean AND
   interaction, forming a symmetric molecule. Absorption spectroscopy shows
   multiple absorption bands in the UV-visible region for the boron,
   gallium, and indium complex. A single broad absorption in the UV region
   was noted for the aluminum complex. Fluorescence emission spectroscopy
   using an excitation wavelength of 352 nm showed small differences in
   emission behavior among the complexes. However, with excitation at the
   lambda(max) and longest lambda of absorption, the aluminum complex of
   BPI was found to be much more emissive than the complexes of boron,
   gallium and indium; The latter complexes all had emission intensities on
   the same order of magnitude, each having a low fluorescence quantum
   yield. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   ligand-bound forms. This work is the first complete synthesis of the
   structural properties of 26 USP available in the Protein Data Bank, over
   75\% of which were determined by structure genomics centers with no
   additional information provided. The results of bioinformatic analyses
   of all available USP structures and their sequence homologs revealed
   that these two new USP structures share overall structural similarity
   with structures of USPs previously determined. Clustering and cladogram
   analyses, however, show how they diverge from other members of the USP
   superfamily and show greater similarity to USPs from organisms
   inhabiting extreme environments. We compared them with other archaeal
   and bacterial USPs and discuss their similarities and differences in
   context of structure, sequential motifs, and potential function. We also
   attempted to group all analyzed USPs into families, so that assignment
   of the potential function to those with no experimental data available
   would be possible by extrapolation.}},

Abstract = {{This technical brief investigates virtual holonomic constraints for
   Euler-Lagrange systems with degrees-of-freedom and controls. In our
   framework, a virtual holonomic constraint is a relation specifying
   configuration variables in terms of a single angular configuration
   variable. The enforcement by feedback of such a constraint induces a
   desired repetitive behavior in the system. We give conditions under
   which a virtual holonomic constraint is feasible, i.e, it can be made
   invariant by feedback, and it is stabilizable. We provide sufficient
   conditions under which the dynamics on the constraint manifold
   correspond to an Euler-Lagrange system. These ideas are applied to the
   problem of swinging up an underactuated pendulum while guaranteeing that
   the second link does not fall over.}},

Abstract = {{Our research focuses on developing an automated victim identification
   methodology for rescue robots in order to aid robot operators with the
   complex and stressful task of searching for victims in cluttered urban
   search and rescue (USAR) environments. In this paper, we present an
   approach that utilizes 2D and 3D sensory information from a real-time 3D
   sensory system for robust victim identification using both human
   geometric and skin region features. Our technique, uniquely, allows for
   the identification of partially occluded victims and single body parts
   that may be visible in cluttered USAR scenes using a Support Vector
   Machine-based classifier based on the aforementioned features. Unlike
   other approaches that focus on the recognition of one specific body part
   (such as the head) or the recognition of a small set of fixed body
   poses, we aim to identify multiple different body parts in a number of
   varying configurations to increase recognition rate. Experimental
   results illustrate the robustness of our methodology to find human
   victims in a variety of different poses in a rubble-filled USAR-like
   scene and its ability to potentially reduce operator workload.}},

Title = {{Non-parametric Bayesian approach to post-translational modification
   refinement of predictions from tandem mass spectrometry}},
Journal = {{BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{821-829}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Motivation: Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a dominant approach for
   large-scale high-throughput post-translational modification (PTM)
   profiling. Although current state-of-the-art blind PTM spectral analysis
   algorithms can predict thousands of modified peptides (PTM predictions)
   in an MS/MS experiment, a significant percentage of these predictions
   have inaccurate modification mass estimates and false modification site
   assignments. This problem can be addressed by post-processing the PTM
   predictions with a PTM refinement algorithm. We developed a novel PTM
   refinement algorithm, iPTMClust, which extends a recently introduced PTM
   refinement algorithm PTMClust and uses a non-parametric Bayesian model
   to better account for uncertainties in the quantity and identity of PTMs
   in the input data. The use of this new modeling approach enables
   iPTMClust to provide a confidence score per modification site that
   allows fine-tuning and interpreting resulting PTM predictions.
   Results: The primary goal behind iPTMClust is to improve the quality of
   the PTM predictions. First, to demonstrate that iPTMClust produces
   sensible and accurate cluster assignments, we compare it with k-means
   clustering, mixtures of Gaussians (MOG) and PTMClust on a synthetically
   generated PTM dataset. Second, in two separate benchmark experiments
   using PTM data taken from a phosphopeptide and a yeast proteome study,
   we show that iPTMClust outperforms state-of-the-art PTM prediction and
   refinement algorithms, including PTMClust. Finally, we illustrate the
   general applicability of our new approach on a set of human chromatin
   protein complex data, where we are able to identify putative similar to
   ovel modified peptides and modification sites that may be involved in
   the formation and regulation of protein complexes. Our method
   facilitates accurate PTM profiling, which is an important step in
   understanding the mechanisms behind many biological processes and should
   be an integral part of any proteomic study.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Not fully understanding the type of axons activated during
   vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is one of several factors that limit the
   clinical efficacy of VNS therapies. The main goal of this study was to
   characterize the electrical recruitment of both myelinated and
   unmyelinated fibers within the cervical vagus nerve. Approach. In
   anesthetized dogs, recording nerve cuff electrodes were implanted on the
   vagus nerve following surgical excision of the epineurium. Both the
   vagal electroneurogram (ENG) and laryngeal muscle activity were recorded
   in response to stimulation of the right vagus nerve. Main results.
   Desheathing the nerve significantly increased the signal-to-noise ratio
   of the ENG by 1.2 to 9.9 dB, depending on the nerve fiber type. Repeated
   VNS following nerve transection or neuromuscular block (1) enabled the
   characterization of A-fibers, two sub-types of B-fibers, and
   unmyelinated C-fibers, (2) confirmed the absence of stimulation-evoked
   reflex compound nerve action potentials in both the ipsilateral and
   contralateral vagus nerves, and (3) provided evidence of stimulus
   spillover into muscle tissue surrounding the stimulating electrode.
   Significance. Given the anatomical similarities between the canine and
   human vagus nerves, the results of this study provide a template for
   better understanding the nerve fiber recruitment patterns associated
   with VNS therapies.}},

Journal = {{ATHEROSCLEROSIS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{227}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{259-266}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Wall shear stress (WSS) is an important parameter with links
   to vascular (dys) function. Difficult to measure directly, WSS is often
   inferred from maximum spectral Doppler velocity (V-max) by assuming
   fully-developed flow, which is valid only if the vessel is long and
   straight. Motivated by evidence that even slight/local curvatures in the
   nominally straight common carotid artery (CCA) prevent flow from fully
   developing, we investigated the effects of velocity profile skewing on
   V-max-derived WSS.
   Methods: Velocity profiles, representing different degrees of skewing,
   were extracted from the CCA of image-based computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) simulations carried out as part of the VALIDATE study. Maximum
   velocities were calculated from idealised sample volumes and used to
   estimate WSS via fully-developed (Poiseuille or Womersley) velocity
   profiles, for comparison with the actual (i.e. CFD-derived) WSS.
   Results: For cycle-averaged WSS, mild velocity profile skewing caused
   +/- 25\% errors by assuming Poiseuille or Womersley profiles, while
   severe skewing caused a median error of 30\% (maximum 55\%). Peak
   systolic WSS was underestimated by similar to 50\% irrespective of
   skewing with Poiseuille; using a Womersley profile removed this bias,
   but +/- 30\% errors remained. Errors were greatest in late systole, when
   skewing was most pronounced. Skewing also introduced large
   circumferential WSS variations: +/- 60\%, and up to +/- 100\%, of the
   circumferentially averaged value.
   Conclusion: V-max-derived WSS may be prone to substantial variable
   errors related to velocity profile skewing, and cannot detect possibly
   large circumferential WSS variations. Caution should be exercised when
   making assumptions about velocity profile shape to calculate WSS, even
   in vessels usually considered long and straight. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF LUMINESCENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{100-108}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Nanoparticles of ZnS doped with Mn, a common photo- and
   electro-luminescent species, were synthesized in water using a
   competitive precipitation method. Particle size was controlled by
   selection of an appropriate stabilizer added during synthesis,
   3-mercaptopropionic acid, which also rendered the particles
   water-dispersible after synthesis and isolation. Primary particle size
   was similar to 3 nm, with small agglomerates of 10-20 nm in size. The
   particles were stably dispersed into water at a loading of 2.5 w/w\%.
   This dispersion formed the basis for an aqueous inkjet ink, containing 1
   w/w\% ZnS:Mn. The small particle size allowed the nanoparticles to be
   successfully delivered to several substrates without loss during
   filtration or jetting. Bright photoluminescence was observed in the
   printed patterns on some substrates (glass, photo-paper, foil, etc.) but
   was quenched on other substrates where the ink penetrated into the
   surface (uncoated paper). The small drop volume (10 pL) allowed for
   reasonably high-resolution printed patterns to be deposited, albeit with
   significant surface roughness due to the ``coffee-ring{''} effect. (c)

Abstract = {{During the fabrication of MOS light emitting devices, the thin film of
   active material is usually characterized by photoluminescence
   measurements before electrical contacts are deposited. However, the
   presence of a conductive contact layer can alter the luminescent
   properties of the active material. The local optical density of states
   changes due to the proximity of luminescent species to the interface
   with the conductive medium (the top electrode), and this modifies the
   radiative rate of luminescent centers within the active layer. In this
   paper we report enhancement of the observed erbium photoluminescence
   rate after deposition of indium tin oxide contacts on thin films of
   SiO2:Er containing silicon nanoclusters, and relate this to Purcell
   enhancement of the erbium radiative rate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

   dynamic compressive loading}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the design and analysis of a broadband
   piezoelectric energy harvester that uses a simply supported
   piezoelectric beam compressed by dynamic loading. The beam is restrained
   at one end and carries a moving mass at the other end where a magnetic
   force is applied axially. Taking advantage of the flexibility of the
   slender beam and the nonlinearity of the magnetic force, the design aims
   to enhance the harvester's functionality with a broad frequency
   bandwidth. Both theoretical and experimental investigations are
   performed in this study over a range of excitation frequencies.
   Specifically, the electromechanical model of the harvester is
   analytically developed by means of the energy-based method and the
   extended Hamilton's principle. Using the derived model, a parametric
   study is carried out to obtain the harvester's voltage response under
   parametric excitations. Furthermore, the effects of various parameters
   on the harvester's voltage response are examined. A prototype harvester
   is fabricated and experimentally tested. The theoretical model is
   validated against experimental data to confirm the harvester's nonlinear
   response behaviors and enhanced capabilities. Both simulation and
   experiment illustrate that the harvester exhibits a softening
   nonlinearity and hence a broad frequency bandwidth with large-amplitude
   voltage response. It is also shown from numerical simulations that the
   harvester's performance can be further improved by properly selecting
   the end mass and reducing the mechanical damping. The present findings
   demonstrate that dynamic compressive loadings can be successfully
   utilized to increase the harvester's voltage output and frequency
   bandwidth.}},

Volume = {{91}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen trichloride (NCl3) is a by-product of electrolytic chlorine
   manufacture, produced when the brine is contaminated with ammonia. A
   common treatment method is a thermal destruction process in which the
   NCl3 is absorbed in a solvent (CHCl3) using a distillation column with
   no liquid bottoms product. The chlorine gas is cooled through direct
   contact with liquid chlorine, which flashes and condenses the solvent
   and NCl3 vapours. The condensate drains through trays to a reboiler in
   which the NCl3 decomposes while the chlorine, solvent, NCl3 solution
   boils. This process is well-known and widely practiced but is known to
   experience catastrophic detonations. A vapour phase thermal
   decomposition of NCl3 does occur, particularly when the heat added
   through compression is considered. The known data on this decomposition
   reaction have been collected and converted in a rate expression that
   allows for integration within an ASPENPLUS process model. Different
   options for the compressor, precooler, intercooler and liquefier
   operations are considered, and their impact on the compressor and
   liquefier duties is reported. A different approach to the design and
   operation for a chlorine compression/liquefaction train is presented and
   discussed. (c) 2013 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering}},

Title = {{Using dual presolving reductions to reformulate cumulative constraints}},
Journal = {{CONSTRAINTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{166-201}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Dual presolving reductions are a class of reformulation techniques that
   remove feasible or even optimal solutions while guaranteeing that at
   least one optimal solution remains, as long as the original problem was
   feasible. Presolving and dual reductions are important components of
   state-of-the-art mixed-integer linear programming solvers. In this
   paper, we introduce them both as unified, practical concepts in
   constraint programming solvers. Building on the existing idea of
   variable locks, we formally define and justify the use of dual
   information for cumulative constraints during a presolving phase of a
   solver. In particular, variable locks are used to decompose cumulative
   constraints, detect irrelevant variables, and infer variable assignments
   and domain reductions. Since the computational complexity of propagation
   algorithms typically depends on the number of variables and/or domain
   size, such dual reductions are a source of potential computational
   speed-up. Through experimental evidence on resource constrained project
   scheduling problems, we demonstrate that the conditions for dual
   reductions are present in well-known benchmark instances and that a
   substantial proportion of them can be solved to optimality in presolving
   - without search. While we consider this result very promising, we do
   not observe significant change in overall run-time from the use of our
   novel dual reductions.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, microstructural evolutions at the joint region of
   transient liquid phase bonded IN-738LC superalloy were examined. The
   experiments were carried out at 1100 degrees C with different holding
   times using Ni-B-Si-Cr-Fe filler alloy, AMS 4776, with B and Si as the
   melting point depressant elements. It was found that insufficient
   isothermal solidification of liquated insert caused the formation of
   continuous centreline eutectic phases. The width of the eutectic
   decreased with the increase in holding time. Complete isothermal
   solidification, which precluded the formation of the centreline
   eutectic, occurred within 45 min of holding time. In addition to the
   centreline eutectic products, precipitation of boron rich particles was
   observed at the diffusion affected zone. Homogenisation of isothermally
   solidified joints at 1120 degrees C for 300 min resulted in the
   elimination of intermetallic phases formed at the diffusion affected
   zone and formation of significant gamma' precipitates in the joint
   region.}},

Abstract = {{Halo-benzoquinones (HBQs) have been previously detected as disinfection
   by-products in chlorinated drinking water. The current work investigates
   the link between natural organic matter (NOM) characteristics and HBQ
   formation during bench-scale coagulation of raw water. Three source
   waters (Lake Ontario, Otonabee River and Grand River) were subjected to
   jar testing using alum followed by chlorination. NOM fractions were
   analyzed via liquid chromatography organic carbon detection (LC-OCD),
   while HBQs were quantified using liquid chromatography triple quadrupole
   mass spectrometry. One HBQ, 2,6-dichloro-(1,4) benzoquinone (2,6-DCBQ),
   was identified in all waters after chlorination, and appeared to
   decrease with increased applied alum dose. 2,6-DCBQ exhibited high
   correlations with some humic NOM indicators: humic substance
   concentration (in Grand and Otonabee River waters only), UV absorbance
   at 254 nm, UV absorbance at 254 nm of the humic peak, and specific UV
   absorbance of humics (humic SUVA). With data pooled from the three
   waters, the biopolymer fraction of NOM was most strongly correlated with
   2,6-DCBQ formation (R-2 = 0.78, p < 0.001); this may be due to
   co-removal of biopolymers with HBQ precursors during coagulation. These
   results indicate that coagulation processes can be effective for
   reduction, but not elimination, of HBQ precursors. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Tumor heterogeneity is a limiting factor in cancer treatment and in the
   discovery of biomarkers to personalize it. We describe a computational
   purification tool, ISOpure, which directly addresses the effects of
   variable contamination by normal tissue in clinical tumor specimens.
   ISOpure uses a set of tumor expression profiles and a panel of healthy
   tissue expression profiles to generate a purified cancer profile for
   each tumor sample, and an estimate of the proportion of RNA originating
   from cancerous cells. Applying ISOpure before identifying gene
   signatures leads to significant improvements in the prediction of
   prognosis and other clinical variables in lung and prostate cancer.}},

Title = {{Impact of age and cognitive demand on lane choice and changing under

Abstract = {{Previous research suggests that drivers change lanes less frequently
   during periods of heightened cognitive load. However, lane changing
   behavior of different age groups under varying levels of cognitive
   demand is not well understood. The majority of studies which have
   evaluated lane changing behavior under cognitive workload have been
   conducted in driving simulators. Consequently, it is unclear if the
   patterns observed in these simulation studies carry over to actual
   driving. This paper evaluates data from an on-road study to determine
   the effects of age and cognitive demand on lane choice and lane changing
   behavior. Three age groups (20-29, 40-49, and 60-69) were monitored in
   an instrumented vehicle. The 40's age group had 147\% higher odds of
   exhibiting a lane change than the 60's group. In addition, drivers in
   their 60's were less likely to drive on the leftmost lane compared to
   drivers in their 20's and 40's. These results could be interpreted as
   evidence that older adults adopt a more conservative driving style as
   reflected in being less likely to choose the leftmost lane than the
   younger groups and less likely to change lanes than drivers in their
   40's. Regardless of demand level, cognitive workload reduced the
   frequency of lane changes for all age groups. This suggests that in
   general drivers of all ages attempt to regulate their behavior in a risk
   reducing direction when under added cognitive demand. The extent to
   which such self-regulation fully compensates for the impact of added
   cognitive demand remains an open question. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Stimulation of endogenous neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) with
   therapeutic factors holds potential for the treatment of stroke.
   Cyclosporin A (CsA) is a particularly promising candidate molecule
   because it has been shown to act as a survival factor for these cells
   over a period of weeks both in vitro and in vivo; however,
   systemically-delivered CsA compromises the entire immune system,
   necessitating sustained localized delivery. Herein we describe a local
   delivery strategy for CsA using an epi-cortical hydrogel of
   hyaluronan-methylcellulose (HAMC) as the drug reservoir. Three methods
   of incorporating the drug into the hydrogel (solubilized, particulate,
   and poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) microsphere-encapsulated)
   resulted in tunable release, spanning a period of hours to weeks.
   Importantly, PLGA-encapsulated CsA released from the hydrogel had
   equivalent bioactivity to fresh drug as measured by the neurosphere
   assay. Moreover, when CsA was released from the PLGA/HAMC composite that
   was injected on the cortex of adult mice, CsA was detected in the NSPC
   niche at a constant concentration for at least 24 days post-implant.
   Thus this hydrogel composite system may be promising for the treatment
   of stroke. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The human HD domain protein SAMHD1 is implicated in the
   Aicardi-Goutieres autoimmune syndrome and in the restriction of HIV-1
   replication in myeloid cells. Recently, this protein has been shown to
   possess dNTP triphosphatase activity, which is proposed to inhibit HIV-1
   replication and the autoimmune response by hydrolyzing cellular dNTPs.
   Here, we show that the purified full-length human SAMHD1 protein also
   possesses metal-dependent 3' -> 5' exonuclease activity against
   single-stranded DNAs and RNAs in vitro. In double-stranded substrates,
   this protein preferentially cleaved 3'-overhangs and RNA in blunt-ended
   DNA/RNA duplexes. Full-length SAMHD1 also exhibited strong DNA and RNA
   binding to substrates with complex secondary structures. Both nuclease
   and dNTP triphosphatase activities of SAMHD1 are associated with its HD
   domain, but the SAM domain is required for maximal activity and nucleic
   acid binding. The nuclease activity of SAMHD1 could represent an
   additional mechanism contributing to HIV-1 restriction and suppression
   of the autoimmune response through direct cleavage of viral and
   endogenous nucleic acids. In addition, we demonstrated the presence of
   dGTP triphosphohydrolase and nuclease activities in several microbial HD
   domain proteins, suggesting that these proteins might contribute to
   anti-viral defense in prokaryotes.}},

Abstract = {{Using first-principles simulations on PbS and CdSe colloidal quantum
   dots, we find that surface defects form in response to electronic doping
   and charging of the nanoparticles. We show that electronic trap states
   in nanocrystals are dynamic entities, in contrast with the conventional
   picture wherein traps are viewed as stable electronic states that can be
   filled or emptied, but not created or destroyed. These traps arise from
   the formation or breaking of atomic dimers at the nanoparticle surface.
   The dimers' energy levels can reside within the bandgap, in which case a
   trap is formed. Fortunately, we are also able to identify a number of
   shallow-electron-affinity cations that stabilize the surface, working to
   counter dynamic trap formation and allowing for trap-free doping.}},

Title = {{Are Quantum Dots Toxic? Exploring the Discrepancy Between Cell Culture
   and Animal Studies}},
Journal = {{ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{662-671}},
Month = {{MAR 19}},
Abstract = {{Despite significant interest in developing quantum dots (QDs) for
   biomedical applications, many researchers are convinced that QDs will
   never be used for treating patients because of their potential toxicity.
   The perception that QDs are toxic is rooted in two assumptions.
   Cadmium-containing QDs can kill cells in culture. Many researchers then
   assume that because QDs are toxic to cells, they must be toxic to
   humans. In addition, many researchers classify QDs as a homogeneous
   group of materials. Therefore, if CdSe QDs are harmful, they extrapolate
   this result to all QDs. Though unsubstantiated, these assumptions
   continue to drive QD research. When dosing is physiologically
   appropriate, QD toxicity has not been demonstrated in animal models. In
   addition, QDs are not uniform: each design is a unique combination of
   physicochemical properties that influence biological activity and
   toxicity. In this Account, we summarize key findings from in vitro and
   in vivo studies, explore the causes of the discrepancy in QD
   toxicological data, and provide our view of the future direction of the
   field.
   In vitro and in vivo QD studies have advanced our knowledge of cellular
   transport kinetics, mechanisms of QD toxicity, and biodistribution
   following animal injection. Cell culture experiments have shown that QDs
   undergo design-dependent intracellular localization and they can cause
   cytotoxicity by releasing free cadmium into solution and by generating
   free radical species. In animal experiments, QDs preferentially enter
   the liver and spleen following intravascular injection, undergo minimal
   excretion if larger than 6 nm, and appear to be safe to the animal.
   In vitro and in vivo studies show an apparent discrepancy with regard to
   toxicity. Dosing provides one explanation for these findings. Under
   culture conditions, a cell experiences a constant QD dose, but the in
   vivo QD concentration can vary, and the organ-specific dose may not be
   high enough to induce detectable toxicity. Because QDs are retained
   within animals, long-term toxicity may be a problem but has not been
   established.
   Future QD toxicity studies should be standardized and systematized
   because methodological variability in the current body of literature
   makes it difficult to compare and contrast results. We advocate the
   following steps for consistent, comparable toxicology data: (a)
   standardize dose metrics, (b) characterize QD uptake concentration, (c)
   identify in vitro models that reflect the cells QDs interact with in
   vivo, and (d) use multiple assays to determine sublethal toxicity and
   biocompatibility.
   Finally, we should ask more specific toxicological questions. For
   example: ``At what dose are 5 nm CdSe QDs that are stabilized with
   mercaptoacetic acid and conjugated to the antibody herceptin toxic to
   Hela cells?{''} rather than ``Are QDs toxic?{''} QDs are still a long
   way from realizing their potential as a medical technology. Modifying
   the current QD toxicological research paradigm, investigating toxicity
   in a case-by-case manner, and improving study quality are important
   steps in identifying a QD formulation that is safe for human use.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores technologies currently expanding the physical scope
   of air pollution monitoring and their potential contributions to the
   assessment of sustainable development. This potential lies largely in
   the ability of these technologies to address issues typically on the
   fringe of the air pollution agenda. Air pollution monitoring tends to be
   primarily focused on human health, and largely neglects other aspects of
   sustainable development. Sensor networks, with their relatively
   inexpensive monitoring nodes, allow for monitoring with finer
   spatiotemporal resolution. This resolution can support more conclusive
   studies of air pollution's effect on socio-ecological justice and human
   quality of life. Satellite observation of air pollution allows for wider
   geographical scope, and in doing so can facilitate studies of air
   pollution's effects on natural capital and ecosystem resilience. Many
   air pollution-related aspects of the sustainability of development in
   human systems are not being given their due attention. Opportunities
   exist for air pollution monitoring to attend more to these issues.
   Improvements to the resolution and scale of monitoring make these
   opportunities realizable. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The complex, thin and irregular bones of the human craniofacial skeleton
   (CFS) are connected together through bony articulations and connective
   tissues. These articulations are known as sutures and are commonly
   divided into two groups, facial and cranial sutures, based on their
   location in the CFS. CFS sutures can exhibit highly variable degrees of
   interdigitation and complexity and are believed to play a role in
   accommodating the mechanical demands of the skull. This study aimed to
   evaluate the mechanical behavior of CFS bone samples with and without
   sutures and to determine the effect of sutural interdigitations on
   mechanical strength. Sagittal, coronal, frontozygomatic and
   zygomaticotemporal sutures along with adjacent bone samples not
   containing sutures were excised from six fresh-frozen cadaveric heads.
   The interdigitation of the sutures was quantified through mu CT based
   analysis. Three-point bending to failure was performed on a total of 29
   samples. The bending strength of bone samples without sutures
   demonstrated a non-significant increase of 14\% as compared to samples
   containing sutures (P=0.2). The bending strength of bones containing
   sutures was positively correlated to the sutural interdigitation index
   (R=0.701, P=0.002). The higher interdigitation indices found in human
   cranial vs. facial sutures may be present to resist bending loads as a
   functional requirement in protecting the brain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Chlorobenzene is a widespread groundwater contaminant found at many
   industrial sites. Reductive dechlorination of chlorobenzene requires
   input of electron donor and results in problematic accumulation of
   benzene, which is more toxic than chlorobenzene. We hypothesized that
   coupling a culture capable of reductive dechlorination of chlorobenzene
   to benzene with a second benzene-degrading methanogenic culture would
   completely detoxify chlorobenzene. To this end, active
   chlorobenzene-dechlorinating microcosms that were producing benzene were
   inoculated with a previously described enriched methanogenic
   benzene-degrading consortium. The combination resulted in the
   transformation of chlorobenzene via benzene to the nontoxic degradation
   products, CO2 and CH4. Sustainable degradation of chlorobenzene and
   benzene was observed in the microcosms and was further confirmed by
   shifts in the carbon isotopic ratios of chlorobenzene and benzene during
   degradation. Moreover, we could show that benzene derived electrons
   fueled chlorobenzene dechlorination removing the need to provide
   exogenous electron donor. The results have promising implications for
   sustainable bioremediation of sites contaminated with chlorinated
   benzenes and benzene.}},

Abstract = {{Low-pressure injection foam molding of polypropylene/carbon-fiber
   composites with the aid of physical blowing agent (N-2) was conducted
   and their foaming behavior and through-plane electrical conductivity

   (0.3 wt.\% N-2) resulted in an increase of the conductivity up to four
   orders of magnitude and significant improvement in its uniformity along
   the injection-molded sample. Foaming enhanced the through-plane
   conductivity through: (a) an enhanced inter-connectivity of fibers
   through biaxial orientation around the growing bubbles, (b) a less
   degree of in-plane fiber orientation (especially within the skin layer)
   by the plasticizing effect of gas, and (c) a decreased skin layer
   thickness by the plasticizing gas. The results also show that the
   injection flow rate and melt temperature played an important role on the
   foams' conductivity through their effects on the foam morphology in the

Abstract = {{Motivated by a class of surface tracking problems in mechanical systems
   subject to contact vibrations, this paper considers a regulation problem
   for discrete-time switched bimodal linear systems where it is desired to
   achieve output regulation against exogenous input signals featuring
   known deterministic and unknown random components. A first step in the
   regulator design involves constructing a set of observer-based
   parameterized stabilizing controllers that satisfy a sufficient
   regulation condition for the switched system against the known
   deterministic disturbance or reference signals. In the second step, an
   additional performance constraint is added to identify, from among the
   already constructed regulators, those that provide the best regulation
   performance against the unknown random disturbances. A corresponding
   regulator synthesis algorithm is developed based on iteratively solving
   properly formulated bilinear matrix inequalities. The proposed regulator
   is successfully evaluated on an experimental setup involving a switched
   bimodal mechanical system subject to contact vibrations, hence
   demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed regulation approach.}},

Abstract = {{Interruptions are causal factors in medication errors. Although
   researchers have assessed the nature and frequency of interruptions
   during medication administration, there has been little focus on
   understanding their effects during medication ordering. The goal of this
   research was to examine the nature, frequency, and impact of
   interruptions on oncologists' ordering practices. Direct observations
   were conducted at a Canadian cancer treatment facility to (1) document
   the nature, frequency, and timing of interruptions during medication
   ordering, and (2) quantify the use of coping mechanisms by oncologists.
   On average, oncologists were interrupted 17 \% of their time, and were
   frequently interrupted during safety-critical stages of medication
   ordering. When confronted with interruptions, oncologists
   engaged/multitasked more often than resorting to deferring/blocking.
   While some interruptions are necessary forms of communication, efforts
   must be made to reduce unnecessary interruptions during safety-critical
   tasks, and to develop interventions that increase oncologists'
   resiliency to inevitable interruptions.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method for fabrication of branched, tubular, perfusable
   microvessels for use in vascular tissue engineering is reported. A
   tubular, elastomeric, biodegradable scaffold is first fabricated via a
   new, double fusible injection molding technique that uses a ternary
   alloy with a low melting temperature, Field's metal, and paraffin as
   sacrificial components. A cylindrical core metal of 500 pm or lower
   diameter with the target branching scaffold geometry is first
   constructed, then the metal structure is coated with paraffin and,
   finally, the metal-paraffin construct is embedded in
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The paraffin layer is then removed by
   heating and replaced by a biodegradable elastomeric pre-polymer that is
   subsequently UV-cured inside the PDMS. Next, the metal core is melted
   away and the PDMS is removed to attain the branched tubular elastomeric
   biodegradable scaffold. Finally, it is also demonstrated that human
   umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were able to spread on the
   surface of the scaffold and form a confluent monolayer, confirming the
   potential of this new technique for making engineered blood vessels.}},

Abstract = {{Pain is frequently reported following stroke, but seems to be an
   underemphasized phenomenon since it can importantly impact
   rehabilitation and long-term outcomes. Two major forms of pain have to
   be distinguished in patients with post-stroke pain: central, neuropathic
   pain, arising from the vascular lesion defined as central post-stroke
   pain (CPSP) and pain primarily triggered by peripheral mechanisms such
   as hemiplegic shoulder pain and spasticity-related pain. Headache after
   stroke is difficult to classify since the pathophysiology is unclear.
   The suggested underlying mechanisms as well as treatment strategies of
   post-stroke pain differ according to the origin (peripheral versus
   central). This article aims at reviewing the pertinent evidence
   regarding clinical characteristics and mechanisms of post-stroke pain
   generation with a focus on CPSP. We discuss possible treatment options
   and highlight current pathophysiological concepts.}},

Title = {{Broadband phonon mean free path contributions to thermal conductivity
   measured using frequency domain thermoreflectance}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Non-metallic crystalline materials conduct heat by the transport of
   quantized atomic lattice vibrations called phonons. Thermal conductivity
   depends on how far phonons travel between scattering events-their mean
   free paths. Due to the breadth of the phonon mean free path spectrum,
   nanostructuring materials can reduce thermal conductivity from bulk by
   scattering long mean free path phonons, whereas short mean free path
   phonons are unaffected. Here we use a breakdown in diffusive phonon
   transport generated by high-frequency surface temperature modulation to
   identify the mean free path-dependent contributions of phonons to
   thermal conductivity in crystalline and amorphous silicon. Our
   measurements probe a broad range of mean free paths in crystalline
   silicon spanning 0.3-8.0 mu m at a temperature of 311 K and show that 40
   +/- 5\% of its thermal conductivity comes from phonons with mean free
   path >1 mu m. In a 500nm thick amorphous silicon film, despite atomic
   disorder, we identify propagating phonon-like modes that contribute >35
   +/- 7\% to thermal conductivity at a temperature of 306 K.}},

Abstract = {{Although Nature has always been a common source of inspiration in the
   development of artificial materials, only recently has the ability of
   man-made materials to produce complex three-dimensional (3D) structures
   from two-dimensional sheets been explored. Here we present a new
   approach to the self-shaping of soft matter that mimics fibrous plant
   tissues by exploiting small-scale variations in the internal stresses to
   form three-dimensional morphologies. We design single-layer hydrogel
   sheets with chemically distinct, fibre-like regions that exhibit
   differential shrinkage and elastic moduli under the application of
   external stimulus. Using a planar-to-helical three-dimensional shape
   transformation as an example, we explore the relation between the
   internal architecture of the sheets and their transition to cylindrical
   and conical helices with specific structural characteristics. The
   ability to engineer multiple three-dimensional shape transformations
   determined by small-scale patterns in a hydrogel sheet represents a
   promising step in the development of programmable soft matter.}},

Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{The maximal covering location problem (MCLP) seeks location of
   facilities on a network, so as to maximize the total demand within a
   pre-defined distance or travel time of facilities (which is called
   coverage radius). Most of the real-world applications of MCLP comprise
   many demand nodes to be covered. Moreover, uncertainty is ubiquitous in
   most of the real-world covering location problems, which are solved for
   a long-term horizon. Therefore, this paper studies a large-scale MCLP on
   the plane with fuzzy coverage radii under the Hurwicz criterion. In
   order to solve the problem, a combination of variable neighborhood
   search (VNS) and fuzzy simulation is offered. Test problems with up to
   2500 nodes and different settings show that VNS is competitive, since it
   is able to find solutions with gaps all below 1.5\% in much less time
   compared to exact algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Course and Variation of the Intercostal Artery by CT Scan}},
Journal = {{CHEST}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{634-639}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: It is conventionally taught that the intercostal artery is
   shielded in the intercostal groove of the superior rib. The continuous
   course and variability of the intercostal artery, and factors that may
   influence them, have not been described in a large number of arteries in
   vivo.
   Methods: Maximal intensity projection reformats in the coronal plane
   were produced from CT scan pulmonary angiograms to identify the
   posterolateral course of the intercostal artery (seventh to 11th rib
   spaces). A novel semiautomated computer segmentation algorithm was used
   to measure distances between the lower border of the superior rib, the
   upper border of the inferior rib, and the position of the intercostal
   artery when exposed in the intercostal space. The position and
   variability of the artery were analyzed for association with clinical
   factors.
   Results: Two hundred ninety-eight arteries from 47 patients were
   analyzed. The mean lateral distance from the spine over which the artery
   was exposed within the intercostal space was 39 mm, with wide
   variability (SD, 10 mm; 10th-90th centile, 28-51 mm). At 3 cm lateral
   distance from the spine, 17\% of arteries were shielded by the superior
   rib, compared with 97\% at 6 cm. Exposed artery length was not
   associated with age, sex, rib space, or side. The variability of
   arterial position was significantly associated with age (coefficient,
   0.91; P<.001) and rib space number (coefficient, -2.60; P<.001).
   Conclusions: The intercostal artery is exposed within the intercostal
   space in the first 6 cm lateral to the spine. The variability of its
   vertical position is greater in older patients and in more cephalad rib
   spaces. CHEST 2013; 143(3):634-639}},

Abstract = {{For the purpose of suspension plasma spraying solid oxide fuel cell
   anode coatings, individual and multi-component aqueous suspensions of
   NiO, CuO, and Co3O4 have been assessed for stability either alone or in
   conjunction with poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) or
   2-phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid (PBTCA). Optimum
   concentrations of the dispersants have been determined using rheology
   measurements. The suspensions have also been characterized by
   dissolution behavior and zeta potential. The isoelectric points of CuO,
   Co3O4, and NiO were measured to be 7.9, 7.4, and greater than 10,
   respectively. Both the Co3O4 and a fine NiO fraction were stable in
   their native state. Based on the results of this study, all of the metal
   oxides respond favorably to PBTCA as a dispersant while only the Co3O4
   responds well to the addition of PEI. The effectiveness of PEI as a
   dispersant for CuO is unclear. A multi-component suspension of these
   oxides containing the equivalent of 60 wt.\% Cu, 32 wt.\% Co and 8 wt.\%
   Ni using only PBTCA as a dispersant showed no obvious signs of settling

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{178-194}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a dynamic nearest neighbor (DNN) policy is proposed for
   operating a fleet of vehicles to serve customers, who place calls in a
   Euclidean service area according to a Poisson process. Each vehicle
   serves one customer at a time, who has a distinct origin and destination
   independently and uniformly distributed within the service area. The new
   DNN policy is a refined version of the nearest neighbor (NN) policy that
   is well known to perform sub-optimally when the frequency of customer
   requests is high. The DNN policy maintains geographically closest
   customer-to-vehicle assignments, due to its ability to divert/re-assign
   vehicles that may be already en-route to pick up other customers, when
   another vehicle becomes available or a new customer call arrives. Two
   other pertinent issues addressed include: the pro-active deployment of
   the vehicles by anticipating in which regions of the service area future
   calls are more likely to arise; and, imposition of limits to avoid
   prohibitively long customer wait times. The paper also presents accurate
   approximations for all the policies compared. Extensive simulations,
   some of which are included herein, clearly show the DNN policy to be
   tangibly superior to the first-come-first-served (FCFS) and NN policies.

Title = {{Investigating the nonlinear relationship between transportation system

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{342-357}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents an econometric investigation of the behavioural
   relationship between transportation system performance in terms of
   travel time changes and daily activity travel scheduling processes.
   Innovative survey data on the complete daily activity-scheduling
   adaptation process is used jointly with revealed scheduling information.
   The survey, conducted in Zurich, Switzerland, collected daily scheduling
   information together with stated adaptation responses corresponding to
   four adaptation scenarios. The four scenarios are defined by applying
   hypothetical increases in travel time of 50\%, 100\%, and 200\% and a
   50\% decrease in travel time. Stated adaptation responses are collected
   in the context of 24-h activity scheduling. Data are used to estimate
   RUM based daily travel activity scheduling models. Models are estimated
   for one revealed schedule and four stated scheduling datasets. In
   addition, a joint model is estimated for pooled revealed and stated
   scheduling data. In the joint model, separate scale/variance parameters
   are estimated for revealed and stated information. Results clearly
   identify the nonlinear responses of activity travel scheduling to the
   changes in travel time. Asymmetric responses are shown for travel time
   increases and decreases. People become more conservative with time
   expenditures when scheduling activities subject to increased travel
   times. However, beyond a certain limit of travel time increase,
   scheduling behaviour becomes more unpredictable. The lessons learned
   from this investigation have implications in the application of
   activity-based models for forecasting and policy analyses. Models
   developed using only a revealed preference dataset should not be used to
   extrapolate to situations where travel times changes by large margins.
   The results also prove that significant improvements in capturing
   behavioural responses in the activity scheduling process are possible by
   pooling revealed preference and stated preference data sets and jointly
   modelling with an explicit representation of RP scale/variance
   differences. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tumor hypoxia is increasingly being recognized as a characteristic
   feature of solid tumors and significantly complicates many treatments
   based on radio-, chemo-, and phototherapies. While photodynamic therapy
   (PDT) Is based on photosensitizer interactions with diffused oxygen,
   photothermal therapy (PTT) has emerged as a new phototherapy that is
   predicted to be independent of oxygen levels within tumors. It has been
   challenging to meaningfully compare these two modalities due to
   differences in contrast agents and irradiation parameters, and no
   comparative In vivo studies have been performed until now. Here, by
   making use of recently developed nanostructured self-quenched porphysome
   nanoparticles, we were able to directly compare PDT and PTT using
   matched light doses and matched porphyrin photosensitizer doses (with
   the photosensitizer being effective for either PTT or PDT based on the
   existence of nanostructure or not). Therefore, we demonstrated the
   nanostructure-driven conversion from the PDT singlet oxygen generating
   mechanism of porphyrin to a completely thermal mechanism, ideal for PTT
   enhancement. Using a novel hypoxia tumor model, we determined that
   nanostructured porphyrin PTT enhancers are advantageous to overcome
   hypoxic conditions to achieve effective ablation of solid tumors.}},

Abstract = {{A series of two component phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes
   (PHOLEDs) combing the direct hole injection into dopant strategy with a
   gradient doping profile were demonstrated. The dopant, host, as well as
   molybdenum oxide (MoO3)-modified indium tin oxide (ITO) anode were
   investigated. It is found that the devices ITO/MoO3 (0 or 1
   nm)/fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium
   {[}Ir(ppy)(3)]:1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazole-2-yl)benzene (TPBi) (30
   -> 0 wt\%, 105 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) show maximum external quantum
   efficiency (EQE) over 20\%, which are comparable to multi-layered
   PHOLEDs. Moreover, the systematic variation of the host from TPBi to
   4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Bphen), dopant from Ir(ppy)(3) to
   bis(2-phenylpyridine)(acetylacetonate)iridium {[}Ir(ppy)(2)(acac)], and

   the design of highly efficient two component PHOLEDs. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A social robot should be able to autonomously interpret human affect and
   adapt its behavior accordingly in order for successful social humanrobot
   interaction to take place. This paper presents a modular non-contact
   automated affect-estimation system that employs support vector
   regression over a set of novel facial expression parameters to estimate
   a person's affective states using a valence-arousal two-dimensional
   model of affect. The proposed system captures complex and ambiguous
   emotions that are prevalent in real-world scenarios by utilizing a
   continuous two-dimensional model, rather than a traditional discrete
   categorical model for affect. As the goal is to incorporate this
   recognition system in robots, real-time estimation of spontaneous
   natural facial expressions in response to environmental and interactive
   stimuli is an objective. The proposed system can be combined with affect
   detection techniques using other modes, such as speech, body language
   and/or physiological signals, etc., in order to develop an accurate
   multi-modal affect estimation system for social HRI applications.
   Experiments presented herein demonstrate the system's ability to
   successfully estimate the affect of a diverse group of unknown
   individuals exhibiting spontaneous natural facial expressions.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. We investigated differences in handwriting kinetics, speed,
   and legibility among four pencil grasps after a 10-min copy task.
   METHOD. Seventy-four Grade 4 students completed a handwriting assessment
   before and after a copy task. Grip and axial forces were measured with
   an instrumented stylus and force-sensitive tablet. We used multiple
   linear regression to analyze the relationship between grasp pattern and
   grip and axial forces.
   RESULTS. We found no kinetic differences among grasps, whether
   considered individually or grouped by the number of fingers on the
   barrel. However, when grasps were grouped according to the thumb
   position, the adducted grasps exhibited higher mean grip and axial
   forces.
   CONCLUSION. Grip forces were generally similar across the different
   grasps. Kinetic differences resulting from thumb position seemed to have
   no bearing on speed and legibility. Interventions for handwriting
   difficulties should focus more on speed and letter formation than on
   grasp pattern.

Abstract = {{Tracheal respiratory sound analysis is a simple and non-invasive way to
   study the pathophysiology of the upper airway and has recently been used
   for acoustic estimation of respiratory flow and sleep apnea diagnosis.
   However in none of the previous studies was the respiratory flow-sound
   relationship studied in people with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), nor
   during sleep. In this study, we recorded tracheal sound, respiratory
   flow, and head position from eight non-OSA and 10 OSA individuals during
   sleep and wakefulness. We compared the flow-sound relationship and
   variations in model parameters from wakefulness to sleep within and
   between the two groups. The results show that during both wakefulness
   and sleep, flow-sound relationship follows a power law but with
   different parameters. Furthermore, the variations in model parameters
   may be representative of the OSA pathology. The other objective of this
   study was to examine the accuracy of respiratory flow estimation
   algorithms during sleep: we investigated two approaches for calibrating
   the model parameters using the known data recorded during either
   wakefulness or sleep. The results show that the acoustical respiratory
   flow estimation parameters change from wakefulness to sleep. Therefore,
   if the model is calibrated using wakefulness data, although the
   estimated respiratory flow follows the relative variations of the real
   flow, the quantitative flow estimation error would be high during sleep.
   On the other hand, when the calibration parameters are extracted from
   tracheal sound and respiratory flow recordings during sleep, the
   respiratory flow estimation error is less than 10\%.}},

Abstract = {{The coating deposited by plasma spraying with liquid precursors has
   nano- and submicron-metric features. Its microstructure highly depends
   on the injection history of the solution droplets. To increase the
   understanding of the formation mechanism of the deposits, a 3D model is

   heating of the solution spray in a plasma jet. The temperature and size
   distributions of the particles upon impacting on the substrate are
   predicted. Individual deposits of precursor droplets or synthesized
   particles impacting on the substrate are collected experimentally. The
   deposits are classified into five types based on the computed
   temperature distribution and experimental observations: (1) melted or
   half-melted particles; (2) small sintered particles; (3) dry
   agglomerates; (4) wet agglomerates; and (5) wet droplets. The forming

Title = {{Development of a new control strategy for 3D MRI-controlled interstitial
   ultrasound cancer therapy}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: MRI-controlled interstitial ultrasound therapy is being
   developed as a minimally invasive, image-guided treatment for localized
   cancers. The method uses an interstitial multielement ultrasound
   applicator to deliver high-intensity ultrasound energy to tissue in
   order to achieve thermal coagulation in a target volume.
   Methods: A new temperature feedback control algorithm incorporating a
   proportional-integral controller is introduced to tackle a
   multiple-input single-output control problem arising in MRI-controlled
   interstitial ultrasound cancer therapy. The inputs to the controller
   block are the frequency, rotation rate, and applied power of an
   interstitial applicator and the output is the boundary temperature
   during treatment. Multiplanar magnetic resonance (MR) thermometry is
   acquired continuously during heating and used in the feedback control
   algorithm to achieve spatial control over treatment.
   Results: The method has been evaluated for prostate cancer treatment as
   an initial clinical application. Spatial treatment accuracy of a few
   millimeters is demonstrated in both simulations and experiments with the
   new controller. The spatial treatment accuracy of the new algorithm is
   shown to be equivalent or slightly improved over the existing approach
   implemented for this technology; however, the implementation of the new
   algorithm is much simpler, and does not involve time-intensive tuning of
   gain constants.
   Conclusions: The study demonstrates the potential advantages of a new
   automatic temperature control system adapted to image guided
   interstitial ultrasound therapy. (C) 2013 American Association of

   mechanical behaviour. The inhibited ability to accommodate imposed
   strain with conventional dislocation mechanism has led to the activation
   of unconventional deformation mechanisms. For one, grain coarsening at
   shear bands has been observed to occur within metals with sub-micron
   grain size upon cyclic deformation. Such grain coarsening is often
   linked to the observed cyclic softening behaviour. The purpose of this
   study was to investigate the relationship between strain localisation
   associated with shear banding and the observed deformation-induced grain
   coarsening in ultra-fine grained metals. The investigation was carried
   out using ultra-fine grained, oxygen-free high conductivity copper
   processed by accumulative roll-bonding. A close relationship between
   strain localisation and deformation-induced grain coarsening was
   revealed. As strain localisation is not only found at shear bands, but
   also at other places whereby heterogeneous microstructure or geometric
   discontinuity is present, hence the present study bears a general
   significance. Such strain localisation sites may also include a hard
   constituent embedded in a relatively ductile matrix, micro-crack tips
   and artificial notches. The stress concentration at these sites provides
   a high input of strain energy for grain boundary motion leading to grain
   coarsening. Furthermore, when the grain size is very small, the stress
   gradient leading away from the stress concentration sites is also
   believed to increase the driving force for grain boundary migration
   within the affected regions.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of periodic excitation from synthetic jet actuators on
   boundary-layer separation and reattachment over a NACA 0025 airfoil at a
   low Reynolds number is studied. Flow-visualization results showed a
   vertical jet pulse accompanied by two counter-rotating vortices being
   produced at the exit of the simulated slot, with the vortices shed at
   the excitation frequency. Hot-wire measurements determined the maximum
   jet velocity for a range of excitation frequencies and voltages, and
   were used to characterize the excitation amplitude in terms of the
   momentum coefficient C-mu. With the synthetic jet actuator installed in
   the airfoil, flow-visualization results showed that excitation produces
   boundary-layer reattachment, with the associated significant reduction
   in wake width. Wake-velocity measurements were performed to characterize
   the effect of flow-control excitation amplitude and frequency on airfoil
   drag and wake topology. The results demonstrate that C-mu is the primary
   governing flow-control parameter. Applying excitation above a specific
   C-mu threshold produced a 50\% reduction in drag, significantly
   affecting wake topology. However, power consumption of a piezoelectric
   synthetic jet actuator depends substantially on the excitation
   frequency. Hence, by varying excitation frequency, significant gains in
   efficiency are possible.}},

Abstract = {{Several recent reports have demonstrated how engineered proteins can
   control cell motility, an important functional module for ultimately
   programming cells as therapeutics. We have reported two engineered
   proteins that regulate the blebbing cell morphology using chimeras of
   RhoA, a protein that regulates cytoskeletal tension. Here, we show that
   engineered switching of blebbing can be used to regulate cell motility.
   First, the analysis of morphology and motility characteristics showed
   that blebbing cells wobbled, or shifted, faster and less linearly than
   cells with a wild type morphology. Second, activating engineered protein
   switches that regulate cell morphology led to predictable changes in
   motility characteristics. Last, exogenous stimuli such as blue light,
   acetylcholine and VEGF-A were used to show that groups of proteins could
   cooperatively increase cell motility in vitro. This work demonstrates
   that control of RhoA can program the motility patterns of living cells
   and has implications in studying the relationship between cell
   morphology and motility. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic spectrum access by non-licensed users has emerged as a promising
   solution to address the bandwidth scarcity challenge. In a secondary
   spectrum market, primary users lease chunks of unused spectrum to
   secondary users. Auctions perform as one of the natural mechanisms for
   allocating the spectrum, generating an economic incentive for the
   licensed user to relinquish channels. Existing spectrum auction designs,
   while taking externality introduced by interference into account, fail
   to consider the potential mobility of secondary users, which leads to
   another dimension of externality: mobile communication motivates a
   secondary user to exclusively occupy a channel, i.e., forbidding channel
   reuse in its mobility region. In this work, we design two expressive
   auctions for mobility support, by introducing two-dimensional bids that
   reflect a secondary user's willingness to pay for exclusive and
   non-exclusive channel usage, for the single-channel and multiple-channel
   scenarios, respectively. In the outcome of our 2D auctions, a channel is
   either monopolized or simultaneously reused without interference,
   whereas a secondary user can be mobile or is regulated to be static. We
   prove the existence of desirable equilibria in both auctions, where 1/10
   and c/7(1+c) of optimal social welfare are guaranteed to be recoverable,
   respectively (c is the number of channels).}},

Abstract = {{Fish are an excellent source of lean protein and omega-3 polyunsaturated
   fatty acids (PUFAs) but there is inadequate information on the levels of
   PUFAs in freshwater fish and specifically Great Lakes fish. Knowledge of
   PUFAs is necessary to make informed decisions regarding the balance
   between the benefits of fish consumption due to these factors versus
   risks of adverse health effects associated with elevated levels of
   contaminants known to be present in some Great Lakes fish and linked to
   increased risk of cancer and adverse neurological effects to both
   infants and adults. Our goal was to determine the lipid profiles in two
   species of Great Lakes fish, lake trout and whitefish. Total fat and the
   percentage of total and omega-3 PUFAs were with one exception
   significantly higher in lake trout than whitefish. Average
   concentrations of EPA + DHA were 11.2 and 9.7 g/100 g lipid in lake
   trout and whitefish, respectively. The concentrations of EPA + DHA in
   fatty marine fish (22.7, 23.9 and 30.2 g/100 g lipid, respectively) are
   about double those found in Great Lakes lake trout and whitefish.
   Nevertheless a 100 g serving of Great Lakes lake trout provides more
   than 500 mg of EPA + DHA, which is the daily intake level recommended by
   the American Dietetics Association for the prevention of coronary heart
   disease. (c) 2013 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

   The symmetry-and antisymmetry-breakings can be caused by increasing the
   applied voltage onto the waveguide in the self-focusing and -defocusing
   cases, respectively. In the self-focusing case, the type of SBB can be
   switched from supercritical to subcritical. While in the self-defocusing

Abstract = {{Suspension plasma-sprayed YSZ coatings were deposited at lab-scale and
   production-type facilities to investigate the effect of process
   equipment on coating properties. The target application for these
   coatings is solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrolytes; hence, dense

   facilities had the same torch but different suspension feeding systems,
   torch robots, and substrate holders. The lab-scale facility had higher
   torch-substrate relative speeds compared with the production-type
   facility. On porous stainless steel substrates, permeabilities and
   microstructures were comparable for coatings from both facilities, and
   no segmentation cracks were observed. Coating permeability was further
   reduced by increasing substrate temperatures during deposition or
   reducing suspension feed rates. On SOFC cathode substrates, coatings
   made in the production-type facility had higher permeabilities and more
   segmentation cracks compared with coatings made in the lab-scale
   facility. Increased cracking in coatings from the production-type
   facility was likely caused mainly by its lower torch-substrate relative

Abstract = {{Antibacterial surfaces such as silver and copper coated areas reduce
   risk of bacterial growth considerably. In this study, wire arc spraying
   has been utilized to produce an antibacterial copper coating with
   ultrafine microstructure on stainless steel substrate. The chemical
   composition, microstructure, and surface morphology of copper coatings
   were characterized with x-ray diffraction and scanning electron
   microscope. Determination of thickness and adhesion of the coating were
   investigated. The antibacterial property of copper coatings was analyzed
   by both gram negative Escherichia coli NCTC 10418 and gram positive
   Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 11047. The antibacterial performance of
   coatings was compared to that of stainless steel 316 and a micrograin
   structure of the commercially available copper. Results indicated that
   the as-sprayed copper coatings have excellent antibacterial behavior
   compared to stainless steel and micrograin copper, which can be
   attributed to the presence of the ultrafine grain size, micropores, and
   crystallographic defects in the microstructure.}},

Abstract = {{Finite element (FE) studies are undertaken to investigate the accuracy

   The FE analysis results indicate that although current constitutive
   models are able to simulate the behavior of conventionally reinforced
   concrete panels accurately, the models overestimate the strength and
   deformation capacity of SFRC elements. Three factors are found to
   significantly influence the calculation accuracy: the tension

Abstract = {{This paper presents a class of recurrent neural networks to solve
   quadratic programming problems. Different from most existing recurrent
   neural networks for solving quadratic programming problems, the proposed

   function is not required to be a hard-limiting function for finite
   convergence time. The stability, finite-time convergence property and
   the optimality of the proposed neural network for solving the original
   quadratic programming problem are proven in theory. Extensive
   simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of the neural
   network with different parameters. In addition, the proposed neural
   network is applied to solving the k-winner-take-all (k-WTA) problem.
   Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations validate the
   effectiveness of our method for solving the k-WTA problem. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a potential alternative cell
   source in regenerative medicine, which includes the use of
   differentiated iPSCs for cell therapies to treat coronary artery and/or
   peripheral arterial diseases. Late-outgrowth endothelial progenitor
   cells (late-EPCs) are a unique primary cell present in peripheral blood
   that exhibit high proliferative capacity, are being used in a wide
   variety of clinical trials, and have the ability to differentiate into
   mature endothelial cells. The objective of this study was to reprogram
   peripheral blood-derived late-EPCs to a pluripotent state under
   feeder-free and defined culture conditions. Late-EPCs that were
   retrovirally transduced with OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC, and iPSC colonies
   were derived in feeder-free and defined media conditions. EPC-iPSCs
   expressed pluripotent markers, were capable of differentiating to cells
   from all three germ-layers, and retained a normal karyotype.
   Transcriptome analyses demonstrated that EPC-iPSCs exhibit a global gene
   expression profile similar to human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We
   have generated iPSCs from late-EPCs under feeder-free conditions. Thus,
   peripheral blood-derived late-outgrowth EPCs represent an alternative
   cell source for generating iPSCs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Aspiration (the entry of foreign contents into the upper airway) is a
   serious concern for individuals with dysphagia and can lead to
   pneumonia. However, overt signs of aspiration, such as cough, are not
   always present, making noninstrumental diagnosis challenging. Valid,
   reliable tools for detecting aspiration during clinical screening and
   assessment are needed. In this study we investigated the validity of a
   noninvasive accelerometry signal-processing classifier for detecting
   aspiration. Dual-axis cervical accelerometry signals were collected from
   40 adults on thin-liquid swallowing tasks during videofluoroscopic
   swallowing examinations. Signal-processing algorithms were used to
   remove known sources of artifact and a classifier was trained to
   identify signals associated with penetration-aspiration. Validity was
   measured in comparison to blinded ratings of penetration-aspiration from
   the concurrently recorded videofluoroscopies. On a bolus-by-bolus basis,
   the accelerometry classifier had a 10 \% false-negative rate (90 \%
   sensitivity) and a 23 \% false-positive rate (77 \% specificity) for
   detecting penetration-aspiration. We conclude that accelerometry can be
   used to support valid, reliable, and efficient detection of aspiration
   risk in patients with suspected dysphagia.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes an experimental investigation of bubble dynamics and
   the effect on flow boiling instabilities and heat transfer in a
   multiple-microchannel heat sink. In this paper, results of the
   experimental investigation of bubble dynamics are presented and
   discussed. The microchannel heat sink contained 40 parallel, rectangular
   channels having hydraulic diameter of 194 mu m, and an aspect ratio of
   0.549. The experiments were conducted with deionised water over a mass
   flux range from 71 to 204 kg/m(2) s, and an inlet temperature of 71
   degrees C. Bubble growth rate and departure diameter under sub-cooled
   and saturated flow boiling are studied using a microscope and a high
   speed camera. The effects of mass flux and heat flux on bubbles growth
   characteristics are investigated and discussed. The results of this
   study demonstrate that the bubble growth rate in microchannels is
   different from that in macroscale channels. Confinement of microchannel
   and interaction between channels result in the unique bubble dynamic in
   microchannels. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Inteins are protein elements that covalently reassemble proteins from
   two precursor fragments in a process known as protein splicing. They are
   commonly used to reassemble a single target protein by protein splicing,
   but a second target protein can potentially reassemble by intein
   dimerization. Here, we use the naturally occurring split DnaE intein
   from Nostoc punctiforme (NpuDnaE) to demonstrate the simultaneous
   assembly of two target proteins in several examples studied with live
   cell imaging: yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) with monomeric red
   fluorescent protein (mRFP), dominant positive mutant of RhoA GTPase with
   YFP and GCaMP2 Ca-2 indicator with mRFP. These examples showed the
   versatility of the strategy along with some interesting attributes:
   first, the two target proteins are in equal stoichiometry; second, the
   extent of protein splicing can be reported by a fluorescent protein. In
   particular, the split GCaMP2 with mRFP could find applications in
   tissue-specific Ca-2 imaging in transgenic organisms, where mRFP could
   control for motion-related intensity changes.}},

Abstract = {{Robust ex vivo expansion of umbilical cord blood (UCB) derived
   hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) should enable the
   widespread use of UCB as a source of cells to treat hematologic and
   immune diseases. Novel approaches for HSPC expansion have recently been
   developed, setting the stage for the production of blood stem cell
   derived products that fulfill our current best known criteria of
   clinical relevance. Translating these technologies into clinical use
   requires bioengineering strategies to overcome challenges of scale-up,
   reproducibility, and product quality assurance. Clinical-scale
   implementation should also define criteria and targets for
   cost-effective cell manufacturing. As production strategies become more
   effective, new opportunities in the therapeutic use of ex vivo expanded
   hematopoietic cell products will emerge. Herein we examine key
   technological milestones that need to be met in order to move ex vivo

   polymer matrix composites}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{It is generally known that load transfer from the polymer matrix to
   carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be greatly hindered due to the pristine CNT
   surface condition. This imperfect condition can have a profound
   influence on the effectiveness of CNT reinforcement. In order to address
   this issue in the context of viscoelastic response, an effective medium
   theory is first presented, and then applied to study the effect of
   interfacial sliding on the time-dependent creep, stress relaxation,
   strain-rate sensitivity, and storage and loss moduli of a multi-walled
   CNT/polypropylene nanocomposite. We show that, without accounting for
   the imperfect load transfer at the interface, the predicted creep
   compliances are too stiff, but with the introduction of a weakened
   interface, the measured creep curves at various CNT loading can be well
   captured. Both stress relaxation and stress-strain relations are also
   found to greatly depend on the interface condition. Under low-frequency
   harmonic loading our calculations also reveal that the interface
   condition is further weakened and that a larger interface sliding
   parameter is required to reflect the measured storage and tangent
   moduli. We conclude that the viscoelastic characteristics of a CNT
   nanocomposite are very sensitive to the interface condition, and that
   continued improvement in surface functionalization is necessary to
   realize the full potential of CNT reinforcement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A plane piston transducer can be focused by a continuous variation of
   the excitation signal phase (or time delay) over the transducer surface.
   Prior analyses of this scheme used the Fresnel approximation, thereby
   limiting the validity. Using the angular spectrum method, an accurate
   radiation model of such a transducer has been developed that includes
   amplitude and phase apodization. The derivation includes the effects of
   diffraction and evanescent waves without using the Fresnel
   approximation. Moreover, this model develops insights into radiated
   field characteristics, including: (a) the spatial frequency bandwidth is
   constant over axial depth, suggesting that spatial resolution can be
   improved away from the focus; (b) the phase of the angular spectrum
   determines the spatial resolution for a given transducer configuration-a
   constant phase is optimal on any observation plane; (c) focusing can
   significantly increase the spatial frequency bandwidth; (d) the velocity
   potential on a plane parallel to the transducer is the Hankel
   convolution of the transducer surface velocity with the Green's
   function; and (e) evanescent waves decay both with increasing spatial
   frequency and axial depth. The analytical model and associated insights
   enhance understanding of the radiated field characteristics, which can
   be of value in the development of signal processing techniques for image
   enhancement. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Nonlinear disturbance observer design for robotic manipulators}},
Journal = {{CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{253-267}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Robotic manipulators are highly nonlinear and coupled systems that are
   subject to different types of disturbances such as joint frictions,
   unknown payloads, varying contact points, and unmodeled dynamics. These
   disturbances, when unaccounted for, adversely affect the performance of
   the manipulator. Employing a disturbance observer is a common method to
   reject such disturbances. In addition to disturbance rejection,
   disturbance observers can be used in force control applications.
   Recently, research has been done regarding the design of nonlinear
   disturbance observers (NLDOs) for robotic manipulators. In spite of good
   results in terms of disturbance tracking, the previously designed
   nonlinear disturbance observers can merely be used for planar serial
   manipulators with revolute joints {[}Chen, W. H., Ballance, D. J.,
   Gawthorp, P. J., O'Reilly, J. (2000). A nonlinear disturbance observer
   for robotic manipulators. IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,
   47 (August (4)), 932-938; Nikoobin, A., Haghighi, R. (2009).
   Lyapunov-based nonlinear disturbance observer for serial n-link
   manipulators. Journal of Intelligent \& Robotic Systems, 55 (July
   (2-3)), 135-153]. In this paper, a general systematic approach is
   proposed to solve the disturbance observer design problem for robotic
   manipulators without restrictions on the number of degrees-of-freedom
   (DOFs), the types of joints, or the manipulator configuration. Moreover,
   this design method does not need the exact dynamic model of the serial
   robotic manipulator. This method also unifies the previously proposed
   linear and nonlinear disturbance observers in a general framework.
   Simulations are presented for a 4-DOF SCARA manipulator to show the
   effectiveness of the proposed disturbance observer design method.
   Experimental results using a PHANToM Omni haptic device further
   illustrate the effectiveness of the design method. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{As the number of cores integrated on a single chip continues to
   increase, communication has the potential to become a severe bottleneck
   to overall system performance. The presence of thread sharing and the
   distribution of data across cache banks on the chip can result in
   longdistance communication. Long-distance communication incurs
   substantial latency that impacts performance; furthermore, this
   communication consumes significant dynamic power when packets are
   switched over many Network-on-Chip (NoC) links and routers. Thread
   migration can mitigate problems created by long distance communication.
   This article presents Moths, an efficient runtime algorithm that
   responds automatically to dynamic NoC traffic patterns, providing
   beneficial thread migration to decrease overall traffic volume and
   average packet latency. Moths reduces on-chip network latency by up to
   28.4\% (18.0\% on average) and traffic volume by up to 24.9\% (20.6\% on
   average) across a variety of commercial and scientific benchmarks.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To design an innovative interactive media display in a
   pediatric hospital clinic waiting space that addresses the growing
   demand for accessible, contact-surface-free options for play.
   BACKGROUND: In healthcare settings, waiting can be anxiety provoking for
   children and their accompanying family members. Opportunities for
   positive distraction have been shown to reduce waiting anxiety, leading
   to positive health outcomes.
   METHODS: An interactive media display, ScreenPlay, was created and
   evaluated using a participatory design approach and a combination of
   techniques including quality function deployment and mixed data
   elicitation methods (questionnaires, focus groups, and observations).
   The user and organizational design requirements were established and
   used to review contemporary strategies for positive distraction in
   healthcare waiting spaces and to conceptualize and test ScreenPlay. Ten
   staff members, 11 children/youths, and 6 parents participated in the
   design and evaluation of ScreenPlay.
   RESULTS: ScreenPlay provided a positive, engaging experience without the
   use of contact surfaces through which infections can be spread. It was
   accessible to children, youth, and adults of all motor abilities. All
   participants strongly agreed that the interactive media display would
   improve the healthcare waiting experience.
   CONCLUSIONS: ScreenPlay is an interactive display that is the result of
   a successful model for the design of healthcare waiting spaces that is
   collaborative, interdisciplinary, and responsive to the needs of its

Abstract = {{To address the high incidence of infusion errors, manufacturers have
   replaced the development of standard infusion pumps with smart pump
   systems. The implementation and ongoing optimization processes for smart
   pumps are more complex, as they require larger coordinated efforts with
   stakeholders throughout the medication process. If improper
   implementation/optimization processes are followed, hospitals invest in
   this technology while extracting minimal benefit. We assessed the
   processes hospitals employed when migrating from standard to smart
   infusion systems, and the extent to which they leveraged their
   investments from both a systems and resource perspective. Twenty-nine
   hospitals in Ontario, Canada, were surveyed that had either implemented
   smart pump systems or were in the process of implementing, representing
   a response rate of 69\%. Results demonstrated that hospitals purchased
   smart pumps for reasons other than safety, did not involve a
   multidisciplinary team during implementation, made little effort to
   standardize drug concentrations or develop drug libraries and dosing
   limits, seldom monitored how nurses use the pumps, and failed to ensure
   wireless connectivity to upgrade protocols and download use data.
   Consequently, they are failing to realize the safety benefits these
   systems can provide.}},

Abstract = {{Originally developed in the context of publicly traded for-profit
   companies, theory of constraints (TOC) improves system performance
   through leveraging the constraint(s). While the theory seems to be a
   natural fit for resource-constrained publicly funded health systems,
   there is a lack of literature addressing the modifications required to
   adopt TOC and define the goal and performance measures. This paper
   develops a system dynamics representation of the classical TOC's
   system-wide goal and performance measures for publicly traded for-profit
   companies, which forms the basis for developing a similar model for
   publicly funded health systems. The model is then expanded to include
   some of the factors that affect system performance, providing a
   framework to apply TOC's process of ongoing improvement in publicly
   funded health systems. Future research is required to more accurately
   define the factors affecting system performance and populate the model
   with evidence-based estimates for various parameters in order to use the
   model to guide TOC's process of ongoing improvement.}},

Abstract = {{In many applications, the traffic traversing the network has interpacket
   dependencies due to application-level encoding schemes. For some
   applications, e. g., multimedia streaming, dropping a single packet may
   render useless the delivery of a whole sequence. In such environments,
   the algorithm used to decide which packet to drop in case of buffer
   overflows must be carefully designed, to avoid goodput degradation. We
   present a model that captures such interpacket dependencies, and design
   algorithms for performing packet discard. Traffic consists of an
   aggregation of multiple streams, each of which consists of a sequence of
   interdependent packets. We provide two guidelines for designing buffer
   management algorithms, and demonstrate their effectiveness. We devise an
   algorithm according to these guidelines and evaluate its performance
   analytically, using competitive analysis. We also perform a simulation
   study that shows that the performance of our algorithm is within a small
   fraction of the performance of the best known offline algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The generalized modulation strategy of the conventional matrix converter
   (MC), i.e., three-leg MC, was previously developed using the duty-cycle
   space vector (DCSV) representation of switch duty cycles. This paper
   uses the DCSV representation of switch duty cycles to develop a new
   formulation of the generalized modulation strategy for one-, three-, and
   four-leg MCs. The four-leg MC, unlike the three-leg MC, is capable of
   providing a neutral connection at the output side of the MC. The neutral
   connection enables the four-leg MC to operate as a power supply
   providing a balanced, regulated, and fixed-frequency voltage for
   balanced and unbalanced loads, including the single-phase load. The
   generalized modulation strategy of the four-leg MC in this paper is
   developed in the context of power supply applications. Using the new
   formulation of the generalized modulation strategy, the direct
   duty-cycle modulation strategies based on DCSV calculation are developed
   for one-, three-, and four-leg MCs, which are referred to as the
   DCSV-based modulation strategy of the MC. Part I of the paper formulates

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: non-invasive measurements of brain activity have an
   important role to play in understanding driving ability. The current
   study aimed to identify the neural underpinnings of human driving
   behavior by visualizing the areas of the brain involved in driving under
   different levels of demand, such as driving while distracted or making
   left turns at busy intersections.
   Materials and Methods: To capture brain activity during driving, we
   placed a driving simulator with a fully functional steering wheel and
   pedals in a 3.0 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   system. To identify the brain areas involved while performing different
   real-world driving maneuvers, participants completed tasks ranging from
   simple (right turns) to more complex (left turns at busy intersections).
   To assess the effects of driving while distracted, participants were
   asked to perform an auditory task while driving analogous to speaking on
   a hands-free device and driving.
   Results: A widely distributed brain a network was identified, especially
   when making left turns at busy intersections compared to more simple
   driving tasks. During distracted driving, brain activation shifted
   dramatically from the posterior, visual and spatial areas to the
   prefrontal cortex.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the distracted brain sacrificed
   areas in the posterior brain important for visual attention and
   alertness to recruit enough brain resources to perform a secondary,
   cognitive task. The present findings offer important new insights into
   the scientific understanding of the neuro-cognitive mechanisms of
   driving behavior and lay down an important foundation for future
   clinical research.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Previous trials suggesting that high-frequency oscillatory ventilation
   (HFOV) reduced mortality among adults with the acute respiratory
   distress syndrome (ARDS) were limited by the use of outdated comparator
   ventilation strategies and small sample sizes.
   Methods
   In a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial conducted at 39 intensive
   care units in five countries, we randomly assigned adults with
   new-onset, moderate-to-severe ARDS to HFOV targeting lung recruitment or
   to a control ventilation strategy targeting lung recruitment with the
   use of low tidal volumes and high positive end-expiratory pressure. The
   primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital death from any cause.
   Results
   On the recommendation of the data monitoring committee, we stopped the
   trial after 548 of a planned 1200 patients had undergone randomization.
   The two study groups were well matched at baseline. The HFOV group
   underwent HFOV for a median of 3 days (interquartile range, 2 to 8); in
   addition, 34 of 273 patients (12\%) in the control group received HFOV
   for refractory hypoxemia. In-hospital mortality was 47\% in the HFOV
   group, as compared with 35\% in the control group (relative risk of
   death with HFOV, 1.33; 95\% confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.64; P =
   0.005). This finding was independent of baseline abnormalities in
   oxygenation or respiratory compliance. Patients in the HFOV group
   received higher doses of midazolam than did patients in the control
   group (199 mg per day {[}interquartile range, 100 to 382] vs. 141 mg per
   day {[}interquartile range, 68 to 240], P<0.001), and more patients in
   the HFOV group than in the control group received neuromuscular blockers
   (83\% vs. 68\%, P<0.001). In addition, more patients in the HFOV group
   received vasoactive drugs (91\% vs. 84\%, P = 0.01) and received them
   for a longer period than did patients in the control group (5 days vs. 3
   days, P = 0.01).
   Conclusions
   In adults with moderate-to-severe ARDS, early application of HFOV, as

Abstract = {{A systematic study of electronic structure and band gap states is
   conducted to analyze the monodoping and charge compensated codoping of
   rutile TiO2 with Rh and Nb, using the DFT + U approach. Doping of rutile
   TiO2 with Rh atoms induces hybridized O 2p and Rh 4d band gap states
   leading to a red shift of the optical absorption edge, consistent with
   previous experimental studies. Since Rh monodoping may induce
   recombination centers, charge compensated codoping with Rh and Nb is
   also explored. This codoping induces an electron transfer from Nb
   induced states to Rh 4d states, which suppresses the formation of Rh4+,
   thereby leading to a reduction in recombination centers and to the
   formation of more stable Rh3+. A combination of band gap reduction by
   0.5 eV and the elimination of band gap states that account for
   recombination centers makes (Rh, Nb)-codoped TiO2 a more efficient and
   stable photocatalyst.}},

   control mode size against an asymmetric refractive index profile. By
   extending this Bragg grating waveguide writing into bulk fused silica
   glass, strong coupling to a continuum of radiation-like modes
   facilitated a significant broadening to over hundreds of nanometers
   bandwidth that blended into the narrow Bragg resonance to form into a
   strongly isolating (43 dB) optical edge filter. This Bragg resonance
   defined exceptionally steep edge slopes of 136 dB/nm and 185 dB/nm for
   unpolarized and linearly polarized light, respectively, that were

Title = {{Parameter estimates for invasive breast cancer progression in the

Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER}},

Volume = {{108}},

Abstract = {{Background: The aim of screening is to detect a cancer in the
   preclinical state. However, a false-positive or a false-negative test
   result is a real possibility.
   Methods: We describe invasive breast cancer progression in the Canadian
   National Breast Screening Study and construct progression models with
   and without covariates. The effect of risk factors on transition
   intensities and false-negative probability is investigated. We estimate
   the transition rates, the sojourn time and sensitivity of diagnostic
   tests for women aged 40-19 and 50-59.
   Results: Although younger women have a slower transition rate from
   healthy state to preclinical, their screen-detected tumour becomes
   evident sooner. Women aged 50-59 have a higher mortality rate compared
   with younger women. The mean sojourn times for women aged 40-49 and
   50-59 are 2.5 years (95\% CI: 1.7, 3.8) and 3.0 years (95\% CI: 2.1,
   4.3), respectively. Sensitivity of diagnostic procedures for older women
   is estimated to be 0.75 (95\% CI: 0.55, 0.88), while women aged 40-19
   have a lower sensitivity (0.61, 95\% CI: 0.42, 0.77). Age is the only
   factor that affects the false-negative probability. For women aged
   40-19, `age at entry', `history of breast disease' and `families with
   breast cancer' are found to be significant for some of the transition
   rates. For the age-group 50-59, `age at entry', `history of breast
   disease', `menstruation length' and `number of live births' are found to
   affect the transition rates.
   Conclusion: Modelling and estimating the parameters of cancer
   progression are essential steps towards evaluating the effectiveness of
   screening policies. The parameters include the transition rates, the
   preclinical sojourn time, the sensitivity, and the effect of different
   risk factors on cancer progression.}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1887-1895}},

Abstract = {{Land use regression (LUR), a geographic information system (GIS), and
   measured air concentrations were used to identify potential sources of
   semivolatile organic contaminants (SVOCs) within an urban/suburban
   region, using Toronto, Canada as a case study. Regression results
   suggested that air concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs), and polycyclic musks (PCMs) were correlated with sources at a
   scale of <5 km. LUR was able to explain 73-90\% of the variability in
   PCBs and PCMs, and 36-89\% of PBDE and PAH variability, suggesting that
   the latter have more spatially complex emission sources, particularly
   for the lowest and highest molecular weight compounds/congeners.
   LUR suggested that similar to 75\% of the PCB air concentration
   variability was related to the distribution of PCBs in
   use/storage/building sealants, similar to 60\% of PBDE variability was
   related to building volume, similar to 55\% of the PAH variability was
   related to the distribution of transportation infrastructure, and
   similar to 65\% of the PCM variability was related to population
   density. Parameters such as population density and household income were
   successfully used as surrogates to infer sources and air concentrations
   of SVOCs in Toronto. This is the first application of LUR methods to
   explain SVOC concentrations.}},

Journal = {{SURFACE \& COATINGS TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{216}},
Pages = {{289-296}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes with thicknesses of approximately 30
   mu m were deposited by suspension plasma spraying. The torch pass speed
   (the relative speed between torch and substrate) was adjusted to vary
   the amount of heat transferred from the plasma to the accumulating
   coating surface with each pass. With porous stainless steel substrates,
   no segmentation cracks were observed in electrolytes made with any spray
   conditions and torch pass speeds, and pass speed did not strongly affect
   electrolyte permeability. With substrates consisting of cathode or anode
   layers on porous steel supports, segmentation cracks were observed in
   most coatings, and the frequency of these cracks diminished with higher
   torch pass speeds. Electrolyte permeability with these substrates was
   also lower with higher pass speeds.
   To better understand the results, plasma-to-surface heat flux profiles
   were determined for a variety of spray conditions, and these data were
   used as boundary conditions to model coating and substrate temperatures
   during spraying. The model found that increasing the pass speed from 64
   to 380 cm s(-1) should reduce the peak temperature difference between
   the electrolyte surface and the steel support by 35 to 40\%. It is
   believed that a reduction in this temperature difference was the primary
   reason for the observed reduction in segmentation cracking with higher
   torch pass speeds. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A complex network approach is proposed for studying the shear behavior
   of a rough rock joint. Similarities between aperture profiles are
   established, and a functional complex network-in each shear
   displacement-is constructed in two directions: parallel and
   perpendicular to the shear direction. We find that the growth of the
   clustering coefficient and that of the number of edges are approximately
   scaled with the development of shear strength and hydraulic
   conductivity, which could possibly be utilized to estimate and formulate
   a friction law and the evolution of shear distribution over asperities.
   Moreover, the frictional interface is mapped in the global-local
   parameter space of the corresponding functional friction network,
   showing the evolution path and, eventually, the residual stage.
   Furthermore, we show that with respect to shear direction, parallel
   aperture patches are more adaptable to environmental stimuli than
   perpendicular profiles. We characterize the pure-contact profiles using
   the same approach. Unlike the first case, the later networks show a
   growing trend while in the residual stage; a saturation of links is
   encoded in contact networks. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{Tissue engineering has developed many paradigms and techniques on how to
   best integrate cells and extracellular matrix to create in vitro
   structures that replicate native tissue. The strategy best suited for
   building these constructs depends mainly on the target cells, tissues,
   and organ of interest, and how readily their respective niches can be
   recapitulated in vitro with available technologies. In this review we
   examine engineered heart tissue and two techniques that can be used to
   induce tissue morphogenesis in artificial niches in vitro: engineered
   surface topology and electrical control of the system. For both the
   differentiation of stem cells into heart cells and further assembly of
   these cells into engineered tissues, these two techniques are effective
   in inducing in vivo-like structure and function. Biophysical modulation
   through the control of topography and manipulation of the electrical
   microenvironment has been shown to have effects on cell growth and
   differentiation, expression of mature cardiac-related proteins and
   genes, cell alignment via cytoskeletal organization, and electrical and
   contractile properties. Lastly, we discuss the evolution and potential
   of these techniques, and bridges to regenerative therapies.}},

Abstract = {{A high-pressure differential scanning calorimeter chamber was used to
   investigate double crystal melting peak generation in polypropylene. The
   double crystal melting peak forms during the batch-based, expanded
   polypropylene (EPP) bead foaming process. This double peak structure is
   required for good sintering and the desired geometric shape of the final
   bead foam products. To form the double peak structure, isothermal
   treatment over a certain period of time is necessary at a high
   temperature and saturated pressure during the batch foaming process.
   This study investigated the influences of various saturation
   temperatures, time, and pressure on double crystal melting peak
   behavior. It was seen that the temperature was the most sensitive
   parameter on double peak generation. Also, the longer saturation time
   increased the amount of perfect crystals with a high melting
   temperature. Furthermore, as the saturation pressure increased, the
   required saturation temperature for generating the second peak with
   perfected crystals decreased through the plasticization effect of CO2.}},

Title = {{Understanding the Controlled Polymerization of Methyl Methacrylate with

   Nitroxide-Mediated Polymerization: The Pivotal Role of Reactivity Ratios}},

Abstract = {{Previously, nitroxide-mediated controlled copolymerization (NMP) of
   methyl methacrylate (MMA) using BlocBuilder unimolecular initiator was
   found to require much less controlling comonomer when using
   9-(4-vinylbenzyl)-9H-carbazole (VBK) compared to styrene (S) as a
   comonomer (minimum similar to 1 mol \% VBK versus 4.4 mol \% S). Here,
   we explored why this was the case. Initially, the use of
   dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent in the copolymerization of MMA/S was
   studied as the MMA/VBK copolymerizations were done in DMF. The results
   confirmed that the increased effectiveness of VBK as a controlling
   comonomer was not due to the solvent or other experimental conditions.
   Second, the propagation rate constant k(P,VBK) and various <
   k(P)>(MMA/VBK) for MMA/VBK copolymerizations were determined using
   pulsed laser polymerization-size exclusion chromatography (PLP-SEC), and
   the dissociation rate constants k(d,VBK) for the VBK-BlocBuilder adduct
   and PVBK chains were determined using electron paramagnetic resonance
   (EPR) spectroscopy, showing that k(d) for VBK was very similar to S and
   < k(P)>(MMA/VBK) was very similar to k(P,MMA). Finally, modeling of the
   system using PREDICI was done and illustrated that the difference in
   reactivity ratios between MMA/S and MMA/VBK was ultimately one of the
   major reasons for the increased control of VBK versus S. This study
   showed that propagation rate of the copolymerization and equilibrium
   constant for the dormant/active species are not the only parameters that
   govern controlled NMP, and the effect of reactivity ratios between the
   methacrylate and the controlling comonomer must also be considered for
   the controlled nitroxide-mediated copolymerization of methacrylate-rich
   mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{White organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs) are currently under
   intensive research and development worldwide as a new generation light
   source to replace problematic incandescent bulbs and fluorescent tubes.
   One of the major challenges facing WOLEDs has been to achieve high

   the technology competitive against other alternative technologies such
   as inorganic LEDs. Here, an all-phosphor, four-color WOLEDs is
   presented, employing a novel device design principle utilizing molecular
   energy transfer or, specifically, triplet exciton conversion within
   common organic layers in a cascaded emissive zone configuration to
   achieve exceptional performance: an 24.5\% external quantum efficiency
   (EQE) at 1000 cd/m2 with a color rendering index (CRI) of 81, and an EQE
   at 5000 cd/m2 of 20.4\% with a CRI of 85, using standard phosphors. The
   EQEs achieved are the highest reported to date among WOLEDs of single or
   multiple emitters possessing such high CRI, which represents a
   significant step towards the realization of WOLEDs in solid-state

Pages = {{155-164}},

Abstract = {{The ability of cities to extract useful work from energy imports is
   analyzed by considering all of the flows of energy within the city as an
   ecological network and by accounting for the role the second law of
   thermodynamics plays in open systems such as cities. We construct a new
   procedure for generating a variety of flow balanced random networks to
   test the role that the network structure has on the city's ability to
   constructively destroy exergy, the useful component of energy in a
   process. We consider two network types, Erdos-Renyi and scale-free
   networks, and illustrate how these types, and the various realizations
   of these types as defined by their control parameters, impact the
   quantity of exergy destroyed. Specifically we find that the Erdos-Renyi
   network is best equipped to destroy exergy, but that the scale-free
   network provides more certainty in this ability for networks that are
   sparsely connected. This trade-off between the exergy destruction and
   certainty is observed in a study of Toronto. Overall the findings
   suggest that the selection of network topology in the development of
   open systems is an important factor (among others) in the successful
   development of open systems, their sustainability, and their ability to
   achieve maximum work extraction from energy imports. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new fuzzy functions (FFs) model is presented and its

   For this purpose, a new hybrid clustering algorithm for model structure

   extended version of possibilistic c-mean (PCM) clustering with
   mahalonobise distance measure and a noise rejection method. In this
   research, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) is applied for
   selecting variables and approximating fuzzy functions in each cluster. A
   metaheuristic Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) is used to
   initialize the clustering parameters. The proposed FFs model is
   validated using two well-known standard artificial datasets and two real
   datasets, Tehran stock exchange and ozone level. It is shown that using
   the proposed FFs model can lead to promising results. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We analyze the performance of continuous-variable quantum key

Title = {{Dynamic strain scanning optimization: an efficient strain design
   strategy for balanced yield, titer, and productivity. DySScO strategy
   for strain design}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: In recent years, constraint-based metabolic models have
   emerged as an important tool for metabolic engineering; a number of
   computational algorithms have been developed for identifying metabolic
   engineering strategies where the production of the desired chemical is
   coupled with the growth of the organism. A caveat of the existing
   algorithms is that they do not take the bioprocess into consideration;
   as a result, while the product yield can be optimized using these
   algorithms, the product titer and productivity cannot be optimized. In
   order to address this issue, we developed the Dynamic Strain Scanning
   Optimization (DySScO) strategy, which integrates the Dynamic Flux
   Balance Analysis (dFBA) method with existing strain algorithms.
   Results: In order to demonstrate the effective of the DySScO strategy,
   we applied this strategy to the design of Escherichia coli strains
   targeted for succinate and 1,4-butanediol production respectively. We
   evaluated consequences of the tradeoff between growth yield and product
   yield with respect to titer and productivity, and showed that the DySScO
   strategy is capable of producing strains that balance the product yield,
   titer, and productivity. In addition, we evaluated the economic
   viability of the designed strain, and showed that the economic
   performance of a strain can be strongly affected by the price difference
   between the product and the feedstock.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the DySScO strategy is a useful
   computational tool for designing microbial strains with balanced yield,
   titer, and productivity, and has potential applications in evaluating
   the economic performance of the design strains.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an econometric modelling framework for a

   utility maximisation (RUM) approach for both discrete and continuous
   decisions and explicit correlation between the two choices. The
   continuous choice is modelled as RUM under budget limitation. The model
   is applied for joint mode choice and departure time choice modelling.
   The empirical application considers continuous time scale for departure
   time under daily 24h time budget constraint. The empirical model is
   estimated by using data collected in Toronto, Canada. The estimated
   parameters reveal many behavioural details of commuters' mode and
   departure time choices. The RUM-based discrete-continuous model with the
   incorporation of time budget constraints for the continuous part is a
   generic econometric model. This article considers modelling mode and
   departure time' choice bundle for empirical application of the model.
   However, the model can be applied for any other similar choice bundle
   situation, for example, in the case of activity-based travel demand and

   for both anode and cathode, and the performances of carbon-based porous
   electrodes including cloth, fiber, and foam were compared to that of
   traditional Toray carbon paper (TGP-H-120). The effects of catalyst
   loading were investigated in a microfluidic fuel cell containing 80

Abstract = {{Carbon sequestration in microporous geological formations is an emerging
   strategy for mitigating CO2 emissions from fossil fuel consumption.
   Injection of CO2 in carbonate reservoirs can change the porosity and
   permeability of the reservoir regions, along the CO2 plume migration
   path, due to CO2-brine-rock interactions. Carbon sequestration is
   effectively a microfluidic process over large scales, and can readily
   benefit from microfluidic tools and analysis methods. In this study, a
   micro-core method was developed to investigate the effect of CO2
   saturated brine and supercritical CO2 injection, under reservoir
   temperature and pressure conditions of 8.4 MPa and 40 degrees C, on the
   microstructure of limestone core samples. Specifically, carbonate
   dissolution results in pore structure, porosity, and permeability
   changes. These changes were measured by X-ray microtomography
   (micro-CT), liquid permeability measurements, and chemical analysis.
   Chemical composition of the produced liquid analyzed by inductively
   coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) shows
   concentrations of magnesium and calcium in the produced liquid. Chemical
   analysis results are consistent with the micro-CT imaging and
   permeability measurements which all show high dissolution for CO2
   saturated brine injection and very minor dissolution under supercritical
   CO2 injection. This work leverages established advantages of
   microfluidics in the new context of core-sample analysis, providing a
   simple core sealing method, small sample size, small volumes of
   injection fluids, fast characterization times, and pore scale
   resolution.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study was done to observe the formation of thin films by
   spraying liquid onto a solid surface and to determine the conditions
   under which the films would rupture or remain stable. Water, or water
   mixed with 20-70 \% by weight of glycerin, was sprayed for varying
   lengths of time onto a circular, 165-mm-diameter plate made of either
   Plexiglas, steel, or Parafilm-M and the motion of the liquid recorded
   using a high-speed camera. Water films ruptured immediately after the
   impact near the center of the surface. Then, if the film thickness was
   greater than a critical value, the water flooded back and the hole
   closed; otherwise, the hole remained in the water layer. The critical
   film thickness increases linearly with advancing liquid-solid contact
   angle. Increasing liquid viscosity by adding glycerin had little effect
   on critical film thickness, but inhibited spreading of the liquid and
   suppressed initial rupture of the liquid layer. A surface energy model
   was used to predict the variation of critical film thickness with
   surface wettability.}},

Abstract = {{We derive an analytical model for the depletion capacitance of
   silicon-on-insulator (SOI) optical modulation diodes. This model
   accurately describes the parasitic fringe capacitances due to a lateral
   pn junction and can be extended to other geometries, such as vertical
   and interdigitated junctions. The model is used to identify the
   waveguide slab to rib height ratio as a key geometric scaling parameter
   for the modulation efficiency and bandwidth for lateral diodes. The
   fringe capacitance is a parasitic effect that leads to a decrease of
   about 20\% in the modulation bandwidth of typical SOI diodes without a
   corresponding increase in the modulation efficiency. From the scaling
   relations, the most effective way to increase the modulation bandwidth
   is to reduce the series resistance of the diode.}},

Title = {{Virus and virus-sized microsphere transport in a dolomite rock fracture}},

Volume = {{49}},

Pages = {{808-824}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted with a laboratory-scale variable-aperture
   dolomite rock fracture to compare the transport of virus-sized
   microspheres and viruses. Transport tests were conducted using bromide,
   two sizes (20 and 200 nm diameter) of carboxylatemodified latex (CML)
   microspheres, and two bacteriophages (MS2 and PR772) that are often used
   as pathogenic virus surrogates. Retention of negatively charged MS2 was
   two to three times lower than retention of similarly sized negatively
   charged 20 nm microspheres, in contrast to expectations from
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory. Retention and transport of MS2
   and PR772 were much closer to that of the 200 nm microspheres, with
   approximately 20\% greater retention of MS2 compared to PR772 for all
   conditions tested. Microsphere transport was more significantly affected
   by ionic strength than the bacteriophage transport, particularly the 20
   nm microspheres. Impacts of calcium chloride were significant and
   different for microspheres compared to bacteriophages. Application of a
   one-dimensional advection-dispersion transport model with two types of
   kinetic attachment and detachment terms gave good fits to microsphere
   and bacteriophage transport data. However, blocking was required to
   accurately simulate transport of the 20 and 200 nm microspheres.
   Blocking was not a significant process for MS2 or PR772 under most
   conditions tested. Overall, results indicate that 20 nm CML microspheres
   are not suitable surrogates for transport of MS2 and PR772 in fractured
   dolomite, and therefore, likely not suitable as surrogates for other
   viral pathogens. The 200 nm microspheres would be more suitable as
   surrogates but show different responses to changes in solution chemistry
   compared to bacteriophages. Citation: Mondal, P. K., and B. E. Sleep

Abstract = {{In this work, a novel design of an active trilayer polymer membrane
   formed by doped polypyrrole (PPy) is presented. The PPy trilayer
   membrane was synthesized with a bis(trifluoro-methane)sulfonimide
   lithium salt (LiTFSI) dopant and was electrochemically deposited onto a
   gold-coated polyvinylidene fluoride porous membrane within a
   custom-designed electrochemical cell. The effects of the polymerization
   current density and activation potential on surface properties such as
   roughness, wrinkling, and wettability of the PPy trilayer membrane, were
   determined. The surface properties of membranes fabricated at five
   polymerization current densities, i(p), were compared. These membranes
   were activated at potentials ranging between 0 and 2 V. The membrane
   fabricated with i(p) = 0.1 mA/cm(2) exhibited the most dynamic range of
   surface properties as a function of activation potential, with a maximum
   increase in wrinkled area of 37\%, surface roughness of 200\%, and
   apparent contact angle from 55 degrees to 96 degrees. The actively
   tunable surface properties of this novel membrane provide promising
   opportunities for the development of surface reaction-based clean energy
   technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Six obligately anaerobic bacterial isolates (195(T), CBDB1, BAV1, VS,
   FL2 and GT) with strictly organohalide-respiring metabolisms were
   obtained from chlorinated solvent-contaminated aquifers, contaminated
   and uncontaminated river sediments or anoxic digester sludge. Cells were
   non-motile with a disc-shaped morphology, 0.3-1 mu m in diameter and
   0.1-0.2 mu m thick, and characteristic indentations on opposite flat
   sides of the cell. Growth occurred in completely synthetic, reduced
   medium amended with a haloorganic electron acceptor (mostly chlorinated
   but also some brominated compounds), hydrogen as electron donor, acetate
   as carbon source, and vitamins. No other growth-supporting redox couples
   were identified. Aqueous hydrogen consumption threshold concentrations
   were <1 nM. Growth ceased when vitamin B-12 was omitted from the medium.
   Addition of sterile cell-free supernatant of Dehalococcoides-containing
   enrichment cultures enhanced dechlorination and growth of strains 195
   and FL2, suggesting the existence of so-far unidentified stimulants.
   Dechlorination occurred between pH 6.5 and 8.0 and over a temperature
   range of 15-35 degrees C, with an optimum growth temperature between 25
   and 30 C. The major phospholipid fatty acids were 14 :0 (15.7 mol\%),
   br15 : 0 (6.2 mol\%), 16 :0 (22.7 mol\%), 10-methyl 16 :0 (25.8 mol\%)
   and 18 :0 (16.6 mol\%). Unusual furan fatty acids including
   9-(5-pentyl-2-furyl)-nonanoate and 8-(5-hexyl-2-furyl)-octanoate were
   detected in strains FL2, BAV1 and GT, but not in strains 195(T) and
   CBDB1. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the six isolates shared more than
   98\% identity, and phylogenetic analysis revealed an affiliation with
   the phylum Chloroflexi and more than 10\% sequence divergence from other
   described isolates. The genome sizes and G+C contents ranged from 1.34
   to 1.47 Mbp and 47 to 48.9 mol\% G+C, respectively. Based on 16S rRNA
   gene sequence comparisons, genome-wide average nucleotide identity and
   phenotypic characteristics, the organohalide-respiring isolates
   represent a new genus and species, for which the name Dehalococcoides
   mccartyi gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. Isolates BAV1 (=ATCC BAA-2100
   =JCM 16839 =KCTC 5957), FL2 (=ATCC BAA-2098 =DSM 23585 =JCM 16840 =KCTC
   5959), GT (=ATCC BAA-2099 =1CM 16841 =KCTC 5958), CBDB1, 195(T) (=ATCC
   BAA-2266(T) =KCTC 15142T) and VS are considered strains of
   Dehalococcoides mccartyi, with strain 195T as the type strain. The new
   class Dehalococcoidia classis nov., order Dehalococcoidales ord. nov.
   and family Dehalococcoidaceae fam. nov. are described to accommodate the
   new taxon.}},

Abstract = {{Organized brain activity is the result of dynamical, segregated neuronal
   signals that may be used to investigate synchronization effects using
   sophisticated neuroengineering techniques. Phase synchrony analysis, in
   particular, has emerged as a promising methodology to study transient
   and frequency-specific coupling effects across multi-site signals. In
   this study, we investigated phase synchronization in intracellular
   recordings of interictal and ictal epileptiform events recorded from
   pairs of cells in the whole (intact) mouse hippocampus. In particular,
   we focused our analysis on the background noise-like activity (NLA),
   previously reported to exhibit complex neurodynamical properties. Our
   results show evidence for increased linear and nonlinear phase coupling
   in NLA across three frequency bands {[}theta (4-10Hz), beta (12-30 Hz)
   and gamma (30-80 Hz)] in the ictal compared to interictal state
   dynamics. We also present qualitative and statistical evidence for
   increased phase synchronization in the theta, beta and gamma frequency
   bands from paired recordings of ictal NLA. Overall, our results validate
   the use of background NLA in the neurodynamical study of epileptiform
   transitions and suggest that what is considered ``neuronal noise{''} is
   amenable to synchronization effects in the spatiotemporal domain.}},

Title = {{Development of a laser displacement probe to measure particle impact

Abstract = {{A new laser displacement probe was developed to measure the impact
   velocities of particles within vibrationally fluidized beds. Key
   features of the displacement signals were interpreted using an analysis
   of the motion of a vibrating particle contacting the vibrating sensor
   window. The sensor output was also used to measure bulk flow velocity
   along the probe window and to provide a measure of the media packing.
   The probe was demonstrated in a tub vibratory finisher containing either
   steel or porcelain spheres. Sample measurements were made at several
   fixed locations in the vibratory tub, in three orthogonal directions.
   The displacement signals from the laser sensors were analyzed to obtain
   the probability distribution functions of the impact velocity of the
   particles. The impact velocity was affected by the orientation of the
   laser probe relative to the bulk flow velocity, and the density and
   elastic properties of the granular media. The average impact velocity of
   the porcelain balls was greater than that of the steel balls. The impact
   velocities of the particles were largely independent of their bulk flow
   speed and packing density. The present laser sensor impact velocity
   measurements are compared with those obtained in a previous study using
   an impact force sensor. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Mechanistic studies of methanol synthesis over Cu from CO/CO2/H-2/H2O
   mixtures: The source of C in methanol and the role of water}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{298}},
Pages = {{10-17}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The low temperature (403-453 K) conversions of CO/hydrogen and
   CO2/hydrogen mixtures (6 bar total pressure) to methanol over copper
   catalysts are both assisted by the presence of small amounts of water
   (mole fraction similar to 0.04-0.5\%). For CO2/hydrogen reaction
   mixtures, the water product from both methanol synthesis and reverse
   water-gas shift serves to initiate both reactions in an autocatalytic
   manner. In the case of CO/D-2 mixtures, very little methanol is produced
   until small amounts of water are added. The effect of water on methanol
   production is more immediate than in CO2/D-2, yet the steady-state rates
   are similar. Tracer experiments in (CO)-C-13/(CO2)-C-12/hydrogen (with
   or without added water) show that the dominant source of C in the
   methanol product gradually shifts from CO2 to CO as the temperature is
   lowered. Cu-bound formate, the major IR visible surface species under
   CO2/hydrogen, is not visible in CO/moist hydrogen. Though formate is
   visible in the tracer experiments, the symmetric stretch is absent.
   These results, in conjunction with recent DFT calculations on Cu(111),
   point to carboxyl as a common intermediate for both methanol synthesis
   and reverse water-gas shift, with formate playing a spectator
   co-adsorbate role. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Towards a hemodynamic BCI using transcranial Doppler without

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Transcranial Doppler (TCD) was recently introduced as a new
   brain-computer interface (BCI) modality for detecting task-induced
   hemispheric lateralization. To date, single-trial discrimination between
   a lateralized mental activity and a rest state has been demonstrated
   with long (45 s) activation time periods. However, the possibility of
   detecting successive activations in a user-independent framework (i.e.
   without training data from the user) remains an open question.
   Objective. The objective of this research was to assess TCD-based
   detection of lateralized mental activity with a user-independent
   classifier. In so doing, we also investigated the accuracy of detecting
   successive lateralizations. Approach. TCD data from 18 participants were
   collected during verbal fluency, mental rotation tasks and baseline
   counting tasks. Linear discriminant analysis and a set of four
   time-domain features were used to classify successive left and right
   brain activations. Main results. In a user-independent framework,
   accuracies up to 74.6 +/- 12.6\% were achieved using training data from
   a single participant, and lateralization task durations of 18 s.
   Significance. Subject-independent, algorithmic classification of TCD
   signals corresponding to successive brain lateralization may be a
   feasible paradigm for TCD-BCI design.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the effects of variation in chemical conditions (solvent
   composition, water content, polymer concentration, and added salt) on
   the morphologies formed by PS-b-PAA in DMF/dioxane/water mixtures in a
   two-phase gas-liquid segmented microfluidic reactor. The differences In
   morphologies between off-chip and on-chip self-assembly and on-chip
   morphological trends for different chemical conditions are explained by
   the interplay of top-down shear effects (coalescence and breakup) and
   bottom-up chemical forces. Using off-chip morphology results, we
   construct a water content-solvent composition phase diagram showing
   disordered, sphere, cylinder, and vesicle regions. On-chip morphologies
   are found to deviate from off-chip morphologies by three identified
   shear-induced paths: 1) sphere-to-cylinder, and 2) sphere-to-vesicle
   transitions, both via shear-induced coalescence when initial micelle
   sizes are small, and 3) cylinder-to-sphere transitions via shear-induced
   breakup when initial micelle sizes are large (high capillary number
   conditions). These pathways contribute to the generation of large
   extended bilayer aggregates uniquely on-chip, at either increased
   polymer or salt concentrations. Collectively these results demonstrate
   the broad utility of top-down directed molecular self-assembly in
   conjunction with chemical forces to control morphology and size of
   polymer colloids at the nanoscale.}},

   modulated by a gate voltage, revealing p-type semiconducting behavior
   with a device mobility of similar to 14.5 cm(2)/V.s and an on-off
   current ratio of -10(3). Moreover, when the CNT-NW-assisted devices are
   irradiated with 1.25-25 mu m infrared (IR) from 300 to 11 K, the photo
   currents increase approximately 1.1- to 2.7-fold compared to the dark
   currents at +/- 2 V bias voltage. Such results demonstrate that the
   presented CNT-NWs have high potential for IR photo-sensor applications.

Abstract = {{Perturbation of whole-body stability often evokes rapid arm reactions.
   It has been suggested that the earliest arm activation is a generic
   (e.g. startle-like) response to which a later stabilizing (e.g.
   counterweight or reach-to-grasp) or impact-protection component can be
   appended. To examine whether the initial part of the reaction is
   generic, we examined arm reactions evoked by small balance perturbations
   in 12 healthy young adults while varying perturbation direction
   (rightward or forward platform translation) and environmental conditions
   (handrail present or absent). The perturbation magnitude was selected to
   be sufficiently small to obviate the need to use the arms for
   stabilization. To avoid adaptation or habituation, analysis focused on
   each subject's very first exposure to the perturbation. Most subjects
   exhibited active movement of both arms in reaction to the perturbation,
   but there was large (non-stereotypical) inter-subject variation in
   muscle-onset latency and arm kinematics. Furthermore, the velocity and
   direction of the initial arm movement were affected by perturbation
   direction, in a manner consistent with functional strategies
   (counterweight strategy in backward falls, hybrid
   counterweight/protective strategy in leftward falls). Although subjects
   never contacted the handrail, responses were slower when it was present.
   These results are not consistent with a generic stereotyped response,
   but suggest instead that even the earliest component of first-trial arm
   reactions was functionally modulated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is an emerging disinfection by-product
   (DBP) which can be formed via the chloramination of amine-based
   precursors. The formation of NDMA is mainly determined by the speciation
   of chloramines and the precursor amine groups, both of which are highly
   dependent on pH. The impact of pH on NDMA formation has been studied for
   the model precursor dimethylamine (DMA) and natural organic matter
   (NOM), but little is known for amine-based pharmaceuticals which have
   been newly identified as a group of potential NDMA precursors,
   especially in waters impacted by treated waste-water effluents. This
   study investigates the role of pH in the formation of NDMA from two
   amine-based pharmaceuticals, ranitidine and sumatriptan, under drinking
   water relevant conditions. The results indicate that pH affects both the
   ultimate NDMA formation as well as the reaction kinetics. The maximum
   NDMA formation typically occurs in the pH range of 7-8. At lower pH, the
   reaction is limited due to the lack of non-protonated amines. At higher
   pH, although the initial reaction is enhanced by the increasing amount
   of non-protonated amines, the ultimate NDMA formation is limited because
   of the lack of dichloramine. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The joint replenishment problem (JRP) has received considerable
   attention and all of the work on JRP is under explicit environment. In
   fact, the decision makers often have to face vague operational
   conditions. In this paper, a novel JRP model with fuzzy minor
   replenishment cost and fuzzy inventory holding cost is developed. More
   concisely, this model is a fuzzy dependent-chance programming (DCP)
   model. Subsequently, the technique of the traditional fuzzy simulation
   (FS) approach and differential evolution algorithm (DE) are integrated
   to design a hybrid intelligent algorithm named FSDE-I to solve this
   practical fuzzy JRP. Thirdly, another intelligent algorithm named
   FSDE-II using an improved FS approach is proposed to estimate the
   credibility more precisely. Finally, FSDE-I and FSDE-II are illustrated
   with numerical examples and the results show the effectiveness of
   FSDE-II. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are associated with
   aging and are prevalent in various brain pathologies. The purpose of the
   current study was to characterize WMH perfusion in age-matched elderly
   controls (ECs) and patients with Alzheimer's disease (ADs).
   Methods: Fifty ECs (23 men) and 61 ADs (33 men) underwent magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI), 99mTc-ECD single-photon emission computed
   tomography (SPECT) and cognitive testing. Brain tissue type was
   classified on T1 weighted images, and WMH were identified on interleaved
   proton density/T2 weighted images. Co-registered MR images were used to
   characterize SPECT perfusion patterns.
   Results: WMH perfusion was lower than normal appearing white matter
   (NAWM) perfusion (P < 0.001) in both EC and AD groups. There was no WMH
   perfusion difference between groups when considering the mean perfusion
   from all WMH voxels (P > 0.43). However, locations that were likely to
   be considered WMH tended to have lower perfusion in ADs compared with
   ECs. Perfusion gradients along watershed white matter regions were
   significantly different between EC and AD groups (P < 0.05). A
   relationship was found between the volume of a WMH lesion and its mean
   perfusion (P < 0.001) in both ECs and ADs.
   Conclusion: Global WMH were hypoperfused compared with NAWM to the same
   degree in EC and AD participants, which suggests a common WMH etiology
   between groups. However, white matter locations that were likely to
   contain WMH tended to be hypoperfused in ADs compared with healthy
   aging. This finding is suggestive of AD-specific pathology that reduces
   the perfusion at anatomic locations susceptible to the formation of WMH
   through either the neurodegenerative process or AD-related vasculopathy
   or both.}},

Title = {{Mixed-Signal-Controlled Flyback-Transformer-Based Buck Converter With
   Improved Dynamic Performance and Transient Energy Recycling}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a practical modification of the buck converter and
   a complementary controller that are well suited for point of load
   applications with highly dynamic loads. The presented
   flyback-transformer-based buck (FTBB) converter has faster transient
   response than the conventional buck, allowing for a reduction in the
   output capacitance without penalty in the size of the magnetic core.
   During heavy-to-light load transients, the FTBB converter also recycles
   excess energy stored in the magnetic component, providing a useful
   energy savings mechanism. In this modification, the conventional buck
   inductor is replaced with the primary winding of the flyback
   transformer, an extra switch, and a set of small auxiliary switches on
   the secondary side. During heavy-to-light load transients, the inductor
   current is steered away from the output capacitor to the input port,
   achieving both energy recycling and savings due to reduced voltage
   overshoots. The light-to-heavy transient response is improved by
   reducing the equivalent inductance of the primary transformer winding to
   its leakage value. A mixed-signal current-programmed mode controller
   regulates operation of the converter. The controller provides minimum
   output voltage deviation and ensures seamless transitions between
   different operating modes. The performance of the FTBB converter is
   verified with a 6-to-1-V, 3-W, 390-kHz experimental prototype. In
   comparison with an equivalent buck converter, the experimental system
   has about three times smaller maximum output voltage deviation, allowing
   for the same output capacitor reduction and, for frequently changing
   loads, about 7\% decrease in power losses.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The purpose of this study was to assess biofilm formation
   within sealer-dentin interfaces of root segments filled with
   gutta-percha and sealer incorporated with chitosan (CS) nanoparticles
   with and without canal surface treatment with different formulations of
   CS. Methods: Standardized canals of 4-mm bovine root segments (N = 35)
   were filled with guttapercha and pulp canal sealer incorporated with CS
   nanoparticles without surface treatment (group CS) or after surface
   treatment with phosphorylated CS (group PHCS), CS-conjugated rose bengal
   and photodynamic irradiation (group CSRB), or a combination of both PHCS
   and CSRB (group RBPH). The control group was filled with gutta-percha
   and an unmodified sealer. After 7 days of setting, specimens were aged
   in buffered solution at 37 degrees C for 1 or 4 weeks. Monospecies
   biofilms of Enterococcus faecalis were grown on specimens for 7 days in
   a chemostat-based biofilm fermentor. Biofilm formation within the
   sealer-dentin interface was assessed with confocal laser scanning
   microscopy. Results: In the 4-week aged specimens only, the mean biofilm
   areas were significantly smaller than in the control for the CS (P =
   .008), PHCS (P = .012), and RBPH (P = .034) groups. The percentage of
   the biofilm-covered interface also was significantly lower than in the
   control for the CS (P = .024) and PHCS (P = .003) groups. The CS, PHCS,
   and RBPH groups did not differ significantly. Conclusions: Incorporating
   CS nanoparticles into the zinc oxide eugenol sealer inhibited biofilm
   formation within the sealer-dentin interface. This effect was maintained
   when canals were treated with phosphorylated CS, and it was moderated by
   canal treatment with CS-conjugated rose bengal and irradiation. (J Endod

   dispensing with a variance in subsequent droplet volume of less than
   15\% between droplets. The frequency of stable generation was 20 Hz, and
   the average volume of dispensed droplet was 1 nL. The dispenser
   operating range and the nondestructive actuation make it suitable for

Abstract = {{Dehalococcoides mccartyi strains are obligate organohalide-respiring
   bacteria harboring multiple distinct reductive dehalogenase (RDase)
   genes within their genomes. A major challenge is to identify substrates
   for the enzymes encoded by these RDase genes. We demonstrate an approach
   that involves blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE)
   followed by enzyme activity assays with gel slices and subsequent
   identification of proteins in gel slices using liquid chromatography
   coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RDase expression was
   investigated in cultures of Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain BAV1 and in
   the KB-1 consortium growing on chlorinated ethenes and
   1,2-dichloroethane. In cultures of strain BAV1, BvcA was the only RDase
   detected, revealing that this enzyme catalyzes the dechlorination not
   only of vinyl chloride, but also of all dichloroethene isomers and
   1,2-dichloroethane. In cultures of consortium KB-1, five distinct
   Dehalococcoides RDases and one Geobacter RDase were expressed under the
   conditions tested. Three of the five RDases included orthologs to the
   previously identified chlorinated ethene-dechlorinating enzymes VcrA,
   BvcA, and TceA. This study revealed substrate promiscuity for these
   three enzymes and provides a path forward to further explore the largely
   unknown RDase protein family.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hybrid QR decomposition (QRD) design that reduces
   the number of computations and increases their execution parallelism by
   using a unique combination of Multi-dimensional Givens rotations,
   Householder transformations and conventional 2-D Givens rotations. A
   semi-pipelined semi-iterative architecture is presented for the QRD
   core, that uses innovative design ideas to develop 2-D, Householder 3-D
   and 4-D/2-D configurable CORDIC processors, such that they can perform
   the maximum possible number of vectoring and rotation operations within
   the given number of cycles, while minimizing gate count and maximizing
   the resource utilization. Test results for the 0.3 mm(2) QRD chip,
   fabricated in 0.13 mu m 1P8M CMOS technology, demonstrate that the
   proposed design for 4 x 4 complex matrices attains the lowest reported
   processing latency of 40 clock cycles (144 ns) at 278 MHz and dissipates
   48.2 mW at 1.3 V supply and 25 degrees C. It outperforms all of the

Abstract = {{Intratumoral heterogeneity arises through the evolution of genetically
   diverse subclones during tumor progression. However, it remains unknown
   whether cells within single genetic clones are functionally equivalent.
   By combining DNA copy number alteration (CNA) profiling, sequencing, and
   lentiviral lineage tracking, we followed the repopulation dynamics of
   150 single lentivirus-marked lineages from 10 human colorectal cancers
   through serial xenograft passages in mice. CNA and mutational analysis
   distinguished individual clones and showed that clones remained stable
   upon serial transplantation. Despite this stability, the proliferation,
   persistence, and chemotherapy tolerance of lentivirally marked lineages
   were variable within each clone. Chemotherapy promoted the dominance of
   previously minor or dormant lineages. Thus, apart from genetic
   diversity, tumor cells display inherent functional variability in tumor
   propagation potential, which contributes to both cancer growth and
   therapy tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the inherent capability for axonal regeneration, recovery
   following severe peripheral nerve injury remains unpredictable and often
   very poor. Surgeons typically use autologous nerve grafts taken from the
   patient's own body to bridge long nerve gaps. However, the amount of
   suitable nerve available from a given patient is limited, and using
   autologous grafts leaves the patient with scars, numbness, and other
   forms of donor-site morbidity. Therefore, surgeons and engineers have
   sought off-the-shelf alternatives to the current practice of autologous
   nerve grafting. Decellularized nerve allografts have recently become
   available as an alternative to traditional nerve autografting. In this
   review, we provide a critical analysis comparing the advantages and
   limitations of the three major experimental models of decellularized
   nerve allografts: cold preserved, freeze-thawed, and chemical detergent
   based. Current tissue engineering-based techniques to optimize
   decellularized nerve allografts are discussed. We also evaluate studies
   that supplement decellularized nerve grafts with exogenous factors such
   as Schwann cells, stem cells, and growth factors to both support and
   enhance axonal regeneration through the decellularized allografts. In
   examining the advantages and disadvantages of the studies of
   decellularized allografts, we suggest that experimental methods,
   including the animal model, graft length, follow-up time, and outcome
   measures of regenerative progress and success be consolidated. Finally,
   all clinical studies in which decellularized nerve allografts have been
   used to bridge nerve gaps in patients are reviewed.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{41-51}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Herein we develop a means to differentiate between the energy required
   to expand and the energy required to maintain the economies of cities. A
   nonlinear model is tested against historical data for two cities, Hong
   Kong and Singapore. A robust fit is obtained for Hong Kong, with energy
   for maintenance close to that for growth, while Singapore, with a weaker
   fit, is growth dominated. The findings suggest that decreases in either
   of the per unit maintenance or growth demands can simultaneously cause
   gross domestic product (GDP) and total energy use to increase.
   Furthermore, increasing maintenance demands can significantly limit
   growth in energy demand and GDP. Thus, the low maintenance demands for
   Hong Kong, and especially Singapore, imply that, all other things being
   equal, GDP and energy use of these cities will continue to grow, though
   Singapore's higher energy use for growth means it will require more
   energy than Hong Kong.}},

   in cortical bone}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Non-enzymatic glycation (NEG) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs)
   may contribute to bone fragility in various diseases, ageing, and other
   conditions by modifying bone collagen and causing degraded mechanical
   properties. In this study, we sought to further understand how collagen
   modification in an in vitro non-enzymatic ribation model leads to loss
   of cortical bone toughness. Previous in vitro studies using
   non-enzymatic ribation reported loss of ductility in the cortical bone.
   Increased crosslinking is most commonly blamed for these changes;
   however, some studies report positive correlations between measures of
   total collagen crosslinking and work-to-fracture/toughness measurements
   whilst correlations between general NEG and measures of ductility are
   often negative.
   Fifteen bone beam triplets were cut from bovine metatarsi. Each provided
   one native non-incubated control, one incubated control and one ribated
   specimen. Incubation involved simulated body fluid +/- ribose for
   fourteen days at 37 degrees C. Pentosidine and pyridinoline crosslinks
   were measured using HPLC. Three-point bending tests quantified
   mechanical properties. Fracture surfaces were examined using scanning
   electron microscopy. The effects of ribation on bone collagen molecular
   stability and intermolecular connectivity were investigated using
   differential scanning calorimetry and hydrothermal isometric tension
   testing.
   Ribation caused increased non-enzymatic collagen modification and
   pentosidine content (16 mmol/mol collagen) and inferior post-yield
   mechanical behaviour, especially post-yield strain and flexural
   toughness. Fracture surfaces were smoother with less collagen fibril
   deformation or tearing than observed in controls. In the ribated group
   only, pentosidine content and thermomechanical measures of crosslinking
   were positively correlated with measures of strain accommodation and
   energy absorption before failure.
   Non-enzymatic ribation and the resulting modifications reduce cortical
   bone pseudo-plasticity through a reduced capacity for post-yield strain
   accommodation. However, the positive correlations we have found suggest
   that increased crosslinking may not provide a complete explanation for
   this embrittlement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recirculation buffer modules combining arrayed waveguide gratings
   (AWGs), tunable wavelength converters (TWCs), and fiber delay lines
   (FDLs) have been proposed to bypass the existing switching bottlenecks
   in massive-scale data centers. Performance studies of such subsystems
   are devoted exclusively to either the network layer or the physical
   layer aspects. Network layer studies consider packet drops only due to
   limited buffering capacity and ignore the critical role of the physical
   layer in degrading signal quality. Purely physical layer studies, on the
   other hand, are oblivious to contention-based drops and load transients.
   As a result, neither approach is able to estimate accurately the
   performance characteristics of buffer modules as key elements in optical
   data centers. In this theoretical work, we integrate the network layer
   and the physical layer effects into a single analysis framework to
   compare various recirculation buffer module designs in terms of
   throughput, delay, signal quality, and complexity. We primarily compare
   the designs in terms of two metrics: maximum operating load and Q-factor
   degradation impact. Our Monte Carlo simulations indicate that Q-factor
   degradation has the dominant role in determining the buffer module
   performance over a wide range of load values, resulting in significant
   bandwidth limitations. In order to implement optical packet switching in
   data centers, tradeoffs between physical layer quality requirements and
   forward error correction (FEC) overheads should be carefully
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Strategies for the production of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) rely on
   serially dissociated adherent or aggregate-based culture, consequently
   limiting robust scale-up of cell production, on-line control and
   optimization of culture conditions. We recently developed a method that
   enables continuous (non-serially dissociated) suspension
   culture-mediated reprogramming to pluripotency. Herein, we use this
   method to demonstrate the scalable production of PSCs and early
   derivatives using acoustic filter technology to enable continuous
   oxygen-controlled perfusion culture. Cell densities of greater than
   1?x?107?cells/mL were achieved after 7 days of expansion at a specific
   growth rate (mu) of 0.61?+/-?0.1?day-1 with a perfusion rate (D) of
   5.0?day-1. A twofold increase in maximum cell density (to greater than
   2.5?x?107?cells/mL) was achieved when the medium dissolved oxygen was
   reduced (5\% DO). Cell densities and viabilities >80\% were maintained
   for extended production periods during which maintenance of pluripotency
   was confirmed by stable expression of pluripotency factors (SSEA-1 and
   Nanog), as well as the capacity to differentiate into all three germ
   layers. This work establishes a versatile biotechnological platform for
   the production of pluripotent cells and derivatives in an integrated,
   scalable and intensified stirred suspension culture. Biotechnol. Bioeng.

   for systems with nonvolatile low and high viscosity liquids. A micro

   Since the internal volume of the cell is small, a short mixing time is
   sufficient for the gasliquid mixtures to reach equilibrium. The
   solubility values are measured by using the pressure decay method. The
   experimental procedures are validated by measuring the carbon dioxide

Abstract = {{Nowadays, there has been significant deployment of peer-assisted
   on-demand streaming services over the Internet. Two of the most unique
   and salient features in a peer-assisted on-demand streaming system are
   the differentiation in the demand (or request) and the prefetching
   capability with caching. In this paper, we develop a theoretical
   framework based on queuing models, in order to 1) justify the
   superiority of service prioritization based on a taxonomy of requests,
   and 2) understand the fundamental principles behind optimal prefetching
   and caching designs in peer-assisted on-demand streaming systems. The
   focus is to instruct how limited uploading bandwidth resources and peer
   caching capacities can be utilized most efficiently to achieve better
   system performance. To achieve these objectives, we first use priority
   queuing analysis to prove how service quality and user experience can be
   statistically guaranteed, by prioritizing requests in the order of
   significance, including urgent playback (e. g., random seeks or initial
   startup), normal playback, and prefetching. We then proceed to construct
   a fine-grained stochastic supply-demand model to investigate peer
   caching and prefetching as a global optimization problem. This not only
   provides insights in understanding the fundamental characterization of
   demand, but also offers guidelines toward optimal prefetching and
   caching strategies in peer-assisted on-demand streaming systems.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the design, implementation, and evaluation of a coarse-grain
   superscalar processor in the context of the microarchitecture of the
   Control Processor (CP) of the Multilevel Computing Architecture (MLCA),
   a novel architecture targeted for multimedia multicore systems. The MLCA
   augments a traditional multicore architecture (called the lower level)
   with a CP (called the top-level), which automatically extracts
   parallelism among coarse-grain units of computation (tasks),
   synchronizes these tasks and schedules them for execution on processors.
   It does so in a fashion similar to how instruction-level parallelism is
   extracted by superscalar processors, i.e., using register renaming,
   Out-of-Order Execution (OoOE) and scheduling. The coarse-grain nature of
   tasks imposes challenging constraints on the direct use of these
   techniques, but also offers opportunities for simpler designs. We
   analyze the impact of these constraints and opportunities and present
   novel microarchitectural mechanisms for coarse-grain superscalar
   execution, including register renaming, task queue, dynamic out-of-order
   scheduling and task-issue. We design an MLCA system around our CP
   microarchitecture and implement it on an FPGA. We evaluate the system
   using multimedia applications and show good scalability for eight
   processors, limited by the memory bandwidth of the FPGA platform.
   Furthermore, we show that the CP introduces little overhead in terms of
   resource usage. Finally, we show scalability beyond eight processors
   using cycle-accurate RTL-level simulation with an idealized memory
   subsystem. We demonstrate that the CP poses no performance bottlenecks
   and is scalable up to 32 processors.}},

Abstract = {{Porous crystalline calcium polyphosphate (CPP) is under investigation as
   a candidate bone substitute/augmentation material including
   incorporation in implants intended for repair of osteochondral defects.
   Previous studies of biphasic implants (i.e., cartilage-CPP constructs)
   for osteochondral defect repair have shown that porous CPP has the
   required features for this application including the bone substitute
   portion of the biphasic implant, but the porous CPP degradation rate is
   lower than preferred. This study investigated the effect of doping with
   MgCO3, MgCl2, K2CO3, or KCl at a molar ratio of M/Ca = 0.02 on
   properties and in vitro degradation behavior of CPP. Doping with
   magnesium or potassium resulted in changes in the crystallization and
   melting temperatures, which required adjustment of the sintering
   conditions for forming samples of the desired porosity level. This, in
   turn, resulted in higher compressive and diametral compressive (i.e.,
   tensile) strengths of the porous-doped CPP samples compared with undoped
   CPP prepared to a given porosity level. For samples prepared in this
   study, the chemical degradation rate of porous Mg-doped CPP samples was
   the fastest while K doping resulted in a lower degradation rate than
   undoped CPP.}},

Title = {{An algorithm to quantify correlated collective cell migration behavior}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNIQUES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{87+}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Collective cell migration is an important process that determines cell
   reorganization in a number of biological events such as development and
   regeneration. Random cell reorganization within a confluent monolayer is
   a popular in vitro model system for understanding the mechanisms that
   underlie coordination between neighboring cells during collective
   motion. Here we describe a simple automated C++ algorithm to quantify
   the width of streams of correlated cells moving within monolayers. Our
   method is efficient and allows analysis of thousands of cells in under a
   minute; analysis of large data sets is therefore possible without
   limitations due to computational time, a common analysis bottleneck.
   Furthermore, our method allows characterization of the variability in
   correlated stream widths among a cell monolayer. We quantify stream
   width in the human retinal epithelial cell line ARPE-19 and the
   fibroblast cell line BJ, and find that for both cell types, stream
   widths within the monolayer vary in size significantly with a peak width
   of 40 mu m, corresponding to a width of approximately two cells. Our
   algorithm provides a novel analytical tool to quantify and analyze
   correlated cell movement in confluent sheets at a population level and
   to assess factors that impact coordinated collective cell migration.}},

Journal = {{CHINESE PHYSICS B}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{An AlGaN/GaN high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) with a novel
   source-connected air-bridge field plate (AFP) is experimentally
   verified. The device features a metal field plate that jumps from the
   source over the gate region and lands between the gate and drain. When
   compared to a similar size HEMT device with a conventional field plate
   (CFP) structure, the AFP not only minimizes the parasitic gate to source
   capacitance, but also exhibits higher OFF-state breakdown voltage and
   one order of magnitude lower drain leakage current. In a device with a
   gate to drain distance of 6 mu m and a gate length of 0.8 mu m, three
   times higher forward blocking voltage of 375 V was obtained at V-GS = 5
   V. In contrast, a similar sized HEMT with a CFP can only achieve a
   breakdown voltage no higher than 125 V using this process, regardless of
   device dimensions. Moreover, a temperature coefficient of 0 V/K for the
   breakdown voltage is observed. However, devices without a field plate
   (no FP) and with an optimized conventional field plate (CFP) exhibit
   breakdown voltage temperature coefficients of -0.113 V/K and -0.065 V/K,
   respectively.}},

   The reaction conditions we refer to as Piers-Rubinsztajn Conditions and
   we have previously shown such conditions to be suitable when using
   phenylated silicones as precursors. In this work we found they also work
   successfully for a silicone oligomer as well as cocopolymers of
   polymethylhydridosiloxane (PMHS) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and a
   PMHS homopolymer, all of which are highly abundent and available in
   industrial quanitities. The resulting material was either a waxy solid,
   viscous oil or a glass. An additional ``finishing{''} step with anisole
   using the same chemistry was found necessary to prevent gelation of the
   copolymer and homopolymer of PMHS. Even after finishing a small fraction
   (<5\%) of Si-H groups remained in the silicones. This nonetheless
   provides a rapid and mild method to synthesize functional silicones and
   tune their physical properties, using commonly available starting

Abstract = {{Lidar has been established over the past few years as a mainstream tool
   for the acquisition of three dimensional point data. Besides the
   conventional mapping missions, lidar has proven to be very useful for a
   wide spectrum of applications such as forestry, urban planning,
   structural deformation analysis, and reverse engineering. In the context
   of a nationwide dataset, it is safe to assume that multiple laser
   scanners are under different conditions to collect the data. Current
   registration and segmentation algorithms assume homogeneity in the local
   point density and accuracy which is an invalid assumption that cannot be
   tolerated. As a consequence of the wide range of lidar sensors currently
   available, it is becoming crucial to develop algorithms for the
   registration and segmentation of lidar data with significantly varying
   characteristics (i.e., varying point density and accuracy). In this
   paper, a methodology for the optimal registration and segmentation of
   heterogeneous lidar data is presented. An example of integrating
   airborne and terrestrial laser scans is presented and followed by a
   discussion of the pros of the integration process.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a methodology for creating a realistic 3D
   (three-dimensional) human model for portrait-based product development
   based on images, including face, wrinkle and hairstyle. For face
   modeling, we first generate a global model through deforming a generic
   model based on a set of facial landmarks. Local optimization is then
   performed for further enhancing the similarity between the subject and
   the 3D model in the non-feature regions (NFRs), eyes/nose/mouth and
   ears, using the proposed Point and Curve based deformation.
   Subsequently, this study proposes a wrinkle modeling method based on
   automatically extracted curves and improved shape control functions.
   Individual hairstyle modeling is introduced in a two-step approach that
   consists of hair-volume generation and individual-strand generation.
   Finally, several resulting 3D human models and their potential
   applications to portrait-based product design demonstrate the
   functionality of our methodology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The common approach for 3D face recognition is to register a probe face
   to each of the gallery faces and then calculate the sum of the distances
   between their points. This approach is computationally expensive and
   sensitive to facial expression variation. In this paper, we introduce
   the iterative closest normal point method for finding the corresponding
   points between a generic reference face and every input face. The
   proposed correspondence finding method samples a set of points for each
   face, denoted as the closest normal points. These points are effectively
   aligned across all faces, enabling effective application of discriminant
   analysis methods for 3D face recognition. As a result, the expression
   variation problem is addressed by minimizing the within-class
   variability of the face samples while maximizing the between-class
   variability. As an important conclusion, we show that the surface normal
   vectors of the face at the sampled points contain more discriminatory
   information than the coordinates of the points. We have performed
   comprehensive experiments on the Face Recognition Grand Challenge
   database, which is presently the largest available 3D face database. We
   have achieved verification rates of 99.6 and 99.2 percent at a false
   acceptance rate of 0.1 percent for the all versus all and ROC III
   experiments, respectively, which, to the best of our knowledge, have
   seven and four times less error rates, respectively, compared to the
   best existing methods on this database.}},

Abstract = {{Acid leaching of silicon is insufficient in order to achieve solar grade
   silicon. Leaching of silicon previously purified by the copper gathering
   method can significantly reduce amount of impurities congregated in the
   Cu-Si intermetallic phase during solidification process. Two samples of
   50 wt\% Cu-50 wt\% Si alloy were solidified at 0.5 and 1.0 degrees C/min
   cooling rate. They were treated with 10 vol\% HNO3 and 5 vol\% HCl and 7
   vol\% HNO3. The inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry technique
   was employed to measure traces of impurities before and after the
   treatment. It was determined that the overall impurity level in purified
   silicon was reduced from 5277 ppm(wt) to 225.5 ppm(wt). The samples
   cooled at 0.5 degrees C/min achieved lower impurities levels in all
   instances while the sample leached with 10\% HNO3 produced the greatest
   reduction in impurity level. Scanning electron microscopy and Energy
   Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy analysis showed that the traces of Cu-Si
   intermetallic together with gathered impurities can be found only in the
   large silicon particles after the acid leaching treatment. In all
   instances, the surface of the silicon particles was free of impurities
   while Si yield was preserved at above 97\%. Crown Copyright (C) 2012

Abstract = {{A technique is proposed for the detection of abnormalities (targets) in
   ultrasound images using little or no a priori information and requiring
   little operator intervention. The scheme is a combination of the CLEAN
   algorithm, originally proposed for radio astronomy, and constant false
   alarm rate (CFAR) processing, as developed for use in radar systems. The
   CLEAN algorithm identifies areas in the ultrasound image that stand out
   above a threshold in relation to the background; CFAR techniques allow
   for an adaptive, semi-automated, selection of the threshold. Neither
   appears to have been previously used for target detection in ultrasound
   images and never together in any context. As a first step towards
   assessing the potential of this method we used a widely used method of
   simulating B-mode images (Field II). We assumed the use of a 256 element
   linear array operating at 3.0 MHz into a water-like medium containing a
   density of point scatterers sufficient to simulate a background of fully
   developed speckle. Spherical targets with diameters ranging from 0.25 to
   6.0 mm and contrasts ranging from 0 to 12 dB relative to the background
   were used as test objects. Using a contrast-detail analysis, the
   probability of detection curves indicate these targets can be
   consistently detected within a speckle background. Our results indicate
   that the method has considerable promise for the semi-automated
   detection of abnormalities with diameters greater than a few
   millimeters, depending on the contrast. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{ULTRASONICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Modulated low-frequency shear waves can be non-invasively generated
   locally within a medium, by the oscillatory acoustic radiation force
   resulting from the interference of two focused quasi-CW ultrasound beams
   of slightly different frequencies. The propagation of such shear waves
   within a viscoelastic medium is known to be affected by the dispersive
   effects of viscosity. Specifically, a low-frequency (LF) spectral
   component was shown to arise with increased viscosities and higher
   modulation frequencies and appear as a `slow' wave at the end of the
   shear waveform. In this paper, the shear dispersion characteristics are
   studied based on the Pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution (PWVD) in the
   time-frequency domain. The ridges of the PWVD are then extracted and
   used to calculate the frequency-dependent shear speed, by identifying
   the LF dispersive component both in time and frequency. Using numerical
   simulations, it is shown that this way of estimating the shear
   dispersion is more efficient and robust than the conventional
   phase-delay Fourier method. Thus, more accurate estimates of the local
   shear modulus and viscosity of the propagating medium could be achieved.
   The effects of noise on the proposed method are also discussed. (C) 2012

   maintaining good beam characteristics across a wide frequency range.
   Moreover, its directivity is comparable to that of the virtual parabolic
   reflector, even at high scan angles. We use the Schwarz-Christoffel

   of coordinates between the virtual and flat reflectors, thereby avoiding
   the need to monitor the anisotropy of the material that results when

Abstract = {{Thermodynamic upper bounds for polymer foam cell densities are predicted
   using compressible self-consistent field theory. It is found that the
   incompressible limit always gives the highest, and therefore ultimate,
   upper bound. Qualitative comparisons between the compressible and
   incompressible cases agree, indicating that low temperatures and high
   blowing agent content should be used to achieve high cell densities. The
   inhomogeneous bubble structure reveals deviations from the expected
   homogeneous Sanchez-Lacombe equation of state, consistent with some
   experimental results. A generalized Sanchez -Lacombe equation of state
   is discussed in the context of its suitability as a simple alternative
   to the Simha-Somcynsky equation of state. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Microscopic flow-fiber interaction is frequently encountered in biofluid
   systems. In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional numerical model
   for such systems, including a spring network model for the elastic
   fiber, the lattice Boltzmann method for the fluid flow, and the immersed
   boundary method for the flow-structure interaction. Simulations are also
   conducted to examine the fiber deformation under constant and sinusoidal
   shear conditions. While an equilibrium state can be reached under a
   constant shear, periodic oscillation in fiber shape is observed in a
   sinusoidal shear flow, at a frequency identical to that of the imposed
   shear flow. A continuous phase shift of the fiber oscillation is also
   noticed along the fiber. These simulations demonstrate the potential
   usefulness of this model in microscopic biofluid and other systems, and
   further studies are necessary to investigate the dynamic flow-fiber
   interaction in various flow situations. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{High-frequency flow fluctuations in intracranial aneurysms have
   previously been reported in vitro and in vivo. On the other hand, the
   vast majority of image-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies
   of cerebral aneurysms report periodic, laminar flow. We have previously
   demonstrated that transitional flow, consistent with in vivo reports,
   can occur in a middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation aneurysm when
   ultra-high-resolution direct numerical simulation methods are applied.
   The object of the present study was to investigate if such
   high-frequency flow fluctuations might be more widespread in
   adequately-resolved CFD models. A sample of N=12 anatomically realistic
   MCA aneurysms (five unruptured, seven ruptured), was digitally segmented
   from CT angiograms. Four were classified as sidewall aneurysms, the
   other eight as bifurcation aneurysms. Transient CFD simulations were
   carried out assuming a steady inflow velocity of 0.5 m/s, corresponding
   to typical peak systolic conditions at the MCA. To allow for detection
   of clinically-reported high-frequency flow fluctuations and resulting
   flow structures, temporal and spatial resolutions of the CFD simulations
   were in the order of 0.1 ms and 0.1 mm, respectively. A transient flow
   response to the stationary inflow conditions was found in five of the 12
   aneurysms, with energetic fluctuations up to 100 Hz, and in one case up
   to 900 Hz. Incidentally, all five were ruptured bifurcation aneurysms,
   whereas all four sidewall aneurysms, including one ruptured case,
   quickly reached a stable, steady state solution. Energetic, rapid
   fluctuations may be overlooked in CFD models of bifurcation aneurysms
   unless adequate temporal and spatial resolutions are used. Such
   fluctuations may be relevant to the mechanobiology of aneurysm rupture,
   and to a recently reported dichotomy between predictors of rupture
   likelihood for bifurcation vs. sidewall aneurysms. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, the bipolar resistive switching characteristics of the
   resistive random access memory (RRAM) device based on sputter-deposited

   excellent resistance switching behavior with a high resistance state to
   low resistance state ratio of 2.5 order, write/erase endurance of about
   1.5 order, and long retention time of 10(4) s at 85 degrees C. In
   addition, the device was investigated to achieve multilevel operation,
   which could increase storage density for next generation memory
   application. It was also found that the polarity of the forming process
   would not influence the resistive switching characteristic but would
   affect the first reset process behavior. The switching behavior could be
   regarded as the oxygen redox near the TiN interface. However, the first
   reset behavior of negative forming process was related to the oxygen
   concentration gradients near the Pt electrode and the Joule heating
   enhanced oxidation. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When transition metal oxides are used in practical applications, such as
   organic electronics or heterogeneous catalysis, they often must be in
   contact with a metal. Metal contacts can affect an oxide's chemical and
   electronic properties within the first few nanometers of the contact,
   resulting in changes to an oxide's chemical reactivity, conductivity,
   and energy-level alignment properties. These effects can alter an
   oxide's ability to perform its intended function. Thus, the choice of
   contacting metal becomes an important design consideration when
   tailoring the properties of transition-metal oxide thin films or
   nanoparticles. Here, metal/metal-oxide interfaces involving a widely
   used oxide in organic electronics, MoO3, are examined. It is
   demonstrated that metal contacts tend to reduce the Mo6+ cation to lower
   oxidation states and, consequently, alter MoO3s valence electronic
   structure and work function when the oxide layer is very thin (less than
   10 nm). MoO3 becomes semimetallic and has a lower work function near
   metal contacts. The observed behavior is attributed to two causes: 1)
   charge transfer from the metal Fermi level into MoO3s low-lying
   conduction band and 2) an oxidation-reduction reaction between the metal
   and MoO3 that results in oxidation of the metal and reduction of MoO3.
   These results illustrate how interfaces are important to an oxide's
   ability to provide energy-level alignment.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel bidirectional modular multilevel dc-dc converter
   is proposed. The proposed topology, named the Triangular Modular
   Multilevel dc-dc Converter (TMMC), can achieve equal power sharing among
   its modules over a broad range of conversion ratios. The proposed
   control algorithm provides localized control of modules which enhances
   the converter's dynamic performance and design flexibility. A 1.1kW
   experimental implementation of the converter is shown to achieve an
   efficiency of 96.3\% and 98.0\% in step-up and step-down modes,
   respectively. The TMMC also provides multiple fixed voltage nodes which
   makes it suitable as a multi-input multi-output converter.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a power flow controller that can be deployed to
   interconnect DC networks of different or similar voltage levels and
   manage the power flow between them. Its key features include: 1)
   bidirectional power flow 2) both step-up and step-down operation and 3)
   bidirectional fault blocking similar to a DC circuit breaker. Moreover,
   its modular architecture makes it aptly suited for high-voltage DC
   (HVDC) applications. The kernel of the power flow controller is a new
   class of single-stage bidirectional DC/DC converters utilizing
   interleaved strings of cascaded submodules. The converter operation is
   analyzed and a simplified model is implemented in PSCAD/EMTDC. A control
   strategy that ensures steady-state power balance of each submodule
   capacitor via circulating AC currents is introduced. Simulation results
   validate the converter's principle of operation and the proposed control
   strategy.}},

   wearable computer system based on Mann's ``Digital Eye Glass{''} (also
   known as EyeTap) concept developed 35 years ago. Like Mann's ``Eye
   Glass{''}, FreeGlass is based on free and Open Source principles
   consistent with a free and open i-Society. FreeGlass is suitable for
   researchers and creators of AR (Augmediated Reality) Glass,
   LifeGlogging, etc. in the information society. Two example applications
   of FreeGlass are also presented: Reality User Interface; and
   ``ALIBEye{''}, a digital alibi through sousveillance (inverse
   surveillance). We note the potential for FreeGlass to bring about a
   transition from a surveillance society (cameras affixed to land and
   buildings), to a sousveillance-society (cameras held, carried, or worn
   by individuals).
   Important elements of a balanced surlsous-veillance society are also
   presented with a view toward a middle-ground between a surveillance-only
   society where large entities record interactions but forbid individuals
   from keeping their own record of their sensory information, and the
   coming sousveillance society in which individuals are also equipped with
   veillance capacity, and the capacity to capture AND authenticate their

Abstract = {{The segmentation task of 3D ultrasound images has been investigated by a
   lot of researchers, due to the advantage that it provides to
   non-invasively detect internal organs and medical conditions. The
   challenging problems toward the segmentation of 3D ultrasound images are
   the presence of high speckle noise, inconsistent intensity level and
   gaps within walls. We propose a new idea by combining 3D-Snake and
   Level-Set approaches to overcome ultrasound difficulties and maintain
   high accuracy to segment bleeding regions. The proposed approach starts
   with a denosing step. The 3D-Snake is resistive to boundaries'
   discontinuities, and therefore is applied to robustly extract the
   approximation of the volume of interest. Then, the Level-Set approach is
   utilized to increase the segmentation accuracy in a few iterations. The
   parameters of the proposed method are analysed and its segmentation
   accuracy is evaluated and compared with the Level-Set method. The
   obtained results validate the superiority of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, two novel image search mechanisms are introduced and
   compared against the traditional linear approach and one another. These
   feature detection algorithms mimic two natural human search strategies
   which make them suitable for faster feature detection within pixelated
   images. Unlike linear approaches where pixel-by-pixel probing is
   required, these mechanisms provide faster feature detection due to their
   non-linear nature. The proposed algorithms are suitable for various
   feature detection applications, such as face detection, image labelling,
   abnormality detection in medical images, and the like. Raindrop and
   Bouncing mechanisms outperformed the linear approach by 75.2\% and
   89.8\% respectively when tested separately against the linear algorithm.
   Moreover, after conducting extensive experiments with various conditions
   on all three algorithms, Raindrop detected 50.85\% of the features while
   Bouncing and linear algorithms were successful in 35.08\% and 14.07\% of

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present COFFE (Circuit Optimization For FPGA
   Exploration), a new fully-automated transistor sizing tool for FPGAs.
   Automated transistor-level CAD tools are an important part of the
   architecture exploration flow because they provide accurate area and
   delay estimates of low-level FPGA circuitry, which must be obtained for
   each architecture. We show that modeling transistors as linear
   resistances and capacitances as has been done in previous FPGA
   transistor sizing tools is highly inaccurate for fine-grained
   transistor-level design in advanced process nodes. Therefore, COFFE's
   transistor sizing algorithm maintains circuit non-linearities by relying
   exclusively on HSPICE simulations to measure delay. Area is estimated
   with a transistor size-based model that incorporates a number of
   improvements to enhance its accuracy in advanced process technologies
   versus prior methods. In addition to more accurate area and delay
   estimation, COFFE considers more layout effects than prior published
   work by automatically accounting for transistor and wire loads, which
   are computed based on architectural parameters and layout area. This new
   FPGA transistor sizing tool requires only several hours to produce
   high-quality transistor sizing results for an entire FPGA tile; a task
   that would normally take months of manual effort. We demonstrate COFFE's
   utility in FPGA architecture studies by investigating an important new
   architectural question at the logic-to-routing interface.}},

   optimizations, called MuxMap, that target the proposed architecture are
   implemented using a modified version of the mapper in the ABC logic

   block and verify post place and route implementation. Multiple hybrid
   configurable logic block architectures with varying MUX:LUT ratios are
   evaluated across three benchmark suites with both Quartus II and Odin-II
   front-end RTL synthesis tools. Experimentally, we show that without any
   mapper optimizations we naturally save similar to 4\% area post place

   area reduction post place and route while maintaining mapping depth,

   worst-case inputs, allowing accelerator area to be reduced by 28\%, on
   average, while retaining the majority of performance advantages
   associated with a hardware versus software implementation. When inputs
   exceed the range that the hardware accelerators can handle, a software
   fallback is automatically triggered. Optimization of the accelerator
   area is achieved by reducing datapath widths based on application
   profiling of variable ranges in software (under typical datasets). The
   selected widths are passed to a high-level synthesis tool which
   generates the accelerator for a given function. The optimized
   accelerators with software fallback capability are generated
   automatically by our framework, with minimal user intervention. Our
   study explores the trade-offs of delay and area for benchmarks
   implemented on an Altera Cyclone II FPGA.}},

Abstract = {{Common practice for large FPGA design projects is to divide sub-projects
   into separate synthesis partitions to allow incremental recompilation as
   each sub-project evolves. In contrast, smaller design projects avoid
   partitioning to give the CAD tool the freedom to perform as many global
   optimizations as possible, knowing that the optimizations normally
   improve performance and possibly area. In this paper, we show that for
   high-speed tiled designs composed of duplicated components and hence
   having multi-localities (multiple instances of equivalent logic), a
   designer can use partitioning to preserve multi-locality and improve
   performance. In particular, we focus on the lanes of SIMD soft
   processors and multicore meshes composed of them, as compiled by Quartus
   12.1 targeting a Stratix IV EP4SE230F29C2 device. We demonstrate that,
   with negligible impact on compile time (less than +/- 10\%): (i) we can
   use partitioning to provide high-level information to the CAD tool about
   preserving multi-localities in a design, without low-level
   micro-managing of the design description or CAD tool settings; (ii) by
   preserving multi-localities within SIMD soft processors, we can increase
   both frequency (by up to 31\%) and compute density (by up to 15\%);
   (iii) partitioning improves the density and speed (by up to 51 and 54\%)
   of a mesh of soft processors, across many building block configurations
   and mesh geometries; (iv) the improvements from partitioning increase as
   the number of tiled computing elements (SIMD lanes or mesh nodes)
   increases. As an example of the benefits of partitioning, a mesh of 102
   scalar soft processors improves its operating frequency from 284 up to
   437 MHz, its peak performance from 28,968 up to 44,574 MIPS, while
   increasing its logic area by only 0.85\%.}},

Abstract = {{As FPGAs continue to increase in size, it becomes increasingly feasible
   and desirable to build higher performance soft processors. Preserving
   the familiar single-threaded programming model can be done with an out
   of order processor. The ability to execute memory loads and stores out
   of order has a large impact on performance, but this is difficult to do
   because the dependencies between stores and loads are not known until
   addresses are computed. Out of order memory disambiguation is
   traditionally done with CAMs in the load queue and store queue, but
   large CAMs are inefficient on FPGAs. Store Queue Index Prediction (SQIP)
   and NoSQ propose to replace CAMs with store-load forwarding prediction
   and load re-execution.
   We implement four memory disambiguation schemes (in-order, CAM, SQIP,
   NoSQ) on a Stratix IV FPGA and evaluate the area and delay trade-offs.
   We find that CAM area and delay degrade quickly with load/store queue
   size, while SQIP and NoSQ have little degradation with queue size but
   have area overhead for prediction and predictor training hardware. SQIP
   and NoSQ use less area than CAMs beyond 32 and 16 load/store queue
   entries, respectively, and have higher maximum frequency beyond 4
   entries.}},

Abstract = {{ARM-based servers are garnering increasing interest in big data
   processing for their low power consumption. However, they are ill-suited
   for compute-intensive tasks due to their poor processing capability
   compared to the CPUs used in a traditional server. This paper describes
   our early efforts to integrate the processing power of the FPGA with the
   ARM processor inside the Xilinx Zynq SoC. An eight-slave Zynq-based
   Hadoop cluster is built and a customized hardware accelerator for a
   standard FIR filter is implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   hardware acceleration. The Xillybus is used for communication between
   the ARM processor and the FPGA fabric, achieving a bandwidth of 103MB/s.
   The Hadoop cluster is proved to be linearly scalable with different
   input sizes and numbers of slaves. Overall, the cluster achieves a
   3.3-fold speedup compared to a native pure software implementation on a
   single ARM processor and about a 20\% improvement compared to an
   ARM-based cluster without hardware accelerators.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of rocks under dynamic loading are important
   in a whole range of rock mechanics and rock engineering problems,
   including blasting, protective design, explosives storage, rock bursts,
   and earthquakes. Due to the transient nature of dynamic loading, the
   dynamic tests of rock materials are very different from and much more
   challenge than static ones. Since 70's of last century, dynamic rock
   compressive property has been extensively studies, using the common
   dynamic testing device-Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB). However,
   significant progress has only been made in recently years on the
   quantification of various rock dynamic properties, owing to the advances
   in the experimental techniques of SHPB. Several innovative testing
   methods have been proposed and thoroughly validated. With these methods,
   it is now possible to accurately quantify rock dynamic tensile strength,
   dynamic shear strength, dynamic bending strength, and dynamic fracture
   toughness. In 2012, three rock dynamic testing methods-dynamic uniaxial
   compression, dynamic Brazil test, and dynamic notched semi-circular bend
   test-were adopted as Suggested Methods by the International Society for
   Rock Mechanics, through its Commission on Rock Dynamics. By far, dynamic
   rock tests have been predominantly carried out without confinement. In
   regards to the challenges in underground rock engineering, it is
   desirable to determine dynamic properties of rocks under confinements
   and to address the thermal effect on the mechanical properties of rocks.
   Some promising progress has been made in this research line.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its pre-existing microcracks induced by tectonic loading, Barre
   Granite shows obvious anisotropy. The characterization of rock
   anisotropy in fracture properties such as mode-I fracture toughness
   under various loading rates is important to many rock engineering
   applications. To measure both static and dynamic fracture toughness of
   Barre granite, notched semi-circular bend fracture tests are conducted
   with an MTS hydraulic servo-control testing machine and with a split
   Hopkinson pressure bar system. Barre granite samples are prepared based
   on the three principal directions, resulting in six orientation sample
   groups. Pulse shaping technique is used to achieve dynamic force balance
   in dynamic tests. Using an orthotropic elastic material model, the
   finite element method is then used to build up equations to determine
   the mode-I fracture toughness. The fracture toughness increases with the
   loading rate among each group. Define the fracture toughness anisotropy
   by the ratio of the largest fracture toughness over the smallest one at
   a given loading rate. We observe that the mode-I fracture toughness
   anisotropy exhibits a pronounced rate dependence, being significant
   under static loading while diminishing as the loading rate increases.
   The mode-I fracture toughness anisotropy may be understood considering
   the preferentially oriented microcracks.}},

   often associated with Rett syndrome and can be observed in intracranial

Abstract = {{Electroencephalography (EEG) testing in clinical labs makes use of large
   amplifiers and complex software for data acquisition. While there are
   new ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG) systems, few have been
   directly compared to a gold standard system. Here, an ultra-low power
   wireless EEG system designed by Imec is tested against the gold standard
   Neuroscan SynAmps2 EEG system, recording simultaneously from the same
   laboratory cap prepared with electrode gel. The data was analyzed using
   correlation analysis for both time domain and frequency domain data. The
   analysis indicated a high Pearson's correlation coefficient (mean=0.957,
   median=0.985) with high confidence (mean P=0.002) for 10-second sets of
   data transformed to the frequency domain. The time domain results had
   acceptable Pearson's coefficient (mean=0.580, median =0.706) with high
   confidence (mean P =0.008).}},

   Snoring pitch (F-0) contours were found using the robust algorithm for
   pitch tracking (RAPT). The OSA snoring contours showed fluctuating
   patterns as compared to the smoother patterns of simple snorers. This
   suggests that snoring reveals the underlying instabilities of UA tissue

   gave 75\% accuracy in distinguishing the 2 groups.}},

Abstract = {{Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder due to recurrent
   collapse of the upper airway (UA) during sleep that increases the risk
   for several cardiovascular diseases. Recently, we showed that nocturnal
   fluid accumulation in the neck can narrow the UA and predispose to OSA.
   Our goal is to develop non-invasive methods to study the pathogenesis of
   OSA and the factors that increase the risks of developing it.
   Respiratory sound analysis is a simple and non-invasive way to study
   variations in the properties of the UA. In this study we examine whether
   such analysis can be used to estimate the amount of neck fluid volume
   and whether fluid accumulation in the neck alters the properties of
   these sounds.
   Our acoustic features include estimates of formants, pitch, energy,
   duration, zero crossing rate, average power, Mel frequency power, Mel
   cepstral coefficients, skewness, and kurtosis across segments of sleep.
   Our results show that while all acoustic features vary significantly
   among subjects, only the variations in respiratory sound energy, power,
   duration, pitch, and formants varied significantly over time. Decreases
   in energy and power over time accompany increases in neck fluid volume
   which may indicate narrowing of UA and consequently an increased risk of
   OSA. Finally, simple discriminant analysis was used to estimate broad
   classes of neck fluid volume from acoustic features with an accuracy of
   75\%. These results suggest that acoustic analysis of respiratory sounds
   might be used to assess the role of fluid accumulation in the neck on
   the pathogenesis of OSA.}},

Abstract = {{A critical limitation with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)
   approach is the rapid onset of muscle fatigue during repeated
   contractions, which results in the muscle force decay and slowing of
   muscle contractile properties. In our previous study, we demonstrated
   that spatially distributed sequential stimulation (SDSS) show a
   drastically greater fatigue-reducing ability compared to a conventional,
   single active electrode stimulation (SES) with an individual with spinal
   cord injury when applied for plantar flexors. The purpose of the present
   study is to explore the fatigue-reducing ability of SDSS for major lower
   limb muscle groups in the able-bodied population as well as individuals
   with spinal cord injury (SCI). SDSS was delivered through four active
   electrodes applied to the muscle of interest, sending a stimulation
   pulse to each electrode one after another with 90 degrees phase shift
   between successive electrodes. For comparison, SES was delivered through
   one active electrode. For both modes of stimulation, the resultant
   frequency to the muscle as a whole was 40 Hz. Using corresponding
   protocols for the fatiguing stimulation, we demonstrated the
   fatigue-reducing ability of SDSS by higher fatigue indices as compared
   with single active electrode setup for major leg muscles in both subject
   groups. The present work verifies and extends reported findings on the
   effectiveness of using spatially distributed sequential stimulation in
   the leg muscles to reduce muscle fatigue. Application of this technique
   can improve the usefulness of NMES during functional movements in the
   clinical setup.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we investigate the suitability of a manifold learning
   technique to classify different types of emphysema based on embedded
   Probabilistic PCA (PPCA). Our approach finds the most discriminant
   linear space for each emphysema pattern against the remaining patterns
   where lung CT image patches can be embedded. In this embedded space, we
   train a PPCA model for each pattern. The main novelty of our technique
   is that it is possible to compute the class membership posterior
   probability for each emphysema pattern rather than a hard assignment as
   it is typically done by other approaches. We tested our algorithm with
   six emphysema patterns using a data set of 1337 CT training patches.
   Using a 10-fold cross validation experiment, an average recall rate of
   69\% is achieved when the posterior probability is greater than 75\%. A
   quantitative comparison with a texture-ased approach based on Local
   Binary Patterns and with an approach based on local intensity
   distributions shows that our method is competitive. The analysis of full
   lungs using our approach shows a good visual agreement with the
   underlying emphysema types and a smooth spatial relation.}},

Abstract = {{We have applied wavelet phase coherence (WPC) to human iEEG data to
   characterize the spatial and temporal interactions of high frequency
   oscillations (HFOs; >80 Hz). Quantitative analyses were performed on
   iEEG segments from four patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy.
   Interelectrode synchrony was measured using WPC before, during and after
   seizure activity. The WPC profiles of HFOs were able to elucidate the
   seizure from non-seizure state in all four patients and for all seizures
   studied (n=10). HFO synchrony was consistently transient and of weak to
   moderate strength during non-seizure activity, while weak to very strong
   coherence, of prolonged duration, was observed during seizures. Several
   studies have suggested that HFOs may have a significant role in the
   process of epileptogenesis and seizure genesis. As epileptic seizures
   result from disturbances in the regular electrical activity present in
   given areas of the brain, studying the interactions between fast brain
   waves, recorded simultaneously and from many different brain regions,
   may provide more information of which brain areas are interacting during
   ictal and interictal activity.}},

Abstract = {{The study of seated balance and postural control, specifically in
   relation to wheelchair propulsion, has been an area of interest for
   quite some time. In biomedical and rehabilitation research this has led
   to the potential of treatment and prevention of spinal cord and
   musculoskeletal injuries. To date, little study has been done which
   analyzes the activity of lower trunk muscles for seated balance, as
   opposed to upper limb and shoulder muscles. For the purpose of this
   study, motorized rotational movement in the forward and backward
   directions was simulated and the corresponding lower back and abdominal
   muscle activity was recorded by surface electromyography (EMG). A
   comparison of how muscle activity was affected by visual input was also
   conducted. This pilot study was performed on two healthy individuals,
   recording two of their abdominal muscles, and two lower back muscles.
   Electrodes were placed on the right and left rectus abdominis, external
   oblique, thoracic erector spinae, and lumbar erector spinae. Each trial
   consisted of twelve randomized tests that were performed twice on each
   subject. The results showed that the speed of rotational motion was the
   dominant factor in abdominal muscle activity. The results also suggested
   that motion of the subject with respect to the visual display had an
   inhibitory effect on the motion perception. Furthermore, challenges to
   wheelchair patients on a slightly rough terrain were highlighted.
   Finally, the results also suggested that visual effects during
   rotational motion had a small effect on the subject, which was possibly
   caused by placing focus on something else rather than on balance issues.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the first experiment of imaging anisotropic
   impedance using a novel technique called Diffusion Tensor Current
   Density Impedance Imaging (DT-CD-II). A biological anisotropic tissue
   phantom was constructed and an experimental implementation of the new
   method was performed. The results show that DT-CD-II is an effective way
   of non-invasively measuring anisotropic conductivity in biological
   media. The cross-property factor between the diffusion tensor and the
   conductivity tensor has been carefully determined from the experimental
   data, and shown to be spatially inhomogeneous. The results show that
   this novel imaging approach has the potential to provide valuable new
   information on tissue properties.}},

Abstract = {{High frequency oscillations (HFOs), which collectively refer to ripples
   (80-200 Hz) and fast ripples (>200 Hz), have been implicated as key
   players in epileptogenesis. However, their presence alone is not in and
   of itself indicative of a pathological brain state. Rather, spatial
   origins as well as coexistence with other neural rhythms are essential
   components in defining pathological HFOs. This study investigates how
   the phase of the delta rhythm (0.5-4 Hz) modulates the amplitude of HFOs
   during a seizure episode. Seven seizures recorded from three patients
   presenting with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy were obtained via
   intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) from a 64-electrode grid.
   Delta modulation of the HFO rhythms was found to emerge at seizure onset
   and termination regardless of the dynamics present within the seizure
   episode itself. Moreover, the differences between delta modulating the
   ripple or fast ripple may be due to the sleep stage of the patient when
   the seizures were being recorded. Further studies exploring how this
   modulation changes in space across the grid may also highlight
   additional properties of this phenomenon. Its temporal pattern suggests
   that it is a potential iEEG-based biomarker for seizure state
   classification.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) is a practical and economical
   experimental technique that integrates physical testing with computer
   simulation. In this method by dividing the structure into two parts,
   known as the experimental and analytical substructures, and
   synchronizing them, the equations of motion are solved in real-time.
   Thus, RTHS can capture the load-rate dependencies in an accurate manner.
   The implementation of RTHS involves challenges in accurate control of
   experimental substructure, execution of the testing algorithms in
   real-time as well as the synchronization of signals. One of these
   challenges is the measurement errors in restoring force feedback
   resulting from the random electrical noise that is usually inevitable in
   these testing platforms. Since the measured restoring force is used in
   command generation, RTHS suffers from error propagation affecting the
   accuracy and in some cases the stability of the simulation results. In
   this paper, using a recently developed user-reconfigurable
   computational/control platform at the University of Toronto, the effects
   of force feedback errors on the RTHS results will be investigated
   considering a wide range of experimental to analytical stiffness ratios.
   The accuracy of the RTHS results will be assessed using tracking
   indicators that reveal the phase and amplitude errors between the RTHS
   results and exact numerical solutions.}},

   for the three-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference
   channel to three-cell MIMO cellular networks. By extending the notion of
   SACs to three-cell networks we show that when d is an element of Z(+)
   DoF/user are achievable in a threeuser M x N interference channel (IC)
   using linear beamforming, then any DoF-tuple \{d(ij)\}, where d(ij) is
   an element of Z(+) represents the DoF of the jth user in the ith cell,
   that satisfies Sigma(K)(j=1) <= d for all i is achievable in a
   three-cell MIMO cellular network with K users per cell having M antennas
   per user and N antennas per base station (i.e., the (3, K, M, N)
   network) using linear beamforming. When restricted to symmetric DoF,
   this result states that whenever d DoF/user are achievable in a
   three-user M xN IC with d = rs, for some r, s. Z(+), then r DoF/user are
   achievable in the (3, s, M, N) network. Although the DoF achieved using
   SACs is not necessarily the largest possible, they are established
   through a constructive procedure where we show how SACs designed for the
   three-user interference channel can be modified to design transmit
   beamformers for the three-cell MIMO cellular networks. Further, we
   highlight the role played by redundant antennas in reducing the
   computational cost of designing transmit beamformers for interference
   alignment.}},

Abstract = {{We study low-delay error correction codes for streaming-recovery over a
   class of packet-erasure channels. In our setup, the encoder observes one
   source frame every M time slots, but is required to transmit a channel
   packet in each time slot. The decoder is required to reconstruct each
   source frame within a playback delay of T source frames. The collection
   of M transmitted channel packets between successive source frames is
   called a (channel) macro-packet. For a certain class of burst-erasure
   channels, we characterize the associated capacity and develop explicit
   codes that attain the capacity. We recover as a special case, the
   capacity when M = 1, studied in earlier works. Our proposed code
   constructions involve splitting each source frame into two groups of
   sub-symbols, applying unequal error protection and carefully allocating
   source and parity-check sub-symbols within each macro-packet. Our
   constructions are a non-trivial extension of the previously proposed
   codes for M = 1. Simulation results indicate significant gains over
   baseline error correction codes for the Gilbert model for burst
   erasures.}},

Abstract = {{Coordinated resource allocation is a topic of significant interest for
   emerging wireless networks. This paper proposes and examines the
   benefits of coordinated scheduling in soft frequency reuse (SFR) based
   systems. Consider the downlink of a 3-sector-per-cell SFR-based wireless
   backhaul network consisting of N access nodes (ANs), each serving K
   remote terminals (RTs) multiplexed across the K time/frequency zones,
   with frequency reuse one between the sectors. Assuming a fixed transmit
   power, the paper considers the resource allocation problem of optimally
   scheduling each of the NK RTs to one of the NK power-zones, on a
   one-to-one basis, and in a coordinated manner, as opposed to
   conventional systems which schedule the RTs one at a time in an
   uncoordinated way. The paper solves the problem using the auction
   method, which offers a close-to-global-optimal solution. The paper
   further proposes heuristic methods with lower computational complexity.
   Simulation results show that coordinated scheduling offers significant
   performance improvement as compared to non-coordinated systems.}},

Abstract = {{Through contact algebras we study theories of mereotopology in a uniform
   way that clearly separates mereological from topological concepts. We
   identify and axiomatize an important subclass of closure mereotopologies
   (CMT) called unique closure mereotopologies (UCMTs) whose models always
   have orthocomplemented contact algebras (OCAs), an algebraic
   counterpart. The notion of MT-representability, a weak form of spatial
   representability but stronger than topological representability,
   suffices to prove that spatially representable complete OCAs are
   pseudocomplemented and satisfy the Stone identity. Within the resulting
   class of contact algebras the strength of the algebraic complementation
   delineates two classes of mereotopology according to the key ontological
   choice between mereological and topological closure operations. All
   closure operations are defined mereologically if and only if the
   corresponding contact algebras are uniquely complemented while
   topological closure operations highly restrict the contact relation but
   allow not uniquely complemented and nondistributive contact algebras.
   Each class contains a single ontologically coherent theory that admits

Abstract = {{The potential use of selectively transparent and conducting photonic
   crystals (STCPCs) made of ITO and silica nanoparticles as rear
   reflectors in 10 mu m crystalline silicon (c-Si) photovoltaics (PV) have
   been explored. Optical simulations comparing the performance of
   STCPC-reflectors and aluminum reflectors have been performed. The STCPCs
   outperform aluminum reflectors deposited on the crystalline silicon
   surface, but exhibit significantly lower reflectivity than the case
   where a substantial silica film layer is included between the aluminum
   reflector and the c-Si absorber. However, solar cells using STCPCs as
   the rear-reflector are capable of generating a significant amount of
   photocurrent from rear illumination in bifacial PV. An STCPC has been
   fabricated on a 10 mu m c-Si membrane and the reflection and
   transmission spectral measurements demonstrate the expected increase in
   absorption in the red-to-NIR range.}},

   wind power integration through multiple Wind Power Plants (WPPs) on the
   power system transient stability and inter-area power oscillations. The
   Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) topologies considered in this review are
   the Doubly-Fed Asynchronous Generator (DFAG), Type-3 and the
   Full-Converter Unit, Type-4 WTGs. The reason is that these are the
   dominate types in the existing and planned installations of wind power
   generation. Also, the different modeling approaches of the WTGs will be
   reviewed, especially the aggregated generic models approach which is the
   most-likely approach in case of stability analysis of large systems.
   Finally, a review of the different counter measures, implemented through
   the WPPs controllers, proposed to mitigate these impacts will be
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: This study aimed to investigate the effects of speech rate changes
   on kinematic characteristics and stability of speech movements in
   younger and older speakers using electromagnetic midsagittal
   articulography. Patients and Methods: Eight young adults and 8 older
   adults engaged in a series of syllable repetition tasks of /pa/, /sa/
   and /ta/ obtained at self-paced slow, habitual and fast speech rates, as
   well as in a series of metronome-guided speech rates, ranging from 2 to
   4 syllables per second. The kinematic parameters duration, amplitude and
   peak velocity were obtained for opening and closing movements. Results:
   Older speakers were able to increase speech rate to the same degree or
   higher compared to younger speakers in both pacing conditions. Kinematic
   data show that older adults increased duration and decreased peak
   velocity in closing movements of alveolar constrictions at slower rates
   more prominently than younger adults. The results on movement stability
   revealed no differences between age groups. Conclusions: The results
   suggest that an age-related difference in speed-accuracy trade-off can
   be ruled out. Differences in kinematic characteristics point towards the
   possibility that older adults aimed to facilitate a closed-loop control
   system to maintain movement stability at slower speech rates. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Alloy 600 and Alloy 800 are Ni-Fe-Cr alloys used in nuclear steam
   generators. Sulfate is an impurity found in faulted secondary side water
   that can accumulate in crevices in the acidic-to-neutral pH range,
   possibly resulting in acid sulfate stress corrosion cracking.
   Electrochemical measurements were done on Alloys 600 and 800 exposed to
   acid sulfate solutions at 315 degrees C and 120 bar. Results indicate
   that the addition of sulfate significantly increased the corrosion rate
   of both alloys - possibly due to reduction of sulfate resulting in
   impairment of surface passivity by reduced sulfur species. The addition
   of Fe2+ in solution reduced the corrosion rate due to the formation of a
   magnetite film. The corrosion rate and anodic current density of the 800
   alloy were greater than those of the 600 alloy at high sulfate
   concentrations but became comparable at lower concentrations, or with
   the addition of Fe2+. SCC experiments were done and were in broad
   agreement with electrochemical measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Supercapacitors are energy storage devices that have the ability to be
   charged and discharged much faster than batteries but suffer from low
   energy density. In researching the influence of pore dimensions of
   activated carbon to increase energy storage, we reported earlier that
   there can be a significant fraction of charge held in activated carbon
   that has a very long redistribution time constant, at least for the
   carbon source with which we were working. This implies that the energy
   density could be increased if we can understand the reasons for charge
   redistribution. In this paper, the research has been extended to include
   other commercial carbon sources and similar charge redistribution
   phenomenon has been found. The effect of temperature has been studied to
   understand the phenomenon of charge redistribution in activated carbon
   supercapacitors.}},
