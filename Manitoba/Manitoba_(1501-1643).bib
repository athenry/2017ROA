Abstract = {{We show how to efficiently calculate the signal in optical coherence
   tomography (OCT) systems due to the ballistic photons, the
   quasi-ballistic photons, and the photons that undergo multiple diffusive
   scattering using Monte Carlo simulations with importance sampling. This
   method enables the calculation of these three components of the OCT
   signal with less than one hundredth of the computational time required
   by the conventional Monte Carlo method. Therefore, it can be used as a
   design tool to characterize the performance of OCT systems, and can also
   be used in the development of novel signal processing techniques that
   can extend the imaging range of OCT systems. We investigate the
   parameter dependence of our importance sampling method and we validate
   it by comparison to an existing method. (c) 2012 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{In this article, a novel technique for assessment of obstructive sleep
   apnea (OSA) during wakefulness is proposed; the technique is based on
   tracheal breath sound analysis of normal breathing in upright sitting
   and supine body positions. We recorded tracheal breath sounds of 17
   non-apneic individuals and 35 people with various degrees of severity of
   OSA in supine and upright sitting positions during both nose and mouth
   breathing at medium flow rate. We calculated the power spectrum,
   Kurtosis, and Katz fractal dimensions of the recorded signals and used
   the one-way analysis of variance to select the features, which were
   statistically significant between the groups. Then, the maximum
   relevancy minimum redundancy method was used to reduce the number of
   characteristic features to two. Using the best two selected features, we
   classified the participant into severe OSA and non-OSA groups as well as
   non-OSA or mild vs. moderate and severe OSA groups; the results showed
   more than 91 and 83\% accuracy; 85 and 81\% specificity; 92 and 95\%
   sensitivity, for the two types of classification, respectively. The
   results are encouraging for identifying people with OSA and also
   prediction of OSA severity. Once verified on a larger population, the
   proposed method offers a simple and non-invasive screening tool for
   prediction of OSA during wakefulness.}},

   approximated by 13 Fourier harmonics. After normalisation of the size,
   rotation and starting point of the contours, the IEFDs were determined.
   Based on the first three IEFDs, perfect classification was achieved for

   subsolidus grain boundary liquation. A decrease in the magnitude of heat

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{205-210}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We present a systematic investigation on the mechanical properties of
   platinum nanowires with single-crystalline and fivefold twinned
   structures by means of atomistic simulations. The results show that the
   Young's moduli of both types of nanowires are significantly higher than
   that of bulk counterpart. Furthermore, the fivefold twinned nanowire
   generally exhibits a higher elastic modulus than the single-crystalline
   one. The introduction of the twinned structures enhances the yielding
   strength of the nanowires but remarkably lowers their ductility. The
   initiation of the yielding mechanism of the two types of nanowires is
   through a nucleation process and the activity of Shockley partial
   dislocations under external stress. However, due to the obstacle to
   partial dislocations, the twin boundaries have been found to be
   simultaneously destructive, initiating the fracture of twinned nanowire.
   A comparison of the results with those of other fcc nanowires has
   indicated that the nonlinear elasticity and the yielding strain should
   also be responsible for the yielding strength of the nanowires. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Samples of distillers' spent grains were prepared by blending different
   proportions of distillers' wet grains (DWG) with condensed distillers'
   solubles (CDS). Such samples when dried with superheated steam (SS) at
   110, 130 and 160 degrees C showed typical behaviour of drying in the
   falling rate period. The overall moisture diffusivity (D-m) increased
   with a decrease in moisture content under all drying conditions. An
   increase in moisture diffusivity with respect to the SS temperature was
   also observed. For all drying conditions, the values of average
   diffusivities (D-m)(avg) non-corrected for shrinkage ranged from 0.52 x
   10(-9) to 3.08 x 10(-9) m(2)/s. For distillers' spent grains of
   different ratios of DWG to CDS, the decrease in SS temperature from 160
   to 110 degrees C caused a decrease in (D-m)(avg) by 69-82\%. Increasing
   the amount of CDS added to the DWG from 0\% to 100\% caused an increase
   in (D-m)(avg) by 14-35\% for the temperature range tested in this study.
   The values of (D-m)(avg) corrected for shrinkage ranged from 0.17 x
   10(-9) to 0.86 x 10(-9) m(2)/s for all drying conditions studied. The
   decrease in SS temperature from 160 to 110 degrees C caused a decrease
   in (D-m)(avg) by 70-74\%. Not much differences were observed for the
   same drying temperatures and different ratios of DWG to CDS. The
   differences between the values of average overall moisture diffusivity
   (D-m)(avg) corrected and non-corrected for shrinkage were significant,
   nearly one order of magnitude. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{During storage, grain can experience significant degradation in quality
   due to a variety of physical, chemical, and biological interactions.
   Most commonly, these losses are associated with insects or fungi.
   Continuous monitoring and an ability to differentiate between sources of
   spoilage are critical for rapid and effective intervention to minimize
   deterioration or losses. Therefore, there is a keen interest in
   developing a straightforward, cost-effective, and efficient method for
   monitoring of stored grain. Sensor arrays are currently used for
   classifying liquors, perfumes, and the quality of food products by
   mimicking the mammalian olfactory system. The use of this technology for
   monitoring of stored grain and identification of the source of spoilage
   is a new application, which has the potential for broad impact. The main
   focus of the work described herein is on the fabrication and
   optimization of a carbon black (CB) polymer sensor array to monitor
   stored grain model volatiles associated with insect secretions (benzene
   derivatives) and fungi (aliphatic hydrocarbon derivatives). Various
   methods of statistical analysis (RSD, PCA, LDA, t test) were used to
   select polymers for the array that were optimum for distinguishing
   between important compound classes (quinones, alcohols) and to minimize
   the sensitivity for other parameters such as humidity. The performance
   of the developed sensor array was satisfactory to demonstrate
   identification and separation of stored grain model volatiles at ambient
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder predominantly
   caused by mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2. A primary feature of the
   syndrome is the impaired maturation and maintenance of excitatory
   synapses in the central nervous system (CNS). Different RTT mouse models
   have shown that particular Mecp2 mutations have highly variable effects
   on neuronal architecture. Distinguishing MeCP2 mutant cellular
   phenotypes therefore demands analysis of specific mutations in
   well-defined neuronal subpopulations. We examined a transgenically
   labeled subset of cortical neurons in YFP-H mice crossed with the
   Mecp2(tm1.1Jae) mutant line. YFP+ Layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the motor
   cortex of wildtype and hemizygous mutant male mice were examined for
   differences in dendrite morphology and spine density. Total basal
   dendritic length was decreased by 18.6\% due to both shorter dendrites
   and reduced branching proximal to the soma. Tangential dendrite lengths
   in the apical tuft were reduced by up to 26.6\%. Spine density was
   reduced by 47.4\% in the apical tuft and 54.5\% in secondary apical
   dendrites, but remained unaffected in primary apical and proximal basal
   dendrites. We also found that MeCP2 mutation reduced the number of YFP+
   cells in YFP-H mice by up to 72\% in various cortical regions without
   affecting the intensity of YFP expression in individual cells. Our
   results support the view that the effects of MeCP2 mutation are highly
   context-dependent and cannot be generalized across mutation types and
   cell populations.}},

Abstract = {{An analytic model for the primary feed of offset reflector antennas is
   presented that facilitates a more general investigation of the cross
   polarization reduction in both asymmetric and inter-cardinal planes. It
   includes both first and second order azimuthal modes, primarily the TE11
   and TE21 type modes, and allows selection of symmetric and asymmetrical
   patterns, with different field tapers in the principal planes. Using
   this model first the influence of the second order TE21 mode on the
   cross polarization of an offset reflector with a circular rim is
   investigated. Then, the problem for an offset reflector with an elliptic
   rim is also studied. It is shown that minimizing the cross polarization
   in the asymmetric plane does not necessarily reduce it globally, as in
   the inter-cardinal plane it remains high. The procedure for reduction of
   the cross polarization globally and its effects on the sidelobe levels
   of the reflector antenna are also investigated. With the proposed feed
   model, the aperture efficiency of the reflector antenna is improved
   compared with a standard Gaussian feed with the same edge taper. Based
   on this study, a dual-mode circular waveguide horn is also proposed and
   designed. Its performance on an offset reflector antenna is studied and
   shown that the cross polarization levels are reduced quite
   satisfactorily within a respectable frequency band.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical electron microscopy and spectroscopy analyses of the fusion
   zone (FZ) microstructure in autogenous laser beam welded Haynes 282 (HY
   282) superalloy were performed. The micro-segregation patterns observed
   in the FZ indicate that Co, Cr and Al exhibited a nearly uniform
   distribution between the dendrite core and interdendritic regions while
   Ti and Mo were rejected into the interdendritic liquid during the weld
   solidification. Transmission electron diffraction analysis and energy
   dispersive X-ray microanalysis revealed the second phase particles
   formed along the FZ interdendritic region to be Ti-Mo rich MC-type
   carbide particles. Weld FZ solidification cracking, which is sometimes
   associated with the formation of gamma-gamma' eutectic in gamma'
   precipitation strengthened nickel-base superalloys, was not observed in
   the HY 282 superalloy. Modified primary solidification path due to
   carbon addition in the newly developed superalloy is used to explain
   preclusion of weld FZ solidification cracking in the material. (C) 2011

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Current breathing flow estimation methods use tracheal breath sounds,
   but one step of the process, `breath phase (inspiration/expiration)
   detection', is done by either assuming alternating breath phases or
   using a second acoustic channel of lung sounds. The alternating
   assumption is unreliable for long recordings, non-breathing events, such
   as apnea, swallow or cough change the alternating nature of the phases.
   Using lung sounds intensity requires the addition of a secondary channel
   and the associated labor. Hence, an automatic and accurate method for
   breath-phase detection using only tracheal sounds would be of great
   benefit. We present a method using several breath sound parameters to
   differentiate between the two respiratory phases. The proposed method is
   novel and independent of flow level; it requires only one prior-and one
   post-breath sound segment to identify the phase. The proposed method was
   tested on data from 93 healthy individuals, without any history of
   pulmonary diseases breathing at 4 different flow levels. The most
   prominent features were from the duration, volume and shape of the sound
   envelope. This method has shown an accuracy of 95.6\% with 95.5\%
   sensitivity and 95.6\% specificity for breath-phase identification
   without assuming breath-phase-alteration and/or using any other
   information.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, silk sericin nanofibers from sericin hope-silkworm, whose
   cocoons consist almost exclusively of sericin were successfully prepared
   by electrospinning method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used
   to observe the morphology of the fibers. The effect of spinning
   conditions, including the concentration of sericin cocoon solution,
   acceleration voltage, spinning distance and flow rate on the fiber
   morphologies and the size distribution of sericin nanofibers were
   examined. The structure and physical properties were also observed by
   Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG). The optimum conditions for
   producing finely thinner fibrous sericin nanofibers without beads were
   the concentration of sericin solution above 6-8 wt\%, acceleration
   voltage ranging from 25 to 32 kV, spinning distance above 9 cm, and flow
   rate above 0.06 cm min(-1). The mean diameter of as spun sericin fibers
   varied from 114 to 430 nm at the different spinning conditions. In the
   as-spun fibers, silk sericin was present in a random coil conformation,
   while after methanol treatment, the molecular structure of silk sericin
   was transformed into a beta-sheet containing structure. Sericin hope
   nanofiber demonstrated thermal degradation at lower temperature than the
   sericin hope cocoon, which probably due to the randomly coiled rich
   structure of the sericin hope nanofiber. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper proposes distributed joint power and admission control
   algorithms for the management of interference in two-tier femtocell
   networks, where the newly-deployed femtocell users (FUEs) share the same
   frequency band with the existing macrocell users (MUEs) using
   code-division multiple access (CDMA). As the owner of the licensed radio
   spectrum, the MUEs possess strictly higher access priority over the
   FUEs; thus, their quality-of-service (QoS) performance, expressed in
   terms of the prescribed minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
   (SINR), must be maintained at all times. For the lower-tier FUEs, we
   explicitly consider two different design objectives, namely,
   throughput-power tradeoff optimization and soft QoS provisioning. With
   an effective dynamic pricing scheme combined with admission control to
   indirectly manage the cross-tier interference, the proposed schemes lend
   themselves to distributed algorithms that mainly require local
   information to offer maximized net utility of individual users. The
   approach employed in this work is particularly attractive, especially in
   view of practical implementation under the limited backhaul network
   capacity available for femtocells. It is shown that the proposed
   algorithms robustly support all the prioritized MUEs with guaranteed QoS
   requirements whenever feasible, while allowing the FUEs to optimally
   exploit the remaining network capacity. The convergence of the developed
   solutions is rigorously analyzed, and extensive numerical results are
   presented to illustrate their potential advantages.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure of linear friction welds in single crystal (SX) CMSX
   486 superalloy was studied. Gleeble thermomechanical simulation of the
   welding process was also performed in order to understand the
   microstructural changes induced in the alloy during the joining process.
   Microstructural analysis of the welded and Gleeble-simulated specimens
   showed that extensive liquation occurred in the alloy during joining,
   which is in contrast to the general assumption that linear friction
   welding (LFW) occurs exclusively in the solid state. The study revealed
   the application of the compressive load during the forging stage of LFW
   induced rapid solidification of the resultant metastable liquid phase.
   Nevertheless, part of the liquid resulted in a continuous Hf-base oxide
   phase along the weld line. Possible ways of preventing the formation of
   the potentially deleterious oxide film and, thus, improve the prospect
   of applying LFW for the joining of CMSX-486 superalloy are suggested.}},

   charging load is then estimated on an hourly basis for a number of
   electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles with different storage capacities.
   Level-1 and level-2 charging regimes as well as two scenarios for
   charging, namely charging at home and charging at home and work, are
   considered. The load profile is presented as an hourly probability of

   a one-year period using GPS devices installed in 76 representative
   vehicles in the city of Winnipeg, Canada, allow predicting the electric
   load profiles onto the grid as a function of time for future plug-in
   electric vehicles. For each parking occurrence, load profile predictions
   properly take into account important factors, including actual
   state-of-charge of the battery, parking duration, parking type, and
   vehicle powertrain. Thus, the deterministic simulations capture the time
   history of vehicle driving and parking patterns using an equivalent 10
   000 urban driving and parking days for the city of Winnipeg. These
   deterministic results are then compared to stochastic methods that
   differ in their treatment of how they model vehicle driving and charging
   habits. The new stochastic method introduced in this study more
   accurately captures the relationship of vehicle departure, arrival, and
   travel time compared to two previously used stochastic methods. It
   outperforms previous stochastic methods, having the lowest error at
   3.4\% when compared to the deterministic method for an electric sedan
   with a 24-kWhr battery pack. For regions where vehicle usage data is not
   available to predict plug-in electric vehicle load, the proposed
   stochastic method is recommended. In addition, using a combination of
   home, work, and commercial changing locales, and Level 1 versus Level 2
   charging rates, deterministic simulations for urban run-out-of-charge
   events vary by less than 4\% for seven charging scenarios selected.
   Using the vehicle usage data, charging scenarios simulated have no
   significant effect on urban run-out-of-charge events when the battery
   size for the electric sedan is increased. These results contribute
   towards utilities achieve a more optimal cost balance between: 1)
   charging infrastructure; 2) power transmission upgrades; 3) vehicle
   battery size; and 4) the addition of new renewable generation to address
   new electric vehicle loads for addressing energy drivers.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure of alloy 909, a low coefficient of thermal expansion
   Fe-Co-Ni superalloy was examined in the solution treated and over aged
   condition, following a previous communication by the authors on the
   solution treated and commercially aged alloys. In the commercially aged
   alloy, only the Laves and the gamma' phases were observed. With some
   indication, however, of alignment of the gamma' phase along
   crystallograpic directions in the austenitic matrix. This alignment of
   the gamma' phase has been previously reported as a precursor to the
   growth of the e phase from the gamma' phase. Analysis by TEM showed that
   the platelet phase was hexagonal (NiFeCo)(2)(TiNb) with some variations
   in the stoichiometry about 2: 1 ratio. Tensile and hardness testing
   indicated that the presence of the platelet shaped epsilon phase in the
   solution treated and overaged condition was not as effective in the
   strengthening of the alloys as the spherical gamma' in the commercially
   aged and solution treated condition. In addition to the presence of e
   phase, blocky A(2)B Laves phase was abundant, which prevents excessive
   grain growth up to similar to 1040 degrees C}},

Abstract = {{A computational study of mixing process and air entrainment in hydrogen
   turbulent non-premixed flame characterized by strong gradients of
   velocity and density at the inlet section is presented. Different
   approaches for turbulence-combustion interactions are evaluated in the
   framework of RSM (Reynolds Stress Model) turbulence model and the
   computational results are compared to experimental data. The combustion
   models investigated are SLFM (Steady Laminar Flamelet Model) and EDC
   (Eddy Dissipation Concept). Mixing is described by oxygen atom mixture
   fraction and air entrainment is characterized by gas mass flow rate.
   Computational results are compared to measurements in physical space at
   two locations (the first one represent the near-field region and the
   second one the far-field region). At the first station, the results
   showed an overestimation of mixing and air entrainment and an inaccurate
   consumption of O-2 and H-2. In addition, the predictions are found to be
   sensitive to combustion modelling. At the second station, the
   description of mixing and air entrainment is improved and the
   predictions are in reasonably agreement with experimental data. Less
   dependency to combustion modelling is noticed in this location. Further
   analysis of the near-field region based on the turbulence time scales
   revealed that turbulence is not well developed in this region of the

Abstract = {{Rounded stepped spillway experimental results are introduced and

   rounded stepped spillway is characterized by a 3\% increase in the rate
   of energy dissipation. An increase in inception length is observed for
   the rounded spillway conveying small discharges, which indicates more
   flow stability and quicker transition to skimming flow. For high
   velocities (high discharges), increase in the mixed air-water length,
   which prevents the cavitation risk damage, is observed in rounded
   spillway. More inception depth and less training wall height are
   observed for rounded spillway. Training wall height for rounded chute is
   found to be 20\% less than the sharp spillway. Generally, the study
   recommends using rounded steps for initial transition steps or for the

Abstract = {{To analyze the effects of small variations of the electric machine

   technique is proposed, where the material nonlinearity is treated by the

   iteration by superposing the contributions of the given electric
   currents and the polarizations. This computation technique has great
   advantages over the finite element based procedures, namely, the change
   in the rotor position does not require the construction of a new
   discretization mesh, very small airgaps can be taken into consideration
   without increasing the amount of computation, and the calculated
   magnetic field in the air is divergenceless and curlless, thus
   eliminating the introduction of spurious forces. As well, the phase
   voltages and the magnetic forces are easily calculated from the magnetic
   field quantities.}},

Abstract = {{A scheme for bilateral control of hydraulic actuators is developed and

   uniqueness of Filippov's solution to the system are proven. Next, the
   extensions of Lyapunov's stability theory to non-smooth systems and
   LaSalle's invariant set theorems are employed to prove the asymptotic
   stability of the control system. Effectiveness of the proposed
   controller is verified by simulation and experimental studies. It is
   shown that beside stability, the system has good transparency in terms
   of position and force exchanges between the master and slave actuators.

Abstract = {{The applicability of Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) for internal leakage
   detection in valve-controlled hydraulic actuators is investigated in
   this paper. First, the actuator response to structured (periodic step)
   inputs directly applied to the control valve is analyzed. This procedure
   is a representative of an offline diagnosis scheme. Next, the capability
   of the approach toward online applications, whereby the actuator tracks
   unstructured (pseudorandom) position reference inputs in a closed-loop
   control scheme against a load, is examined. The pressure signal at one
   side of the actuator is decomposed into oscillatory functions called
   intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), and Hilbert transform is applied to
   each IMF to obtain the instantaneous amplitude. It is shown that the
   root mean square of the instantaneous amplitude associated with the
   first IMF establishes feature patterns that can be effectively used to
   detect internal leakage and its severity. Experimental tests show the
   effectiveness of the approach in detecting internal leakage values as
   low as 0.124 L/min (representing a reduction of approximately 2.6\% of
   the available flow rate to move the actuator) during offline diagnosis
   and as low as 0.23 L/min (representing a reduction of approximately 5\%
   of the available flow rate to move the actuator) when the actuator
   tracks reference position inputs online. This is done without having
   prior knowledge about the model of the actuator or leakage.}},

   of the electric field at the probe's locations. Each printed-wire probe
   is loaded with five equally spaced p-i-n diodes, in series. We show that
   electric field data collected in this way within the proposed tomography
   system can be used to reconstruct the dielectric properties of an object
   of interest. Reconstructions for various objects are shown. Although the
   results are still preliminary, sufficient experimentation has been done
   to delineate the advantages of such an indirect method of collecting
   scattered-field data for tomographic imaging purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Stacked microstrip square-ring antennas are investigated for circular
   polarisation (CP). Enhancement of axial ratio bandwidth is obtained
   using stacked square rings and applying corner perturbations to both
   parasitic and driven rings. Both negative and positive corner
   perturbations are used and wide axial ratio bandwidths are demonstrated.
   A novel approach is presented, where a combination of positive and
   negative perturbations is adopted in the driven and parasitic rings,
   respectively, which resembles a sequential rotation and offers broad
   axial ratio bandwidth, along with a wide axial ratio beamwidth. The
   effects of finite ground plane on the CP performance of this antenna are
   studied, and methods are presented to overcome the problems associated
   with the degradation of the CP performance because of the finite ground
   plane. The effect of positioning the antenna asymmetrically on the
   ground plane is also studied, which shows that the ground plane symmetry
   is important for the CP antenna. The measured 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth
   of approximately 5.15\% is achieved for dual-layer square-ring antennas.
   The measured right-hand CP (RHCP) gain is in excess of 7 dBic for a wide
   frequency range. The simulation results are in good agreement with the
   measured data.}},

Abstract = {{Low Reynolds number effects on turbulent flows over a backward facing
   step (BFS) in an open channel were investigated. The Reynolds numbers
   based on momentum thickness (theta) and step height (h) are in the range
   590 <= Re-theta <= 1950 and 950 <= Re-h <= 2900, respectively. The
   Froude number based on the approach water depth and freestream velocity
   varied from 0.12 to 0.37. A particle image velocimetry technique was
   used to measure the velocity field. The flow patterns in the
   reattachment and redevelopment regions are qualitatively similar for all
   the three Reynolds numbers studied. The mean velocity profiles in outer
   coordinates do not exhibit significant Reynolds number effects
   downstream of the BFS. On the contrary, the turbulence intensities and
   Reynolds shear stress do not show Reynolds number similarity. As
   expected, similarity with the upstream profile improves with increasing
   streamwise distance from the reattachment point. Data obtained in this
   study were also compared with previous measurements made over backward
   facing step in a closed channel to study free surface effects. The
   results showed that deviation of flow over BFS in open channel from flow
   over BFS in a closed channel is more significant in the immediate
   vicinity of the step.}},

Abstract = {{Passive dynamic walking is a gait developed, partially or in whole, by
   the energy provided by gravity. An improved kneed bipedal walking
   mechanism was designed and built to study passive gait patterns. The
   first aim of this study is to determine if testing a passive dynamic
   biped walker on a ramp is equivalent to testing on a treadmill. Based on
   the small difference between the gait patterns measured on the two test
   platforms, testing on a treadmill is equivalent to testing on a ramp.
   Measurement of the gait parameters were then conducted on the treadmill
   to evaluate the effects of the treadmill angle of inclination, mass
   distribution of the biped, treadmill belt speed and length of flat feet.
   Our experimental results are presented and compared with previous
   experimental and simulation results. Research on passive dynamic bipedal
   walking helps to develop an understanding of walking mechanics.
   Moreover, experimental passive dynamic walking results provide
   information to validate mathematical models of passive dynamic walking.}},

Abstract = {{The accelerated durability test can be achieved by using the GlyghWorks
   software through the process of Mission Profile and Test Synthesis.
   Mission profile comprises a number of load events that simulate the real
   world driving conditions, which contain dynamic information about the
   vehicle. Test Synthesis is accomplished with extracting the information
   on the frequency of the events expected in the service life. The
   challenge of accurately separating the time series signal that correlate
   the load events becomes essential in order to efficiently conduct the
   accelerated durability test analysis. In this paper, a method is
   developed for automatic event identification from a time series based on
   wavelet analysis, clustering, and Fourier analysis, which are applied
   respectively to denoise, cluster and refine the segmentation of
   respective events embedded in the time series signal. The identified
   events and their corresponding data are used to generate the accelerated
   durability testing profiles. A systematic approach of acceleration time
   series generation for the partial test based on the durability testing
   PSD profile will also be shown, and then the created loading profile can
   be directly applied as the driven profile in the lab test. Subsequently,
   method of validation process for the partial test will be introduced.}},

Abstract = {{The operating efficiency of evacuated tubes themselves under varying
   environmental conditions and installation scenarios, independent of
   water and space heating auxiliary equipment, are not readily available
   values. Further, Manitoba specific data has not been established. The
   purpose of this research program was to measure the efficiency of
   evacuated tube solar collectors under various operating conditions
   including: the angle of inclination towards the incident solar
   radiation, heat transfer fluid flow rate, glazing installation, and
   number of evacuated tubes. The operating conditions and configurations
   were chosen to represent realistic or probable installation scenarios
   and environmental conditions. Furthermore, the research aimed to
   identify the suitability of evacuated tube solar collectors to each of
   the scenarios. These design values are of use for appropriate sizing of
   water or space heating systems, system configuration and optimization,
   and calculation of return on investment. The scope of the research
   project was limited to the efficiency of various configurations of a
   32-tube panel, not the entire solar domestic hot water or space heating
   system. Thus, factors such as heat loss in the tubing, solar storage
   tank, and heat exchanger efficiency were not investigated. The findings
   indicated that efficiency varied by approximately 5\% between the
   different collector configurations, as observed from the overlay graph
   of results. When the efficiency of a collector is considered within a
   system it is proposed that effectiveness may be a better measure of
   overall performance.}},

Abstract = {{A control scheme for teleoperation of hydraulic actuators, using a
   haptic device, is developed and experimentally evaluated in this paper.
   In the control laws, the position error between the displacement of the
   haptic device and the hydraulic actuator movement is used at both master
   and slave sides to maintain good position tracking at the actuator side
   while providing a haptic force to the operator. Lyapunov's stability
   theory and LaSalle's invariant set theorems are employed to prove the
   asymptotic stability of the system. It is shown that beside stability,
   the system performs well in terms of position tracking of the hydraulic
   actuator and providing a feel of telepresence to the operator. Proposed
   controller only needs system's pressures and displacements that are easy
   to obtain via on-line measurements. Additionally, the controller does
   not need any information about the parameters of the system. These
   characteristics make the controller very attractive from the
   implementation view point.}},

Abstract = {{Balancing control is important for biped locomotion. In spite of large
   efforts, it is extremely difficult to design balancing control
   strategies for a standing biped satisfying the following three
   requirements simultaneously: maintaining postural stability, improving
   energy efficiency and guaranteeing satisfaction of the constraints
   between the biped feet and the ground. In this paper, a
   proportional-derivative (PD) controller developed from the genetic
   algorithm (GA) satisfying all three requirements is proposed for a
   standing biped, which is simplified as a two-link inverted pendulum with
   one additional rigid foot-link. The simulation results show that with
   the proposed controller the biped can be maintained at the upright
   position with the minimal energy consumption, and the constraints
   between the foot-link and the ground are satisfied during quiet
   standing. By using the concept of Lyapunov exponents (LEs), the
   stability analysis of the controlled biped is provided. Morever
   structural stability of the biped subject to the different control gains
   is also investigated, and parts of the stability regions in the
   parametric space of control gains are identified. The paper contributes
   to the biped balancing control, which is significant to the development
   of biped robots.}},

   key based on its received shares. In certificate-based scheme, channel
   certificate can be constructed by receiving certificate authority shares
   at the cognitive radio. Simulation results show that the proposed

Abstract = {{Pulsatile laminar-turbulent transitional flow in a three-dimensional
   (3D) constricted channel represents a challenging topic and has many
   important applications in bio-medical engineering. In this research, we
   numerically investigate the physics of a physiological pulsatile flow
   confined within a 3D channel with an idealized stenosis formed
   eccentrically on the top wall using the method of large-eddy simulation
   (LES). The advanced dynamic nonlinear subgrid-scale stress (SGS) model
   of Wang and Bergstrom {[}1] was implemented in the current LES approach
   to properly resolve the unrealistic SGS dissipation effects and
   numerical instabilities that are intrinsic to the Smagorinsky type
   dynamic models (DM). The Reynolds numbers tested in the simulation are
   1700 and 2000, which are characteristic of human blood flows in large
   arteries. An in-house 3-D LES code has been modified to conduct our
   unsteady numerical simulations, and the results obtained have been
   validated using two different grid arrangements and the experimental
   results of Ahmed and Giddens {[}2]. The numerical results have been
   examined in terms of the resolved mean velocity, turbulence kinetic
   energy, viscous wall shear stress, resolved and sub grid-scale Reynolds
   stresses, as well as the local kinetic energy fluxes between the

Abstract = {{A practical approach to designing distributed joint source channel
   (DJSC) codes for correlated binary sources using LDPC codes is
   presented. In this approach, both distributed compression and channel
   error protection are achieved by optimally puncturing bits of a
   systematic channel code to match the source correlation and channel
   error probability. This requires the design of a channel code with a
   specific unequal error protection (UEP) property. Towards this end, we
   present a linear-programming based algorithm for optimizing an irregular
   LDPC code for a given level of source correlation and channel noise.
   Experimental results are presented for both binary symmetric channels
   and Gaussian channels, which demonstrate that the proposed DJSC codes
   can significantly outperform the best code found through random search,
   tandem source-channel codes and previously reported schemes based on
   turbo codes when the encoding delay is constrained.}},

Abstract = {{We present a wireless passive sensor for remote in vivo milk pH
   measurement. The sensor consists of a planar spiral inductor connected
   in parallel to a varactor forming a LC resonant circuit. A pH
   combination electrode made of an iridium/iridium oxide sensing electrode
   and a silver/silver chloride reference electrode, is connected in
   parallel to the varactor. As the milk pH changes during spoilage, the
   voltage across the electrodes varies, shifting the resonant frequency of
   the sensor. For in vivo monitoring the sensor is sandwiched between
   dielectric spacers for encapsulation, and to reduce parasitic capacitive
   coupling and eddy current loss. The resonant frequency of the sensor is
   tracked remotely by an interrogator coil coupled to the sensor inductor.
   In vivo measurement shows that milk pH can be monitored with 100 kHz/pH
   sensitivity and 0.12 pH accuracy over 6.8-4.4 pH range.}},

Abstract = {{Prior information is used to improve imaging results obtained using the
   finite-element contrast source inversion (FEM-CSI) of a microwave
   tomography (MWT) dataset collected as part of a forearm imaging study.
   The data consist of field measurements taken inside a prototype MWT
   system that uses simple dipole antennas and a saltwater matching medium.
   Initial images of the 2-D cross-sectional dielectric profile of the
   individuals' arms are reconstructed using FEM-CSI. These initial
   ``blind{''} imaging results show that the image quality is dependent on
   the thickness of the arm's peripheral adipose tissue layer: Thicker
   layers of adipose tissue lead to poorer overall image quality. The poor
   image quality for arms with high levels of adipose tissue is not
   improved by changing the matching fluid's complex dielectric constant.
   Introducing prior information into the FEM-CSI algorithm in the form of
   an inhomogeneous background consisting of an adipose layer surrounding a
   muscle region provides substantial improvement of the image quality: The
   internal anatomical features of the arm are resolved for each of the
   five datasets. Two methods are employed to estimate the arm periphery
   and adipose layer thickness from the blind imaging results: manual
   estimation and a novel image segmentation algorithm based on global
   optimization using simulated annealing.}},

Abstract = {{Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a respiratory disorder with serious
   consequences that is characterized by repetitive cessation of breathing
   for more than 10s often associated with a drop of more than 4\% in the
   blood's Oxygen saturation level. The gold standard for OSA diagnosis is
   full-night Polysomnography (PSG), which is a time-consuming,
   inconvenient, and costly assessment. On the other hand, our team has
   showed that the analysis of tracheal respiratory sounds recorded during
   wakefulness holds promises to be used as a simple and effective tool for
   screening moderate and severe OSA. In this paper, we examine the
   nonlinear characteristics of tracheal breath sounds and the possibility
   to extract features from Higher Order Spectra (HOS) for OSA screening.
   The data used in this study were recorded during wakefulness in two body
   positions, supine and upright, and during mouth and nose breathing. We
   estimated the bispectrum of the sounds in each respiratory cycle,
   calculated the median bifrequencies and the energy of the bispectrum,
   and investigated any statistically significant differences between the
   extracted features in two groups of non-OSA and severe OSA data. The
   differences in the features between body positions and nose/mouth
   breathing were also looked at. One-way ANOVA revealed significant
   differences in the features between non-OSA individuals and those with
   severe OSA. The results encourage the use of these features in future
   studies for OSA screening.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting aspiration after swallows (the entry of bolus into trachea) is
   often a difficult task particularly when the patient does not cough;
   those are called silent aspiration. In this study, the application of
   acoustical analysis in detecting silent aspiration is investigated. We
   recorded the swallowing and the breath sounds of 10 individuals with
   swallowing disorders, who demonstrated silent aspiration during the
   fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) assessment. We
   analyzed the power spectral density (PSD) of the breath sound signals
   following each swallow; the PSD showed higher magnitude at low
   frequencies for the breath sounds following an aspiration. Therefore, we
   divided the frequency range below 300 Hz into 3 sub-bands, over which we
   calculated the average power as the characteristic features for the
   classification purpose. Then, the fuzzy k-means unsupervised
   classification method was deployed to find the two clusters in the data
   set: the aspirated and non-aspirated groups. The results were evaluated
   using the FEES assessments provided by the speech language pathologists.
   The results show 82.3\% accuracy in detecting swallows with silent
   aspiration. Although the proposed method should be verified on a larger
   dataset, the results are promising for the use of acoustical analysis as
   a clinical tool to detect silent aspiration.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report on a new method for potential diagnosis of
   Parkinson's Disease (PD) based on the analysis of the spontaneous
   response of vestibular system recorded by Electrovestibulography
   (EVestG). EVestG data of 20 individuals with PD and 28 healthy controls
   were adopted from a previous study. The field potentials and their
   firing pattern in response to whole body tilt stimuli from both left and
   right ears were extracted. We investigated several statistical and
   fractal features of the field potentials and also their firing patterns.
   One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to select the features
   showing the most significant differences between individuals with PD and
   the age-matched controls. Linear Discriminant analysis classification
   was applied to every selected feature using a leave-one-out routine. The
   result of each feature's classifier was used in a heuristic weighted
   average voting system to diagnose PD patients. The weights of the voting
   system were the (posterior) probabilities calculated by the designed
   classifier to indicate a subject related to a specific class. The
   results show more than 97\% accuracy for PD diagnosis. Given that the
   patients were at different stage of disease, the high accuracy of the
   results encourages the use of vestibular response for PD diagnosis as a
   plausible quick and non-invasive screening tool.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual reality (VR) experiments are commonly used to assess human brain
   functions. We orient ourselves in an environment by computing precise
   self-to-object spatial relations (egocentric orientation) as well as
   object-to-object spatial relations (allocentric orientation). Egocentric
   orientation involves cues that depend on the position of the observer
   (i.e. left-right, front-behind), whereas allocentric orientation is
   maintained through the use of environmental features such as landmarks.
   As such, allocentric orientation involves short-term memory, whereas
   egocentric orientation does not. This paper presents a Virtual Reality
   Navigational (VRN) experiment specifically designed to assess egocentric
   spatial cognition. The design aimed to minimize the effect of spatial
   cues or landmarks for human navigation in a naturalistic VR environment.
   The VRN experiment designed for this study, called the Virtual House, is
   a symmetric three story cubic building, with 3 windows on each side on
   every floor, and one entrance on each side of the building. In each
   trial, a window is marked by a pseudo-random sequence as the objective.
   The marked window is shown to the participant from an outdoor view. The
   task is to reach the objective window using the shortest path through
   the building. The experiment entails 2 sets of 8 trials to cover all
   possibilities. The participants' performance error is measured by the
   difference between their traversed distance trajectory and the shortest
   natural distance (calculated using the VR engine), normalized by the
   shortest distance, in each trial. Fifty-two cognitively healthy adults
   participated in the study. The results show no learning effect during
   the 16 trails, implying that the experiment does not rely on short-term
   memory. Furthermore, the subjects' normalized performance error showed
   an almost linear increase with age, implying that egocentric spatial
   cognition ability declines with age.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the performance of a wide-band cognitive radio
   network where each cognitive user can assemble multiple primary
   channels. Two channel assembling schemes are considered: a constant
   channel assembling (CCA) and a variable channel assembling (VCA). In the
   variable channel assembling scheme, cognitive users assemble their
   channels on the basis of the number of detected residual channels that
   are unoccupied by primary users or cognitive users. The effects of
   imperfect spectrum sensing (with false alarms and misdetections) are
   taken into account and it is assumed that spectrum handover is
   implemented in the secondary network. These channel assembling schemes
   are analyzed by using Continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC), and the
   system performance is evaluated in terms of throughput, blocking
   probability, and forced termination probability. Numerical results show
   that channel assembling achieves lower forced termination probability,
   but does not increase achieved system throughput and leads to higher
   blocking probability. They also show that VCA outperforms CCA in terms
   of throughput and forced termination probability.}},

   secondary user in absence of a primary user and hence seen as busy by a
   secondary user that senses the channel. Actual busy channel consists of
   either a primary or other secondary user activity as observed by a

Abstract = {{The problem of decision fusion for cooperative spectrum sensing in
   cognitive radio networks is studied when noisy fading channels are
   present between the cognitive radios (CRs) and the fusion center (FC).
   The CRs perform spectrum sensing using energy detection and transmit
   their binary decisions to the FC for a final decision on the absence or
   presence of the primary user activity. Considering the limited resources
   in cognitive radio networks, which makes it difficult to acquire the
   instantaneous channel state information, noncoherent transmission
   schemes with on-off keying (OOK) and binary frequency shift keying
   (BFSK) are employed to transmit the binary decisions to the fusion
   center. The aim is to optimize the detection performance in terms of the
   achievable secondary throughput in the cognitive radio network. Toward
   this end, for each of the transmission schemes considered, first a
   weighted energy-detector is obtained. Then the detection threshold at
   the CR nodes as well as at the FC, the sensing weights and the sensing
   time are optimized to maximize the secondary throughput.}},

   based on the modulated scatterer technique. Using this technique, we
   demonstrated a novel tomography system by utilizing printed-wire probes

   distance and the interaction of probes-collector in our multi collector

   system with less collectors and more probes. We show the reconstructed

Abstract = {{A capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) array is
   designed as an alternative to conventional piezoelectric transducers. A
   thin silicon nitride membrane is suspended over a bottom electrode on a
   silicon wafer. In the immersion mode, the transducer cell shape and
   dimensions are optimized for an operating frequency of 10MHz. We show
   that the proposed imager array can generate a pencil shape beam with a
   similar to 1.5 degrees half beam width, enhancing the detector
   resolution. A phased array technique is employed to excite multiple
   cells using time-delayed signals to steer the acoustic beam toward the
   object. This eliminates the need to mechanically move the detector,
   simplifying the transducer driving system. Moreover, unlike conventional
   transducers, the pencil beam can be effectively steered over a wide
   range of angles without producing grating lobes, which minimizes power
   loss in undesired directions. This can also improve the signal to noise
   ratio of the imager CMUT array. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd....Selection

   simulation increases drastically. This paper proposes a hybrid CPU-GPU
   environment for fast large scale power systems simulation. In this
   scheme the GPU is mainly deployed to perform the computationally
   intensive part of the simulation in parallel on its built-in multiple
   processing cores, and the CPU is assigned for other sequential jobs like
   flow control of the simulation and storing output data, etc. The
   GPU-based approach is used to simulate a network with 900 Buses, and it
   is shown that the CPU-GPU based implementation is 70 times faster than
   the conventional CPU-based implementations.}},

Abstract = {{Fault detection based on ultrasonic imaging is a common technique used
   in non destructive testing. Correct interpretation of the scans requires
   training so that responses from unwanted echoes such as the background
   are discriminated from echoes corresponding to faults. Thus, enhancement
   in the form of displaying the desired echoes without the background
   response can offer an advantage for detection or further quantification
   of the fault. A fast way to achieve this goal and detect the background
   signatures and isolate them from the fault ones is to use time-frequency
   analysis. When time-varying filtering is used, the tendency is to
   recover the echoes coming from the faults. These echoes are
   reconstructed with no phase distortion because the system is linear and
   the scans c in which the background was cancelled in different specimens
   where faults were located very close to the surface buried within the
   initial pulse response and close to each other deeper in the specimen.
   This technique uses a single reference scan fast enough so that to
   finish the processing earlier than the time required to acquire a new

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss, with numerical
   simulations, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) natural convection laminar flow
   from an isothermal horizontal circular cylinder immersed in a fluid with
   viscosity proportional to a linear function of temperature.
   Design/methodology/approach - The governing boundary layer equations are
   transformed into a non-dimensional form and the resulting nonlinear
   system of partial differential equations are reduced to convenient form,
   which are solved numerically by two very efficient methods: implicit
   finite difference method together with Keller box scheme; and direct
   numerical scheme.
   Findings - Numerical results are presented by velocity and temperature
   distributions of the fluid as well as heat transfer characteristics,
   namely the shearing stress and the local heat transfer rate in terms of
   the local skin-friction coefficient and the local Nusselt number for a
   wide, range of MHD parameter, viscosity-variation parameter and viscous
   dissipation parameter.
   Originality/value - MHD flow in this geometry with temperature dependent
   viscosity is absent in the literature. IN this paper, the results
   obtained from the numerical simulations have been verified by two
   methodologies.}},

Abstract = {{A review has been carried out on the present understanding of weld
   heat-affected zone (HAZ) micro-fissuring, and the role of minor elements
   at the parts per million range, in nickel-based superalloy welds. In the
   first part of the review, the reasons for HAZ micro-fissuring are
   addressed. In the second part, the propensity of minor elements, such as
   boron, carbon, sulphur, phosphorus and magnesium, to segregate to grain
   boundaries and their role in HAZ micro-fissuring are discussed. With
   elemental additions of 12-15 elements, coupled with varying percentages
   of alloying addition and differing heat treatments, the ability to
   clearly define the role of phases, heat treatments and elemental effects
   becomes very difficult. In the review, some trends can be seen to be
   clear, such as the role of second-phase particles, such as carbides
   and/or gamma prime precipitates, but the effects of parts per million
   additions of minor elements, coupled with their synergistic effects,
   remain a much more difficult task. Therefore, whereas some general
   conclusions are made in the review, the synergistic effects of boron,
   carbon and phosphorus on HAZ micro-fissuring in nickel-based
   superalloys, as outlined in the chapter, require careful consideration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an agent based modeling (ABM) study oriented
   towards simulating crowds and movements of agents within a confined
   area. The region of interest is a rectangular room with one or two
   exits, where the sounding of an alarm triggers agents to move towards
   the exit(s). The agent based model is built around a game framework with
   emphasis on visualization of agent behavior. Agent interactions are
   local, well defined and approximate behaviors modeled in other crowd
   simulations. Agents have six behavioral modes, which control the agents'
   target(s), their capacity to make decisions regarding which path to
   take, and their ability to communicate to one another. The initial
   intent was to observe the behaviors during egress where crowding occurs
   at the exit bottleneck. Behaviors of agents leaving are typically as
   expected as all interactions were coded to precipitate the events. The
   accidental or serendipitous behavior was a consequence of extending the
   simulation beyond the observations of crowd formation associated with
   the exodus. It is the visualization afforded by a serious game
   development framework and visualization which facilitated the
   observation of emergent behavior. This accidental emergence or
   spontaneous order was observed and not explicitly controlled or
   programmed.}},

Abstract = {{No-wait flow-shop scheduling problems refer to the set of problems in
   which a number of jobs are available for processing on a number of
   machines in a flow-shop context with the added constraint that there
   should be no waiting time between consecutive operations of the jobs.
   The problem is strongly NP-hard. In this paper, the considered
   performance measure is the makespan. In order to explore the feasible
   region of the problem, a hybrid algorithm of Tabu Search and Particle
   Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is proposed. In the proposed approach, PSO
   algorithm is used in order to move from one solution to a neighbourhood
   solution. We first employ a new coding and decoding technique to
   efficiently map the discrete feasible space to the set of integer
   numbers. The proposed PSO will further use this coding technique to
   explore the solution space and move from one solution to a neighbourhood
   solution. Afterwards, the algorithm decodes the solutions to its
   respective feasible solution in the discrete feasible space and returns
   the new solutions to the TS. The algorithm is tested by solving a large
   number of problems available in the literature. Computational results
   show that the proposed algorithm is able to outperform competitive
   methods and improves some of the best-known solutions of the considered
   test problems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the application of the concept of Lyapunov
   exponents in vehicle lateral stability analysis. The constructive nature
   of the available methods for calculating Lyapunov exponents as the
   `invariant' measure of the dynamics is the main advantage of this
   concept. The vehicle model has two degrees of freedom (2-DOF), and its
   non-linearity is caused by the third-order polynomial expression between
   the sideslip forces on the the tires and the tire sideslip angles. In
   this paper, firstly, the concept of Lyapunov exponents and the standard
   algorithm to calculate them are presented. Then, by applying this
   concept to the case of a straight-line motion, the lateral stability
   region of the vehicle model is estimated. Moreover, the effects of
   driving conditions such as the vehicle longitudinal velocity, road
   friction and steering angle on the stability region are investigated.
   The comparison of the results obtained by the concept of Lyapunov
   exponents with those given in literature by simulation based methods
   verifies the effectiveness of this concept for vehicle lateral stability
   analysis.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL}},

Volume = {{85}},

Pages = {{1952-1966}},
Abstract = {{Balancing control is important for biped standing. In spite of large
   efforts, it is very difficult to design balancing control strategies
   satisfying three requirements simultaneously: maintaining postural
   stability, improving energy efficiency and satisfying the constraints
   between the biped feet and the ground. In this article, a
   proportional-derivative (PD) controller is proposed for a standing
   biped, which is simplified as a two-link inverted pendulum with one
   additional rigid foot-link. The genetic algorithm (GA) is used to search
   for the control gain meeting all three requirements. The stability
   analysis of such a deterministic biped control system is carried out
   using the concept of Lyapunov exponents (LEs), based on which, the
   system stability, where the disturbance comes from the initial states,
   and the structural stability, where the disturbance comes from the PD
   gains, are examined quantitively in terms of stability region. This
   article contributes to the biped balancing control, more significantly,
   the method shown in the studied case of biped provides a general
   framework of systematic stability analysis for certain deterministic
   nonlinear dynamical systems.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of cerebrospinal fluid in mitigating closed head injuries

   Three biomechanical models were constructed. In these models,
   cerebrospinal fluid was considered as a soft solid material, an inviscid
   fluid without intracranial pressure, and an inviscid fluid with normal
   intracranial pressure, respectively, while other conditions such as the
   finite-element mesh, the impact, and the boundary conditions were kept
   the same. The recently developed nearest nodes finite-element method was
   adopted to deal with large deformations in brain tissue. Results
   obtained from the numerical studies showed that cerebrospinal fluid was
   able to remarkably reduce the maximum peak strains, especially the shear
   strains induced by impacts and transmitted to the brain. Cerebrospinal
   fluid with intracranial pressure was able to further buffer relative
   oscillations between the skull and the brain.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a means of collecting and analyzing data related to
   personal social contact networks. A custom application is developed for
   smartphones that support Bluetooth connectivity, as representative of
   the ensemble of many consumer electronic products, to infer users'
   location and proximity to one another, the duration of such proximity
   ('contact'), and GPS-based information. In many instances of testing the
   application in this work, this is augmented by device meta-identity. The
   smartphone application and data storage and retrieval are discussed in
   detail. Preliminary data were collected (device-device proximity,
   proximity duration, and location) in pilot testing on the Blackberry
   Storm and HTC Hero (Android) smartphones. Data are presented as
   distributions and visualization tools for evolving contact graphs,
   including Pareto distributions and power law exponents representing
   face-to-face contacts. Extracted parameters are useful for estimating
   the potential of infection spread (e. g., respiratory illness), where a
   key transmission vector is person-person contact. A variant of the
   standard SEIR individual-based model is developed, with individual
   contact patterns guided by contact distributions extracted from the
   smartphone proximity data. Finally, a detailed agent-based model (ABM)
   of a small community is developed and the spread of an infectious
   disease is simulated. The data from the ABM is then analyzed in terms of
   proximity distributions across various demographic profiles,
   illustrating the utility of the proposed data collection technologies in
   supporting advancing modeling and simulation efforts associated with
   infectious diseases.}},

   due to concerns regarding drying efficiency, various drying methods have
   been proposed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the protein
   content and antioxidant activity of DDG using two different drying
   media: (1) hot air at 150 degrees C and (2) and superheated steam (SS)
   at 150 degrees C. The results were compared to a reference sample dried
   at near ambient air temperature of 30 degrees C. Protein content ranged
   from 15.1 to 16.4\% wb for all samples. With respect to phenolic
   content, ethanolic extraction (3.1-12.9 mg GAE/g) was more effective
   than aqueous extraction (0.87-2.9 mg GAE/g). The DDG samples dried with
   SS had the highest phenolic contents among the analyzed samples (p <
   0.05). Antioxidant activity ranged between 0.32 and 0.44 mg Trolox/g for
   aqueous extracts and 0.54-0.57 mg Trolox/g for ethanolic extracts. The
   results indicate that SS drying can be a suitable method to dry
   distillers' spent grain without the adverse effect on protein and
   phenolic contents.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, we numerically investigate the physics of a pulsatile
   non-Newtonian flow confined within a three-dimensional (3D) channel with
   an idealised stenosis formed eccentrically on the upper wall using the
   method of large-eddy simulation (LES). A new consistent modelling
   approach is proposed to perform LES of non-Newtonian flow by
   implementing the advanced subgrid-scale (SGS) stress model of Wang and
   Bergstrom (2005) in the current numerical procedure. The proposed
   modelling approach for LES resolves the previous conceptual
   inconsistency in modelling the molecular and SGS viscosities, as it
   warrants that both the molecular and SGS viscosities are non-linear
   functions of the resolved strain rate tensor. The Womersley number
   tested in the simulation is fixed at 10.5 and the Reynolds number tested
   is set to 1200, which are characteristics of human blood flows in large
   arteries. An in-house 3D LES code has been modified to conduct our
   unsteady numerical simulations, and the results obtained have been
   validated using two different grid arrangements and reported
   experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{The fate and behavior of natural and synthetic estrogens in wastewater
   treatment processes is currently of increasing concern all over the
   world. In this study, the removal mechanisms of a natural estrogen, 17
   beta-estradiol (E2), and a synthetic estrogen, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol
   (EE2) were investigated in membrane bioreactors (MBRs) with and without
   powdered activated carbon (PAC) addition. The experimental results
   showed that the average removal rates of E2 and EE2 by the MBR without
   PAC addition were 89.0 and 70.9\%; PAC addition in the MBR increased the
   removal rate of E2 and EE2 by 3.4 and 15.8\%, respectively. The greater
   impact of PAC dosing on EE2 removal was due to its greater hydrophobic
   property. Adsorption played a more important role in the removal
   mechanisms of EE2 than E2. Biodegradation was the dominant mechanism for
   the removal of E2 and EE2 in MBRs. Unlike their adsorption behavior, the
   biodegradation rates of both E2 and EE2 were not significantly different
   between the MBRs with and without PAC addition.}},

Journal = {{FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{113-120}},
Abstract = {{Colour quantisation algorithms are essential for displaying true colour
   images using a limited palette of distinct colours. The choice of a good
   colour palette is crucial as it directly determines the quality of the
   resulting image. Colour quantisation can also be seen as a clustering
   problem where the task is to identify those clusters that best represent
   the colours in an image. In this paper we propose rough c-means and
   fuzzy rough c-means clustering algorithms for colour quantisation of
   images. Both approaches utilise the concept of lower and upper
   approximations of clusters to define palette colours. While in the rough
   c-means approach cluster centroids are refined iteratively through a
   linear combination of elements of the lower and upper approximations,
   the fuzzy rough c-means technique assigns variable membership values to
   the elements in the boundary region which in turn are incorporated into
   the calculation of cluster centres. Experimental results on a standard
   set of images show that these approaches performs significantly better
   than other, purpose built colour quantisation algorithms}},

Title = {{NUMERICAL MODELING OF THE FREEZING OF A POROUS HUMID FOOD INSIDE A

Journal = {{NUMERICAL HEAT TRANSFER PART A-APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{62}},

Pages = {{250-269}},
Abstract = {{The conjugate heat transfer problem of food freezing inside a cavity was
   numerically investigated. A vegetable sponge has been considered as a
   food block freezing inside a square freezing chamber due to natural
   convection. The need for specifying the block surface convective heat
   transfer coefficients was eliminated by solving the surrounding cooling
   fluid and, therefore, a comprehensive understanding on heat transfer and
   airflow during freezing can be achieved. The 2-D unsteady Navier-Stokes
   and energy equations were solved using a finite volume method with the
   semi-implicit SIMPLE algorithm. Thermophysical properties of food block
   components were considered to be dependent on temperature, as well as
   moisture and ice content, which has been rarely considered in food
   freezing studies. The specific heat capacity method was employed to
   model the freezing process. The Krischer model was adopted for
   predicting the thermal conductivity of the food, which indicates that
   the model works with reasonable accuracy for humid porous foods. The
   mechanism of natural convection in the cavity was carefully studied and
   the effects of different parameters on the freezing time were examined.
   The food freezing curves were investigated for various Rayleigh numbers
   in the range of 10(4) <= Ra <= 10(6), with different area ratios of A =
   1/16, 1/9, and 1/4, and food initial water contents of X-tw = 0.48,
   0.58, and 0.68. It was concluded that increasing the Rayleigh number
   reduces the freezing time. On the other hand, area ratio and initial

Title = {{Lyapunov stable displacement-mode haptic manipulation of hydraulic
   actuators: theory and experiment}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1313-1326}},
Abstract = {{In this article, a stable control scheme is designed and experimentally
   evaluated for haptic-enabled teleoperated control of hydraulic
   actuators. At the actuator (slave) side, the controller allows the
   hydraulic actuator to have a stable position tracking. At the master
   side, the haptic device provides a kind of ` feel' of telepresence to
   the operator by creating a force that acts like a virtual spring,
   coupling the displacement of the haptic device to the displacement of
   the hydraulic actuator. In free motion, this virtual spring restricts
   the operator's hand to move fast when the slave manipulator is
   behind/ahead in terms of tracking the master manipulator's displacement.
   On the other hand, when interacting with the environment, the
   constrained force imposed on the hydraulic actuator is indirectly
   reflected through this virtual spring force. Extension of Lyapunov's
   stability theory to non-smooth systems is first employed to prove the
   stability of the resulting control system. Effectiveness of the
   controller is then validated via experimental studies. It is shown that
   the control scheme performs well in terms of both positioning the
   hydraulic actuator and providing a haptic feel to the operator. The
   control scheme is easy to implement since very little knowledge about
   system parameters is needed and the required on-line measurements are
   actuator's supply and line pressures and displacement.}},

Pages = {{533-551}},
Abstract = {{The technical and economic assessment of using hybrid energy system for
   electricity generation in rural communities in the south-west of Nigeria
   is investigated in this study. Renewable resources (wind and solar data)
   in Ibadan located on the latitude of 7.43 degrees N and longitude 3.91
   degrees E are used. Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable
   software has been employed to carry out the present study. It was found
   that Wind-PV-Generator-Battery hybrid system is most suitable option as
   stand-alone electricity generating system in Ibadan. The optimal
   simulation results indicate that the levelised cost of energy for this
   hybrid energy system varies between \$0.437/kWh and \$0.606/kWh
   depending on the diesel price. These costs are significantly lower than
   the cost of using diesel generator only (without battery) which varies
   between \$0.607 and \$0.940 per kWh. It was further observed that there
   is a significant reduction in emission produced if hybrid energy system
   is used instead of only generator based energy system. The most suitable
   hybrid systems in other locations in south-west Nigeria can be
   identified from the optimal energy system plots provided.}},

Title = {{Distributed transform coding via source-splitting}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Transform coding (TC) is one of the best known practical methods for
   quantizing high-dimensional vectors. In this article, a practical
   approach to distributed TC of jointly Gaussian vectors is presented.
   This approach, referred to as source-split distributed transform coding
   (SP-DTC), can be used to easily implement two terminal transform codes
   for any given rate-pair. The main idea is to apply source-splitting
   using orthogonal-transforms, so that only Wyner-Ziv (WZ) quantizers are
   required for compression of transform coefficients. This approach
   however requires optimizing the bit allocation among dependent sets of
   WZ quantizers. In order to solve this problem, a low-complexity
   tree-search algorithm based on analytical models for transform
   coefficient quantization is developed. A rate-distortion (RD) analysis
   of SP-DTCs for jointly Gaussian sources is presented, which indicates
   that these codes can significantly outperform the practical alternative
   of independent TC of each source, whenever there is a strong correlation
   between the sources. For practical implementation of SP-DTCs, the idea
   of using conditional entropy constrained (CEC) quantizers followed by
   Slepian-Wolf coding is explored. Experimental results obtained with
   SP-DTC designs based on both CEC scalar quantizers and CEC trellis-coded
   quantizers demonstrate that actual implementations of SP-DTCs can
   achieve RD performance close to the analytically predicted limits.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{192-199}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a two-dimensional physical model was used to evaluate the
   effectiveness of adding baffles and sills at step edges or of shifting
   them from step edges of a 1V:1H sloping, short, sharp- or round-crested
   stepped spillway with an ogee inlet. A comparison between different
   configurations of baffles and sills was carried out with respect to the
   energy dissipation and the flow characteristics. The baffle-shifted
   round-crested spillway gives the smallest discharge required for the
   onset of a skimming flow among all other configurations. The
   baffle-edged chute dissipates more energy than the sill-edged spillway.
   Shifting baffles or sills from the sharp edges decreases the energy
   dissipation. Shifting baffles or sills from the round-crested spillway
   increases the energy dissipation in the range of the discharges studied.
   Empirical equations for energy dissipation are introduced for practical
   application of spillways of comparable similar conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Corrosion is a major problem for civil infrastructure and is one of the
   leading factors in infrastructure deterioration. Techniques such as
   half-cell potential can be used to periodically monitor corrosion, but
   can be difficult to reliably interpret. Wired systems have large
   installation cost and long-term reliability issues due to wire
   corrosion. In this paper an embedded inductively coupled coil sensor
   able to monitor the corrosion potential of reinforcement steel in
   concrete is presented. The sensor is based on a coil resonator whose
   resonant frequency changes due to the corrosion potential being applied
   across a parallel varactor diode. The corrosion potential can be
   monitored externally using an inductively coupled coil. An accelerated
   corrosion test shows that it can measure corrosion potentials with a
   resolution of less than 10 mV. This sensor will detect corrosion at the
   initiation stage before observable corrosion has taken place. The
   wireless sensor is passive and simple in design, making it an
   inexpensive, battery less option for long-term monitoring of the
   corrosion potential of reinforcing steel.}},

Title = {{Wave propagation in graphene sheets with nonlocal elastic theory via
   finite element formulation}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{223}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Abstract = {{A nonlocal elastic plate model that accounts for the scale effects is
   first developed for wave propagations in graphene sheets. Moreover, a
   finite element model developed from the weak-form of the elastic plate
   model is reported to fulfill a comprehensive wave study in the sheets
   and realize an application of the sheets as gas sensors. The
   applicability of the finite element model is verified by molecular
   dynamics simulations. The studies show that the nonlocal finite element
   plate model is indispensable in predicting graphene phonon dispersion
   relations, especially at wavelengths less than 1 nm, when the
   small-scale effect becomes dominant. Moreover, the nonlocal parameter
   e(o)a, a key parameter in the nonlocal model, is calibrated through the
   verification process. The dependence of the small-scale effect and the
   width of sheets on the dispersion relation is also investigated, and
   simulation results show that the phase velocity decreases to an
   asymptotic value with the width of sheets reaches a sufficiently large
   size. As an application of the investigation, the potential of graphene
   sheets as nano-sensors for noble gas atoms is explored by defining and
   examining an index based on the phase velocity shifts in a graphene
   sheet attached by gas atoms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The physical, chemical composition and service properties of imported
   monolithic refractory and locally produced refractory lining materials
   were investigated and compared in this study. The samples were compacted
   in a standard rammer, cured in air for 24 h and oven dried for 24 h.
   They were then heated to temperature of 100 degrees C and characterized
   to determine their refractory properties. These samples were tested for
   parameters, such as bulk density, porosity, thermal conductivity,
   electrical conductivity, refractoriness, permeability, and cold
   strength. The results obtained indicate that local acidic ramming mass
   was found to be a good substitute to imported ramming masses due to
   comparative properties of the former. A fusion temperature of 1620
   degrees C was obtained in the local sample which is equivalent to the
   value obtained for the imported ramming masses. The results of other
   properties show little or no variation between the locally produced
   ramming mass and the imported ones.}},

Title = {{Reducible self-assembled micelles for enhanced intracellular delivery of
   doxorubicin}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{This study developed novel reducible micelles that are approximately 100
   nm in diameter and consist of poly(beta-amino ester)-graft-poly(ethylene
   glycol) amphiphilic copolymers (PAE) with phenylbutylamine functional
   side groups. Our report is unique in the following ways: (1) the
   reductively degradable micelles provide a safe and efficient doxorubicin
   intracellular delivery, (2) the synthesis procedure is a simple and mild
   pathway with a well-defined structure, and (3) the aromatic
   phenylbutylamine side groups increase hydrophobicity and strengthen the
   interaction with doxorubicin (DOX) to improve the drug-loading
   capability. In vitro, micelles exhibit faster release of DOX upon the
   action of dithiothreitol (DTT). Drug-laden micelles present higher cell
   inhibition efficiency in comparison to free doxorubicin, while the blank
   micelles show very low cytotoxicity. The copolymeric micelles show a
   rapid internalization and efficient cytoplasmic doxorubicin release in
   both human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 and human breast
   adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell lines observed by confocal laser scanning
   microscopy (CLSM). The micelle is promising for enhanced intracellular
   drug delivery in tumour cells.}},

Journal = {{NUMERICAL HEAT TRANSFER PART B-FUNDAMENTALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{91-115}},
Abstract = {{A pressure-based coupled solution method based on a finite-volume
   discretization is presented. The method uses a cell-centered co-located
   variable arrangement on a nonorthogonal two-dimensional structured grid.
   The coupled algebraic analogs of the mass, momentum, and energy
   conservation equations for incompressible flow are solved. In addition
   to coupling the mass and momentum equations, the energy equation is
   coupled to the velocities via a Newton-Raphson linearization of the
   energy advection terms. The momentum equations are coupled to the energy
   equation via an implicit temperature in the Boussinesq approximation.
   The convergence behavior of the new method is demonstrated on the
   solution of steady, laminar natural convection in an annulus for Prandtl
   numbers of 0.707 and 13,050 at a Rayleigh number of 1 x 10(6). A
   significant reduction in the number of iterations to convergence is
   obtained with the new method compared to a method with only
   velocity-to-temperature coupling and a method with energy and momentum
   decoupled. An improvement to the new method was obtained by using an
   approach that uses a delayed time-step increase and a modified face
   temperature value estimation.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the movement of liquid manure in soil is essential in
   assessing the agronomic and environmental impacts of manure injection
   and guiding the design of manure injectors. In this study, a
   two-dimensional model was developed to simulate liquid flow in a sandy
   soil following pocket injection. The Hydrus-2D software package was used
   for the model computation. The simulation required the dimensions of the
   soil pocket as an input. Thus, field measurements were carried out to
   determine the shapes of the pockets created by typical rolling tines
   (from an AerWay aerator). Field measurements were also performed on
   liquid distribution zones to evaluate the model. The model domain
   consisted of two materials representing disturbed soil (soil pocket
   area) and undisturbed soil. These two materials were given different
   soil bulk densities and initial water contents. The simulation results
   showed that water movement occurred both laterally and vertically within
   the model domain over time. At approximately 500 s, water movement
   nearly stopped, and the water infiltration zones at this simulation
   point were comparable with some of those measured in the field in terms
   of both shape and dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{A generalized dimensionless model of paddy drying was developed from a
   validated partial differential equation (PDE) drying model using the
   dimensional analysis of Buckingham theorem. This generalized
   dimensionless model considered all drying parameters in an equation to
   predict the grain moisture content during the drying process.
   Statistical parameters, namely, coefficient of determination (R-2),
   chi-square (chi(2)), mean relative deviation (MRD), and root mean square
   error (RMSE), were used as criteria to compare the dimensionless model
   with a validated PDE model. Based on these calculated parameters, it was
   concluded that the generalized dimensionless model fitted reasonably
   well with data from the PDE model and good agreement was found between
   the generalized dimensionless model and experimental drying data.}},

Journal = {{BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{37-43}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Synthetic leachate with different initial concentrations of acetate
   (500-2500 mg HAc/L) and propionate (500-3500 mg HPr/L) was treated with
   active biomass acclimated to landfill leachate under anaerobic
   mesophilic conditions for 72 h. Methanogenesis was observed within all
   samples during the first 48 h. The greatest removal of acetate
   (80-100\%) and propionate (15-35\%) was achieved in tests with initial
   concentrations ranging from 1500 to 1900 mg HAc/L and from 1000 to 1800
   mg HPr/L. Concurrent with the removal of acids, pH increased between 0.3
   and 0.45 units, to above the threshold pH for precipitation of CaCO3.
   Therefore, some 50-70\% of dissolved Ca2+ was removed from solution.
   This study suggests that by using an equalization tank (prior to the
   anaerobic digester) to maintain the acetate and propionate
   concentrations to within their optimum range would help to alleviate
   clogging through the removal of dissolved Ca2+ and maximizing CH4
   production. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed the wind energy potential and the economic viability

   The two-parameter Weibull probability density function was employed to
   analyze the wind speed data collected between 1971 and 2007 by the
   Nigerian Meteorological Agency for seven meteorological stations, in the
   southern part of Nigeria, namely Asaba, Calabar, Ogoja, P-Harcourt, Uyo,
   Benin-City, and Warn. The performance of small to medium size commercial
   wind turbine models of various rated powers ranging from 5.2 kW to 250
   kW were investigated and economic evaluation of the wind energy in all
   the sites was performed using the levelised cost method. The results
   showed that the annual mean wind speeds range from 3.09 m/s at Warn to
   4.15 m/s at Calabar, while the corresponding annual mean power densities
   vary from 23.17 W/m(2) to 56.22 W/m(2). Our analysis demonstrated that
   the wind resource in all the sites considered fall into Class 1 wind
   resource category, hence, they can marginally be considered for small
   scale standalone system for electricity generation. The cost of energy
   production per kWh for the selected sites varies between \$0.090 at
   Ogoja and \$2.118 at Uyo. Moreover, the cost of water delivered varies

   corresponded to the highest factor loading of first principal component,
   was considered to be Significant. Statistical and histogram features

Abstract = {{Identification of the volatile organic compounds released by insects can
   be used to detect insects in stored grains. An attempt was made to
   identify the volatile organic compounds released by Tribolium castaneum

   headspace analysis. Feasibility of the automatic headspace sampler in
   headspace analysis was found to be positive. The amount of volatiles
   produced by T castaneum adults increased with an increase in insect
   density. The concentration of methyl-1,4-benzoquinone:
   ethyl-1,4-benzoquinone; and 1-tridecene released by ten adult insects
   were: 8.5, 9.1 and 10.6 mu g/100 mu L compared to 7, 8 and 4.2 mu g/100
   mu L for five adult insects. Extreme high or low temperature leading to
   death produced very high amounts of volatiles compared to insects kept
   at 35 degrees C. The larvae of the T. castaneum insects did not produce
   any volatiles at ambient condition or at extreme cold or hot condition.
   The C. ferrugineus adults did not produce any detectable amount of
   volatiles even at very high insect density after up to 3 days. The
   results of the combination of T. castaneum and C. ferrugineus insects
   gave the same volatile compounds as produced by T. castaneum insects

Abstract = {{The micromotion at the interface between the polyethylene tibial insert
   and metal tibial tray, in modular total knee replacements, has been
   shown to contribute to wear particle-induced osteolysis and cause
   implant failure. Therefore, studying the design parameters that are
   involved in the backside wear process is an important task that may lead
   to improvement in new total knee replacements. In the present study, a
   finite element model was developed to predict the backside micromotion
   along the entire modular interface. Both the linear elastic constitutive
   model and non-linear J(2)-plasticity constitutive model were considered
   in the finite element model for polyethylene and were corroborated
   against published results obtained from displacement controlled knee
   simulator wear tests. The finite element simulation with the non-linear
   J(2)-plasticity constitutive model was able to more accurately predict
   backside micromotion, while the linear elastic constitutive model was
   not. The developed finite element model (including the non-linear
   J(2)-plasticity constitutive model) was then applied to assess the
   effects of the tibial tray locking mechanism design (dovetails versus
   full-peripheral design) and different levels of interference fit on
   insert micromotion. The developed finite element model, implementing the
   non-linear J(2)-plasticity constitutive model, was shown to successfully
   predict clinical amounts of backside micromotion and could be used for
   the design and development of total knee replacements for the reduction
   of backside micromotion and wear.}},

Journal = {{SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{118}},
Pages = {{117-122}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The discrete element method (DEM) has been recognized as an effective
   tool to simulate soil-tool interactions. However, most existing discrete
   element models were for cohesionless soils, and in those models there
   were limited discussions on selections and calibrations of model
   parameters. In this study, a soil-tool interaction model was developed
   using a commercial DEM software, Particle Flow Code in Three Dimensions
   (PFC3D). In the model, soil particles were defined with the basic PFC3D
   model particles, which consisted of balls with cohesive bonds between
   balls. The model parameters, bond normal and shear strengths, were
   determined based on intrinsic stresses of soil. The most sensitive model
   parameter, ball normal stiffness, was calibrated for two contrast soils:
   coarse and fine soils. The calibrations were performed through comparing
   the draught forces of a simple soil engaging tool simulated with the
   PFC3D soil-tool interaction model and those estimated with the Universal
   Earthmoving Equation. The calibrated ball normal stiffness is 6 x 10(3)
   N m(-1) for coarse soil and 2 x 10(4) N m(-1) for fine soil. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Thousands of sparsely populated communities scatter in the remote areas
   of northern Canada. It is economically preferable to adopt the
   decentralized systems to treat the domestic wastewater because of the
   vast human inhabitant distribution and cold climatic conditions.
   Electro-technologies such as electrofiltration, elctrofloatation,
   electrocoagulation and electrokinetic separation have been applied in
   water and conventional wastewater treatment for decades due to the
   minimum requirements of chemicals as well as ease of operation. The
   membrane bioreactor (MBR) is gaining popularity in recent years as an
   alternative water/wastewater treatment technology. However, few studies
   have been conducted to hyphenate these two technologies. The purpose of
   this work is to design a novel electrically enhanced membrane bioreactor
   (EMBR) as an alternative decentralized wastewater treatment system with
   improved nutrient removal and reduced membrane fouling. Two identical
   submerged membranes (GE ZW-1 hollow fiber module) were used for the
   experiment, with one as a control. The EMBR and control MBR were
   operated for 4 months at room temperature (20 +/- 2 degrees C) with
   synthetic feed and 2 months at 10 degrees C with real sewage. The
   following results were observed: (1) the transmembrane pressure (TMP)
   increased significantly more slowly in the EMBR and the interval between
   the cleaning cycles of the EMBR increased at least twice; (2) the
   dissolved chemical oxygen demand (COD) or total organic carbon (TOC) in
   the EMBR biomass was reduced from 30 to 51\%, correspondingly,
   concentrations of the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), the
   major suspicious membrane foulants, decreased by 26-46\% in the EMBR;
   (3) both control and EMBR removed >99\% of ammonium-N and >95\% of
   dissolved COD, in addition, ortho-P removal in the EMBR was >90\%,
   compared with 47-61\% of ortho-P removal in the MBR; and (4) the
   advantage of the EMBR over the conventional MBR in terms of membrane
   fouling retardation and phosphorus removal was further demonstrated at
   an operating temperature of 10 degrees C when fed with real sewage. The
   EMBR system has the potential for highly automated control and minimal
   maintenance, which is particularly suitable for remote northern
   applications.}},

   Review}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{116-143}},
Abstract = {{Conventional Raman techniques require a continuous-wave laser with
   stabilized wavelength, narrow line width, and sufficient output power.
   Due to their miniature size and low cost, diode lasers are good choice
   as light sources for Raman spectroscopy, especially when compact and
   portable instruments are needed. However, a solitary multimode diode
   laser has certain drawbacks that limit its use for Raman application. To
   circumvent these drawbacks, an external cavity can be coupled to the
   active gain medium of the diode to enhance the laser performance. A
   grating-based external cavity allows the laser to operate in a single
   longitudinal mode with greatly reduced line width and stabilized
   wavelength. This article examines the fundamentals of semiconductor
   lasers to show the necessity of operating diode lasers in an external
   cavity for Raman applications. Two feedback grating-based external
   cavity diode laser (ECDL) designs, viz. Littrow and Littman-Metcalf
   configurations, are explained. Historic and recent progress in the
   development of ECDL devices is reported. An updated summary of
   ECDL-equipped Raman systems applied to fields such as in vivo biomedical
   studies and in situ process/quality control is provided. Topics on
   mode-hop-free continuous scanning, wavelength stabilization, and dealing
   with ambient conditions are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The variation in the shape of cereal grains, namely; barley, oat, rye
   and wheat (Canada Western Amber Durum and Canada Western Red Spring),
   were quantitatively evaluated using principal components analysis (PCA)
   based on elliptic Fourier descriptors. Grain image boundary contours
   were extracted from the digital images of kernels, expressed as
   chain-coded points and then approximated by 13 elliptic Fourier
   coefficients. After normalization of the size, rotation and starting
   point of the contours, four groups of coefficients namely; invariant,
   symmetrical, asymmetric and standardized Fourier coefficients were
   analyzed separately using PCA. The PCA based on the symmetric Fourier
   coefficients captured the shape variability of different grains with
   fewer principal components (PCs) than the rest. Results suggest that the
   major shape variations of grains can be summarized by the first two,
   five, eight and seventeen PCs of the symmetric, standardized, invariant
   and asymmetric Fourier coefficients, respectively, capturing about 99\%
   of shape variations. The effect of growing regions on kernel shapes was
   also studied and results revealed that the shape variability is well
   captured by the PCA of the symmetric coefficients of the standardized
   Fourier descriptors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development and hardware implementation of a

   The classification system was tested using the transient signals
   generated by a real-time waveform playback unit. The test waveforms were
   generated by simulating an actual extra-high-voltage transmission system
   on an electromagnetic transient simulation program. The operation of the
   classification system was further verified using waveforms obtained from
   an actual fault recorder. The performance of the classifier was
   investigated under different practical scenarios, such as current
   transformer saturation, measurement noise, and lightning faults.}},

Abstract = {{The focus is on the development of a multi-band decision-fusion strategy
   for improving the performance of hyperspectral-imaging based fruit
   inspection systems. The goal is to estimate the ratio of the bruised to
   unbruised areas in fruits such as strawberries so that the quality can
   be evaluated by comparing the ratio to a threshold. The challenge,
   therefore, is to accurately segment the edible part of the berry and
   accurately classify the pixels in the edible part as either bruised or
   unbruised. A multi-band segmentation algorithm was formulated to
   generate a mask for extracting pixels in edible region of a strawberry
   from each band in a hypercube. A notable feature of the segmentation
   algorithm is that it is autonomous and does not require prior
   information to select specific spectral bands in different hypercubes. A
   multi-band decision-fusion strategy was formulated to exploit
   information from multiple spectral bands in order to improve the
   classification of bruised-unbruised pixels. Using a sample of 30
   strawberries, experiments were designed to evaluate and compare the
   performance of the decision-fusion strategy with the best uni-band and
   multivariate classifiers. It was shown that the improvement in
   performance using the decision-fusion strategy was statistically
   significant. Finally, it was noted that the formulation of the
   multi-band decision-fusion strategy is quite general and is applicable
   to polychotomous inspection of various other fruits and vegetables. (C)

Abstract = {{Interaction of a moving nanoparticle with a single-walled carbon
   nanotube (SWCNT) is of concern. The SWCNT is simulated by an equivalent
   continuum structure (ECS) under simply supported boundary conditions.
   The moving nanoparticle is modeled by a moving point load by considering
   its full inertial effects and Coulomb friction with the inner surface of
   the ECS. The ECS under the moving nanoparticle is modeled based on the
   Rayleigh, Timoshenko, and higher-order beam theories in the context of
   the nonlocal continuum theory of Eringen. The dimensionless discrete
   equations of motion associated with the nonlocal beam models are then
   obtained by using Galerkin method. The effects of slenderness ratio of
   the ECS, ratio of mean radius to thickness of the ECS, mass weight and
   velocity of the moving nanoparticle, and small scale parameter on the
   dynamic response of the SWCNT are explored. The capabilities of various
   nonlocal beam theories in capturing the longitudinal and transverse
   displacements as well as the nonlocal axial force and bending moment are
   also scrutinized in some detail. The possibility of moving nanoparticle
   separation from the inner surface of the SWCNT is examined by monitoring
   the sign of the contact force. Subsequently, the role of important
   parameters on the possibility of this phenomenon is explored using
   various nonlocal beam theories. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{Various resonant cavity antennas (RCAs) having different metal strip
   gratings (MSGs) as their superstrates are studied in terms of their
   directivity and scanning properties using transverse equivalent network
   (TEN) model in conjunction with the periodic method of moments (MoM). It
   is shown that radiation patterns in E- and H-planes coincide over a wide
   angle range in RCAs when their MSG superstrates are free-standing and
   highly reflective, as reported in the previous literature. However,
   using less reflective MSG or employing dielectric support in the MSG
   superstrate degrades the equality of E- and H-plane radiation patterns.
   Moreover, as the scan angle increases, radiation patterns in E- and
   H-planes become noticeably different. It is elucidated that this is due
   to the angular dependence of the reflection coefficient phase of the MSG
   superstrates. A comparative study is also performed on a few different
   RCAs based on both simulation and measurement results. It is illustrated
   that in practice when the excitation source of the RCA is a probe-fed
   microstrip antenna and the RCA is finite in size, cross-polarization
   increases considerably as opposed to the RCAs having ideal sources and,
   infinite ground plane and MSG superstrate in the transverse direction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents estimations of multi-scale (multi-fractal) measures
   for feature extraction from deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences, and
   demonstrates the intriguing possibility of identifying biological
   functionality using information contained within the DNA sequence. We
   have developed a technique that seeks patterns or correlations in the
   DNA sequence at a higher level than the local base-pair structure. The
   technique has three main steps: (i) transforms the DNA sequence symbols
   into a modified Levy walk, (ii) transforms the Levy walk into a signal
   spectrum, and (iii) breaks the spectrum into sub-spectra and treats each
   of these as an attractor from which the multi-fractal dimension spectrum
   is estimated. An optimal minimum window size and volume element size are
   found for estimation of the multi-fractal measures. Experimental results
   show that DNA is multi-fractal, and that the multi-fractality changes
   depending upon the location (coding or non-coding region) in the
   sequence.}},

Abstract = {{Microfluidic devices provide powerful new tools for quantitative stem
   cell research owing to its advantages in cellular microenvironmental
   control and experiment throughput over conventional methods.
   Particularly, microfluidics is playing a growing role in studying stem
   cell growth, differentiation and trafficking mediated by chemical
   factors such as different growth and differentiation factors and
   physical parameters such as direct current electric fields (dcEF). In
   the present study, we focused on adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and
   we quantitatively characterized ADSCs growth and positioning mediated by
   epidermal growth factor (EGF) and dcEF using microfluidic devices. Our
   results revealed that ADSCs preferentially grow toward the EGF gradient.
   In addition, we showed that ADSCs tend to orient perpendicularly to the
   dcEF. These microfluidics-based results demonstrated the interesting
   roles of EGF and dcEF in controlling ADSCs growth and trafficking.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulation of the interaction between light and tissue is
   important for the design and analysis of many optical imaging
   modalities. Most current simulations are based on the Transport Theory
   of light in a dielectric, and only calculate the intensity of light in a
   volume. These simulations do not provide phase information, which is
   important for many biomedical imaging systems. We are interested in
   obtaining the optical field, magnitude and phase, due to the interaction
   of light with tissue. Therefore, we need to solve the integral equation
   for scalar scattering in a volume of interest. Since the wavelength of
   light is in the order of nanometres, simulation of volumes of more than
   a few millimetres requires intensive computational resources.
   For large volumes, Monte Carlo methods are a suitable choice because
   their computational complexity is independent of the mathematical
   dimension of the problem. Also by a careful selection of the random
   sampling scheme the number of samples needed can be further reduced. In
   this paper we present an implementation of a method to solve Fredholm
   integral equations of the second kind using Reversible Jump Markov chain
   Monte Carlo (RJMCMC). This method could be used to simulate light in
   tissue with very large electrical size, meaning tissue whose physical
   dimensions are much larger than the wavelength of light., by solving the
   integral equation of scalar scattering over a large domain. We
   implemented this method based on RJMCMC and present in this paper the
   results of applying it to solve integral equations of one and two
   dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease continues to be one of the major
   causes of mortality. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of
   atherosclerotic coronary artery disease are dependent on the detection
   of high risk atherosclerotic plaque.
   As age is one of the most important risk factors, atherosclerosis
   worsens steadily with increasing age. Automatic characterization of
   atherosclerotic plaque using the optical coherence tomography (OCT)
   images provides a powerful tool to classify patients with high risk
   plaque.
   In this study we develop an automatic classifier to detect
   atherosclerotic plaque in young and old Watanabe heritable
   hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits, using OCT images without reliance on
   visual inspection. Our classifier based on texture analysis technique
   may provide an efficient tool for detecting invisible changes in tissue
   structure.
   We extracted a set of 22 statistical textural features for each image
   using the spatial gray level dependence matrix (SGLDM) method. An
   optimal scalar feature selection process was carried to select the best
   discriminating features that employ the Fisher discriminant ratio (FDR)
   criterion, and cross correlation measure between the pairs of features.
   Using these optimal features, we formed a combination of 5 best
   classification features using an exhaustive search method. A combined
   feature set was finally employed for the classification of plaque. We
   obtained correct classification rate and validation of 76.67\% and 75\%
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of Lyapunov exponents is a powerful tool for analyzing the
   stability of nonlinear dynamic systems especially when the mathematical
   models of the systems are available. However, for real world systems,
   such models are often unknown, and estimating these exponents reliably
   from experimental data is notoriously difficult. A novel method of
   estimating Lyapunov exponents from a time series is presented in this
   paper The method combines the ideas of reconstructing the attractor of
   the system under study and approximating the embedded attractor through
   tuning a Radial-Basis-Function (RBF) network, which facilitates the
   derivation of the Jacobian matrices for applying the model-based
   algorithm. Simplified as a two-link inverted pendulum with one
   additional rigid foot-link, a standing biped with a Linear Quadrtic
   Regulator (LQR) is selected as a case study. The biped balance system
   has a spectrum including four negative Lyapunov exponents, of which the
   high numerical accuracy derived through the newly proposed method can be
   guaranteed even in presence of the measurement noise. We believe that
   the work can contribute to the stability analysis of nonlinear systems
   of which the dynamics are either unknown or difficult to model due to
   complexities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews recent research studies on the application of the
   nonlocal continuum theory in modeling of carbon nanotubes and graphene
   sheets. A variety of nonlocal continuum models in modeling of the two
   materials under static and dynamic loadings are introduced and reviewed.
   The superiority of nonlocal continuum models to their local
   counterparts, the necessity of the calibration of the small-scale
   parameter, and the applicability of nonlocal continuum models are
   discussed. A brief introduction of the nonlocal beam, plate, and shell
   models is particularly presented. Summary and recommendations for future
   research are also provided. This paper is intended to provide an
   introduction of the development of the nonlocal continuum theory in
   modeling the two nano-materials, review the different nonlocal continuum
   models, and inspire further applications of the nonlocal continuum
   theory to nano-material modeling. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights
