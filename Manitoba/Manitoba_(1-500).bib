Abstract = {{This study presents an analysis of the observed inter-annual variability
   and inter-decadal trends in river discharge across northern Canada for
   1964-2013. The 42 rivers chosen for this study span a combined gauged
   area of 5.26 x 10(6) km(2) and are selected based on data availability
   and quality, gauged area and record length. Inter-annual variability in
   river discharge is greatest for the eastern Arctic Ocean (coefficient of
   variation, CV = 16 \%) due to the Caniapiscau River diversion into the
   La Grande Riviere system for enhanced hydropower production. Variability
   is lowest for the study area as a whole (CV = 7 \%). Based on the
   Mann-Kendall test (MKT), no significant (p > 0.05) trend in annual
   discharge from 1964 to 2013 is observed in the Bering Sea, western
   Arctic Ocean, western Hudson and James Bay, and Labrador Sea; for
   northern Canada as a whole, however, a statistically significant (p <
   0.05) decline of 102.8 km(3) 25 yr(-1) in discharge occurs over the
   first half of the study period followed by a statistically significant
   (p < 0.05) increase of 208.8 km(3) 25 yr(-1) in the latter half.
   Increasing (decreasing) trends in river discharge to the eastern Hudson
   and James Bay (eastern Arctic Ocean) are largely explained by the
   Caniapiscau diversion to the La Grande Riviere system. Strong regional
   variations in seasonal trends of river discharge are observed, with
   overall winter (summer) flows increasing (decreasing, with the exception
   of the most recent decade) partly due to flow regulation and storage for
   enhanced hydropower production along the Hudson and James Bay, the
   eastern Arctic Ocean and Labrador Sea. Flow regulation also suppresses
   the natural variability of river discharge, particularly during cold
   seasons.}},

Journal = {{3 BIOTECH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Solid-state fermentation (SSF) can divert food waste from landfills and
   produce high-value products. This study was aimed to investigate the
   feasibility of using SSF and optimize the conditions of production of
   phytase by Aspergillus ficuum from potato waste. Different parameters
   including pH of the potato waste, inoculum level, moisture content,
   incubation period, temperature, and supplementary nitrogen and carbon
   sources were evaluated. The results indicated that pH, inoculum level,
   and moisture content did not significantly vary phytase production.
   However, different incubation periods, incubation temperatures, nitrogen
   sources, and carbon sources changed the phytase production
   significantly. The ideal and economic conditions for phytase production
   consisted of a normal moisture content (79\%) of potato waste, 1.0 ml
   inoculum size, and normal pH 6.1 at room temperature for 144 h
   incubation time. The highest phytase activity (5.17 +/- 0.82 U/g ds) was
   obtained under the aforementioned optimized conditions. When (NH4)2SO(4)
   was used as a nitrogen source in the substrate, the phytase activity
   increased to 12.93 +/- 0.47 U/g ds, which was a 2.5-fold increase
   compared to the control treatment. This study proposed a novel and
   economical way to convert food processing waste to highly valuable
   products and investigated the optimal conditions of the production of
   phytase during SSF in potato waste.}},

Abstract = {{Flexural strengthening of reinforced concrete using near-surface mounted
   (NSM) fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites is a widely studied
   topic, and a promising technology. However, overlooked applications such
   as prestressed concrete and one-way slabs require further experimental
   investigation and theoretical refinement in order to develop
   comprehensive design guidelines. This paper investigates the behavior of
   prestressed hollow-core slabs strengthened in flexure with NSM carbon
   FRP strip reinforcement. Seven full-scale simply supported slab
   specimens were tested to failure under two-point monotonic load
   configuration. Experimental variables included two different internal
   prestressing reinforcement ratios, and three different NSM strengthening
   reinforcement ratios. This paper examines cracking behavior and modes of
   failure, load-strain relationships, deflections, and strengthened
   capacities. Also, a comparison between experimental results and
   theoretical predictions by relevant Canadian and American standards or

Abstract = {{Decisions made in the early design phase enormously contribute to the
   performance of a product during its life cycle. Since users' preferences
   may change over time, a product design should be revised under the
   preference change. Providing accurate data for designers ensures an
   optimal decision for product design; this research presents a new method
   to assess effects of the quantified changes on product cost and
   development time. In addition, two models to optimize design under
   unexpected disturbances are proposed. Normally, optimal parameters
   require several search iterations in design process before finalizing a
   product. The design time in terms of number of iterations can be reduced
   by adding resources in each iteration using modern control engineering
   methods. However, adding resources will increase the design cost. The
   proposed method in this research minimizes the total product design cost
   and environmental impacts under changes of users' preferences. The
   method is validated using an example of the smartphone design. The
   research novelty is a method of applying quantified changes of external
   disturbances (such as changes in users' preferences) in the design
   process, addressing a real problem in industry, and proposing optimal
   models of products for reduced cost and environmental impacts.}},

Title = {{Road safety performance measures and AADT uncertainty from short-term
   counts}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{186-196}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this paper is to enable better risk analysis
   of road safety performance measures by creating the first knowledge base
   on uncertainty surrounding annual average daily traffic (AADT) estimates
   when the estimates are derived by expanding short-term counts with the
   individual permanent counter method.
   Background: Many road safety performance measures and performance models
   use AADT as an input. While there is an awareness that the input suffers
   from uncertainty, the uncertainty is not well known or accounted for.
   Method: The paper samples data from a set of 69 permanent automatic
   traffic recorders in Manitoba, Canada, to simulate almost 2 million
   short-term counts over a five year period. These short-term counts are
   expanded to AADT estimates by transferring temporal information from a
   directly linked nearby permanent count control station, and the
   resulting AADT values are compared to a known reference AADT to compute
   errors. The impacts of five factors on AADT error are considered: length
   of short-term count, number of short-term counts, use of weekday versus
   weekend counts, distance from a count to its expansion control station,
   and the AADT at the count site.
   Results: The mean absolute transfer error for expanded AADT estimates is
   6.7\%, and this value varied by traffic pattern group from 5\% to
   10.5\%. Reference percentiles of the error distribution show that almost
   all errors are between -20\% and +30\%. Error decreases substantially by
   using a 48-h count instead of a 24-h count, and only slightly by using
   two counts instead of one. Weekday counts are superior to weekend
   counts, especially if the count is only 24 h. Mean absolute transfer
   error increases with distance to control station (elasticity 0.121, p =
   0.001), and increases with AADT (elasticity 0.857, p < 0.001).
   Implications: These results can support evidence-based risk analysis of
   road safety performance measures that use AADT as inputs. Analytical
   frameworks for such analysis exist but are infrequently used in road
   safety because the evidence base on AADT uncertainty is not well
   developed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We recently proposed a novel single-source integral equation (SSIE) for
   accurate broadband resistance and inductance extraction and current flow
   modeling in 2-D conductors. The new surface integral equation is
   advantageous compared with the traditional volume electric field
   integral equation (V-EFIE) used for the inductance extraction, since the
   unknown function is defined on the surface of conductors as opposed to
   the volumetric unknown current density in V-EFIE. The new SSIE is also
   more suitable for the solution of inductance extraction problems than
   the traditional surface integral equation formulations, as it features
   only a single unknown surface function as opposed to having the unknown
   equivalent electric and magnetic surface current densities. The new
   equation also features only the electric field Green's functions unlike
   the previously known SSIE formulations. The latter property makes the
   new SSIE equation particularly suitable to the inclusion of the
   multilayered substrate effect into the inductance extraction model. This
   paper describes the generalization of the new SSIE formulation to the
   case of transmission line models embedded into the multilayered lossy
   substrates. This paper also shows how the matrix sparsity in the method
   of moments discretization of the novel integral equation can be
   exploited to accelerate its numerical solution and reduce associated
   memory use. This sparsity arises due to the skin-effect-based
   attenuation of the fields in conductors' cross sections leading to
   vanishing levels of the matrix elements corresponding to the distant
   interactions. Typical examples of inductance extraction in complex
   interconnects situated in lossy substrate are considered to validate the
   proposed techniques against traditional approaches.}},

Abstract = {{An advanced technique for damage detection in beam structures, using a
   vibration characteristic tuning procedure is developed by an optimal
   design of piezoelectric materials. Piezoelectric sensors and actuators
   are mounted on the surface of the host beam to generate excitations for
   the tuning via a feedback process. The excitations induced by the
   piezoelectric effect are used to magnify the effect of the damage in the
   vibration characteristics of the damaged structure to realize an
   effective damage detection process. To describe the detection process,
   theoretical models of the cantilevered beams with and without tuning
   induced by piezoelectric effect are built first, while the damage is
   represented by a crack at the fixed end. From the established models,
   the natural frequencies of the tuned beams with and without the crack
   are obtained to study the sensitivity of the proposed technique. As a
   result of the tuning process, more obvious changes on the natural
   frequencies due to the existence of a crack are observed. The results
   also indicate a shorter distance from the piezoelectric actuators to the
   crack leads to a higher detection sensitivity. An optimal length of the
   piezoelectric actuators is also obtained for better detection.}},

Abstract = {{The eddy dissipation concept (EDC) model has the ability to incorporate
   detailed chemistry in turbulent combustion, which makes it attractive
   for simulating a wide range of industrial combustion systems. However,
   its application for modeling weakly turbulent reacting flows and slow
   chemistry poses a real challenge. The present study examines the
   influence of the EDC model's coefficients, with respect to turbulent
   flow field characteristics. In order to assess the sensitivity of EDC
   model's constants, simulations of two distinct jet flames covering
   weakly and highly turbulent flow conditions are performed. The
   predictions are compared with published experimental measurements. The
   findings of this study revealed that EDC predictions of the
   characteristics of weakly turbulent reacting flow can be improved by
   changing the model's constants. The study also showed that, in
   comparison with the standard EDC, modifying the model's coefficients
   produced improved predictions of the characteristics of highly turbulent
   reacting flow regions. The conclusions of the analysis carried out in
   this study are used to simulate the gas-phase combustion of a
   small-scale biomass furnace using the EDC model, which is presented in
   the companion paper for this study.}},

Abstract = {{Small-scale grate-firing biomass furnaces suffer from high levels of
   pollutant emissions caused mainly by a low level of air/fuel mixing and
   a short residence time for combustion as a result of their small volume.
   Reliable gas-phase combustion modeling is key for improving the design
   of these systems. The present work describes a computational fluid
   dynamics study of biomass combustion using the modified eddy dissipation
   concept (EDC) model. Part 1 (10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b01947) of this
   study focused on examining the main challenges of the EDC model
   regarding its application for modeling weakly turbulent and
   slow-chemistry reacting flows. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was
   carried out on the constants of the model for modeling non-premixed
   combustion at weakly and highly turbulent reacting flow conditions.
   Using the conclusions of the analysis of part 1
   (10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b01947), gas-phase combustion of a small
   lab-scale grate-firing biomass furnace is simulated in the present paper
   (part 2). The results revealed that the modified EDC model produced
   reasonable predictions of the temperature and gas emissions.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main faults that may happen in electro-hydrostatic systems is
   the actuator internal leakage that occurs due to wearing in the piston
   seal. This paper focuses on detecting the internal leakage using
   multiscale analysis of experimental data measured from an
   electrohydrostatic actuator (EHA) test rig. Multiscale techniques are
   the strong tools in analysis of time series, as they are able to extract
   more useful information about dynamical systems as compared with
   single-scale methods. In this paper, several multiscale measures are
   obtained from the actuator pressure signal of an EHA testbed in both
   healthy and faulty operating modes. The measures are correlation fractal
   dimension, variance fractal dimension, maximal Lyapunov exponent,
   average value of correlation entropy, and wavelet detailed and
   approximation coefficients. Sensitivity of each measure to the effect of
   the internal leakage is quantified by calculating the percentage of
   change of faulty measures with respect to those of the healthy operating
   mode. The percentage of change in the mean value of correlation entropy
   and level five wavelet detailed coefficient indicated that these two
   measures are appropriate indicators to detect different levels of
   actuator internal leakage in EHA systems. In contrast, the correlation
   fractal dimension, the variance fractal dimension, and maximal Lyapunov
   exponent did not exhibit reliable sensitivities to the internal leakage.}},

Abstract = {{This work examines the qualifications recognition and career development
   experiences of internationally educated engineers (immigrants to Canada)
   through the interaction of boundary crossing and liberal fairness ideals
   embedded in the qualifications recognition process. The work explored
   how immigrant engineers experienced boundary crossing, evidence for
   learning at the boundary, and the dynamic tension between immigrant
   engineers' personal transitions within structural commitments to
   standardization and regulation. Data were collected from 18 voluntary
   participants who had immigrated to Canada and completed a qualifications
   recognition process to become registered as professional engineers in
   Canada and who were in active professional engineering practice. The
   data provided evidence of changes to immigrant engineers' personal
   identity and professional practice, where these changes were forms of
   learning that facilitated the boundary crossing from newcomer to
   legitimate participant in the Canadian engineering profession. However,
   the data did not provide evidence of learning as collaborative
   co-development of new processes for all actors - newcomers and long-time
   Canadians alike. Instead, the resilience of the Canadian profession to
   true integration in favour of an expectation of assimilation of newcomer
   practices into the Canadian mainstream was illuminated, due to the
   dominance of foundational commitments in the Canadian qualifications
   recognition processes to liberal fairness ideals as political mechanisms
   of risk reduction and access to the profession.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in air and ground temperatures can lead to degradation of

   Thompson, Manitoba, Canada. Thermistor strings were among several types
   of instruments installed beneath the toe, midslope, shoulder, and
   centerline of the embankment. The principal objective of the research
   was thermal numerical modeling of current and projected future ground
   temperatures in the embankment and its foundation. Measured ground
   temperatures were used with local climate records to calibrate a
   two-dimensional thermal numerical model. Future changes projected by
   climatologists were then used to simulate potential long-term

Abstract = {{Two 4-L anaerobic moving bed-biofilm reactors (AMBBR) with different
   quantities of cubic media (25 and 35\% by volume) were examined.
   Reactors were fed synthetic protein-based feed and both were shown to be
   capable of treating up to 20kg/m3day of chemical oxygen demand (COD),
   achieving 80\% COD removal. Beyond that load the performance began to
   decrease. The maximum biogas production observed was 9.25m3CH4/m3day at
   an organic loading rate (OLR) of 20kgCOD/m3day. The methane composition
   varied between 60 and 70\%. Averaged methane yields of 0.36 +/-
   0.07m3CH4/kgCOD removed and specific removal rates from 0.4 to
   20kgCOD/m3day were achieved. At the maximum OLR above 20kgCOD/m3day, the
   specific surface area activity was calculated as 98 and 75gCOD/m2day in
   the 25 and 35\% reactors, respectively. Kinetic tests performed at the
   maximum OLR revealed that free-floating suspended biomass contributed to
   no more than 2.5\% of the total removal. The reactors were also capable
   of treating brewery wastewater, reliably attaining 80\% COD removal with

Abstract = {{Two test sections along a newly constructed road embankment on peat
   foundations were instrumented to investigate their performance and to
   develop more economical means of construction method. The peat deposit
   in the study area has an average thickness of 4m. One test section is an
   embankment with geotextile only at its base, and the other is with
   geotextile and timber logs (corduroy). Settlements were measured using
   monitoring plates and pins. Ground temperatures were measured using
   thermistor strings. Pore water pressures were measured using vibrating
   wire piezometers. This paper presents the monitoring results of the two
   fully-instrumented sections. Results show that adding timber logs near
   the toe of the slope reduced the settlement of the peat foundation and
   therefore reducing the requirement for fill material to maintain road
   elevation.}},

   distributed according to a spatial Poisson point process. Furthermore,
   we present a comparison methodology for fairly evaluating the energy
   consumption of conventional cellular network from one side and
   relay-assisted device-to-device communication from another side. Results
   suggest that a significant energy saving can be achieved when
   relay-assisted device-to-device communication is adopted for distances
   below a certain threshold. In order to test the analytical framework, we
   perform Monte-Carlo simulations and compare the results with those

Abstract = {{MULASSIS (Multilayered Shielding Simulation Software) is a GEANT4 based
   radiation analysis software for simulating the transport of radiating
   particles through a target material and has been used in predicting the
   radiation shielding effectiveness of homogenous and composite material
   shielding for satellites in Highly Elliptical Orbits (Emmanuel et al.,
   2014; Emmanuel and Raghavan, 2015). In order to validate the simulations
   of radiation shielding effectiveness by MULASSIS and latter's
   applicability to shield design, the radiation shielding effectiveness of
   three materials, Aluminum (Al), Polyethylene (PE) and Carbon Fiber
   Composite (CFC), was studied experimentally in proton and electron
   environments and compared with predictions using MULASSIS. A 70 MeV
   proton beam from a cyclotron source was used to measure the water
   equivalent thickness (t(WET)), a measure of thickness for complete
   absorption of the radiation (also known as stopping range), for the
   three material targets. A 10 MeV electron accelerator was used to
   determine the dose deposited (transmitted TID) on a detector behind the
   three material targets. The experimental conditions were used in
   MULASSIS to predict the stopping range and the transmitted TID. The
   simulated results compared very well with the experimental result within
   7\% for protons and 2-74\% (lower values for shield thicknesses less
   than 10 mm) for electrons, validating the software and its applicability
   to the design of radiation shields. (C) 2016 COSPAR. Published by

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{175-183}},

Abstract = {{A numerical analysis using a commercial CFD code, ANSYS CFX, was used to
   model two-phase flow discharging from a stratified region through a
   small branch of circular cross-section. The purpose of this study is to
   assess the capability of the code in predicting the pertinent flow
   parameters and to generate detailed results that can provide insights
   into some of the flow phenomena. The inhomogeneous, free surface model
   was used and the code predictions were evaluated by comparing results
   with previous correlation equations and experimental data. Results were
   obtained for the critical heights of the interface at the onsets of gas
   and liquid entrainment, as well as the mass flow rate and quality during
   two-phase discharge. Additional results including force balances and
   pressure contours were also analysed to provide insight into the flow
   characteristics just before the onsets of liquid and gas entrainment.
   All results are in good agreement with existing correlation equations
   and experimental data. CFD modelling is therefore a possible tool for
   predicting the correct results for discharging two-phase flow for the
   geometry under consideration; the computation time required to obtain
   converged results, however, was found to be excessive. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Alginate hydrogels have been used in cell encapsulation for many years
   but a prevalent issue with pure alginates is that they are unable to
   provide enough bioactive properties to interact with mammalian cells.
   This paper discusses the modification of alginate with mussel-inspired
   dopamine for cell loading and anti-infection. Mouse bone marrow stem
   cells were immobilized into alginate and alginate-dopamine beads and
   fibers. Through live-dead and MIT assay, alginates modified by dopamine
   promoted cell viability and proliferation. In vitro cell differentiation
   results showed that such an alginate-dopamine gel can promote the
   osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cell after PCR and ALP
   assays. In addition to that, the adhesive prosperities of dopamine
   allowed for coating the surface of alginate-dopamine gel with silver
   nanoparticles, which provided the gel with significant antibacterial
   characteristics. Overall, these results demonstrate that a
   dopamine-modified alginate gel can be a great tool for cell
   encapsulation to promote cell proliferation and can be applied to bone
   regeneration, especially in contaminated bone defects. (C) 2016

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS}},

Pages = {{7-14}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a very fast electromagnetic transient (EMT)
   simulation model for the HVdc modular multilevel converter (MMC) that
   maintains the identity of each switching level, but achieves computation
   speeds comparable to the much simplified averaged-value models (AVMs)
   when simulating the multi-terminal dc grid. Speedup is achieved by
   representing the off state of a MMC sub-module (SM) with ideal zero
   conductance, and representing the converter with a companion model using
   the A-stable Backward Euler (BE) method. Often, the user may wish to use
   the nearest level control (NLC) based voltage balancing algorithm. Then
   additional speedup can be obtained by using an efficient sorting
   algorithm which is integrated into the Thevenin equivalent circuit. This
   achieves a linear speedup (i.e. order O(N)) with system size. When
   compared with a fully detailed simulation (no simplifications), the
   method shows one to two orders of magnitude speed improvement with
   earlier reported fast MMC models, with negligible loss in accuracy. (C)

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-destructive technique that is
   capable of localizing pathologies and assessing other anatomical
   features (e.g., tissue volume, microstructure, and white matter
   connectivity) in postmortem, ex vivo human brains. However, when brains
   are removed from the skull and cerebrospinal fluid (i.e., their normal
   in vivo magnetic environment), air bubbles and air-tissue interfaces
   typically cause magnetic susceptibility artifacts that severely degrade
   the quality of ex vivo MRI data. In this report, we describe a
   relatively simple and cost-effective experimental setup for acquiring
   artifact-free ex vivo brain images using a clinical MRI system with
   standard hardware. In particular, we outline the necessary steps, from
   collecting an ex vivo human brain to the MRI scanner setup, and have
   also described changing the formalin (as might be necessary in
   longitudinal postmortem studies). Finally, we share some representative
   ex vivo MRI images that have been acquired using the proposed setup in
   order to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. We hope that this
   protocol will provide both clinicians and researchers with a
   straight-forward and cost-effective solution for acquiring ex vivo MRI
   data from whole postmortem human brains.}},

Abstract = {{A full-ring PET insert consisting of 16 PET detector modules was
   designed and constructed to fit within the 114 mm diameter gradient bore
   of a Bruker 7 T MRI. The individual detector modules contain two silicon
   photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays, dual-layer offset LYSO crystal arrays,
   and high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI) cables for both signal
   and power transmission. Several different RF shielding configurations
   were assessed prior to construction of a fully assembled PET insert
   using a combination of carbon fibre and copper foil for RF shielding.
   MR-compatibility measurements included field mapping of the static
   magnetic field (B-0) and the time-varying excitation field (B-1) as well
   as acquisitions with multiple pulse sequences: spin echo (SE), rapid
   imaging with refocused echoes (RARE), fast low angle shot (FLASH)
   gradient echo, and echo planar imaging (EPI). B-0 field maps revealed a
   small degradation in the mean homogeneity (+0.1 ppm) when the PET insert
   was installed and operating. No significant change was observed in the
   B-1 field maps or the image homogeneity of various MR images, with a 9\%
   decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observed only in EPI images
   acquired with the PET insert installed and operating. PET detector flood
   histograms, photopeak amplitudes, and energy resolutions were unchanged
   in individual PET detector modules when acquired during MRI operation.
   There was a small baseline shift on the PET detector signals due to the
   switching amplifiers used to power MRI gradient pulses. This baseline
   shift was observable when measured with an oscilloscope and varied as a
   function of the gradient duty cycle, but had no noticeable effect on the
   performance of the PET detector modules. Compact front-end electronics
   and effective RF shielding led to minimal cross-interference between the
   PET and MRI systems. Both PET detector and MRI performance was
   excellent, whether operating as a standalone system or a hybrid PET/MRI.}},

Abstract = {{Flow condition in rivers is highly turbulent and unsteady due to
   upstream structures or geometry of the river. In a hydrokinetic farm
   downstream turbines are subjected to the wake of upstream turbines.
   Operating in the wake not only affects the average power output of the
   turbine but also influences the quality of the power by imposing
   fluctuations to the power. The current study presents the water tunnel
   testing results of a vertical axis turbine operating in the vortex
   shedding behind a cylinder with various sizes located at different
   distances upstream the turbine. The vortex shedding from a circular
   cylinder has similar patterns with vortex shedding from blades of a
   vertical turbine. Results show that for certain sizes of upstream
   cylinder the maximum negative effect occurs when the upstream cylinder
   is 1.5 turbine diameters away. At closer or farther distances the
   negative effect is limited. The frequency analysis of the power data
   shows that when the turbine operates in the wake, the frequency strength
   at the rotational frequency of the turbine and its multiples decreases.
   At the same time, new frequency peaks appear in the power spectrum as
   the result of the vortex shedding behind the cylinder.}},

Title = {{Nonlinear System Identification Technique for a Base-Excited Structure
   Based on Modal Space Formulation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Most of the nonlinear system identification techniques described in the
   existing literature required force and response information at all
   excitation degrees-of-freedom (DOFs). For cases, where the excitation
   comes from base motion, those methods cannot be applied as it is not
   feasible to obtain the measurements of motion at all DOFs from an
   experiment. The objective of this research is to develop the methodology
   for the nonlinear system identification of continuous, multimode, and
   lightly damped systems, where the excitation comes from the moving base.
   For this purpose, the closed-form expression for the equivalent force
   also known as the pseudo force from the measured data for the
   base-excited structure is developed. A hybrid model space is developed
   to find out the nonlinear restoring force at the nonlinear DOFs. Once
   the nonlinear restoring force is obtained, the nonlinear parameters are
   extracted using ``multilinear least square regression{''} in a modal
   space. A modal space is chosen to express the direct and cross-coupling
   nonlinearities. Using a cantilever beam as an example, the proposed
   methodology is demonstrated, where the experimental setup, testing
   procedure, data acquisition, and data processing are presented. The
   example shows that the method proposed here is systematic and
   constructive for nonlinear parameter identification for base-excited
   structure.}},

Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{Para-amino benzoic acid (PABA), a folic acid related metabolite, was
   first introduced to fabricate micro-grooves and improve hydrophilicity
   over surfaces of carbon fibers (CFs). Then, engineered CFs/poly(lactic
   acid)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLA-PEG) biocomposites were fabricated by a
   solvent casting/particulate leaching method. We found that introducing
   small hydrophobic PABA molecules and fabricating patterned structures
   would lead to benign integrated interfaces between CFs and the PLA-PEG
   matrix. Specifically, the compressive strength of CFs/PLA-PEG was
   improved from 3.98 to 5.48 MPa. In addition, the CFs/PLA-PEG
   biocomposites significantly accelerated the adhesion and proliferation
   of pre-osteoblasts with minimized cytotoxicity. By comparing the
   cyto-compatibility of L929 and MC3T3 cells cultured on different
   modified PLA-PEG composites, it could be concluded that PABA-CFs not
   only overcame the limitation of poor strength of PLA-PEG, but also
   improved the cell growth. These results indicate that the PABA-CFs
   reinforced PLA-PEG biocomposites could be a potential alternative for
   tissue engineering scaffolds.}},

Abstract = {{Skin segmentation is a crucial and a challenging step in many face and
   gesture recognition techniques and it has various applications in human
   computer interaction, objectionable content filtering, image retrieval
   and many more. In this article, we propose a novel skin segmentation
   method, which uses multi-manifold-based skin classification of feature
   space skin candidate Voronoi regions to achieve accurate skin
   segmentation. The state-of-the-art skin segmentation techniques reported
   in this article focus on discrimination between textural feature vectors
   belonging to skin and non-skin classes. In contrast, the proposed method
   focuses on discrimination between textural feature vectors belonging to
   skin and skin-like (non-skin) classes, which lead to higher skin
   classification accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a novel image
   segmentation technique based on spatial and feature space Dirichlet
   tessellation (also called a Voronoi diagram) to achieve feature space
   segmentation of skin candidate regions of an image. These feature space
   segments will then be classified using a multi-manifold-based skin
   classifier. The proposed skin segmentation method was evaluated on two
   benchmark skin segmentation data sets and its results were compared with
   four other state-of-the-art methods proposed for skin segmentation. The
   experimental results reported in this article confirm that the proposed
   method outperforms the existing skin segmentation approaches in terms of
   false alarm rates in the skin segmentation process. Also, the proposed
   method results in the lowest minimal detection error compared to the
   existing methods reported in this article. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{A 3-D microwave imaging method within metallic enclosures is
   investigated and improved. This method uses the components of the
   surface-current vector at receiver points on the enclosure wall as data.
   At the metallic wall, the normal component of the magnetic field as well
   as the tangential components of the electric field is negligible,
   whereas the vectorial surface current, which is directly related to the
   tangential components of the magnetic field, is dominant. After
   presenting the results of a numerical investigation based on synthetic
   data, the method is validated using an experimental system comprised of
   24 co-resident shielded, coaxial half-loop antennas, distributed in four
   layers, within a cylindrical metallic enclosure. These antennas are used
   in receiver-transmitter pairs to introduce an electromagnetic field into
   the chamber and collect the magnetic field at the receiver points. The
   measured data are used as input to a multiplicatively regularized
   finite-element contrast source inversion algorithm. Due to their
   relatively small size and minimal protrusion into the chamber, these
   antennas minimally perturb the field distribution inside the chamber and
   thereby allow the use of a simple numerical inversion model, which does
   not need to account for the passive antennas. These attributes are
   especially useful for large computationally intensive industrial
   applications. The experimental system described herein is a
   laboratory-scale prototype for a stored-grain imaging application where
   metallic silos are utilized.}},

Abstract = {{Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have a significant role in urban
   systems' serviceability. These infrastructures, especially in coastal
   regions, are vulnerable to flooding. To minimize vulnerability, a better
   understanding of flood risk must be realized. To quantify the extent of
   efforts for flood risk management, a unified index is needed for
   evaluating resiliency as a key concept in understanding vulnerability.
   Here, a framework is developed to evaluate the resiliency of WWTPs in
   coastal areas of New York City. An analysis of the current understanding
   of vulnerability is performed and a new perspective utilizing different
   components including resourcefulness, robustness, rapidity, and
   redundancy is presented to quantify resiliency using a multi-criteria
   decision-making (MCDM) technique. To investigate the effect of certain
   factors of WWTPs on resiliency, uncertainty analysis is also
   incorporated in developing the framework. As a result, rather than a
   single value, a range of variation for each WWTP's resiliency is
   obtained. Finally, improvement of WWTPs' performance is investigated by
   allocating financial resources. The results show the significant value
   of quantifying and improving resiliency that could be used in
   development of investment strategies. Consideration of uncertainty in
   the analysis is of great worth to estimate the potential room for
   improvement of resiliency of individual WWTPs.}},

Volume = {{227}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The objective of the study is to improve understanding of natural
   phosphorus removal processes to limit the need for chemical addition in
   an existing facultative wastewater stabilization pond in Manitoba,
   Canada. Surface samples were collected from lagoon cells and analyzed.
   The windward and leeward sides of the ponds were sampled and the results
   were averaged. Phosphorus appears to be removed by assimilation into
   biomass; and precipitation at alkaline pH. When the nitrogen to
   phosphorus (N/P) ratio and ideal theoretical N/P ratio for cellular
   growth are compared, there appears to be nitrogen-limiting conditions in
   the secondary cells of the stabilization system. There is evidence
   ammonia removal by free ammonia volatilizing to the atmosphere may be
   contributing to nitrogen-limiting conditions in the secondary lagoon
   cells. Additional nitrogen may need to be supplied to remove more
   phosphorus by assimilation into biomass.}},

Abstract = {{Mitochondria are the primary source for energy generation in the cell,
   which manifests itself in the form of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
   Nicotinamide dinucleotide (NADH) molecules are the first to enter the
   so-called electron transport chain or ETC of the mitochondria. The ETC
   represents a chain of reducing agents organized into four major
   protein-metal complexes (I-IV) that utilize the flow of electrons to
   drive the production of ATP. An additional integral protein that is
   related to oxidative phosphorylation is ATP synthase, referred to as
   complex V. Complex V carries out ATP synthesis as a result of the
   electron flow through the ETC. The coupling of electron flow from NADH
   to molecular oxygen to the production of ATP represents a process known
   as oxidative phosphorylation. In this review, we describe mainly the
   bioenergetic properties of mitochondria, such as those found in the ETC
   that may be altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increasing evidence
   points to several mitochondrial functions that are affected in AD.
   Furthermore, it is becoming apparent that mitochondria are a potential
   target for treatment in early-stage AD. With growing interest in the
   mitochondria as a target for AD, it has been hypothesized that deficit
   in this organelle may be at the heart of the progression of AD itself.
   The role of mitochondria in AD may be significant and is emerging as a
   main area of AD research.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{1-29}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This article reviews published literature on the characteristics of a
   liquid jet injected transversally into a subsonic gaseous crossflow. The
   review covers the following aspects: (i) liquid jet primary breakup
   regimes, (ii) liquid jet trajectory and penetration, (iii) liquid jet
   breakup length, and (iv) droplets features and formation mechanisms. The
   focus is on analyzing the role of different prominent parameters which
   include gaseous and liquid properties, and liquid injector geometry. The
   review revealed that gas Weber number plays a crucial role in defining
   non-turbulent primary breakup regimes, while liquid jet Weber number is
   of great importance for the transition to turbulent primary breakup.
   Jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratio is the most important parameter for
   predicting the trajectory, penetration, and breakup length of a liquid
   jet in a crossflow. The characteristics of droplets disintegrated during
   the primary breakup are mostly influenced by the nozzle exit conditions,
   whereas the characteristics of droplets produced via the secondary
   breakup are strongly dependent on the velocity of cross airflow.
   Although the review revealed that substantial progress has been made in
   understanding this complex two-phase flow phenomenon, there still remain
   several shortcomings which require further research. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of anaerobic hydrolysis of particulate COD (pCOD) on
   biological phosphorous removal in extended anaerobic condition was
   investigated through (i) sequencing batch reactors (SBR) s with
   anaerobic hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 0.8, 2, and 4 h; (ii) batch
   tests using biomass from a full scale biological nutrient removal (BNR)
   plant; and (iii) activated sludge modeling (BioWin 4.1 simulation). The
   results from long-term SBRs operation showed that phosphorus removal was
   correlated to the ratio of filtered COD (FCOD) to total phosphorus (TP)
   in the influent. Under conditions with low FCOD/TP ratio (average of 20)
   in the influent, extending anaerobic HRT to 4 h in the presence of pCOD
   did not significantly improve overall phosphorous removal. During the
   period with high FCOD/TP ratio (average of 37) in the influent, all SBRs
   removed phosphorous completely, and the long anaerobic HRT did not have
   negative effect on overall phosphorous removal. The batch tests also
   showed that pCOD at different concentration during 4 h test did not
   affect the rate of anaerobic phosphorus release. The rate of anaerobic
   hydrolysis of pCOD was significantly low and extending the anaerobic HRT
   was ineffective. The simulation (BioWin 4.1) of SBRs with low influent
   FCOD/TP ratio showed that the default kinetics of anaerobic hydrolysis
   in ASM2d overestimated phosphorous removal in the SBRs (high anaerobic
   hydrolysis of pCOD). The default anaerobic hydrolysis rate in BioWin 4.1
   (ten times lower) could produce similar phosphorous removal to that in
   the experiment. Results showed that the current kinetics of anaerobic
   hydrolysis in ASM2d could lead to considerable error in predicting
   phosphorus removal in processes with extended anaerobic HRT. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We present a joint resource allocation (RA) and admission control (AC)
   framework for an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access
   (OFDMA)-based downlink cellular network composed of a macrocell
   underlaid by a cloud radio access network (C-RAN) of small cells. In
   this framework, the RA problems for both the macrocell and small cells
   are formulated as optimization problems. In particular, the macrocell,
   being aware of the existence of the small cells, maximizes the sum of
   the interference levels it can tolerate subject to the macrocell power
   budget and the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints of macrocell user
   equipments (MUEs). On the other hand, the small cells minimize the total
   downlink transmit power subject to their power budget, QoS requirements
   of small cell UEs (SUEs), interference thresholds for MUEs, and
   fronthaul constraints. Moreover, AC is considered in the resource
   allocation problem for the small cells to account for the case where it
   is not possible to support all SUEs. Besides, to allow for the existence
   of other network tiers, small cells have a constraint on the number of
   sub-channels that can be allocated. Both optimization problems are shown
   to be mixed integer nonlinear problems (MINLPs) for which, lower
   complexity algorithms are proposed that are based on the framework of
   successive convex approximation (SCA). Numerical results demonstrate the
   importance of the careful selection of the resource allocation policy at
   the macrocell and its impact on the performance of small cells.
   Moreover, we investigate the effect of the different parameters of the
   RA problem for the C-RAN of small cells on the overall performance of
   small cells.}},

Abstract = {{Many contact-sensor-based methods for structural damage detection have
   been developed. However, these methods have difficulty compensating for
   environmental effects, such as variation or changes in temperature and
   humidity, which may lead to false alarms. In order to partially overcome
   these disadvantages, vision-based approaches have been developed to
   detect corrosions, cracks, delamination, and voids. However, there are
   few such approaches for loosened bolts. Therefore, we propose a novel
   vision-based detection method. Target images of loosened bolts were
   taken by a smartphone camera. From the images, simple damage-sensitive
   features, such as the horizontal and vertical lengths of the bolt head,
   were calculated automatically using the Hough transform and other image
   processing techniques. A linear support vector machine was trained with
   the aforementioned features, thereby building a robust classifier
   capable of automatically differentiating tight bolts from loose bolts.
   Leave-one-out cross-validation was adapted to analyze the performance of
   the proposed algorithm. The results highlight the excellent performance
   of the proposed approach to detecting loosened bolts, and that it can
   operate in quasi-real-time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A complete two-phase numerical model of film condensation from a pure
   vapour that is based on the two-dimensional elliptic governing equations
   is presented. The model predicts the full viscous flow and heat and mass
   transfer for the vapour around the tube and in the entire film from the
   top of the tube to the falling film below the tube. The numerical model
   uses a dynamically moving computational grid that tracks the phase
   interface sharply. The model uses an adaptive-grid Eulerian method with
   a segregated solution method based on a finite volume approach.
   Fundamental balances of mass, energy, and force are enforced accurately
   at the phase interface. The model was used to perform a numerical
   analysis of laminar film condensation from downward flowing vapour over
   an isothermal horizontal tube. The validity of this new model is
   demonstrated by comparisons with previous theoretical and experimental
   studies. New results are presented on the effects of inlet-to-tube
   temperature difference, upstream Reynolds number and saturation pressure
   on the condensate film development, the local and average heat transfer
   coefficients, and the total liquid mass flow rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A multiple moving membrane capacitive micromachined ultrasonic
   transducer has been developed. This transducer cell structure includes a
   second flexible plate suspended between the transducer top plate and the
   fixed bottom electrode. The added plate influences the transducer top
   plate deflection map and, therefore, the transducer properties. Three
   series of individual air-coupled, dual deflectable plate transducers and
   two 1 x 27 element transducer arrays were fabricated using multiuser
   microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) processes (MUMPs). Each set of
   transducers included devices with middle plate radii from 22\% to 65\%
   of the corresponding transducer top plate radius. The effect of the
   transducer middle plate configuration has been investigated. Electrical,
   optical, and acoustic characterizations were conducted and the results
   were compared with the simulation findings. It was found that the
   transducer top plate amplitude of vibration is significantly enhanced
   with a wider middle deflectable plate. The electrical and optical
   measurement results are shown to be in good agreement with simulation
   results. The acoustic measurement results indicated a 37\% increase in
   the amplitude of transmitted signal by the 1-MHz air-couple transducer
   when its middle plate radius was increased by 35\%. (C) 2016 Society of

Abstract = {{Detection percentage of stored grain insects using different separation
   methods was determined. The stored grain insects tested were:
   Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.), Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), Sitophilus
   oryzae (L.), and Tribolium castaneum (Herbst). To determine the
   detection percentage, I or 100 adults of the four insect species, and 1
   or 100 young or old larvae of T. castaneum were introduced into wheat
   with 14 +/- 1\%, 16 +/- 1\%, or 18 +/- 1\% moisture content. The
   following four methods were used to separate the introduced insects from
   the infested wheat: Berlese funnel (Berlese), shaking grain on a metal
   sieve (Metal sieve), shaking grain on an acrylic device (Acrylic sieve),
   and microwave heating. For all detection methods, wheat moisture content
   did not influence the detection percentage. Detection method and insect
   species influenced the recovery percentage. For example, Metal sieve and
   Acrylic sieve methods had a higher recovery percentage of adults of O.
   surinamensis and T. castaneum than for S. oryzae and R. dominica. There
   was no significant difference in recovery percentage of the larvae and
   adults between the Metal sieve and Acrylic sieve methods, with the
   exception of weevils. The Berlese method had the lowest recovery
   percentage of introduced insects, with the exception of weevils, while
   the Microwave method had the highest or the second highest recovery
   percentage. Generally, the recovery percentage of the young larvae was
   lower than that of adults. The Microwave method could improve detection
   accuracy for larvae. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{For about the past decade and a half research efforts into cognitive
   radio networks (CRNs) have increased dramatically. This is because CRN
   is recognized as a technology that has the potential to squeeze the most
   out of the existing spectrum and hence virtually increase the effective
   capacity of a wireless communication system. The resulting increased
   capacity is still a limited resource and its optimal allocation is a
   critical requirement in order to realize its full benefits. Allocating
   these additional resources to the secondary users (SUs) in a CRN is an
   extremely challenging task and integer programming based optimization
   tools have to be employed to achieve the goals which include, among
   several aspects, increasing SUs throughput without interfering with the
   activities of primary users. The theory of the optimization tools that
   can be used for resource allocations (RA) in CRN have been well
   established in the literature; convex programming is one of them, in
   fact the major one. However when it comes to application and
   implementation, it is noticed that the practical problems do not fit
   exactly into the format of well established tools and researchers have
   to apply approximations of different forms to assist in the process. In
   this survey paper, the optimization tools that have been applied to RA
   in CRNs are reviewed. In some instances the limitations of techniques
   used are pointed out and creative tools developed by researchers to
   solve the problems are identified. Some ideas of tools to be considered
   by researchers are suggested, and direction for future research in this
   area in order to improve on the existing tools are presented.}},

Abstract = {{To improve the energy efficiency of small-cell networks, in this paper,
   we analyze the operating procedure of home base stations, i.e., Home
   evolved Node B (HeNB), in femtocells, by introducing anMAP/PH/1/k
   queueing model. In this analytical model, the HeNB's power on/off is
   represented as the alternative service and vacation periods. In
   addition, the hybrid-access mode defined in Third-Generation Partnership
   Project (3GPP) Release 9 is considered, which involves both
   high-priority and low-priority users. Based on the analytical results,
   an adaptive service rate and vacation length (ASV) method is proposed to
   maximize the HeNB's energy efficiency while satisfying its
   quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, such as blocking probability and
   user waiting time. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ASV
   method is more effective in improving energy efficiency compared with
   its counterpart.}},

Abstract = {{Although total knee arthroplasty is generally a successful operation,
   many studies have shown that it results in significant alterations in
   the kinematics of the joint, which cause limitations in performing the
   activities of daily living. This study aimed to define the design
   features for a customized surface-guided total knee replacement and to
   evaluate the kinematic outcomes. Magnetic resonance imaging data of the
   knee joint are used to generate the design features as they relate to
   the functionality of the implant. The motion is guided by considering a
   partial ball and socket configuration on the medial condyle and varying
   radii of curvature on the lateral articulating surface. A virtual
   simulation of the behavior of the surface-guided total knee replacement
   was performed to investigate the motion patterns of this total knee
   replacement under gait and squatting loading conditions. Results of the
   virtual simulation show that flexion and extension of the knee make the
   center of the lateral condyle move more naturally in the posterior and
   anterior directions, in comparison to the center of the medial condyle.
   Such guidance is achieved as a result of the novel customized designed
   contact between the articulating surfaces. The proposed customized
   surface-guided total knee replacement provides patterns of motion close
   to the expected more natural target, not only during a gait cycle but
   also as the knee flexes to higher degrees during squatting. Major design
   features include location and orientation of the flexion and pivoting
   axes, the trace of the contact points on the tibia, and the radii of the
   guiding arcs on the lateral condyle.}},

Abstract = {{Laminar flame speed of a newly developed biodiesel surrogate,
   1,3-dimethoxyoctane, has been experimentally determined at standard
   atmospheric pressure and 433 K using a spherical combustion chamber. The
   29 L combustion chamber has two pairs of fused silica windows for
   optical access and is also equipped with 4 pairs of axial fans for
   generating isotropic turbulence, which is used here to prepare
   homogeneous combustible mixtures of fuel and air. Schlieren technique
   was used to visualize and document the temporal evolution of the
   outwardly propagated spherical 1,3-dimethoxyoctane/air flame. An
   in-house developed Matlab code was employed for postprocessing of the
   flame front images and determining the time histories of its radius.
   Validation of the experimental setup and methodology was achieved by
   measuring the laminar flame speed of n-heptane/air mixtures at
   atmospheric pressure and 353 K, and compared with published reports. The
   results revealed that the proposed biodiesel surrogate,
   1,3-dimethoxyoctane, has an overall flame speed comparable to that of
   published biodiesel surrogates. Furthermore, the flammability limits of
   the newly developed biodiesel surrogate were similar to those of gaseous
   hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, ethane) and higher than those of liquid
   fuels (e.g., gasoline, diesel).}},

Abstract = {{We present the initial results from a small animal PET insert designed
   to be operated inside a 7T MRI. The insert fits within the 114 mm inner
   diameter of the Bruker BGA-12S gradient coil while accommodating the
   Bruker 35 mm volume RF coil (outer diameter 60 mm), both used in the
   Bruker 70/20 MRI systems. The PET insert is a ring comprising 16
   detectors. Each detector has a dual-layer offset (DLO) lutetium-yttrium
   oxyorthsilicate (LYSO) scintillator array read out by two SensL
   SPMArray4B SiPM arrays. The DLO scintillator has bottom (top) layers of:
   22 x 10 (21 x 9) crystals of size 1.2 x 1.2 x6 (4) mm(3) for a total of
   409 crystals per block, providing an axial extent of 28.17 mm. The
   detector outputs are multiplexed to four signals using a custom readout
   board and digitized using the OpenPET data acquisition platform. The
   detector flood images successfully resolve over 99\% of the crystals,
   with average energy resolution of 12.5 +/- 2.0\% at 511 keV. Testing of
   the PET system inside the MRI showed that the PET insert had no effect
   on MRI image homogeneity and only a small effect on echo planar images
   (EPI) signal to noise ratio (SNR) (-9\%), with neither PET nor MRI
   images showing obvious artefacts. These acquisitions used the OpenPET
   operating in ``oscilloscope mode{''} with USB2.0 interface, allowing a
   maximum total singles event rate of 280 kcps, strongly limiting the
   count rate capabilities of the system. The PET radial spatial resolution
   (as measured with a Na-22 point source and FBP-3DRP reconstruction) is
   1.17 mm at the centre, degrading to 1.86 mm at a 15 mm radial offset.
   Simultaneous phantom and mouse PET/MR imaging produced good quality
   images that were free of any obvious artefacts.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW) reducing
   Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurim, Staphylococcus aureus or
   bacterial mixtures on stainless steel surfaces was evaluated and
   compared its efficacy with composite phenol solution for reducing total
   aerobic bacteria in animal transport vehicles. Stainless steel surfaces
   were inoculated with these strains individually or in a mixture, and
   sprayed with SAEW, composite phenol, or alkaline electrolyzed water for
   0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 min. The bactericidal activity of SAEW increased with
   increasing available chlorine concentration and spraying duration. The
   SAEW solution of 50 mgl(-1) of available chlorine concentration showed
   significantly higher effectiveness than composite phenol in reducing the
   pathogens on stainless steel surfaces (P<0.05). Complete inactivation of
   pathogens on stainless steel surfaces were observed after treatment with
   alkaline electrolyzed water followed by SAEW at 50 mgl(-1) of available
   chlorine concentration for 2 min or alkaline electrolyzed water
   treatment followed by SAEW treatment at 90 mgl(-1) of available chlorine
   concentration for 0.5 min. The efficacy of SAEW in reducing total
   aerobic bacteria in animal transport vehicles was also determined.
   Vehicles in the disinfection booth were sprayed with the same SAEW,
   alkaline electrolyzed water and composite phenol solutions using the
   automatic disinfection system. Samples from vehicle surfaces were
   collected with sterile cotton swabs before and after each treatment. No
   significant differences in bactericidal efficiency were observed between
   SAEW and composite phenol for reducing total aerobic bacteria in the
   vehicles (P>0.05). SAEW was also found to be more effective when used in
   conjunction with alkaline electrolyzed water. Results suggest that the
   bactericidal efficiency of SAEW was higher than or equivalent to that of
   composite phenol and SAEW may be used as effective alternative for
   reducing microbial contamination of animal transport vehicles. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Clays exhibit creep in compression and shear. In one-dimensional
   compression, creep is commonly known as ``secondary compression{''} even
   though it is also a significant component of deformations resulting from
   shear straining. It reflects viscous behaviour in clays and therefore
   depends on load duration, stress level, the ratio of shear stress to
   compression stress, strain rate, and temperature. Research described in
   the paper partitions strains into elastic (recoverable) and plastic
   (nonrecoverable) components. The plastic component includes viscous
   strains defined by a creep rate coefficient psi that varies with
   plasticity index and temperature (T), but not with stress level or
   overconsolidation ratio (OCR). Earlier elastic-viscoplastic (EVP) models
   have been modified so that psi = psi (T) in a new
   elastic-thermoviscoplastic (ETVP) model. The paper provides a
   sensitivity analysis of simulated results from undrained (CI (U) over
   bar) triaxial compression tests for normally consolidated and lightly
   overconsolidated clays. Axial strain rates range from 0.15\%/day to
   15\%/day, and temperatures from 28 to 100 degrees C.}},

   management of MGs considering ancillary services by electric vehicles}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},

Volume = {{112}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes a well-defined energy management system (EMS)
   intended for smart microgrids (MGs) operational management. The proposed
   EMS aims at optimal allocation of active elements including electric
   vehicles (EVs), distributed generations (DGs), and responsive loads
   (RLs). To avoid the adverse effects of EVs' burden, a price-sensitive
   priority-based smart charging approach is outlined. As an innovative
   point, the potential of EVs in providing ancillary services such as
   reactive power provision is addressed in improving the MG's
   techno-economical performance. Moreover, the infield automatically
   controlled switches (ACSs) are accommodated to yield in optimal hourly
   reconfigurations. This practice would definitely impinge on the
   scheduling patterns of active elements and enhance the performance of
   the MG. Furthermore, the effects of reconfigurations and EVs' reactive
   power processes are explored on the capacity release of DGs, EV
   reliance, and imported power from the upper grid. The
   released/unallocated capacities are offered as reserve resources for

Abstract = {{Quantifying streamflow sources within remote, data scarce, Boreal
   catchments remains a significant challenge because of limited
   accessibility and complex, flat topography. The coupled use of
   hydrometric and isotopic data has previously been shown to facilitate
   quantification of streamflow sources, but application has generally been
   limited to small basins and short time scales. A lumped flow-isotope
   model was used to estimate contributing streamflow sources (soil,
   ground, and wetland water) over a four-year period in two large nested
   headwater catchments (Sapochi and Odei Rivers) in northern Manitoba,
   Canada. On average, the primary streamflow source was estimated as soil
   water (60\%) in the Sapochi River, and groundwater (54\%) in the Odei
   River. A strong seasonal influence was observed: soil water was the
   primary streamflow source in summer, changing to groundwater and
   wetlands during the winter. Interannual variability in streamflow
   sources was strongly linked to the presence or absence of late summer
   rainfall. The greatest uncertainties in source quantification were
   identified during the spring freshets and high precipitation events, and
   hence, simulations may be improved through explicit representation of
   the soil freeze/thaw process and data collection during this period.
   Assessment of primary streamflow components and qualitative uncertainty
   estimation using coupled isotope-flow modelling is an effective method
   for first-order identification of streamflow sources in data sparse
   remote headwaters. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an incentive-compatible mechanism for transmission
   scheduling in electronic health (e-health) networks with delay-sensitive
   medical packets is studied. Unlike existing works in the literature, we
   focus on the beyond wireless body area network (beyond-WBAN)
   communications. In the considered system, medical packets arrive
   randomly at each gateway (which ordinarily stands for one patient), and
   their transmission requests are reported to the network regulator (i.e.,
   the base station) with specific delay sensitivities that reflect their
   medical signal severities. The base station then determines the order of
   transmission by formulating a priority queue. With the construction of
   the packets' utility and the base station's profit functions, we analyze
   the characteristics of the service system and design an
   incentive-compatible mechanism such that all gateways will be forced to
   report the actual delay sensitivities of their medical packets.
   Theoretical analyses show that our proposed mechanism can maximize the
   profit of the base station (i.e., minimize the total waiting cost from
   all medical packet transmissions) while guaranteeing higher service
   priorities to more emergent medical packets. Numerical results examine
   the properties of the proposed mechanism, and demonstrate its
   feasibility in providing economic incentives for all individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Virtualization has been seen as one of the main evolution trends in the
   forthcoming fifth generation (5G) cellular networks which enables the
   decoupling of infrastructure from the services it provides. In this
   case, the roles of infrastructure providers (InPs) and mobile virtual
   network operators (MVNOs) can be logically separated and the resources
   (e.g., subchannels, power, and antennas) of a base station owned by an
   InP can be transparently shared by multiple MVNOs, while each MVNO
   virtually owns the entire BS. Naturally, the issue of resource
   allocation arises. In particular, the InP is required to abstract the
   physical resources into isolated slices for each MVNO who then allocates
   the resources within the slice to its subscribed users. In this paper,
   we aim to address this two-level hierarchical resource allocation
   problem while satisfying the requirements of efficient resource
   allocation, strict inter-slice isolation, and the ability of intra-slice
   customization. To this end, we design a hierarchical combinatorial
   auction mechanism, based on which a truthful and sub-efficient resource
   allocation framework is provided. Specifically, winner determination
   problems (WDPs) are formulated for the InP and MVNOs, and
   computationally tractable algorithms are proposed to solve these WDPs.
   Also, pricing schemes are designed to ensure incentive compatibility.
   The designed mechanism can achieve social efficiency in each level even
   if each party involved acts selfishly. Numerical results show the
   effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies indicate electricity consumption is increasing in new
   and green buildings highlighting the importance of investigating
   parameters affecting that increase. The majority of previous studies
   also focused on studying commercial or residential buildings emphasizing
   the need to study energy consumption in other building types. This study
   analyzed historical energy consumption data in a representative sample
   of thirty schools in Manitoba, Canada. It showed that the decrease in
   gas consumption for heating in new schools was counteracted by a
   statistically significant increase in their electricity consumption.
   Three cases study schools were selected for further analysis of their
   electricity consumption. Within each school, one classroom, the
   gymnasium, as well as spaces with significant community use, were
   sub-metered to collect real-time electricity consumption data. Results
   indicated total electricity consumption increased in the newest school,
   although sub-metered spaces in older schools consumed more electricity.
   Variations in electricity consumption between sub-metered spaces were
   attributed to occupant behaviour. The study is the first to provide an
   in-depth investigation of electricity consumption in Canadian school

Abstract = {{A new technique for sharp-interface modeling of dendritic solidification
   is proposed using a meshfree interface finite element method such that
   the liquid-solid interface is represented implicitly and allowed to
   arbitrarily intersect the finite elements. At the interface-embedded
   elements, meshfree interface points without connectivity are imposed
   directly at the zero level set while meshfree interpolants are
   constructed using radial basis functions. This ensures both the
   partition of unity and the Kronecker delta properties are satisfied
   allowing for precise and easy imposition of Dirichlet boundary
   conditions at the interface. The constructed meshfree interpolants are
   also used for solving a variational level set equation based on the
   Ginzburg-Landau energy functional minimization such that
   reinitialization is completely eliminated and fast marching algorithms
   for interfacial velocity extension are not necessary resulting in an
   efficient algorithm with excellent volume conservation. The meshfree
   interface finite element method is used for modeling dendritic
   solidification in a pure melt where it is found suitable in handling the
   complex interfacial dynamics often encountered in dendritic growth.
   Mathematical formulation and implementation followed by numerical
   results and analysis will be presented and discussed. Copyright (c) 2016

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations are used to show a new type of
   pseudo-elasticity and shape memory effects in small-scale nanotwinned
   metals. Nanotwinned Au thin-films and nanowires are found to achieve
   full recovery of up to 20\% tensile and -6.25\% compressive strains upon
   reverse loading when the twin boundaries make a special angle of 70.53
   degrees from the principal axis. This phenomenon results in superelastic
   recoverable strains up to 5 times larger than the useful range of
   deformation that can be induced in some advanced bulk
   shape-memory-alloys and small-scale ceramics, with a tensile strength
   above 1 GPa. The pseudo-elastic behavior stems from a unique interplay
   between deformation twinning and slip in grains composed of non-\{1 1
   1\} free surfaces and discontinued twin boundary migration in those
   exposing only \{1 1 1\} free surfaces. This finding could open up new
   opportunities for small-scale nanotwinned metals as advanced materials

Abstract = {{Background A prerequisite for successful robot-assisted neurosurgery is
   to use a hand-controller matched with characteristics of real robotic
   microsurgery. This study reports quantified data pertaining to the
   required workspace and exerted forces of surgical tools during
   robot-assisted microsurgery.
   Methods A surgeon conducted four operations in which the neuroArm
   surgical system, an image-guided computer-assisted manipulator
   specifically designed to perform robot-assisted neurosurgery, was
   employed to surgically remove brain tumors. The position, orientation,
   and exerted force of surgical tools were measured during operations.
   Results Workspace of the neuroArm manipulators, for the cases studied,
   was 60x60x60 mm(3) while it offered orientation ranges of 103 degrees,
   62 degrees and 112 degrees. The surgical tools exerted a maximum force
   of 1.86 N with frequency band of less than 20 Hz.
   Conclusions This data provides important information specific to
   neurosurgery that can be used to select among commercially available, or
   further design a customized, haptic hand-controller for robot-assisted
   neurosurgical systems. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Photo-crosslinking and self-healing have received considerable attention

   coumarin moieties, the hydrogels exhibit excellent self-healing capacity
   when they are exposed to light with wavelengths at 280 and 365 nm,
   respectively. To enhance cell compatibility, a poly ( amidoamine)
   crosslinker is also synthesized. Variations in light exposure times and
   irradiation wavelengths are found to alter the self-healing property of
   the hydrogels. The hydrogels are shown to induce a regular cellular
   pattern. The hydrogels are used to regulate bone marrow stromal cells
   differentiation. The relative mRNA expressions are recorded to monitor
   the osteogenic differentiation of the cells.}},

Title = {{An Analysis Framework for Buffer-Aided Relaying Under Time-Correlated
   Fading Channels}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{65}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a framework to analyze the performance of
   buffer-aided (BA) relaying under time-correlated fading channels in
   terms of the queueing behavior of packets at the relay's buffer. Unlike
   independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) fading, correlated
   fading brings challenges in performance analysis since the state
   transition probabilities of buffer occupancy become time variant. To
   overcome this issue, we first establish an aggregate quasi-birth-death
   (QBD) Markov chain integrating both the buffer occupancy process and the
   channel fading process, then analyze the stationary distribution of the
   aggregate chain, and finally extract the stationary distribution of
   buffer occupancy from it. Using the stationary distribution of buffer
   occupancy, system throughput, end-to-end delay, and outage probability
   are derived. Numerical results verify our analyses and show that the
   throughput of BA relaying under correlated fading channels can approach
   the one under i.i.d. fading only for loose delay constraints or high
   fadingmargins. For stringent delay constraints and low fading margins,
   correlated fading causes great degradation of throughput. In particular,
   a throughput loss of about 16\% under an infinite buffer (28\% under a
   finite buffer) is observed for the requirement of an average delay of 20
   slots and a fading margin of 5 dB. This means that the designs based on
   i.i.d. fading are not always feasible for correlated fading. According
   to these observations, some insights on performance degradation and
   guidelines on redesigning improved policies under correlated fading are
   provided.}},

Abstract = {{Broken kernels in stored wheat are contaminants, and these reduce the
   quality of wheat and increase risk of spoilage. The present study was
   conducted to predict the amount of broken kernels in bulk Canada Western
   Red Spring wheat samples using a near-infrared hyperspectral imaging
   system. The hyperspectral images of bulk wheat samples with different
   levels of broken kernels (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 \%) were acquired in
   the 1000-1600 nm wavelength range at a 10-nm interval. The reflectance
   spectra acquired from these samples were used to develop regression
   models using principal component regression (PCR) and partial
   least-squares regression (PLSR) techniques. A tenfold cross-validation
   technique was used for determining the optimal number of components
   required to develop these regression models. Among the two regression
   techniques used, the PLSR technique {[}with mean square errors of
   predictions (MSEP), standard error of cross-validation (SECV), and
   correlation coefficient of 0.483, 0.70, and 0.94, respectively]
   performed better than the PCR technique (with MSEP, SECV, and
   correlation coefficient of 0.74, 0.86, and 0.88, respectively). The
   classification models were developed using the linear discriminant
   analysis (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) statistical
   techniques. Both classifiers accurately classified (100.0 +/- 0.0 \%)
   the uncontaminated wheat sample from the higher contamination level
   ({[}6 \%) wheat samples. Both classifiers also gave similar
   classification results (QDA 89.8 +/- 2.6 \% and LDA 87.7 +/- 1.6 \%)
   when multi-way classification was performed to classify uncontaminated
   sample from the contaminated samples.}},

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative
   diseases. Activins are members of the superfamily of transforming growth
   factors and have many potential neuroprotective effects. Herein, at the
   first place, we verified activin B's neuroprotective role in a PD model,
   and revealed that activin B's fast release has limited function in the
   PD therapy. To this end, we developed a multifunctional crosslinker
   based thermosensitive injectable hydrogels to deliver activin B, and
   stereotactically injected the activin B-loaded hydrogel into the
   striatum of a mouse model of PD. The histological evaluation showed that
   activin B can be detected even 5 weeks post-surgery in PD mice implanted
   with activin B-loaded hydrogels, and activin B-loaded hydrogels can
   significantly increase the density of tyrosine hydroxylase positive
   (TH+) nerve fibers and reduce inflammatory responses. The behavioral
   evaluation demonstrated that activin B-loaded hydrogels significantly
   improved the performance of the mice in the PD model. Meanwhile, we
   found that hydrogels can slightly induce the activation of microglia
   cells and astrocytes, while cannot induce apoptosis in the striatum.
   Overall, our data demonstrated that the developed activin B-loaded
   hydrogels provide sustained release of activin B for over 5 weeks and
   contribute to substantial cellular protection and behavioral
   improvement, suggesting their potential as a therapeutic strategy for
   PD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of time delay
   associated with a semi-active variable viscous (SAVV) damper on the
   response of seismically excited linear and nonlinear structures. The
   maximum time delay is estimated on the basis of stability criteria,
   which consist of analyses of structural modal properties. Numerical
   computation of the critical time delay is performed by using dichotomic
   approach, which is based on multiple solving of the eigenvalue problem.
   Simulation results indicate that variable dampers can be effective in
   reducing the seismic response of structures, and that time-delay effects
   are important factors in control design of seismically excited
   structures. Furthermore, simulation results show degradation of
   performance whenever the actual delay exceeds the calculated critical
   time delay, which shows the accuracy and reliability of the proposed
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{A strictly anaerobic, thermophilic bacterium, designated strain YS13,
   was isolated from a geothermal hot spring. Phylogenetic analysis using
   the 16S rRNA genes and cpn60 UT genes suggested strain YS13 as a species
   of Thermoanaerobacter. Using cellobiose or xylose as carbon source, YS13
   was able to grow over a wide range of temperatures (45-70 degrees C),
   and pHs (pH 5.0-9.0), with optimum growth at 65 degrees C and pH 7.0.
   Metabolic profiling on cellobiose, glucose, or xylose in 1191 medium
   showed that H-2, CO2, ethanol, acetate, and lactate were the major
   metabolites. Lactate was the predominant end product from glucose or
   cellobiose fermentations, whereas H-2 and acetate were the dominant end
   products from xylose fermentation. The metabolic balance shifted away
   from ethanol to H-2, acetate, and lactate when YS13 was grown on
   cellobiose as temperatures increased from 45 to 70 degrees C. When YS13
   was grown on xylose, a metabolic shift from lactate to H-2, CO2, and
   acetate was observed in cultures as the temperature of incubation
   increased from 45 to 65 degrees C, whereas a shift from ethanol and CO2
   to H-2, acetate, and lactate was observed in cultures incubated at 70
   degrees C.}},

Title = {{Position referenced force augmentation in teleoperated hydraulic
   manipulators operating under delayed and lossy networks: A pilot study}},
Journal = {{ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Position error between motions of the master and slave end-effectors is
   inevitable as it originates from hard-to-avoid imperfections in
   controller design and model uncertainty. Moreover, when a slave
   manipulator is controlled through a delayed and lossy communication
   channel, the error between the desired motion originating from the
   master device and the actual movement of the slave manipulator end
   effector is further exacerbated. This paper introduces a force feedback
   scheme to alleviate this problem by simply guiding the operator to slow
   down the haptic device motion and, in turn, allows the slave manipulator
   to follow the desired trajectory closely. Using this scheme, the master
   haptic device generates a force, which is proportional to the position
   error at the slave end-effector, and opposite to the operator's intended
   motion at the master site. Indeed, this force is a signal or cue to the
   operator for reducing the hand speed when position error, due to delayed
   and lossy network, appears at the slave site. Effectiveness of the
   proposed scheme is validated by performing experiments on a hydraulic
   telemanipulator setup developed for performing live-line maintenance.
   Experiments are conducted when the system operates under both dedicated
   and wireless networks. Results show that the scheme performs well in
   reducing the position error between the haptic device and the slave
   end-effector. Specifically, by utilizing the proposed force, the mean
   position error, for the case presented here, reduces by at least 92\% as
   compared to the condition without the proposed force augmentation
   scheme. The scheme is easy to implement, as the only required on-line
   measurement is the angular displacement of the slave manipulator joints.

Title = {{Study of sex differences in the association between hip fracture risk
   and body parameters by DXA-based biomechanical modeling}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{90-98}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{There is controversy about whether or not body parameters affect hip
   fracture in men and women in the same way. In addition, although bone
   mineral density (BMD) is currently the most important single
   discriminator of hip fracture, it is unclear if BMD alone is equally
   effective for men and women. The objective of this study was to quantify
   and compare the associations of hip fracture risk with BMD and body
   parameters in men and women using our recently developed two-level
   biomechanical model that combines a whole-body dynamics model with a
   proximal-femur finite element model. Sideways fall induced impact force
   of 130 Chinese clinical cases, including 50 males and 80 females, were
   determined by subject-specific dynamics modeling. Then, a DXA-based
   finite element model was used to simulate the femur bone under the
   fall-induced loading conditions and calculate the hip fracture risk.
   Body weight, body height, body mass index, trochanteric soft tissue
   thickness, and hip bone mineral density were determined for each subject
   and their associations with impact force and hip fracture risk were
   quantified. Results showed that the association between impact force and
   hip fracture risk was not strong enough in both men (r = -0.31, p<0.05)
   and women (r = 0.42,p<0.001) to consider the force as a sole indicator
   of hip fracture risk. The correlation between hip BMD and hip fracture
   risk in men (r = -0.83,p<0.001) was notably stronger than that in women
   (r = -0.68, p <0.001). Increased body mass index was not a protective
   factor against hip fracture in men (r = -0.13, p>0.05), but it can be
   considered as a protective factor among women (r = -0.28, p<0.05). In
   contrast to men, trochanteric soft tissue thickness can be considered as
   a protective factor against hip fracture in women (r = -0.50, p<0.001).
   This study suggested that the biomechanical risk/protective factors for
   hip fracture are sex-specific. Therefore, the effect of body parameters
   should be considered differently for men and women in hip fracture risk
   assessment tools. These findings support further exploration of
   sex-specific preventive and protective measurements to reduce the
   incidence of hip fractures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, large-eddy simulation (LES) has been performed to
   investigate the turbulent wake behind a wall-mounted square cylinder.
   The flow features a relatively high cylinder aspect ratio of 4, a
   Reynolds number of 12,000 (based on the free-stream velocity and
   cylinder side length), and a thin developing boundary layer with a
   thickness of only 18 \% of the obstacle height. These characteristics of
   the flow impose challenges to LES for accurate simulation of large
   energetic eddies induced by the cylinder and their intense interactions
   with the thin developing boundary layer. The coherent flow structures
   around the cylinder have been studied based on the instantaneous and
   time-averaged resolved velocity and pressure fields. The local kinetic
   energy transfer between the resolved and subgrid scales and the
   streamwise evolution of the subgrid-scale viscosity have been
   investigated to provide physical insights into the subgrid-scale
   dynamics. The LES predictions of the flow statistics have been validated
   against a set of recently reported wind-tunnel experimental data.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{43-55}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a discrete time working vacation queue with a
   utility function for the reward of receiving the service and the cost of
   waiting in the system. A more flexible switching mechanism between low
   and regular service states is introduced to enhance the practical value
   of the working vacation queue. Under different precision levels of the
   system information, namely observable, almost un-observable and fully
   unobservable cases, the utility function is studied from both the
   individual customer's and the system administrator's points of view. By
   analyzing the steady-state behavior of the system, the associated
   optimal joining decisions under different information scenarios are
   obtained. We find that for the fully observable queue, the joining
   threshold for individual optimization may be less than the one for
   social optimization in working vacation period. A similar situation also
   appears in almost unobservable case. Such phenomenon is not possible for
   the classic first come first served queue due to the fact that there is
   no vacation time and thus will not cause large fluctuations in
   customers' conditional waiting time. Additionally, we also conduct some
   numerical comparisons to demonstrate the effect of the information
   levels as well as system parameters on customer joining behavior. (C)

Abstract = {{We have demonstrated what we believe is the first continuous wave
   neodymium-doped potassium gadolinium tungstate crystal (Nd: KGW) laser
   with hot-band diode pumping at similar to 910 nm. This pumping
   wavelength reduced the quantum defect by >46\% as compared to
   conventional similar to 810 nm pumping and resulted in significantly
   lower thermal lensing. The laser produced 2.9 W of average output power
   at 1067 nm in a diffraction-limited beam for an absorbed pump power of
   8.3 W. The slope efficiency and optical-to-optical efficiency were found
   to be 43\% and 35\%, respectively. Significant reduction of quantum
   defect offered by this pumping wavelength and availability of suitable
   high-power laser diodes opens up an attractive way to further power and
   efficiency scaling of Nd: KGW lasers. (C) 2016 Optical Society of

Title = {{Experimental investigations on flow characteristics of two parallel

Abstract = {{The instability of supercritical water flow inside two parallel channels
   is investigated experimentally in this paper. Two types of instabilities
   with various oscillation periods occur at different power region during
   the heating process, indicating the existence of two types of dynamic
   instabilities. The type I instability occurs when the outlet temperature
   of the test section surpasses the pseudo-critical temperature. Sudden
   increase of the pressure drop cause a big disturbance to the system
   which results in a periodic feedback between the pressure drop and the
   mass flow rate. Large oscillations were found in the entire system at
   low heating power during which the two parallel channels oscillates in
   phase with the whole system with a long oscillation period (20-300 s).
   The type II instability occurs only in the heated section at high powers
   at which the two parallel channels oscillate 180 out of phase while the
   rest of the system is stable. The period of type II instability is
   relatively small, i.e. 2-5 s. With Ambrosini's non-dimensional
   parameters, a stability map was generated using the obtained instability
   data. Analysis of the instability map showed the expected result that no
   instability occurs when the exit fluid temperature is below the
   pseudo-critical temperature regardless of the system pressure, inlet
   temperature, heating power, and local loss coefficient. The influences
   of inlet mass flow rate, inlet fluid temperature and system pressure on
   instabilities were also studied. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Experimental feasibility of multistatic holography for breast microwave
   radar image reconstruction}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The goal of this study was to assess the experimental
   feasibility of circular multistatic holography, a novel breast microwave
   radar reconstruction approach, using experimental datasets recorded
   using a preclinical experimental setup. The performance of this approach
   was quantitatively evaluated by calculating the signal to clutter ratio
   (SCR), contrast to clutter ratio (CCR), tumor to fibroglandular response
   ratio (TFRR), spatial accuracy, and reconstruction time.
   Methods: Five datasets were recorded using synthetic phantoms with the
   dielectric properties of breast tissue in the 1-6 GHz range using a
   custom radar system developed by the authors. The datasets contained
   synthetic structures that mimic the dielectric properties of
   fibroglandular breast tissues. Four of these datasets the authors
   covered an 8 mm inclusion that emulated a tumor. A custom microwave
   radar system developed at the University of Manitoba was used to record
   the radar responses from the phantoms. The datasets were reconstructed
   using the proposed multistatic approach as well as with a monostatic
   holography approach that has been previously shown to yield the images
   with the highest contrast and focal quality.
   Results: For all reconstructions, the location of the synthetic tumors
   in the experimental setup was consistent with the position in the both
   the monostatic and multistatic reconstructed images The average spatial
   error was less than 4 mm, which is half the spatial resolution of the
   data acquisition system. The average SCR, CCR, and TFRR of the images
   reconstructed with the multistatic approach were 15.0, 9.4, and 10.0 dB,
   respectively. In comparison, monostatic images obtained using the
   datasets from the same experimental setups yielded average SCR, CCR, and
   TFRR values of 12.8, 4.9, and 5.9 dB. No artifacts, defined as responses
   generated by the reconstruction method of at least half the energy of
   the tumor signatures, were noted in the multistatic reconstructions. The
   average execution time of the images formed using the proposed approach
   was 4 s, which is one order of magnitude faster than the current
   state-of-the-art time-domain multistatic breast microwave radar
   reconstruction algorithms.
   Conclusions: The images generated by the proposed method show that
   multistatic holography is capable of forming spatially accurate images
   in real-time with signal to clutter levels and contrast values higher
   than other published monostatic and multistatic cylindrical radar
   reconstruction approaches. In comparison to the monostatic holographic
   approach, the images generated by the proposed multistatic approach had
   SCR values that were at least 50\% higher. The multistatic images had
   CCR and TFRR values at least 200\% greater than those formed using a
   monostatic approach. (C) 2016 American Association of Physicists in

Abstract = {{Designing antibacterial surfaces has become extremely important to
   minimize Healthcare Associated Infections which are a major cause of
   mortality worldwide. A previous biocide releasing approach is based on
   leaching of encapsulated biocides such as silver and triclosan which
   exerts negative impacts on the environment and potentially contributes
   to the development of bacterial resistance. This drawback of leachable
   compounds led to the shift of interest towards a more sustainable and
   environmentally friendly approach: contact-killing surfaces. Biocides
   that can be bound onto surfaces to give the substrates contact-active
   antibacterial activity include quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs),
   quaternary phosphoniums (QPs), carbon nanotubes, antibacterial peptides,
   and Nchloramines. Among the above, QACs and N-chloramines are the most
   researched contact-active biocides. We review the engineering of
   contact-active surfaces using QACs or N-chloramines, the modes of
   actions as well as the test methods. The charge-density threshold of
   cationic surfaces for desired antibacterial efficacy and attempts to
   combine various biocides for the generation of new contact-active
   surfaces are discussed in detail. Surface positive charge density is
   identified as a key parameter to define antibacterial efficacy. We
   expect that this research field will continue to attract more research
   interest in view of the potential impact of self-disinfective surfaces
   on healthcare-associated infections, food safety and corrosion/fouling
   resistance required on industrial surfaces such as oil pipes and ship
   hulls. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A technique to reduce the E-plane sidelobe of the TM12 mode of circular
   microstrip patch is presented. It involves the use of a single
   nonresonant narrow slot embedded at the patch center. The fundamental
   working principle is the linear superposition of the radiated field by
   the patch and the embedded slot. The sidelobe level (SLL) and the peak
   gain are found to be dependent on the slot length. Effects of various
   design parameters like slot length, dielectric constant and substrate
   thickness on SLL and peak gain are investigated. Measurements results
   are provided to confirm these findings. In addition to this, to show the
   merit and utilization of the proposed technique, a novel single layer,
   easy to design and fabricate high gain circular microstrip antenna
   configuration is also proposed. It is a simple slot loaded circular
   patch having a peak gain similar to 11 dBi with SLL as low as -20 dB.
   Depending upon the substrate parameters, peak gains as large as 13 dBi
   can be attained.}},

Abstract = {{A novel air-coupled multiple moving membrane-capacitive micromachined
   ultrasonic transducer (M3-CMUT) with individually biased deflectable
   plates has been developed. Unlike the conventional capacitive
   micromachined ultrasonic transducer, this device cell structure includes
   an additional deflectable plate that is suspended underneath the
   transducer top plate. This added flexible plate contributes to the
   device signal transmission and reception. It is demonstrated that due to
   the presence of this added moving plate, the transducer is capable of
   operating under inverse bias condition, where the driving voltage is
   sandwiched between two grounded electrodes. COMSOL electromechanical
   simulations were conducted to investigate the influence of the
   transducer additional moving plate. A set of three individuals and an
   array of 1x23 M-3-CMUT transducers were fabricated using a sacrificial
   technique and with resonant frequencies ranging from 0.8 to 2.1 MHz.
   Electrical, optical, and pitch-catch acoustic measurements were
   performed to characterize the transducers properties under inverse bias
   condition. The experimental results are shown to be in good agreement
   with the simulation results for all of the fabricated transducers. It is
   shown that these transducers are fully functional under both normal and
   inverse bias conditions without any degradation in the transducer

Abstract = {{The minimum frustration principle (MFP) is a computational approach
   stating that, over the long time scales of evolution, proteins' free
   energy decreases more than expected by thermodynamical constraints as
   their amino acids assume conformations progressively closer to the
   lowest energetic state. This Review shows that this general principle,
   borrowed from protein folding dynamics, can also be fruitfully applied
   to nervous function. Highlighting the foremost role of energetic
   requirements, macromolecular dynamics, and above all intertwined time
   scales in brain activity, the MFP elucidates a wide range of mental
   processes from sensations to memory retrieval. Brain functions are
   compared with trajectories that, over long nervous time scales, are
   attracted toward the low-energy bottom of funnel-like structures
   characterized by both robustness and plasticity. We discuss how the
   principle, derived explicitly from evolution and selection of a
   funneling structure from microdynamics of contacts, is unlike other
   brain models equipped with energy landscapes, such as the Bayesian and
   free energy principles and the Hopfield networks. In summary, we make
   available a novel approach to brain function cast in a biologically
   informed fashion, with the potential to be operationalized and assessed
   empirically. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A heterogeneous wireless network (HetNet), which combines multiple
   cooperating radio access technologies in an overlapping structure, is a
   communication system that has been recognized as an efficient way to
   meet the increasing traffic demand in broadband wireless networks. In
   this paper, we exploit the network cooperation in HetNets to propose two
   joint radio resource management (JRRM) schemes that improve energy
   savings while satisfying the system quality-of-service (QoS) performance
   requirements. First, we present an optimal QoS-aware energy-efficient
   JRRM scheme, which is formulated as a semi-Markov decision process
   model, and provide the optimal control policy for the HetNet under
   analysis. Second, we present an implementation-friendly QoS-aware
   energy-efficient JRRM scheme that utilizes a threshold on the macrocell
   radio resource occupancy to trigger the switching-on/off procedure of
   the base transceiver station resources, as well as a load-balancing
   procedure to minimize the service disruptions that may occur because of
   radio resource shortage and to reduce power consumption during the
   HetNet operation. This JRRM scheme is analyzed by means of a
   multidimensional continuous-time Markov chain model. Third, we devise an
   algorithm to determine the threshold setting in the
   implementation-friendly JRRM scheme according to a desirable power
   saving level that is prespecified by the mobile network operator.
   Numerical results show that the proposed schemes achieve substantial
   energy savings while keeping satisfactory performance levels.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents test results of six full-scale glass
   fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) reinforced concrete slab-column edge
   connections. The test connections included two series with three
   connections each. The connections of Series 1 investigated the effect of
   a new type of GFRP shear reinforcement on the punching shear behavior of
   slab-column edge connections, while those of Series 2 investigated the
   effect of moment-to-shear ratio. For Series 1, one connection did not
   have shear reinforcement, while the other two connections had
   ribbed-deformed GFRP shear studs with headed ends at different radial
   spacing (120 and 80mm). For Series 2, three different moment-to-shear
   ratios were applied to the connections (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6m). The typical
   dimensions of the slabs were 2,800x1,550x200mm with a 300-mm square
   column extending above and below the slab. The headed ends of the studs
   provided adequate anchorage, which allowed the studs to control the
   propagation of shear cracks and to increase the deformability and
   capacity of the connections. On the other hand, increasing the
   moment-to-shear ratio significantly decreased the deformability and
   shear force capacity of the connections.}},

Abstract = {{Six full-scale reinforced-concrete (RC) interior slab-column connections
   of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) were constructed and tested to
   failure. The specimen consisted of a square slab with a 2,800-mm side
   length and a 200-mm thickness in addition to a 300-mm-square column stub
   extended for 1,000mm above and below the slab. The test specimens were
   subjected to vertical shear forces and unbalanced moments. The test
   variables included the moment-to-shear ratio, GFRP double-headed shear
   studs ratio, and the type of GFRP bar surface texture (ribbed or
   sand-coated). The test results revealed that increasing the
   moment-to-shear ratio reduced the vertical shear capacity and increased
   the deflections and the strains at failure. Moreover, the presence of
   the GFRP shear studs enhanced the slab capacity but was not able to
   change the punching shear mode of failure. Furthermore, the used two
   types of GFRP bars showed comparable behavior. The results were compared
   with the predictions of the available fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP)
   design provisions such as those from Canada, the United States, and
   Japan. Finally, a new method is proposed to predict the punching shear

Abstract = {{This paper reveals the existence of poorly damped resonant modes in the
   modular multilevel converter (MMC) that can result in harmonic
   instability. A small-signal model based on dynamic phasors is introduced
   which takes into consideration the dynamics of internal variables, such
   as circulating arm currents, which have a tendency for a large second
   harmonic component and module capacitor voltage ripple, which has other
   harmonic components. The small-signal model is validated by comparison
   with the electromagnetic transient simulation of a detailed model. It is
   shown that the use of an active circulating current suppressing scheme
   can effectively improve the damping of internal harmonic modes in
   comparison with a passive filter used for the same purpose. The damping
   of internal harmonic modes has been shown to be significantly impacted
   by the gains of the MMC's outer-loop controller but is less sensitive to
   the ac system strength or the gain of the phase-locked loop. A larger
   arm resistance also increases the damping of these internal modes.}},

Abstract = {{Surface electrical and electromagnetic geophysical methods can map
   enhanced electrical conductivity caused by acid mine drainage in mine
   tailings piles. In this case study, we investigate quantitative
   relationships between geophysical responses and the electrical
   conductivity, acidity and salinity of tailing samples at the Central
   Manitoba Mine tailings in Manitoba, Canada. Previous electromagnetic
   surveys at the site identified zones of enhanced conductivity that were
   hypothesized to be caused by acid mine drainage. In the present study,
   high resolution EM31 and DC-resistivity measurements were made on a
   profile through a zone of enhanced conductivity and laboratory
   measurements of salinity and pH were made on saturation paste extracts
   from an array of tailing samples collected from the upper 2 m of
   tailings along the profile.
   Observed spatial correlation of pH and pore-fluid salinity in the
   tailings samples confirms that the enhanced conductivity in the Central
   Manitoba Mine tailings is due to acid mine drainage. Contoured
   cross-sections of the data indicate that the acid mine drainage is
   concentrated near the base of the oxidized zone in the thicker parts of
   the tailings pile. The zone of increased acidity extends to the surface
   on sloping margins causing an increase in apparent conductivity in
   shallow penetrating geophysical responses. The quantitative relationship
   between measured pH and salinity shows that the conductivity increase
   associated with the acid mine drainage is due only in part to conduction
   by ions produced from dissociation of sulfuric acid. Comparison of the
   observations with fluid conductivity estimates based on statistical
   relationships of pH and ion concentrations in water samples from across
   the tailings pile shows that Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions also make significant
   contributions to the conductivity at all values of pH and Cu2+, Al3+ and
   Fe3+ ions make additional contributions at low pH. Variability in the
   measured conductivity at constant values of pH is explained by
   variations in the contribution of the SO42- to the measurements. The
   results of the study demonstrate the feasibility of using
   electromagnetic geophysical surveys to map acid mine drainage, and
   related ionic concentration, in mine tailings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A passive walker is dynamic and energy efficient, but is always
   restricted to a downward gentle slope, and cannot walk on the flat
   ground. To design and build a bipedal walking robot, as dynamic and
   energy efficient as a passive walker, and still enable to walk on the
   flat ground, there is a need for a proper source of energy (actuation)
   to replace the gravitational energy input. Such an actuation system
   should allow the robot to walk a larger portion of a gait cycle all by
   its natural dynamics, and also, the actuation system does not have to
   suppress the natural dynamics of the robot. Therefore, in this paper,
   the authors present the design of a passive-based physical bipedal robot
   which can walk on the flat ground purely based on its natural dynamics
   (no control and no actuation) for a large portion of a gait cycle with a
   dynamic and highly energy-efficient gait. The robot has three internal
   degrees of freedom, i.e., the (active) hip and the two (passive) knees
   as well as the two round-feet rigidly connected to the two shanks. Only
   one compliant hip-actuation system is used to allow the robot to perform
   energy recovery as well as coordination between the energy input and the
   natural dynamics. The energy is injected at the hip and is stored in a
   torsional spring at the beginning of each gait cycle (similar or equal
   to 40\% of a gait cycle); such energy is then recovered to enable the
   robot walking forward entirely by its natural dynamics for the rest of
   that cycle (similar or equal to 60\% of a gait cycle). As a result, the
   robot can walk with a dynamic and highly energy-efficient gait on the
   flat ground with a Froude number of 0.176, a mechanical cost of
   transport of 0.086, and a total cost of transport of 0.236, which are
   comparable to a human and the best available bipedal walking robots in
   the literature.}},

Abstract = {{A quantum entanglement's composite system does not display separable
   states and a single constituent cannot be fully described without
   considering the other states. We introduce quantum entanglement on a
   hypersphere - which is a 4D space undetectable by observers living in a
   3D world -, derived from signals originating on the surface of an
   ordinary 3D sphere. From the far-flung branch of algebraic topology, the
   Borsuk-Ulam theorem states that, when a pair of opposite (antipodal)
   points on a hypersphere are projected onto the surface of 3D sphere, the
   projections have matching description. In touch with this theorem, we
   show that a separable state can be achieved for each of the entangled
   particles, just by embedding them in a higher dimensional space. We view
   quantum entanglement as the simultaneous activation of signals in a 3D
   space mapped into a hypersphere. By showing that the particles are
   entangled at the 3D level and un-entangled at the 4D hypersphere level,
   we achieved a composite system in which each local constituent is
   equipped with a pure state. We anticipate this new view of quantum
   entanglement leading to what are known as qubit information systems.}},

Abstract = {{Combining spectrum sensing (SS) and primary user (PU) traffic
   forecasting provides a cognitive radio network with a platform from
   which informed and proactive operational decisions can be made. The
   success of these decisions is largely dependent on prediction accuracy.
   Allowing secondary users (SU) to perform these predictions in a
   collaborative manner allows for an improvement in the accuracy of this
   process, since individual SUs may suffer from SS and prediction
   inaccuracies due to poor channel conditions. To overcome these problems
   a collaborative approach to forecasting PU traffic behaviour, that
   combines SS and forecasting through SU cooperation, has been proposed in
   this article. Both pre-fusion and post-fusion scenarios for cooperative
   prediction were investigated and a number of binary prediction methods
   were considered (including the authors' own simple technique).
   Cooperative prediction performance was investigated, under various PU
   traffic conditions, for a group of ten SUs experiencing different
   channel conditions and a sub-optimal cooperative forecasting algorithm
   was proposed to minimise cooperative prediction error. Simulation
   results indicated that the accuracy of the prediction methods was
   influenced by the PU traffic pattern and that cooperative prediction
   lead to a significant improvement in prediction accuracy under most of
   the traffic conditions considered. However, this came at the cost of
   increased computational complexity. The pre-fusion scenario was found to
   be the most accurate scenario (up to 25 \% improvement), but was also
   eleven times more complex than when no fusion was employed. The
   cooperative forecasting algorithm was found to further improve these
   results.}},

Title = {{Solving resource allocation problems in cognitive radio networks: a
   survey}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Month = {{JUL 29}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive radio networks (CRN), in their quest to become the preferred
   next-generation wireless communication paradigm, will depend heavily on
   their ability to efficiently manage the limited resources at their
   disposal in meeting the demands of their numerous users and driving
   their operations. As a result, a considerable amount of research work
   has been recently dedicated to investigating and developing resource
   allocation (RA) models that capture the essentials of CRN. The various
   ideas put forward by researchers to address RA problems in CRN have been
   somewhat diverse, and somehow, there seem to be no links that bring
   cohesion and clarity of purpose and ideas. To address this problem and
   bridge the gap, in this paper, a comprehensive study on the prevalent
   techniques developed for addressing RA problems in CRN is carried out,
   with an intent to put some structure, relevance and meaning to the
   various solution approaches. The solution models are therefore grouped
   and/or classified based on certain outstanding criteria, and their
   strengths and weaknesses highlighted. Open-ended problems are
   identified, and suggestions for improving solution models are given. The
   study therefore gives good directions for further investigations on
   developing RA solutions in CRN.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a recent increase in the greening of existing buildings, the
   literature continues to focus on investigating barriers to the greening
   of new buildings. The goal of this research was to develop a method
   using failure mode and effects analysis to investigate the barriers to
   the greening of existing buildings using the Leadership in Energy and
   Environmental Design version 4 for Building Operations and Maintenance:
   Existing Buildings rating system. Its specific objectives included using
   this method to 1) investigate potential failure modes when certifying
   existing buildings using this rating system, as well as their causes and
   effects, 2) rank failure modes, effects and causes in order of priority
   and 3) identify opportunities and lessons learned from implementing this
   method. The research involved bringing together a focus group of five
   local experts who were familiar with the rating system for a one-day
   workshop. The experts, along with the research team, were tasked with
   identifying these potential failure modes along with their causes,
   effects and detection controls and with rating the probability of
   occurrence of the failure modes, the severity of the failure effects and
   the ease of detection of the failure controls. The analysis of the
   workshop data showed that over half of the identified failure causes
   were technical in nature, with financial causes and organizational
   causes representing 14\% and 11\% of all failure causes, respectively.
   The analysis also showed the intricate relationship between technical,
   financial, organizational, social and environmental factors; therefore,
   these different factors need to be integrated and interlinked, rather
   than compartmentalized and separated. This research provided a new
   comprehensive method based on the use of failure mode and effects
   analysis to evaluate the risks to the greening of existing buildings
   using the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating system.
   Workshop participants found failure mode and effects analysis to be an
   excellent method for identifying, evaluating and ranking green building
   certification risks because it helped to foster interdisciplinary
   collaboration between participants from various disciplines, as well as
   between researchers and industry stakeholders. Nevertheless, there is a
   need for future applications of the method to limit the scope of the
   analysis to specific categories or credits of the rating system. This
   narrow scope would facilitate the analysis of the workshop data and
   enable a more in-depth and comprehensive analysis of all risks and risk
   types, including ones that traditionally tend to be ignored, such as
   organizational and social risks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Nonuniform rational b-splines (NURBS) are the most widely used technique
   in today's geometric computer-aided design systems for modeling
   surfaces. Combining the locally corrected Nystrom (LCN) method with
   NURBS requires formulating LCN on both quadrilateral and triangular
   Bezier surfaces, as a typical NURBS-generated Bezier mesh includes
   elements of both the types. While on quadrilateral elements the product
   of 1-D Gaussian quadrature rules can be applied to LCN effectively,
   Gaussian integration rules available for triangles cannot efficiently be
   applied to LCN for two reasons. First, they do not possess the same
   number of quadrature points as the number of functions in a complete set
   of polynomial basis at an arbitrary order. Second, they exacerbate the
   condition number of the resulting matrix equation at higher orders due
   to an increasing density of quadrature points near the edges and corners
   of triangles. In this paper, we construct a new set of quadrature rules
   for Bezier triangles (i.e., degenerate quadrilaterals) based on the
   Newton-Cotes (equidistant) quadrature rules and apply these rules to the
   LCN solution of the electric, magnetic, and combined field integral
   equations. Results show that the new family of quadrature rules
   overcomes both the aforementioned issues and can be applied to LCN
   effectively for orders from 0 to 9, inclusively.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the effect of the Coriolis force on the
   flow field in a rib-roughened channel subjected to either clockwise or
   counter-clockwise system rotation using hybrid RANS/LES based on wall
   modelling. A simplified dynamic forcing scheme incorporating backscatter
   is proposed for the hybrid simulation approach. The flow is
   characterized by a Reynolds number of Re = 1.5 x 10(4) and a rotation
   number Ro ranging from -0.6 to 0.6. The mean flow speed and turbulence
   level near the roughened wall are enhanced under counter-clockwise
   rotation and suppressed under clockwise rotation. The Coriolis force
   significantly influences the stability of the wall shear layer and the
   free shear layers generated by the ribs. Consequently, it is interesting
   to observe that the classification of the roughness type relies not only
   on the pitch ratio, but also on the rotation number in the context of
   rotating rib-roughened flows. In order to validate the present hybrid
   approach, the first-and second-order statistical moments of the velocity
   field obtained from the simulations are thoroughly compared with the
   available laboratory measurement data. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Tall buildings are ubiquitous in major cities and house the homes and
   workplaces of many individuals. However, relatively few studies have
   been carried out to study the dynamic characteristics of tall buildings
   based on field measurements. In this paper, the dynamic behavior of the
   Green Building, a unique 21-story tall structure located on the campus
   of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA),
   was characterized and modeled as a simplified lumped-mass beam model
   (SLMM), using data from a network of accelerometers. The accelerometer
   network was used to record structural responses due to ambient
   vibrations, blast loading, and the October 16th 2012 earthquake near
   Hollis Center (ME, USA). Spectral and signal coherence analysis of the
   collected data was used to identify natural frequencies, modes,
   foundation rocking behavior, and structural asymmetries. A relation
   between foundation rocking and structural natural frequencies was also
   found. Natural frequencies and structural acceleration from the field
   measurements were compared with those predicted by the SLMM which was
   updated by inverse solving based on advanced multiobjective optimization
   methods using the measured structural responses and found to have good
   agreement.}},

Abstract = {{Transmit power optimization or power control plays an important role in
   implementing wireless relay networks since it can significantly improve
   system performance, such as transmission rate, power consumption, etc.
   However, power optimization introduces considerable control channel
   overheads due to exchanging channel state information (CSI) and
   optimization results. In this paper, we aim to design a new power
   optimization scheme to reduce overheads while avoiding a large
   performance loss. We consider a typical three-node amplify-and-forward
   relay network consisting of a source, a relay, and a destination. The
   power of source and that of relay are optimized to minimize the total
   power consumption under the constraint of a minimum transmission rate or
   nonviolation probability. We first define and analyze two schemes based
   on traditional routines, which are called Strategies I and II. In
   Strategy I, transmit power of both source and relay is optimized based
   on instantaneous CSI, whereas in Strategy II, transmit power is based on
   statistical CSI. We then propose a new partial CSI strategy, which is
   called Strategy III, where source power is based on statistical CSI,
   whereas relay power is based on instantaneous CSI. Strategy III is
   formulated and solved by the two-stage stochastic programming method.
   With this new strategy, the control channel overhead can be reduced by
   50\% compared with Strategy I, and at the same time, the potential
   significant performance degradation as in Strategy II can be avoided.
   Simulation results show that the proposed strategy results in
   near-optimal performance when the relay is located close to the source.}},

Abstract = {{The diverse transmit power levels of base stations (BSs) in a multitier
   cellular network, on the one hand, lead to an uneven distribution of
   traffic loads among different BSs when received signal power (RSP)-based
   user association is used. This causes underutilization of resources at
   low-power BSs. On the other hand, strong interference from high-power
   BSs affects downlink transmissions to the users associated with
   low-power BSs. In this context, this paper proposes a
   channel-access-aware (CAA) user association scheme that can
   simultaneously enhance the spectral efficiency (SE) of downlink
   transmission and achieve traffic load balancing among different BSs. The
   CAA scheme is a network-assisted user association scheme that requires
   traffic load information from different BSs, in addition to channel
   quality indicators. We develop a tractable mathematical model to derive
   the SE of the network and the SE of downlink transmission to a user who
   associates with a BS using the proposed CAA scheme considering almost
   blank subframe (ABS)-based interference coordination at a macro BS. The
   framework can model and analyze the individual traffic load
   distributions of different BSs in a two-tier network. The derived
   expressions provide approximate solutions of reasonable accuracy,
   compared with the results obtained from Monte Carlo simulations.
   Numerical results comparatively analyze the gains of the CAA scheme over
   conventional-RSP-based association and biased-RSP-based association.
   Based on this, important insights are extracted, which are related to
   the selection of the proportion of an ABS in various traffic load
   scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The prime objective of this paper is to give some analysis results
   concerning the discrete-time finite-buffer NT-policy queue, which can be
   utilized to determine the optimal threshold values. By recording the
   waiting time of the leading customer in server's vacation period, the
   model is successfully described as a vector-valued Markov chain.
   Meanwhile, depending on the special block structure of the one-step
   transition probability matrix, the equilibrium queue length distribution
   is calculated through a more effective UL-type RG-factorization. Due to
   the number of customers served in the busy period does not have the
   structure of a Galton-Watson branching process, analysis of the
   regeneration cycle is regarded as a difficult problem in establishing
   the cost structure of the queueing system. However, employing the
   concept of i-busy period and some difference equation solving skills,
   the explicit expression for the expected length of the regeneration
   cycle is easily derived, and the stochastic decomposition structure of
   the busy period is also demonstrated. Finally, numerical results are
   offered to illustrate how the direct search method can be implemented to
   obtain the optimal management policy.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of contaminants in wheat reduces its quality and thereby
   its grade. The identification of these contaminants in wheat is
   difficult when they are physically and sometimes visually similar.
   Moreover, manual contaminant identification methods are time-consuming
   and labour intensive. Near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging is an
   advanced image processing technique used effectively for quality
   evaluation of various food and agricultural products. This technique can
   be an effective alternative to the traditionally used manual contaminant
   identification methods. This study reports the performance evaluation of
   the previously developed classification model to differentiate seven
   foreign material types (barley, canola, maize, flaxseed, oats, rye, and
   soybean); six dockage types (broken wheat kernels, buckwheat, chaff,
   wheat spikelets, stones, and wild oats); and two animal excreta types
   (deer and rabbit droppings) from Canada Western Red Spring (CWRS) wheat
   using NIR hyperspectral imaging. The classification model tested in this
   study was developed using standard normal variate (SNV) spectral
   pre-processing technique and k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) classifier. Two
   separate experiments were conducted to identify and quantify (by number)
   the amount of contaminant type present along with wheat. The performance
   of the classification model was compared with the model validation
   results. The results of the developed classification model were very
   close to the model validation results and thus this model can be used
   for the classification of various contaminants in wheat. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{This study presents a framework for the integration of electrified
   light-duty vehicles and intermittent renewable energy towards a
   sustainable transportation system. Batteries of plug-in electric
   vehicles, obtained at their automotive end of life, are repurposed as
   stationary storage systems to integrate with intermittent wind power.
   The objective is to investigate how electric mobility can effectively
   meet the challenges of sustainability when the ultimate goal is to
   displace fossil fuels with new generation of low-cost intermittent
   renewable energy. The developed model of the framework considers future
   market penetration scenarios of electric vehicles, calculates
   availability of batteries at their automotive end of life, and estimates
   the storage capacity required to generate base-load wind power in the
   region of study. A new cost model is proposed to calculate the cost of
   delivering base-load power from renewables when they rely on
   intermittent sources. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
   framework, the renewable energy ratio is used as a measure of
   sustainability. A sample case study is performed for Canada, and the
   results suggest a self-sufficiency of the integrated system to address
   concerns of the impact of vehicular charging energy with renewable
   energy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted for two storage years (2011-12 and 2013-14) to
   determine the changes in grain quality while storing 12\% moisture
   content (m.c., wet basis) canola seeds in silo bags under Canadian
   Prairie conditions. Canola seeds were stored in three silo bags (67
   tonnes per bag) and unloaded at three different times (one bag at a
   time) which represent 20 weeks of storage (unloaded in late winter), 28
   weeks of storage (unloaded in spring) and 40 weeks of storage (unloaded
   after summer storage). Canola seed quality parameters (germination, free
   fatty acid value (FAV), and moisture content), and intergranular
   composition (CO2 and O-2 levels) at different locations in silo bags
   were analysed every two weeks. Temperature of canola seeds at various
   locations in the silo bag was recorded every 30 min. The germination of
   canola seeds at most parts of the silo bags stayed above a safe level up
   to late winter (20 weeks of storage). At the top layer of the silo bags,
   germination of canola seeds decreased to below 30\% during summer
   storage (after 40 weeks of storage). Moisture content of canola seeds
   increased at the top layer in both storage years. The FAV values
   remained at safe levels until 20 weeks of storage, and increased more
   than two times the initial values after summer storage. The commercial
   grades after first, second and third unloading (after 20, 28 and 40
   weeks of storage) were Grade 1, Grade 2 and Feed Grade, respectively, in
   year 1. Whereas for year 2, these were Grade 1, Grade 1 and Grade 2
   after first, second and third unloading, respectively. The grain quality
   analysis and commercial grading results indicated that ambient
   temperature had a major role in quality of canola during storage. Crown

Abstract = {{A passive wireless sensor for the measurement of ac electric fields
   emanating from high-voltage (HV) apparatus using radio-frequency (RF)
   resonant cavities is presented. The sensor is composed of a coaxial
   transmission line resonator, where the resonant frequency is perturbed
   by capacitively coupled varactors. HV apparatus induces a bias voltage
   on the varactors through capacitively coupled electric fields. A printed
   circuit board on the top of the cavity provides coupling between the
   cavity and varactors and also between the varactors and the external
   electric field. The sensor is designed with a resonant frequency in the
   range of 2.4-2.5 GHz in the industrial, scientific, and medical band.
   Using capacitive coupling to an HV transmission line with 60 Hz at 1.7
   kV, a resonant frequency shift of 7.2 (kHz)/12.5 (V/m) was obtained. The
   resonance frequency is determined remotely by sending pulses of RF
   signal to the sensor and recording the ring back of the resonator. RF
   pulses, with a frequency of 2455 MHz, are used to remotely interrogate
   the sensor at a repetition rate of 2.5 MHz and a pulsewidth of 100 ns.
   Downconverting the received signal, a ring back signal is recorded whose
   analysis determines the resonant frequency.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a compact ac/dc electric field sensor with
   adjustable sensitivity and measurement range. The sensor is fabricated
   using an SOI micromachining process, and consists of a metallized
   membrane supported by micro-springs. The sensor operates by monitoring
   membrane displacement due to incident electric fields. Unlike field
   mills, this sensor does not have rotating parts, avoiding associated
   wear and maintenance issues. High sensitivity is achieved by using a
   laser position monitoring system. Modulation of the incident electric
   field with a bias voltage on the sensing membrane is used to give the
   sensor a wide measurement range, from sub-1 V/m to MV/m. Bench top
   experimental measurements with both dc and ac fields demonstrated a
   resolution of 0.1 V/m and sensitivity of 180 mV/(V/m), with the sensor
   operating at resonance. Measurements under 20 kV simulated power line 75
   cm from the sensor demonstrated a resolution of 17 Vim and sensitivity
   of 360 mV/(kV/m). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic resonance of a fluid-filled tube with closed and open outlet
   ends for zero and turbulent mean flows is investigated both
   experimentally and numerically for different wall materials and
   thicknesses. The main goal is to create a data bank of acoustic wave
   resonance in fluid-filled tubes at a frequency range of 20-500 Hz to
   validate and verify numerical prediction models used by the nuclear
   industry and to determine if there is a better method with existing
   technology. The experimental results show that there is a strong effect
   of turbulent flow, wall material, and wall thickness on resonant
   amplitudes at frequencies above similar to 250 Hz. A numerical
   investigation is performed solving the linear wave equation with
   constant and frequency-dependent damping terms and a computational fluid
   dynamic (CFD) code. Comparing the one-dimensional (1D) and CFD results
   shows that CFD solution yields better predictions of both resonant
   frequency and amplitude than the 1D solution without the need for
   simplified added damping methods, which are required by the 1D
   methodology. This finding is valid especially for frequencies higher

Abstract = {{In this paper, the geometrical properties of the subgrid-scale (SGS)
   stress tensor are investigated through its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
   The concepts of Euler rotation angle and axis are utilized to
   investigate the relative rotation of the eigenframe of the SGS stress
   tensor with respect to that of the resolved strain rate tensor. Both
   Euler rotation angle and axis are natural invariants of the rotation
   matrix, which uniquely describe the topological relation between the
   eigenframes of these two tensors. Different from the reference frame
   fixed to a rigid body, the eigenframe of a tensor consists of three
   orthonormal eigenvectors, which by their nature are subjected to
   directional aliasing. In order to describe the geometric relationship
   between the SGS stress and resolved strain rate tensors, an effective
   method is proposed to uniquely determine the topology of the
   eigenframes. The proposed method has been used for testing three SGS
   stress models in the context of homogeneous isotropic turbulence at
   three Reynolds numbers, using both a priori and a posteriori approaches.}},

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{The main focus of this paper is to investigate the impact of fuel type
   on HCCI combustion under different engine loads. A coupled chemical
   kinetics-computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model is developed to
   investigate the combustion performance and emissions characteristics of
   a HCCI engine with pre-combustion chamber fueled with natural gas,
   natural gas/10\% dimethyl ether (DME) mixtures, or methanol. The
   simulation results indicate that the probability of partial combustion
   increases when using natural gas under low engine load. However,
   methanol and natural gas/DME experience complete combustion under low
   engine load. In contrast, for both methanol and natural gas/DME the rate
   of pressure rise and heat release at high engine load is very high which
   induces engine knock. At leaner mixtures (ER < 0.26), natural gas/DME
   attains the highest indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) compared to
   that of methanol and natural gas. However, natural gas fueled HCCI
   engine has the highest IMEP under rich mixture conditions (ER > 0.26).
   NOx emissions of natural gas fueled HCCI engine are much lower than that
   of methanol and natural gas/DME, especially at high engine loads.
   However, natural gas/DME and methanol offer superior combustion control
   and NOx, carbon monoxide (CO), and unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions
   under low to moderate engine loads. However, the use of natural gas in
   HCCI combustion is suitable for moderate to high engine loads. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The engineered cardiac patch (ECP) is a promising strategy to repair
   infarct myocardium and restore the cardiac function. An ideal ECP should
   be able to mimic the primary attributes of native myocardium, which
   includes a high resilience, good cardiomyocyte adhesion, and synchronous
   contraction. Here, a mussel-inspired dopamine crosslinker is used to
   integrate polypyrrole (Ppy) nanoparticles, gelatin-methyacrylate, and
   poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate into a cryogel form. The dopamine
   crosslinker and Ppy nanoparticles are coordinated to obtain optimal
   mechanical and superelastic properties for the ECP. The dopamine
   facilitates the uniform distribution of the Ppy nanoparticles, which
   migrate and fuse from the scaffold to the surface of the cardiomyocytes,
   revealing a potential mechanism for restoring infarct myocardium. The
   incorporated Ppy nanoparticles thus significantly enhance the
   functionalization of the cardiomyocytes, resulting in excellent
   synchronous contraction by increasing the expression of -actinin and
   CX-43. Cardiomyocytes-loaded ECP can improve the cardiac function in
   myocardial-infarction (MI) affected rat models. The results show that
   the fractional shortening and ejection fraction are elevated by about
   50\% and that the infarct size is reduced by 42.6\%. Collectively, this
   study highlights an effective cardiac patch based on mussel-inspired
   conductive particle adhesion and a superelastic cryogel promising for
   the restoration of infarcted myocardium.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a game theoretic relay load balancing and power
   allocationscheme is proposed for downlink transmission in a
   decode-and-forward orthogonal frequency division multiple access-based
   cellular relay network. A system with a base station communicating with
   multiple users via multiple relays is considered. The relays have
   limited power, which must be divided among the users they support. In
   traditional scheme, each relay simply divides its transmit power equally
   among all its users. Moreover, each user selects the relay with the
   highest channel gain. In this work, we do not apply the traditional
   relay scheme. It is because the users are distributed randomly, and by
   applying the traditional relay selection scheme, it may happen that some
   relays have more users connected to them than other relays, which
   results in having unbalanced load among the relays. In order to avoid
   performance degradation, achieve relay load balancing, and maximize the
   total data rate of the network, a game theoretic approach is proposed,
   which efficiently assigns the users to relays. The power of each relay
   is wisely distributed among users by the efficient power allocation
   scheme. Simulation results indicate that the proposed game-based scheme
   can considerably improve the average sum-spectral efficiency. Moreover,
   it shows that by applying the game, users who can connect to uncongested
   relays join them as opposed to connecting to congested relays. Copyright

Abstract = {{In this work, the adsorption of protein on a Au surface coated by
   self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiol chains is studied by
   molecular dynamics simulations with an all-atom model. Particularly, a
   more realistic embedded-atom method potential has been used to
   characterize the Au-Au interactions in the system as compared to
   previous studies. With this all-atom model, many experimental
   observations have been reproduced from the simulations. It is found that
   the SAMs have the lowest adsorption energy on the Au(111) surface where
   the alkanethiol chains form a well ordered (root 3x root 3)R30 degrees
   triangular lattice at 300 K. Furthermore, it is confirmed that
   carboxyl-terminated SAMs are more effective to absorb proteins than the
   methyl-terminated SAMs. On the basis of the simulation results, we
   propose that the experimentally observed aggregation of protein-Au
   nanoparticle conjugates is mainly due to the electrostatic interactions
   between protein amino acids and carboxyl-terminated SAMs from multiple
   Au surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Topology control is important for heterogeneous sensor networks in order
   to minimize the total network power consumption under the constraint
   that all sensor nodes' connectivity requirements are satisfied. To
   address this issue, an optimization problem is first formulated, which
   is formally proved to be NP-hard. For practical applications, an
   effective solution, named topology adaptation algorithm (TAA), is
   proposed. TAA adopts both graph theory and maximum flow theory to find
   prespecified node disjoint paths with low time complexity and high
   network power efficiency. In order to further save the network power
   consumption, a judgment theory is proposed to remove any unnecessary
   long edges at the beginning without affecting network connectivity. Both
   theoretical and numeric results show that the proposed topology control
   algorithm can outperform counterparts in terms of the total network
   power consumption, the percentage of supernodes achieving
   k-connectivity, the average degree of nodes, and the average length of
   paths.}},

   with monolithic metallic glasses. It was found that long CNTs
   dramatically increased the stiffness and yield strength of the metallic
   glass, and improved their elastic region of deformation and ability to
   absorb energy. In contrast, metallic glasses reinforced with short CNTs
   showed almost no improvement of mechanical properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUN 14}},
Abstract = {{It is well established that obesity decreases overall life expectancy
   and increases the risk of several adverse health conditions. Mounting
   evidence indicates that body fat is likely also associated with
   structural and functional brain changes, reduced cognitive function, and
   greater impulsivity. However, previously reported differences in brain
   structure and function have been variable across studies and difficult
   to reconcile due to sample population and methodological differences. To
   clarify these issues, we correlated two independent measures of body
   composition-i.e., body mass index (BMI) and body fat percent (BFP)-with
   structural and functional neuroimaging data obtained from a cohort of 32
   neurologically healthy adults. Whole-brain voxel-wise analyses indicated
   that higher BMI and BFP were associated with widespread decreases in
   gray matter volume, white matter volume, and white matter microstructure
   (including several regions, such as the striatum and orbitofrontal
   cortex, which may influence value assessment, habit formation, and
   decision-making). Moreover, closer examination of resting state
   functional connectivity, white matter volume, and white matter
   microstructure throughout the default mode network (DMN), executive
   control network (ECN), and salience network (SN) revealed that higher
   BMI and BFP were associated with increased SN functional connectivity
   and decreased white matter volumes throughout all three networks (i.e.,
   the DMN, ECN, and SN). Taken together, these findings: (1) offer a
   biologically plausible explanation for reduced cognitive performance,
   greater impulsivity, and altered reward processing among overweight
   individuals, and (2) suggest neurobiological mechanisms (i.e., altered
   functional and structural brain connectivity) that may affect overweight
   individuals' ability to establish and maintain healthy lifestyle
   choices.}},

Abstract = {{Given an irreducible stochastic matrix M, Kemeny's constant K(M)
   measures the expected time for the corresponding Markov chain to
   transition from any given initial state to a randomly chosen final
   state. A combinatorially based expression for K (M) is provided in terms
   of the weights of certain directed forests in a directed graph
   associated with M, yielding a particularly simple expression in the
   special case that M is the transition matrix for a random walk on a
   tree. An analogue of Braess' paradox is investigated, whereby inserting
   an edge into an undirected graph can increase the value of Kemeny's
   constant for the corresponding random walk. It is shown in particular
   that for almost all trees, there is an edge whose insertion increases
   the corresponding value of Kemeny's constant. Finally, it is proven that
   for any m is an element of N, almost every tree T has the property that
   there are at least m trees, none of which are isomorphic to T, such that
   the values of Kemeny's constant for the corresponding random walks
   coincide with the value of Kemeny's constant for the random walk on T.
   Several illustrative examples are included.}},

Abstract = {{Neutrophil migration and chemotaxis are fundamentally important
   biological processes and have direct relevance to various health
   problems. Microfluidic devices provide useful experimental tools for the
   quantitative analysis of neutrophil chemotaxis in controlled
   microenvironments. However, such experiments often require specialized
   research facilities and lengthy cell preparation from a large amount of
   blood. In this paper, we report a new, yet simple, all-on-chip method
   for the magnetic isolation of untouched neutrophils directly from small
   volumes of blood, followed by chemotaxis testing on the same
   microfluidic device. Furthermore, we incorporated a cell-docking
   structure to the microfluidic device for better control of the cells'
   initial positions before the chemotaxis test and for improved data
   analysis. The whole experiment can be performed in less than 25 minutes.
   We successfully validated this method by testing neutrophil chemotaxis
   to both purified chemoattractant ( i.e. fMLP) and clinical samples (
   sputum from patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, COPD).
   Thus, the ``all-on-chip{''} method can be a useful tool for research and
   clinical applications that require rapid and accurate chemotaxis testing
   of untouched neutrophils.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach for inspecting the condition of porcelain insulators
   based on statistical analysis of electromagnetic radiations of live
   insulators is proposed in this paper. Realistic replicas of punctured
   and contaminated insulators were created in the laboratory following IEC
   standards. These defective insulators were tested under high voltage
   stress while the electromagnetic radiations originated from the partial
   discharge activities on the insulators were captured using an electric
   field sensor. During the experiments, a multitude of tests were
   conducted and resulted in measuring and recording a total of 410,000
   cycles of discharge activities. A feature extraction algorithm was
   developed to calculate the statistical features of the phase resolved
   interpretation of partial discharge pulses. The results of analyzing the
   extracted features from the radiated signature of defective insulators
   indicate that the scale and shape parameters of a two-sided Weibull
   distribution function, fit to the recorded measurements, entail distinct
   information about the source of discharges that can be used to identify
   the source of defects. Based on the library of features extracted from
   the recorded electromagnetic radiations, a support vector machine (SVM)
   classifier was developed which can successfully classify the radiation
   signature of punctured and contaminated insulators.}},

Abstract = {{To establish the design requirements for an MR-compatible haptic
   hand-controller, this paper measures magnitudes and frequency bands of
   three mechanical motion and interaction components during the
   performance of neurosurgical tasks on a cadaveric brain. The
   hand-controller would allow the performance of virtual neurosurgical
   tasks within the bore of a high field magnet during image acquisition,
   i.e., functional MRI. The components are the position and the
   orientation of a surgical tool, and the force interaction between the
   tool and the brain tissue. A bipolar forceps was retrofitted with a
   tracking system and a set of force sensing components to measure
   displacements and forces, respectively. Results showed working
   positional, rotational, and force frequency bands of 3, 3 and 5 Hz,
   respectively. Peak forces of 1.4, 2.9 and 3.0 N were measured in the
   Cartesian coordinate system. A workspace of 50.1 x 39.8 x 58.2 mm(3) and
   orientation ranges of 40.4 degrees, 60.1 degrees and 63.1 degrees for
   azimuth, elevation, and roll angles were observed. The results

Abstract = {{The inversion of the monostatic normalized radar cross section (NRCS)
   data collected by an on-site C-band scatterometer and also RADARSAT-2
   satellite are investigated to reconstruct some parameters of interest
   associated with landfast snow-covered sea ice in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut,
   Canada. The parameters of interest are temperature, density, salinity,
   and snow grain size. To this end, this remote sensing problem is cast as
   an inverse scattering problem in which a data misfit cost functional is
   to be minimized using a differential evolution algorithm. This
   minimization requires repetitive calls to an appropriate electromagnetic
   forward solver. The utilized electromagnetic forward solver attempts to
   model both surface and volume scattering components associated with the
   irradiated rough multilayered medium under investigation. The
   reconstruction results demonstrate the ability of this inversion
   algorithm to retrieve the parameters of interest with reasonable
   accuracy. In particular, the best performance of the inversion algorithm
   occurs when both the scatterometer and satellite NRCS data are
   simultaneously used in the inversion process.}},

Abstract = {{The need for extra spectrum and the fact that a large amount of spectrum
   below 6 GHz is allocated to radar systems has motivated regulatory
   bodies and researchers to investigate the feasibility of dynamic
   spectrum access in radar bands. To design efficient wireless
   communication schemes that coexist with radar systems, it is essential
   that the wireless community thoroughly understand the operations of
   these systems in different bands. This article studies incumbent
   operations and usage patterns in the 5 GHz band, where weather radar
   systems dominate, dynamic frequency selection is employed as a sharing
   mechanism, and recent works have explored the possibility to temporally
   share the spectrum with such radar systems. We present a
   measurement-based study of spectrum usage by a weather radar in Finland.
   Our measurement results show that the weather radar's scan patterns are
   quasi-periodic, and that use of sensing may not reliably detect radar
   signals due to its quasi-periodic scanning patterns and different
   vertical scanning angles. Finally, we present a framework for a
   database-assisted temporal sharing coexistence mechanism that takes into
   account the real occupancy behavior of the radar.}},

Abstract = {{services, next generation wireless networks are expected to be able to
   deliver high data rates while wireless resources become more and more
   scarce. This requires the next generation wireless networks to move
   toward new networking paradigms that are able to efficiently support
   resource-demanding applications such as personalized mobile services.
   Examples of such paradigms foreseen for the emerging 5G cellular
   networks include very densely deployed small cells and device-to-device
   communications. For 5G networks, it will be imperative to search for
   spectrum and energy-efficient solutions to the resource allocation
   problems that i) are amenable to distributed implementation, ii) are
   capable of dealing with uncertainty and lack of information, and iii)
   can cope with users' selfishness. The core objective of this article is
   to investigate and establish the potential of the MAB framework to
   address this challenge. In particular, we provide a brief tutorial on
   bandit problems, including different variations and solution approaches.
   Furthermore, we discuss recent applications as well as future research
   directions. In addition, we provide a detailed example of using an MAB
   model for energy-efficient small cell activation in 5G networks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an assessment of the seismic performance of concrete
   columns internally reinforced with glass-fiber-reinforced polymers
   (GFRP) bars. Eight full-scale column prototypes with 1,650-mm shear span
   and 350-mm square cross-section were constructed and tested under
   combined lateral cyclic quasi-static and constant axial loading. The
   test specimens represent the lower portion of first-story columns
   between the footing and the contra-flexure point. The test parameters
   included longitudinal reinforcement type and ratio, level of axial load,
   and stirrup spacing. Test results showed that the drift capacity of
   GFRP-reinforced concrete (RC) rectangular columns at failure ranged
   between 8.5 and 12.5\%, which exceeds the limitations of North American
   building codes. This indicates that the deformability of GFRP-RC column
   prototypes successfully replaced the ductility in steel-RC columns in
   dissipating the seismic energy in the presence of constant axial load.
   Furthermore, there was insignificant strength degradation before failure
   due to the well-confined concrete core. (C) 2015 American Society of

Abstract = {{Flow characteristics associated with spillways are important to restore
   ecological connectivity because spillways can either constrain or offer
   safe routes for downstream passage of fish. We studied the hydrodynamics
   of flow and downstream movement behaviour of the catadromous European
   eel (Anguilla anguilla) and the potamodromous Iberian barbel
   (Luciobarbus bocagei) in spillways with upstream face inclinations of
   =90 degrees (standard) 45 degrees and 30 degrees (modified). The
   standard spillway was tested for two water depths (H=32 and 42cm).
   Modified spillways facilitated downstream passage and reduced delay
   times of passage of the European eel. Upstream of the 90 degrees
   spillway, distinct recirculation areas were observed, and associated
   turbulence strongly hampered downstream passage of fish. Both species
   were found to avoid turbulence, but barbel displayed stronger avoidance
   for areas of rapid changes in flow velocity when comparing to eels.
   Overall, eels were faster in passing the spillway and had a higher
   downstream passage success (80\%) than barbel (32\%). Eels were
   predominantly thigmotactic in contrast to barbel, which showed limited
   contact with structures. The results suggest that modified spillways may
   enhance passage survival. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a distributed opportunistic medium access control (MAC)
   scheme for maximizing the expected aggregate throughput in a
   multichannel wireless network such as a clustered orthogonal
   frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) network. In our proposed
   scheme, each user attempts to send only on its best channel and
   transmits if the best-channel gain is higher than a given threshold,
   which is dynamically updated depending on previous idle and collision
   situations. In this way, with our proposed scheme, in a homogeneous
   system where the channel fading distribution is identical for all users,
   the best user for each channel is obtained in a distributed manner. We
   also obtain the optimal values of the thresholds so that the probability
   of successful transmission is maximized and a minimal number of
   transmission opportunities are wasted (e.g., due to collision or idle
   transmissions). In the asymptotic limit of a large number of users and
   sufficiently long transmission slot duration, we show that, in
   comparison with the optimal centralized scheme, the throughput loss for
   our proposed scheme goes to zero. Furthermore, we extend our distributed
   opportunistic MAC scheme for a homogeneous system to that for a
   heterogeneous system where the channel fading distribution is
   heterogeneous across users. Throughput performances and signaling
   overhead are analyzed for the proposed distributed MAC schemes and
   compared with those of the existing schemes. Simulation results show
   that our proposed schemes significantly improve the average aggregate
   throughput when compared with the existing schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Treating bone defects in the presence of infection is a formidable
   clinical challenge. The use of a biomaterial with the dual function of
   bone regeneration and infection control is a novel therapeutic approach
   to this problem. In this Study, we fabricated an innovative,
   dual-function biocomposite hydrogel containing nano silver and
   nanosilica (nAg/nSiO(2)) particles and evaluated, its characteristics
   using FT-IR, SEM, swelling ratio, and stiffness assays. The in vitro
   antibacterial analysis showed that this nAg/nSiO(2) hydrogel inhibited
   both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, this
   nontoxic material could promote osteogenic differentiation of rat bone
   marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). We then created infected bone defects in
   rat calvaria in order to evaluate the function of the hydrogel in vivo.
   The hydrogel demonstrated effective antibacterial ability while
   promoting bone regeneration in these defects. Our results indicate that
   this nAg/nSiO(2) hydrogel has the potential to both control infection
   and to promote bone healing in contaminated defects.}},

Abstract = {{A novel high-gain circular microstrip radiator is proposed. The antenna
   consists of two circular discs, in a stacked configuration, designed to
   operate in TM11 and TM13 modes. The patches are designed, so that the
   resonant frequencies for both modes converge into a single frequency. It
   is found that by simultaneous excitation of both resonant modes, high
   gain and low sidelobe level (SLL) can be obtained in the radiation
   patterns. Excitation is done using a single coaxial feed. The
   fundamental working principle of the antenna is based on the
   superposition of radiated far fields of the TM11 and TM13 modes. At
   first, through a pattern synthesis, using different far field mode
   amplitude ratios, it is shown that the substrate dielectric constants
   can be selected for both layers such that it leads to low SLL. Next, for
   practical antenna design, the mode excitation, input impedance, and
   radiation properties of the TM13 mode are studied. For sound
   understanding and explanation, the edge voltage ratio at the aperture
   and mode amplitude ratio in the far field are calculated and their
   effects on SLL and peak directivity are discussed. Finally, the
   measurements results are provided in support of simulations.}},

Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{The objective of our study was to decrease the wound adherence of
   commercial silver based wound dressings by depositing a non-adherent
   layer. Our hypothesis was that this non-adherent layer will lower the
   dressing's adherence to burn wounds without compromising the
   antimicrobial activity or increasing the cytotoxicity.
   A polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogel layer was grafted on two commercial
   silver antimicrobial dressings (silver nanocrystal dressing (NC) and
   silver plated dressing (SP)) using a proprietary technique. The grafted
   PAM served as the non-adherent layer. Dressing adherence was measured
   with a previously published in vitro gelatin model using an Instron
   mechanical force testing instrument. The dressings were challenged with
   two clinically retrieved bacterial strains (Methicillin-resistant
   Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa) with both a disk diffusion test, and a suspension
   antibacterial test. The cytotoxicity of samples to human neonatal
   fibroblast cells was evaluated with
   3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
   assay.
   Both untreated dressings showed high peeling energy: 2070 +/- 453 J/m(2)
   (NC) and 669 +/- 68 J/m(2) (SP), that decreased to 158 +/- 119 J/m(2)
   (NC) and 155 +/- 138 J/m(2) (SP) with the PAM deposition. Addition of
   the PAM caused no significant difference in zone of inhibition (ZOI)
   (disk diffusion test) or antibacterial kinetics (suspension test)
   against both bacteria (p > 0.05, n = 6) in either dressing. Survival of
   fibroblasts was improved by the PAM grafting from 48 +/- 5\% to 60 +/-
   3\% viable cells in the case of NC and from 55 +/- 8\% to 61 +/- 4\%
   viable cells in SP (p < 0.05, n = 12).
   It was concluded that PAM as a non-adherent layer significantly
   decreases the adherence of these two commercial antimicrobial dressings
   in an in vitro gelatin model while preserving their antimicrobial
   efficacy, and reducing their cytotoxicity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and

Title = {{Towards a fourth spatial dimension of brain activity}},

Abstract = {{Current advances in neurosciences deal with the functional architecture
   of the central nervous system, paving the way for general theories that
   improve our understanding of brain activity. From topology, a strong
   concept comes into play in understanding brain functions, namely, the 4D
   space of a ``hypersphere's torus{''}, undetectable by observers living
   in a 3D world. The torus may be compared with a video game with biplanes
   in aerial combat: when a biplane flies off one edge of gaming display,
   it does not crash but rather it comes back from the opposite edge of the
   screen. Our thoughts exhibit similar behaviour, i.e. the unique ability
   to connect past, present and future events in a single, coherent picture
   as if we were allowed to watch the three screens of past-present-future
   ``glued{''} together in a mental kaleidoscope. Here we hypothesize that
   brain functions are embedded in a imperceptible fourth spatial dimension
   and propose a method to empirically assess its presence. Neuroimaging
   fMRI series can be evaluated, looking for the topological hallmark of
   the presence of a fourth dimension. Indeed, there is a typical feature
   which reveal the existence of a functional hypersphere: the simultaneous
   activation of areas opposite each other on the 3D cortical surface. Our
   suggestion-substantiated by recent findings-that brain activity takes
   place on a closed, donut-like trajectory helps to solve long-standing
   mysteries concerning our psychological activities, such as
   mind-wandering, memory retrieval, consciousness and dreaming state.}},

Title = {{Low wall shear stress predominates at sites of abdominal aortic aneurysm
   rupture}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Aortic diameter as the primary criterion in the decision to
   repair abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) has drawbacks as some rupture
   below size thresholds, whereas others reach extreme size without
   rupture. Predictions of static aortic wall stress have also failed to
   reliably predict rupture potential. The objective of this study was to
   computationally assess blood flow characteristics at the site of
   infrarenal AAA rupture. On the basis of the finite element literature
   correlating rupture location with high static local wall stress, we
   hypothesized that a computational fluid dynamics approach would also
   demonstrate rupture at regions of high pressure and wall shear stress
   (WSS).
   Methods: Three-dimensional AAA geometry was generated from computed
   tomography angiography images of seven ruptured AAAs. Aortic blood flow
   velocity, pressure, and WSS were computationally determined. Flow
   characteristics at the site of rupture were determined and compared
   across all cases.
   Results: AAA size at the time of rupture was 8.3 +/- 0.9 cm. Only three
   of the seven AAAs ruptured at the site of maximal diameter. Blood flow
   velocity in the aneurysmal aorta showed dominant flow channels with
   zones of recirculation, where low WSS predominated. Regardless of
   aneurysm size or configuration, rupture occurred in or near these flow
   recirculation zones in all cases. WSS was significantly lower and
   thrombus deposition was more abundant at the site of rupture.
   Conclusions: This computational study was the first to assess blood flow
   characteristics at the site of infrarenal AAA rupture in realistic
   aortic geometries. In contradiction to our initial hypothesis, rupture
   occurred not at sites of high pressure and WSS but rather at regions of
   predicted flow recirculation, where low WSS and thrombus deposition
   predominated. These findings raise the possibility that this flow
   pattern may lead to thrombus deposition, which may elaborate adventitial
   degeneration and eventual AAA rupture.}},

Abstract = {{Mulching and soil water content (SWC) have a significant impact on soil
   erosion, and this study investigated the effect of straw mulching on
   water infiltration and soil loss under different initial SWC treatments
   in a rainfall simulation experiment conducted in northern China.
   Increasing initial SWC can decrease soil infiltration and increase soil
   loss. During an 80mm rainfall event (80 mm.h(-1) for 60 min), 8\%, 12\%
   and 16\% initial SWC treatments decreased cumulative infiltration by
   8.7\%, 42.5\% and 58.1\%, and increased total sediment yield by 44, 146
   and 315 g, respectively, compared to 4\% initial SWC. However, in all
   the straw mulching treatments, there was no significant difference in
   stable infiltration rate between the different initial SWC treatments.
   For all initial SWC treatments, straw mulching of 30\% or more
   significantly enhanced water infiltration by over 31\% and reduced soil
   loss by over 49\%, compared to the unmulched treatment. Taking into
   consideration the performance of no-till planters, a maize straw
   mulching rate of 30\% to 60\% (1400-3100 kg.hm(-2)) is recommended for
   the conservation of water and soil in northern China.}},

   The proposed active snubber cell can be applied in different dc-dc

Title = {{Single-support heel-off: a crucial gait event helps realizing agile and
   energy-efficient bipedal walking}},
Journal = {{ROBOTICA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1335-1350}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Single-support heel-off occurs when the heel of the trailing leg has
   been lifted from the ground around its toe, while the leading leg is
   still swinging forward. A similar gait event occurs during human
   walking, and is crucial to achieve a longer step length and a higher
   walking speed. In this paper, this crucial gait event is studied,
   specifically in how it influences the agility and the energy efficiency
   of bipedal walking. Toward this goal, the concept of limit-cycle bipedal
   walking which possesses natural and energy-efficient gaits is employed.
   The aforementioned concept is applied to a flat-foot bipedal model which
   is developed and actuated by a constant hip torque only during the
   single-support phase to walk on the ground. The impedance of each ankle
   is adjusted by using two springs, one at the back-side and the other at
   the front-side, as well as one damper. In comparison with point/round
   foot bipedal models, the flat-foot bipedal model produces more versatile
   limit-cycle gaits comprised of a number of gait series, each of which is
   a sequence detected among twelve gait postures dictated by the kinetics
   of the unilateral constraints at the heel, toe, or both. As a result of
   comprehensive simulations, it is concluded that single-support heel-off
   significantly improves the agility of bipedal walking because of the
   increase in the step length and the walking speed. Furthermore, even
   though limit-cycle gaits including single-support heel-off require
   higher energy input as compared with gaits excluding such an event,
   single-support heel-off significantly improves the energy efficiency of
   bipedal walking since the increase in the step length dominates the
   increase in the energy input.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{192-202}},

Abstract = {{Seismic fragility was estimated for a controlled high-rise building
   using 200 kN magnetorheological (MR) dampers with direct
   performance-based design (DPBD) to assess seismic vulnerability and to
   validate the performance of the DPBD which was previously developed. The
   DPBD offers multiple control design layouts for various performance
   levels subjected to different hazard levels using multi-objective
   optimization approaches. These multiple control design layouts for the
   given performance levels need to be validated using random seismic
   excitations because those performance-based designs (PBD) had been
   devolved based on the specific strength of design objective earthquakes
   (i.e., hazard levels) from the DPBD. In order to evaluate those PBD
   cases using MR dampers, two different approaches for fragility
   estimation of the four PBD cases under two hazard levels are conducted:
   traditional approach using the overall maximum interstory drift and
   system reliability approach which considers multiple limit states
   associated with the maximum interstory drift for stories within the
   entire system. The results are compared using 41 earthquake ground
   motions. From this study, overall seismic fragility relations have been
   derived from extensive fragility analyses in terms of broad range of
   hazard levels for multiple performance levels which were achieved by new
   direct performance-based design using MR dampers. Moreover, it is
   observed that the multiple performance-based control design cases
   obtained from DPBD clearly show significant reduction in seismic
   vulnerability compared to the uncontrolled case. It also shows different
   seismic fragility estimates against seismic hazards reflecting the
   performance enhancement based on the initial objective of the DPBD.
   Based on the results, the system reliability approach can identify the
   stories that have close interstory drifts to the overall maximum value
   allowing for more accurate estimates of the seismic fragility of
   multi-story buildings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical study is performed for 2-D axisymmetric turbulent flow of
   supercritical water flowing upward in a vertical pipe with constant
   applied wall heat flux. This study uses Computational Fluid Dynamics
   (CFD) to analyze supercritical flow instability in a vertical heated
   channel. The governing equations are solved using two RANS models in the
   CFD code ANSYS CFX v14.5. Analyses of static and oscillatory flow
   instabilities are performed using the standard k-epsilon model with a
   scalable wall-function and the k-omega-based SST model. The instability
   threshold results of the CFD code are compared with 1-D non-linear code
   predictions. Also, criteria for approximating the thresholds of static
   and oscillatory instabilities based on steady-state results are assessed
   and discussed. The effect of changing the turbulent Prandtl number
   (Pr-t) on the instability threshold is also examined. It was observed
   that the instability threshold results obtained using the k-epsilon and
   the SST models are similar. Also, the results of the CFD and 1-D codes
   are different due mainly to the different pressure drop predictions
   between the two methodologies. Comparisons of instability threshold
   predictions between CFD and 1-D codes showed smaller differences for
   static instabilities and greater differences for oscillatory
   instabilities. In addition, approximating the flow instability threshold
   by the criteria proposed generally holds true for a CFD solution.
   Results also indicate that the value of Prt does not have a noticeable
   effect on the instability threshold for the cases examined in the
   present study. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Parameter identification for advanced friction models is the most
   demanding task and involves a wide range of experimental dynamic
   analysis. The identification results directly affect the quality of the
   friction model and significantly depend on the setup. While many setups
   have been proposed to investigate the various characteristics of
   friction, rather less attention has been paid to designing one that is
   practical for parameter identification dedicated to certain common
   models. An experimental setup featuring simplicity, flexibility and good
   versatility is proposed here. The setup consists of a mass block
   connected to a motor-powered ball screw mechanism. Such a block slides
   on a metal base and the friction at the contact junction is varied
   accordingly. The materials and lubricants in the contact surface can be
   easily altered if needed. A capacitance displacement sensor is designed
   and installed at where the precise presliding profiles can be captured.
   The experimental setup, the calibration procedure for the displacement
   sensor and the experimental results are presented. It is shown that the
   experimental data produced by our setup leads to the success in
   parameter identification procedures of the selected friction models.
   Some limitations of the friction models, from the perspective of
   parameter identification, are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In recent years, the study of the shear strength of soil with
   geosynthetics has caught the attention of scholars. In this study, by
   changing the traditional geogrid structure and adding polymeric anchors
   to the reinforcement grid, naming it Grid-Anchor (G-A), it is sought to
   experimentally analyze the performance of this new system by increasing
   the Coefficient of Interaction Ratio in Direct Shear (CIRDS). To achieve
   this, 16 large-scale direct shear tests were conducted on a typical
   geogrid and G-A system. The results of this showed that CIRDS is, on
   average, 1.45 times greater. In other words, the interaction between
   soil and the reinforcement in G-A system increases by almost 50\%
   compared to that of typical geogrid regarding direct shear mechanism.

Title = {{Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of core metabolism in Clostridium
   termitidis CT1112 during growth on alpha-cellulose, xylan, cellobiose
   and xylose}},
Journal = {{BMC MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAY 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Clostridium termitidis CT1112 is an anaerobic,
   Gram-positive, mesophilic, spore-forming, cellulolytic bacterium,
   originally isolated from the gut of a wood feeding termite Nasusitermes
   lujae. It has the ability to hydrolyze both cellulose and hemicellulose,
   and ferment the degradation products to acetate, formate, ethanol,
   lactate, H-2, and CO2. It is therefore ges in gene and gene product
   expression during growth of C. termitidis on cellobiose, xylose, xylan,
   and alpha-cellulose.
   Results: Correlation of transcriptome and proteome data with growth and
   fermentation profiles identified putative carbon-catabolism pathways in
   C. termitidis. The majority of the proteins associated with central
   metabolism were detected in high abundance. While major differences were
   not observed in gene and gene-product expression for enzymes associated
   with metabolic pathways under the different substrate conditions,
   xylulokinase and xylose isomerase of the pentose phosphate pathway were
   found to be highly up-regulated on five carbon sugars compared to
   hexoses. In addition, genes and gene-products associated with a variety
   of cellulosome and non-cellulosome associated CAZymes were found to be
   differentially expressed. Specifically, genes for cellulosomal enzymes
   and components were highly expressed on alpha-cellulose, while xylanases
   and glucosidases were up-regulated on 5 carbon sugars with respect to
   cellobiose. Chitinase and cellobiophosphorylases were the predominant
   CAZymes expressed on cellobiose. In addition to growth on xylan, the
   simultaneous consumption of two important lignocellulose constituents,
   cellobiose and xylose was also demonstrated.
   Conclusion: There are little changes in core-metabolic pathways under
   the different carbon sources compared. The most significant differences
   were found to be associated with the CAZymes, as well as specific up
   regulation of some key components of the pentose phosphate pathway in
   the presence of xylose and xylan. This study has enhanced our
   understanding of the physiology and metabolism of C. termitidis, and
   provides a foundation for future studies on metabolic engineering to
   optimize biofuel production from natural biomass.}},

Title = {{A Subject-Specific Acoustic Model of the Upper Airway for Snoring Sounds
   Generation}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 23}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring variations in the upper airway narrowing during sleep is
   invasive and expensive. Since snoring sounds are generated by air
   turbulence and vibrations of the upper airway due to its narrowing;
   snoring sounds may be used as a non-invasive technique to assess upper
   airway narrowing. Our goal was to develop a subject-specific acoustic
   model of the upper airway to investigate the impacts of upper airway
   anatomy, e.g. length, wall thickness and cross-sectional area, on
   snoring sounds features. To have a subject-specific model for snoring
   generation, we used measurements of the upper airway length,
   cross-sectional area and wall thickness from every individual to develop
   the model. To validate the proposed model, in 20 male individuals,
   intensity and resonant frequencies of modeled snoring sounds were
   compared with those measured from recorded snoring sounds during sleep.
   Based on both modeled and measured results, we found the only factor
   that may positively and significantly contribute to snoring intensity
   was narrowing in the upper airway. Furthermore, measured resonant
   frequencies of snoring were inversely correlated with the upper airway
   length, which is a risk factor for upper airway collapsibility. These
   results encourage the use of snoring sounds analysis to assess the upper
   airway anatomy during sleep.}},

Abstract = {{More and more system operators are interested in calculating transfer
   capability in real time using real-time power flow models generated from
   the energy management system (EMS). However, comparing with off-line
   study models, EMS models usually cover a limited portion of the
   interconnected system. It is not practical to extend the EMS model in
   order to capture the impact of the external systems and as such using an
   equivalent network becomes necessary for this purpose. Equivalent
   circuits can be derived from the off-line models for certain
   pre-determined operating conditions. Such fixed equivalent models may
   produce invalid results under various real-time operating conditions.
   Hence, it is necessary to derive an equivalent circuit model that is
   adaptive to the available real-time information. This study presents a
   new method of creating an equivalent circuit model based on the measured
   boundary station parameters such as voltages and power flows. Simulation
   studies show that such derived equivalent circuit models provide
   solutions with adequate accuracy in comparison with detailed off-line
   system model.}},

Title = {{Global changes in the proteome of Cupriavidus necator H16 during
   poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate) synthesis from various biodiesel by-product
   substrates}},
Journal = {{AMB EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 17}},
Abstract = {{Synthesis of poly-{[}3-hydroxybutyrate] (PHB) by Cupriavidus necator H16
   in batch cultures was evaluated using three biodiesel-derived
   by-products as the sole carbon sources: waste glycerol (REG-80, refined
   to 80 \% purity with negligible free fatty acids); glycerol bottom
   (REG-GB, with up to 65 \% glycerol and 35 \% free fatty acids), and free
   fatty acids (REG-FFA, with up to 75 \% FFA and no glycerol). All the
   three substrates supported growth and PHB production by C. necator, with
   polymer accumulation ranging from 9 to 84 \% cell dry weight (cdw),
   depending on the carbon source. To help understand these differences,
   proteomic analysis indicated that although C. necator H16 was able to
   accumulate PHB during growth on all three biodiesel by-products, no
   changes in the levels of PHB synthesis enzymes were observed. However,
   significant changes in the levels of expression were observed for two
   Phasin proteins involved with PHB accumulation, and for a number of gene
   products in the fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway, the Glyoxylate Shunt,
   and the hydrogen (H-2) synthesis pathways in C. necator cells cultured
   with different substrates. The glycerol transport protein (GlpF) was
   induced in REG-GB and REG-80 glycerol cultures only. Cupriavidus necator
   cells cultured with REG-GB and REG-FFA showed up-regulation of
   beta-oxidation and Glyoxylate Shunt pathways proteins at 24 h pi, but
   H-2 synthesis pathways enzymes were significantly down-regulated,
   compared with cells cultured with waste glycerol. Our data confirmed
   earlier observations of constitutive expression of PHB synthesis
   proteins, but further suggested that C. necator H16 cells growing on
   biodiesel-derived glycerol were under oxidative stress.}},

Abstract = {{Polyaniline (PANI) is a promising pseudocapacitance electrode material.
   However, its structural instability leads to low cyclic stability and
   limited rate capability which hinders its practical applications. In
   view of the limitations, flexible PANI-based composite films are
   developed to improve the electrochemical performance of electrode
   materials. We report in the research a facile and cost-effective
   approach for fabrication of a high-performance supercapacitor (SC) with
   excellent cyclic stability and tunable energy and power densities. SC
   electrode containing a very high mass loading of active materials is a
   flexible film of PANI, tissue wiper-based cellulose, graphite-based
   exfoliated graphite (ExG), and silver nanoparticles with potential
   applications in wearable electronics. The optimum preparation weight
   ratios of silver nitrate/aniline and ExG/aniline used in the research
   are estimated to be 0.18 and 0.65 (or higher), respectively. Our results
   show that an ultrahigh capacitance of 3.84 F/cm(2) (240.10 F/g) at a
   discharge rate of 5 mA can be achieved. In addition, our study shows
   that the power density can be increased from 1531.3 to 3000 W/kg by
   selecting the weight ratio of ExG/aniline to be more than 0.65, with a
   sacrifice in the energy density. The obtained promising electrochemical
   properties are found to be mainly attributed to an effective combination
   of PANT, ExG, cushiony cellulose scaffold, and silver as well as the
   porosity of the composite.}},

Abstract = {{A screening method called the compensation impact factor (CIF) is
   proposed in this study to identify the risk of sub-synchronous resonance
   (SSR) caused when generators are connected to series compensated
   transmission lines. First, the definition of CIF is given and the
   meaning behind this index is explained. Second, the electric damping is
   used to classify the operating scenario into high SSR risk group and low
   SSR risk group. Then the correlation between the value of the CIF and
   the risk classification is analysed and the threshold value of CIF for
   this classification is calculated by using conditional probability. The
   proposed method is validated by (a) a 3-bus system with one generator
   and (b) the IEEE-39-bus system with ten generators. The advantage of
   applying the proposed method is that only the high-risk scenarios need
   to be analysed in detail using electromagnetic transient simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Cell and enzyme immobilization are often used for industrial production
   of high-value products. In recent years, immobilization techniques have
   been applied to the production of value-added chemicals such as
   1,3-Propanediol (1,3-PDO). Biotechnological fermentation is an
   attractive alternative to current 1,3-PDO production methods, which are
   primarily thermochemical processes, as it generates high volumetric
   yields of 1,3-PDO, is a much less energy intensive process, and
   generates lower amounts of environmental organic pollutants. Although
   several approaches including: batch, fed-batch, continuous-feed and
   two-step continuous-feed were tested in suspended systems, it has been
   well demonstrated that cell immobilization techniques can significantly
   enhance 1,3-PDO production and allow robust continuous production in
   smaller bioreactors. This review covers various immobilization methods
   and their application for 1,3-PDO production.}},

Abstract = {{Surgical tool motion during microsurgery could arguably reflect surgical
   performance. This paper reports on how the motion of a surgical tool
   correlates or differs between conventional freehand surgery and
   robot-assisted surgery. In this pilot study, components of the position
   and orientation as well as the linear and angular velocities of a
   surgical tool, over the same period of operation, are compared during
   the two scenarios. For freehand surgery, a bipolar forceps is
   retrofitted with a tracking system to measure translational and
   rotational components of the tool motion. In robot-assisted surgery, the
   position and orientation components are obtained using kinematics of the
   neuroArm image-guided robotic system. A cross correlation analysis was
   used to investigate correlation between each pair of displacement or
   velocity components from freehand and robot-assisted scenarios to
   indicate how strongly or weakly two sets of data are linked together.
   The absolute maximum value of the cross correlation coefficient is
   calculated for each pair of components to quantitatively investigate the
   correlation between two sets of data. Results showed that the positional
   and rotational components, reflecting the surgical workspace, in both
   scenarios are correlated. However, for the cases studied, surgical tool
   rate of motion differs between the two scenarios. Results are important
   as they can be utilized to design robot-assisted neurosurgical systems
   that reflect characteristics of freehand surgery gained by surgeons
   through years of training, knowledge, and experience.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{The problem of joint downlink cell association (CA) and wireless
   backhaul bandwidth allocation (WBBA) in two-tier cellular heterogeneous
   networks (HetNets) is investigated. Large-scale antenna array is
   implemented at the macro base station (BS), while the small cells within
   the macro cell range are single-antenna BSs and they rely on
   over-the-air links to the macro BS for back-hauling. A sum logarithmic
   user rate maximization problem is studied under the wireless backhaul
   constraints. Duplex and spectrum sharing with co-channel reverse
   time-division duplex (TDD) and dynamic soft frequency reuse is
   considered for interference management in the two-tier HetNet employing
   large-scale antenna arrays at the macro BS and wireless backhauling for
   small cells. Two in-band WBBA scenarios, namely, unified bandwidth
   allocation and per-small-cell bandwidth allocation, are investigated for
   joint CA-WBBA in the HetNet. A two-level hierarchical decomposition
   method for relaxed optimization is employed to solve the mixed-integer
   nonlinear program (MINLP). Solutions based on the General Algorithm
   Modeling System (GAMS) optimization solver and fast heuristics are also
   proposed for cell association in the per-small-cell WBBA scenario. It is
   shown that when all small cells have to use in-band wireless backhaul,
   the system load has more impact on both the sum logarithmic rate and
   per-user rate performance than the number of small cells deployed within
   the macro cell range. The proposed joint CA-WBBA algorithms have an
   optimal load approximately equal to the size of the large-scale antenna
   array at the macro BS. The cell range expansion (CRE) strategy, which is
   an efficient cell association scheme for HetNets with ideal backhauling,
   is shown to be inefficient when in-band wireless backhauling for small
   cells comes into play.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian approach was used to develop a model for
   predicting the penetration of a liquid jet in a subsonic gaseous
   crossflow. This was achieved by taking into account the effect of all
   forces acting on the jet, including drag, gravitation, and surface
   tension, as well as the mass shedding from the liquid column. The effect
   of mass shedding from the liquid column and jet Reynolds number on the
   spray penetration height was also studied. It was found that, although
   the momentum flux ratio q plays a predominant role in the prediction of
   a liquid jet column, the liquid jet penetration can be affected when
   changing the ambient temperature and pressure (or gas to liquid density
   and viscosity ratio), especially when holding constant q and jet
   velocity v(j). Two correlations were developed in the form of
   sinusoidal-exponential and logarithmic function for the prediction of
   liquid column and droplets' plume regions, respectively. The proposed
   correlations are capable of predicting jet penetration of different
   liquids in a subsonic crossflow at different operating conditions and

Abstract = {{In this study, landfill leachate with and without pre-treatment was
   co-treated with municipal wastewater at different mixing ratios. The
   leachate pre-treatment was achieved by air stripping to removal ammonia.
   The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of landfill
   leachate on nutrient removal of the wastewater treatment process. It was
   demonstrated that when landfill leachate was co-treated with municipal
   wastewater, the high ammonia concentration in the leachate did not have
   a negative impact on the nitrification. The system was able to adapt to
   the environment and was able to improve nitrification capacity. The
   readily biodegradable portion of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the
   leachate was utilized by the system to improve phosphorus and nitrate
   removal. However, this portion was small and majority of the COD ended
   up in the effluent thereby decreased the quality of the effluent. The
   study showed that the 2.5\% mixing ratio of leachate with wastewater
   improved the overall biological nutrient removal process of the system
   without compromising the COD removal efficiency. (C) 2015 The Research

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider joint beamforming, power, and channel
   allocation in a multiuser and multichannel underlay
   multiple-input-single-output (MISO) cognitive radio network (CRN). In
   this system, the primary users' spectrum can be reused by secondary-user
   transmitters (SU-TXs) to maximize spectrum utilization, whereas
   intrauser interference is minimized by implementing beamforming at each
   SU-TX. After formulating the joint optimization problem as a nonconvex
   mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we propose a solution that
   consists of two stages. In the first stage, a feasible solution for
   power allocation and beamforming vectors is derived under a given
   channel allocation by converting the original problem into a convex form
   with an introduced optimal auxiliary variable and a semidefinite
   relaxation approach. In the second stage, two explicit searching
   algorithms, i. e., genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing
   (SA)-based algorithm, are proposed to determine suboptimal channel
   allocations. Simulation results show that the beamforming and power and
   channel allocation with SA algorithm can achieve a close-to-optimal sum
   rate while having lower computational complexity compared with the
   beamforming and power and channel allocation with the GA algorithm.
   Furthermore, our proposed allocation scheme has significant improvement
   in achievable sum rate compared with the existing zero-forcing
   beamforming.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel dynamic common-control-channel-based medium access
   control (DCCC-MAC) protocol for cellular (centralized) cognitive radio
   (CR) networks. Specifically, unlike the traditional
   dedicated-control-channel-based medium access control (MAC) protocols,
   the proposed MAC protocol eliminates the requirement of a dedicated
   channel for control information exchange. During a given transmission
   frame, the common control channel (CCC) is selected by a cooperating set
   of secondary users (SUs) by using a support-vector-machine (SVM)-based
   learning technique. In the DCCC-MAC protocol, the frame duration is
   divided into four main phases as follows: spectrum sensing, CCC
   selection, data transmission, and beaconing. The SUs that participate in
   the CCC selection process are allocated channels for data transmission
   during a frame interval using a scheduling process, whereas the other
   SUs have to contend to access the channels. We present an analytical
   approach to calculate the minimum required number of minislots in the
   transmission frame for a given number of SUs in the CCC selection
   process. The saturation throughput of the proposed MAC protocol is
   analyzed in closed form. To this end, the numerical and simulation
   results are presented to quantify the performance of the proposed
   DCCC-MAC protocol. We also compare the performance of the DCCC-MAC
   protocol with that of two other state-of-the-art CR MAC protocols that
   use CCCs.}},

Abstract = {{Conjugate-matched primary feeds for offset reflector antennas are

   two orthogonal polarizations. First, required mode content factors and
   tapering numbers of the TE11 mode are addressed for the y-polarized case
   in offset reflectors with different focal length-to-diameter ratios.
   Then, the model is appropriately tailored for the x-polarized primary
   feeds. It is shown that when the polarization orientation changes, the
   corresponding beamwidths of the TE11 mode should be swapped in the
   principal E-and H-planes. This is particularly important to
   simultaneously realize low cross-polarization levels at both asymmetry

Abstract = {{In this paper, we provide not only key knowledge for friction model
   selection among candidate models but also experimental friction features
   compared with numerical predictions reproduced by the candidate models.
   A motor-driven one-dimensional sliding block has been designed and
   fabricated in our lab to carry out a wide range of control tasks for the
   friction feature demonstrations and the parameter identifications of the
   candidate models. Besides the well-known static features such as
   break-away force and viscous friction, our setup experimentally
   demonstrates subtle dynamic features that characterize the physical
   behavior. The candidate models coupled with correct parameters
   experimentally obtained from our setup are taken to simulate the
   features of interest. The first part of this work briefly introduces the
   candidate friction models, the friction features of interest, and our
   experimental approach. The second part of this work is dedicated to the
   comparisons between the experimental features and the numerical model
   predictions. The discrepancies between the experimental features and the
   numerical model predictions help researchers to judge the accuracy of
   the models. The relation between the candidate model structures and
   their numerical friction feature predictions is investigated and
   discussed. A table that summarizes how to select the most optimal
   friction model among a variety of engineering applications is presented
   at the end of this paper. Such comprehensive comparisons have not been

   problem is formulated as a multi-objective nonlinear optimization
   problem and solved using the nonlinear simplex function in MATLAB. The

   critical value for the RF is determined through a large number of

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report on a new method for assisting in Meniere's
   disease diagnosis. An accurate diagnosis of Meniere's is challenging,
   and requires an expert opinion after observing several clinical
   assessments and tests over a period of time. Our proposed method is
   based on the analysis of the spontaneous and driven ear evoked responses
   recorded using Electrovestibulography (EVestG). We used the EVestG
   signals of 35 individuals suspected of Meniere's and 26 age-matched
   healthy controls, out of which data of 14 patients with Meniere's and 16
   healthy controls were used for developing the diagnostic algorithm
   (training set) and the rest for testing. While recording and analyzing
   the test dataset, the researchers were only aware the patients suffered
   some dizziness, and were kept blind to the exact diagnoses till the end
   of study. EVestG field potentials (FPs) and their firing pattern, in
   response to several whole body tilt stimuli from both left and right
   ears were extracted. We investigated several features of the extracted
   FPs in response to each of side, back/forward, rotation, up/down, supine
   rotation, and supine up/down tilt stimulations, and selected the top
   five features showing the most significant differences between of the
   groups of the training set for every tilt. An ad-hoc average voting
   classifier was designed based on building five single-feature
   classifiers (using Linear Discriminant analysis) and taking the average
   of the single-feature classifiers' votes. The results showed the side
   tilt data were best for the purpose of Meniere's diagnosis; it resulted
   in 78\% and 90\% sensitivity and specificity for test dataset,
   respectively. The second best accuracy was achieved using back/forward
   tilt. The results and their implications are discussed. Overall, the
   EVestG side tilt results encourage the use of vestibular response as a
   non-invasive, robust and quick screening for Meniere's and separating it
   from other types of dizziness.}},

Abstract = {{Symmetries are widespread invariances underscoring countless systems,
   including the brain. A symmetry break occurs when the symmetry is
   present at one level of observation but is hidden at another level. In
   such a general framework, a concept from algebraic topology, namely, the
   Borsuk-Ulam theorem (BUT), comes into play and sheds new light on the
   general mechanisms of nervous symmetries. The BUT tells us that we can
   find, on an n-dimensional sphere, a pair of opposite points that have
   the same encoding on an n - 1 sphere. This mapping makes it possible to
   describe both antipodal points with a single real-valued vector on a
   lower dimensional sphere. Here we argue that this topological approach
   is useful for the evaluation of hidden nervous symmetries. This means
   that symmetries can be found when evaluating the brain in a proper
   dimension, although they disappear (are hidden or broken) when we
   evaluate the same brain only one dimension lower. In conclusion, we
   provide a topological methodology for the evaluation of the most general
   features of brain activity, i.e., the symmetries, cast in a
   physical/biological fashion that has the potential to be
   operationalized. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Bionics can be applied in the area of designing soil engaging tools in
   agriculture to minimize power requirement and optimize soil conditions
   for crop growth. In this study, a bear claw was investigated with the
   objective of mimicking it for the future design of subsoiling tools. A
   numerical model was developed using the discrete element method (DEM) to
   simulate the interaction of the bear claw with soil. During the
   simulations, soil cutting forces were recorded and soil disturbance of
   the claw was monitored. The most critical model parameter, particle
   stiffness, was calibrated through comparing the soil cutting forces and
   disturbance width of a blade between the simulations and the predictions
   by the universal earthmoving equation from the literature. Then the
   calibrated model was used to examine effects of the working depths and
   rake angles of the claw on the soil cutting forces and soil disturbance
   characteristics. The results showed that draft and vertical forces
   varied linearly and nonlinearly, respectively with the rake angle of the
   claw; however, number of particles dislodged and soil porosity changes
   varied only slightly with the change of rake angle. All these dynamic
   attributes significantly increased as the working depth of the claw
   increased. Considering draft force and soil disturbance, the best
   performance of the claw was at the rake angle of 30 degrees. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The nonlinear aerothermal flutter instability of a shape memory alloy
   (SMA) fiber reinforced composite beam subjected to simultaneous actions
   of thermal and aerodynamic loads is investigated. The Brinson model is
   used to simulate behaviors of the SMA fibers and the Euler-Bernoulli
   beam theory along with nonlinear von-Karman strain field are used for
   modeling of the beam. Thermomechanical properties are assumed to be
   temperature-dependent. The aerodynamic pressure is modeled based on the
   quasi-steady first-order piston theory. The governing equations are
   solved by means of the Galerkin approach, and flutter and buckling
   boundaries, natural frequencies and damping ratios are obtained. Effects
   of various pivotal factors such as SMA volume fraction, prestrain of SMA
   fibers, location and orientation of SMA fibers on critical flutter
   dynamic pressure, damping ratio and bifurcation points and paths are
   studied. The results show that the aerothermal flutter characteristics
   of the laminated beam can be significantly enhanced by embedding SMA
   fibers. Moreover, the presence of aerodynamic flow and SMA fibers
   results in postponement of the bifurcation point and a reduction of the
   postbuckling deflection. The results of this study are expected to shed
   a light into enhancing the stability boundaries efficiently by
   increasing the SMA fiber volume fraction and prestrain. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Maximum available power (MAP) is an index for analyzing power-voltage
   stability in high-voltage direct current (HVdc) converters. Earlier work
   on calculating MAP for voltage sourced converters (VSC) was not
   consistent with the methods used for line commutated converters (LCC).
   The Thevenin voltage source used in VSC-HVdc analysis was set to 1.0 pu,
   but for LCC-HVdc, it was calculated so as to provide rated conditions at
   the converter busbar. This study attempts to rationalize the approaches
   used for VSC-HVdc and LCC-HVdc calculations by making them mutually
   consistent. However, as the VSC can operate at much lower short-circuit
   ratio (SCR) than can the LCC, the Thevenin equivalent voltage at low
   SCRs can be significantly larger than 1.0 pu. This would require an
   unreasonably large tap changer setting. As an alternative, the paper
   recommends that for calculating MAP for a VSC, an ac network equivalent
   be used where some reactive power is locally supplied by shunt
   capacitors. This renders a Thevenin voltage close to 1.0 pu. This study
   also considers the impact of the VSC's internal voltage limits on the
   MAP. The key results are validated using electromagnetic transients
   simulation.}},

Abstract = {{A Lorentz force based resonant MEMS magnetic-field sensor with optical

   optical positioning system and external electronics. Sensor sensitivity
   is controlled by the control of the coil bias current, and shows linear
   sensitivity with incident field. The resolution and noise floor is 0.4
   nT and 1.78 nTi,/root Hz respectively at 53 mHz bandwidth, for a coil
   bias current of 50 mA(rms) and operation at atmospheric pressure. This
   sensor is suitable for various applications due to wide measurement

Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{29-43}},
Month = {{APR 7}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a radio resource allocation scheme for wireless body area
   networks (WBANs) is proposed. Unlike existing works in the literature,
   we focus on the communications in beyond-WBANs, and study the
   transmission scheduling under a scenario that there are a large number
   of gateways associating with one base station of medical centers.
   Motivated by the distinctions and requirements of beyond-WBAN
   communications, we introduce a priority-aware pricing-based capacity
   sharing scheme by taking into account the quality of service (QoS)
   requirements for different gateways. In the designed scheme, each
   gateway is intelligent to select transmission priorities and data rates
   according to its signal importance, and is charged by a price with
   regard to its transmission request. The capacity allocation is proceeded
   with guarantee of the absolute priority rule. In order to maximize the
   individual utility, gateways will compete with each other by choosing
   the optimal transmission strategies. Such decision process is formulated
   as a non-atomic game. Theoretical analyses show that our proposed
   pricing-based scheme can lead to an efficient Wardrop equilibrium.
   Through numerical results, we examine the convergence of strategy
   decisions, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism
   in improving the utilities of gateways. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

   achieved by a joint determination of sensing and transmission parameters
   of the secondary users, such as sensing times, decision threshold
   vectors, and power allocation vectors. There is a conflict between these
   two objectives, thus a multiobjective optimization problem is
   introduced. The authors propose an analytical approach based on Newton's

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{405-416}},

Abstract = {{Tight gas reservoirs are of prominent importance among unconventional
   petroleum reservoirs. Due to the complicated flow dynamics of gas in
   tight porous media and compressibility effects, corrections have to be
   applied to the Darcy equation so that it can properly predict gas flow
   dynamics. As the mean pore diameter of tight rocks (e.g. shales)
   decreases, the ratio of the mean free path to the pore diameter, known
   as the non-dimensional Knudsen number, rises, the gas rarefaction
   effects becomes important, and the condition of no-slip on the pore
   surface is violated. Proper treatments of these complexities have been
   attempted by using classical continuum fluid mechanics and kinetic
   theory of gases approaches. The most well-known slip condition
   correction was presented by Klinkenberg in 1941. Many researchers have
   tried to correct and extend Klinkenberg's model beyond the slip flow
   regime. In this research the slip condition of the rarefied gas in low
   permeability simple porous media is studied by the lattice Boltzmann
   method and new corrections to Klinkenberg's coefficients are
   investigated. These corrections allow the extension of Klinkenberg model
   to higher ranges of Knudsen numbers. All the simulations in this work
   were performed by codes developed by the authors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

   the measured data, is first constructed. The framework then revolves
   around the number of the right singular vectors of this operator, and
   their spatial frequency contents that can be utilized in reconstruction.
   Furthermore, this framework is used to introduce the ``best{''} possible
   reconstruction that can be achieved in a given MWT system when imaging a

Abstract = {{This letter proposes the use of saddle point approximation (SPA) to
   evaluate the outage probability of wireless cellular networks. Unlike
   traditional numerical integration-based approaches, the SPA approach
   relies on cumulant generating functions (CGFs) and eliminates the need
   for explicit numerical integration. The approach is generic and can be
   applied to a wide variety of distributions, given that their CGFs exist.
   We illustrate the usefulness of SPA on channel fading distributions such
   as Nakagami-m, Nakagami-q (Hoyt), and Rician distributions. Numerical
   results validate the accuracy of the proposed SPA approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper utilizes an electromagnetic inverse-scattering algorithm to
   quantitatively reconstruct the vertical temperature and salinity
   profiles of snow-covered sea ice from time-series monostatic
   polarimetric normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) data. The
   reconstructed profile at a given time step is utilized to provide a
   priori information for the profile reconstruction at the subsequent time
   step. This successive use of a priori information in the inversion
   algorithm results in achieving high reconstruction accuracy over the
   time period of interest. This inversion scheme is evaluated against the
   experimental data collected from snow-covered sea ice grown in an Arctic
   ocean mesocosm facility. It will be shown that the time evolution of the
   temperature, salinity, and density profiles of an artificially grown
   snow-covered sea ice can be quantitatively reconstructed using
   single-frequency time-series radar cross-section data assuming that
   these profiles are initially known with sufficient accuracy.}},

   emphasizing the basic tradeoffs behind omni-directional and directional
   out-of-band energy transmission, providing system-level performance
   evaluation, and discussing open challenges on the way to sustainable
   wireless-powered wearables. The key aspects highlighted in this article
   include system operation choices, user mobility effects, impact of

Abstract = {{In order to minimize electric grid power consumption, energy harvesting
   from ambient RF sources is considered as a promising technique for
   wireless charging of low-power devices. To illustrate the design
   considerations of RF-based ambient energy harvesting networks, this
   article first points out the primary challenges of implementing and
   operating such networks, including non-deterministic energy arrival
   patterns, energy harvesting mode selection, energy-aware cooperation
   among base stations, and so on. A brief overview of recent advances and
   a summary of their shortcomings are then provided to highlight existing
   research gaps and possible future research directions. To this end, we
   investigate the feasibility of implementing RF-based ambient energy
   harvesting in ultra-dense small cell networks and examine the related
   trade-offs in terms of the energy efficiency and
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio outage probability of a typical
   user in the downlink. Numerical results demonstrate the significance of
   deploying a mixture of on-grid small base stations (powered by electric
   grid) and off-grid small base stations (powered by energy harvesting),
   and optimizing their corresponding proportions as a function of the
   intensity of active small base stations in the network.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this paper is to explore the exact analytical
   solutions of the magnetization of linear arrays of two ideal
   ferromagnetic spheres in the presence of external magnetic fields.
   First, the total scalar magnetic potential outside the spheres, related
   to the magnetic field intensity, which satisfies the Laplace equation,
   is obtained by the superposition of the potentials due to all spheres
   and the potential corresponding to the external field. The translational
   addition theorems for scalar Laplacian functions in spherical
   coordinates are then used to translate the two coordinates systems into
   one coordinates system. Then, the exact boundary conditions were used to
   solve the magnetic field quantities outside the system. On the other
   hand, the scalar magnetic potential inside each sphere, related to the
   magnetic flux density, also satisfies the Laplace equation, which is
   solved by imposing the boundary conditions known from the solution of
   the outside quantities. Finally, the expressions derived are used to
   generate numerical results of controllable accuracy for various field
   quantities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a robust frequency-domain method to tune the d-q

   Voltage Source Converter (MMC-VSC) systems. A linearized state-space
   model of the MMC-VSC system is developed and used to calculate the
   stability-related frequency-domain attributes. The controller design
   problem is formulated as an optimization problem. In this paper, the
   simulated annealing optimization technique is applied to find the
   proportional-integral (PI) controller parameters that give desired
   damping for the oscillatory modes and desired values for decaying
   exponential modes. The efficacy of this method is tested on the
   electromagnetic transient model of a two-terminal MMC-VSC system on the
   real-time digital simulators, and the results are provided in this
   paper. Finally, tuned controller parameters for different ac system
   strengths are discussed and it is shown that this mathematical model is
   suitable to tune the PI-controller parameters for MMC-VSC systems
   connected to strong as well as weak ac networks.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The demand for sustainable concrete structures with longer service life
   and lower maintenance cost has been driving the use of glass
   fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) reinforcement in new concrete
   structures. The behavior of GFRP bars under seismic loading in
   reinforced concrete (RC) frame structures has not been widely
   investigated. Furthermore, the ability of FRP-RC frame structures to
   dissipate energy in seismic events is still questionable due to the
   elastic-linear behavior of the FRP reinforcement. Very few studies have
   been conducted on the seismic behavior of GFRP-RC exterior beam-column
   joints, and none studied the shear capacity of joints. Therefore, this
   study attempts to partially fill this gap by investigating the shear
   capacity of beam-column joints reinforced with GFRP bars and stirrups.
   Six full-scale exterior beam-column joint prototypes (T-shaped) were
   constructed and tested under simulated seismic load conditions. Test
   parameters in this study included the concrete strength and the shear
   stress level in the joint. Diagonal shear failure in the joint exhibited
   in some specimens showed the significance of evaluating the shear
   capacity in the joint.}},

Abstract = {{Short-term fermentation of raw sludge from a high purity oxygen
   activated sludge systems was explored as a means of increasing the
   dissolved phosphorus and producing volatile fatty acids (VFA).
   Fermentation of primary sludge (PS), waste activated sludge (WAS), and
   co-thickened sludge (PS and WAS) showed significant phosphorus
   solubilization and VFA production at 2-4 days of fermentation in
   conditions of a completely mixed system of equal solids and liquid
   residence times. Factors found to have the most influence on phosphorus
   solubilization rates were sludge type, fermentation time, total
   phosphorus (TP) content in sludge, and process pH. WAS fermentation
   solubilized the most phosphorus per mass of volatile solids (VS)
   followed by co-thickened sludge. PS fermentation produced the most VFA
   per mass VS fermented while WAS produced the least. After 4 days of
   fermentation, co-fermented sludge converted 48 \% of TP to dissolved
   phosphorus, and produced 1624 mg l(-1) of VFA-COD which corresponded to
   a VFA-COD yield per mass of 0.139 mg per mg VS applied. In terms of
   total sludge management, co-fermentation resulted in greater overall VFA
   production and phosphorus solubilization than individual sludge
   fermentation.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical miss-match between the host and an implanted foreign body
   is one of the primary causes for implantation failure. To enhance the
   efficacy in wound repair, we developed stiffness tunable
   temperature-sensitive hydrogels composed of poly(amidoamine) (PAA)-based
   poly(n-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM). PNIPAM-PAA hydrogels with three
   different stiffness fabricated by varying the concentrations of
   poly(amidoamine) were chosen for morphology and rheology tests. The
   degradation rate and cell compatibility of gels were also characterized.
   The PAA-PNIPAM hydrogels were then tested in a wound healing model of
   mice with full-thickness skin loss. We found that the stiffness of
   hydrogels has an impact on the wound healing process mainly by
   regulating the cell activities in the proliferation phase. PNIPAM-PAA
   hydrogels with appropriate stiffness reduce scar formation and improve
   wound healing by promoting myofibroblast transformation, keratinocytes
   proliferation, extracellular matrix synthesis and remodeling. Moreover,
   the stiffness of hydrogels impact on the secretion of TGF-beta 1 and
   bFGF, which play an important role in skin wound healing. These results
   suggest that the therapeutic effects of hydrogels in skin wound healing
   can by regulated by hydrogels' stiffness. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

   using texture analysis of optical microscopy images}},
Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{104-112}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Oil-impregnated Kraft paper samples normally used for power transformer
   electrical insulation have been artificially aged thermally to produce a
   sample set with varying levels of insulation deterioration. The samples
   were aged in an oven at a ternperature above the normal operating
   temperature of a power transformer.
   Digital images obtained from optical microscopy measurements on the
   paper samples have been analyzed using a texture analysis method which
   converts each image into a spatial gray level dependence matrix (SGLDM).
   The SGLDM contains information about the statistical variation of pixels
   gray-level intensities in an image and thereby information about the
   sample texture. Mathematical operators applied to the SGLDM have been
   used to extract 22 different statistical texture features for each
   sample image.
   Optical microscopy images of the thermally aged samples show that
   thermal deterioration of the insulation paper produces changes in
   morphology and physical structure. These changes are detectable by the
   statistical texture features extracted from the SGLDM texture analysis.
   Statistical classification is performed on the feature set to
   demonstrate that differentiation between oil-impregnated paper samples
   with different levels of thermal degradation is reliable with low error
   rates. Therefore, development of a practical method to assess condition
   of oil-impregnated paper insulation using optical microscopy and texture
   analysis is promising. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was reported to promote
   angiogenesis. Electrospun nanofibers lead to idea wound dressing
   substrates. Here we report a convenient and novel method to produce VIP
   loaded microspheres in polycaprolactone (PCL) nano-fibrous membrane
   without complicated processes. We first coated mussel-inspired dopamine
   (DA) to nanofibers, then used strong adhesive DA to absorb the
   functional peptide. PCL, membrane was then immersed into acetone to
   generate microspheres with VIP loading. We employed high pressure liquid
   chromatography to record encapsulation efficiency of (31.8 +/- 2.2)\%
   and loading capacity of (1.71 +/- 0.16)\%. The release profile of VIP
   from nanosheets showed a prolonged release. The results of laser
   scanning confocal microscope, scanning electron microscope and cell
   counting kit-8 proliferation assays showed that cell adhesion and
   proliferation were promoted. In order to verify the efficacy on wound
   healing, in vivo implantation was applied in the full-thickness defect
   wounds of BALB/c mice. Results showed that the wound healing was
   significantly promoted via favoring the growth of granulation tissue and
   angiogenesis. However, we found wound re-epithelialization was not
   significantly improved. The resulting VIP-DA-coated PCL (PCL-DA-VIP)
   nanosheets with spatiotemporal delivery of VIP could be a potential
   application in wound treatment and vascular tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{A novel ultrawideband pattern diversity antenna, with sum and difference
   radiation patterns used in monopulse tracking, is proposed. To achieve
   pattern diversity, a crescent-shaped radiating element is fed from two
   sides at an angle close to 90 degrees, by two coaxial feeds. The ground
   is a corner-shaped cavity. The sum and difference patterns can be
   obtained by in-phase and out-of-phase excitations of the two coaxial
   ports. A single-element antenna is first studied to show the operating
   principle of the design. A modified design with two elements is then
   proposed and studied through simulations and measurements of a
   fabricated prototype, showing excellent radiation characteristics over a
   large frequency bandwidth. The application of this antenna as a
   reflector feed is then studied. It is shown that the antenna can
   theoretically feed a prime focus reflector with 60\% (for the sum
   pattern) efficiency over a 48\% fractional bandwidth (5.5-9 GHz), with a
   maximum efficiency of 75\%. The antenna is compact (5 x 4.1 x 2 cm(3))
   and has low cost and simple fabrication. To the best of authors'
   knowledge, this is the first attempt to feed a reflector with this class
   of antennas.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamical adaptive backstepping-sliding mode control scheme is
   designed and implemented for the first time, to track and regulate the
   position of a low-cost pneumatically driven single-rod, double-acting
   cylinder. The mass flow rate of compressed air into and out of the
   cylinder is regulated by a 5/3-way proportional directional control
   valve. The derivation of the controller, utilizing a design procedure
   that guarantees stability of the control system, is presented first.
   Next, experimental evaluation of the controller is conducted with
   respect to performance and robustness to parametric uncertainties.
   Experiments employ a sinusoidal reference trajectory with tracking
   frequencies of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 Hz; a multiple-step polynomial
   reference trajectory having step sizes of 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1
   m; and three external loads of 4.4, 9, and 16 kg operating in two modes
   (motion assisting and resisting). From over 70 experiments involving
   various operating conditions, average root mean square of tracking error
   of 1.73 mm and steady-state error of 0.71 mm are achieved for the
   position tracking and regulating, respectively. As compared with the
   classical sliding mode control scheme alone, the new controller
   outperforms by more than twofold. The adaptive LuGre-based friction
   observer applied in this control scheme significantly assists in
   compensating the adverse effect of friction with the average of 55\%
   less tracking error. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Human dermal papilla (DP) cells have been studied extensively when grown
   in the conventional monolayer. However, because of great deviation from
   the real in vivo three-dimensional (3D) environment, these
   two-dimensional (2D) grown cells tend to lose the hair-inducible
   capability during passaging. Hence, these 2D caused concerns have
   motivated the development of novel 3D culture techniques to produce
   cellular microtissues with suitable mimics. The hanging-drop approach is
   based on surface tension-based technique and the interaction between
   surface tension and gravity field that makes a convergence of liquid
   drops. This study used this technique in a converged drop to form
   cellular spheroids of dermal papilla cells. It leads to a controllable
   3Dspheroid model for scalable fabrication of inductive DP microtissues.
   The optimal conditions for culturing high passaged (P8) DP spheroids
   were determined first. Then, the morphological, histological and
   functional studies were performed. In addition, expressions of
   hair-inductive markers including alkaline phosphatase, alpha-smooth
   muscle actin and neural cell adhesion molecule were also analyzed by
   quantitative RT-PCR, immunostaining and immunoblotting. Finally, P8-DP
   microtissues were coimplanted with newborn mouse epidermal cells (EPCs)
   into nude mice. Our results indicated that the formation of 3D
   microtissues not only endowed P8-DP microtissues many similarities to
   primary DP, but also confer these microtissues an enhanced ability to
   induce hair-follicle (HF) neogenesis in vivo. This model provides a
   potential to elucidate the native biology of human DP, and also shows
   the promising for the controllable and scalable production of inductive
   DP cells applied in future follicle regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient repair of concrete pavements typically requires a
   rapid-setting material to accelerate opening the road to traffic. While
   numerous high-early-strength cementitious repair materials are
   commercially available, many of them are vulnerable to premature
   deterioration. On the other hand, despite its improved long-term
   performance, concrete incorporating fly ash is rarely used as a repair
   material due to the delay in setting time, strength gain, and
   microstructural development at early ages. Nevertheless, these
   performance limitations can be mitigated by incorporation of
   nanoparticles (for example, nanosilica) in fly ash concrete. In this
   study, an effort was made to develop nano-modified fly ash concrete as a
   repair material for concrete pavements. The performance of the newly
   developed mixtures was compared to that of two commercial cementitious
   products. The results indicate that the nano-modified fly ash concrete
   has balanced performance in terms of hardening time, strength
   development, bonding with substrate concrete, and resistance to
   infiltration of fluids and salt-frost scaling.}},

Abstract = {{The field of cohesive sediment erosion is still not fully understood, in
   large part due to the many soil parameters that affect cohesive sediment
   erodibility. In this study several undisturbed natural soil samples were
   taken from different river banks in Manitoba, Canada. The samples mainly
   contained clay and silt with 24-94\% clay content, thus the study
   covered a wide range of cohesive soil. For each sample 13 different
   physical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties were measured.
   Critical shear stress of erosion and erosion rate were quantified using
   an Erosion Measurement Device (EMD). Stepwise regression was used to
   find the variables most significantly correlated to critical shear
   stress and erosion rate, which led to the development of a new empirical
   equation to estimate the critical shear stress of cohesive soils. It was
   found that the critical shear stress is highly correlated with cohesion,
   while both cohesion and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) had significant
   influence on the erosion rate. (C) 2015 International Research and

Abstract = {{Repair and rehabilitation of deteriorating concrete elements are of
   significant concern in many infrastructural facilities and remain a
   challenging task. Concerted research efforts are needed to develop
   repair materials that are sustainable, durable, and cost-effective.
   Research data show that fiber-reinforced mortars/concretes have superior
   performance in terms of volume stability and toughness. In addition, it
   has been recently reported that nano-silica particles can generally
   improve the mechanical and durability properties of cement-based
   systems. Thus, there has been a growing interest in the use of
   nano-modified fiber-reinforced cementitious composites/mortars (NFRM) in
   repair and rehabilitation applications of concrete structures. The
   current study investigates various mechanical and durability properties
   of nano-modified mortar containing different types of fibers (steel,
   basalt, and hybrid (basalt and polypropylene)), in terms of compressive
   and flexural strengths, toughness, drying shrinkage, penetrability, and
   resistance to salt-frost scaling. The results highlight the overall
   effectiveness of the NFRM owing to the synergistic effects of
   nano-silica and fibers.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater recharge estimation is a critical quantity for sustainable
   groundwater management. The feasibility and robustness of recharge
   estimation was evaluated using physical-based modeling procedures, and
   data from a low-cost weather station with remote sensor techniques in
   Southern Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada. Recharge was determined
   using the Richards-based vadose zone hydrological model, HYDRUS-1D. The
   required meteorological data were recorded with a HOBOTM weather station
   for a short observation period (about 1 year) and an existing weather
   station (Abbotsford A) for long-term study purpose (27years).
   Undisturbed soil cores were taken at two locations in the vicinity of
   the HOBOTM weather station. The derived soil hydraulic parameters were
   used to characterize the soil in the numerical model. Model performance
   was evaluated using observed soil moisture and soil temperature data
   obtained from subsurface remote sensors. A rigorous sensitivity analysis
   was used to test the robustness of the model. Recharge during the short
   observation period was estimated at 863 and 816mm. The mean annual
   recharge was estimated at 848 and 859mm/year based on a time series of
   27 years. The relative ratio of annual recharge-precipitation varied
   from 43\% to 69\%. From a monthly recharge perspective, the majority
   (80\%) of recharge due to precipitation occurred during the hydrologic
   winter period. The comparison of the recharge estimates with other
   studies indicates a good agreement. Furthermore, this method is able to
   predict transient recharge estimates, and can provide a reasonable tool
   for estimates on nutrient leaching that is often controlled by strong
   precipitation events and rapid infiltration of water and nitrate into
   the soil.}},

Abstract = {{Next generation cellular networks will consist of multiple tiers of
   cells and users associated with different network tiers may have
   different priorities (e.g., macrocell-picocell-femtocell networks with
   macro tier prioritized over pico tier, which is again prioritized over
   femto tier). Designing efficient joint power and admission control
   (JPAC) algorithms for such networks under a cochannel deployment (i.e.,
   underlay) scenario is of significant importance. Feasibility checking of
   a given target signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SINR) vector is
   generally the most significant contributor to the complexity of JPAC
   algorithms in single/multitier underlay cellular networks. This is
   generally accomplished through iterative strategies whose complexity is
   either unpredictable or of O(M-3), when the well-known relationship
   between the SINR vector and the power vector is used, where M is the
   number of users/links. In this paper, we derive a novel relationship
   between a given SINR vector and its corresponding uplink/downlink power
   vector based on which the feasibility checking can be performed with a
   complexity of O(B-3 + MB), where B is the number of base stations. This
   is significantly less compared to O(M-3) in many cellular wireless
   networks since the number of base stations is generally much lower than
   the number of users/links in such networks. The developed novel
   relationship between the SINR and power vector not only substantially
   reduces the complexity of designing JPAC algorithms, but also provides
   insights into developing efficient but low-complexity power update
   strategies for prioritized multitier cellular networks. We propose two
   such algorithms and through simulations, we show that our proposed
   algorithms outperform the existing ones in prioritized cellular
   networks.}},

   particular cell dielectric properties as it travels along the array-such
   as cytoplasm conductivity and membrane capacitance. The
   Clausius-Mossotti factor of the cell is determined from the measured
   response signal in conjunction with numerical simulation of its
   trajectory. The approach is validated through measuring polystyrene
   microspheres. The DEP response of Chinese hamster ovary cells using two

Title = {{One-day offset in daily hydrologic modeling: An exploration of the issue
   in automatic model calibration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{534}},
Pages = {{164-177}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Hydrologic modeling literature illustrates that daily simulation models
   are incapable of accurately representing hydrograph timing due to
   relationships between precipitation and watershed hydrologic response
   that happen with a sub-daily time step in the real world. For watersheds
   with a time of concentration less than 24 h and a late day precipitation
   event, the observed hydrographic response frequently occurs one day
   after the precipitation peak while the model simulates a same day event.
   The analysis of sub-daily precipitation and runoff in this study
   suggests that, this one-day offset is inevitable in daily analysis of
   the precipitation-runoff relationship when the same 24-h time interval,
   e.g. the calendar day, is used to prepare daily precipitation and runoff
   datasets. Under these conditions, daily simulation models will fail to
   emulate this one-day offset issue (1dOI) and result in significant daily
   residuals between simulated and measured hydrographs. Results of this
   study show that the automatic calibration of such daily models will be
   misled by model performance metrics that are based on the aggregation of
   daily residuals to a solution that systematically underestimate the peak
   flow rates while trying to emulate the one-day lags. In this study, a
   novel algorithm called Shifting Hydrograph In order to Fix Timing
   (SHIFT) is developed to reduce the impact of this one-day offset issue
   (1dOI) on the parameter estimation of daily simulation models. Results
   show that with SHIFT the aforementioned automatic calibration finds a
   solution that accurately estimates the magnitude of daily peak flow
   rates and the shape of the rising and falling limbs of the daily
   hydrograph. Moreover, it is shown that this daily calibrated model
   performs quite well with an alternative daily precipitation dataset that
   has a minimal number of 1dOIs, concluding that SHIFT can minimize the
   impact of 1dOI on parameter estimation of daily simulation models. (C)

Abstract = {{Modeling and simulation can help to validate and evaluate the
   performance of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) within specific
   applications. In order to resolve the issue of the restriction on node
   mobility in existing Zigbee WSN simulation models, this paper proposes a
   Zigbee compliant new simulation model using the OPNET simulator. Based
   on the Zigbee MAC layer model in OPNET Modeler, we develop a network
   layer model and propose an improved AODV routing algorithm to support
   node mobility, both of which are compatible with Zigbee protocols. We
   further present in details the structure of the network layer process
   model and the implementation procedures of its kernel functions.
   Comprehensive performance comparisons are performed between the proposed
   model and the Zigbee model in OPNET standard libraries. In order to
   evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model in the aspect of node
   mobility support, time intervals between route failure occurrence and
   route recovery are measured as well. The experimental results show that
   the proposed simulation model achieves better performance, compared to
   the original one. In addition, when node mobility causes routing
   failures, alternative routes can be established quickly by the proposed
   model.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the physico-chemical effects occasioned by the cold
   plasma discharge (CPD) on the photo decolorization of Reactive Orange 16
   (RO16) by 3D fabrics (spacer fabrics) loaded with ZnO:TiO2
   nano-photocatalysts (nphs) were optimized via response surface
   methodology (RSM). CPD was employed to improve the surface
   characteristics of the spacer fabrics for nphs loading. Surface
   morphology and color variation were studied utilizing scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) and CIE-Lab system, respectively. The effect of CPD on
   the wetting ability of the spacer fabrics was examined using dynamic
   adsorption measurement (DAM). Also, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) was
   utilized to investigate the durability of the nphs on the spacer
   fabrics. All the experiments were implemented in a Box-Behnken design
   (BBD) with three independent variables (CPD treatment time, dye
   concentration and irradiation time) in order to optimize the
   decolorization of RO16. The anticipated values of the decolorization
   efficiency were found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental
   values (R-2 = 0.9996, Adjusted R-2 = 0.9992). The kinetic analysis
   demonstrated that the photocatalytic decolorization followed the
   Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model. In conclusion, this heterogeneous
   photocatalytic process is capable of decolorizing and mineralizing azoic
   reactive dye in textile wastewater. Moreover, the results confirmed that
   RSM based on the BBD was a suitable method to optimize the operating
   conditions of RO16 degradation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   in third and fourth grade in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. An engineering
   audit and air samples were also taken in the homes of a subset of 715
   homes. Results showed that a child's respiratory health is significantly
   associated with self reported visible mold in the home and that a
   significant association existed between occupant-reported visible mold
   and tested airborne mold. Findings highlight the need for clearer
   standards of acceptable CFU/m(3) limits for mold genera that are
   applicable to homes. In the absence of such guidelines, problems

Abstract = {{Free nitrous acid (FNA) inhibition of anoxic and aerobic phosphorous
   removal in an integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) system with
   different FNA adaptation was investigated. A bench scale sequencing
   batch reactor (SBR) with plastic media was operated in an
   anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic sequence. During the anoxic period, nitrite was
   fed into the reactor at different concentrations to select for biomass
   adapted to 0.06 and 0.4 mu g HNO2-N L-1 of FNA during anoxic stage in
   Phase I and II, respectively. Long term anoxic/aerobic phosphorus
   removal was achieved in the IFAS reactor in both phases. In Phase I,
   aerobic phosphorous uptake was inhibited at higher level compared with
   anoxic phosphorus uptake. In Phase II, DPAO in both suspended and
   attached forms could adapt and were not inhibited at FNA level four
   times higher than the adapted concentration. The PAO's aerobic activity
   in Phase II, did not show significant adaptation and was inhibited at
   slightly lower level compared with that in Phase I. The FNA inhibition
   of aerobic phosphorous uptake rate in attached biomass was 20\% of that
   in suspended forms. In batch testes with the FNA level was raised to
   three times the adapted concentration, the contribution of attached
   biomass to overall anoxic and aerobic phosphorus uptake increased by
   20\% and 39\%, respectively. The attached biomass could allow an IFAS
   system to be less inhibited and better maintain phosphorous removal at
   sudden FNA inhibition events. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   efficiencies and minimal pollutant emissions (e.g., SOx, NOx). In spite
   of growing interest in pulse combustion technology, its state-of-the art
   is largely missing in the literature. The aim of this paper is to
   provide a comprehensive yet concise review of pulse combustion regarding
   the phenomenon and background of such combustion, modeling, experimental
   findings and industrial applications. First, the basics of pulse
   combustion are presented which include pulse combustor classification
   and types, operation principles, and advantages and disadvantages. In
   view of sustainability, pulse combustion characteristics with different
   fuel (e.g., biogas) are fully elaborated. Then, pulse combustion models
   described in topical literature are classified into different types and
   thoroughly examined. Next, experimental and numerical studies performed
   by numerous researchers are summarized, and the applications of pulse
   combustion in different fields, particularly in drying are presented,
   and its great potential to promote the utilization of renewable fuels is
   analyzed. Finally, the barriers, challenges, and R\&D for pulse
   combustion are identified and a constructive discussion on these issues
   is provided. Key publications for the readers seeking broader and
   in-depth information are also given. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Use of Boundary Control With Second-Order Switching Surface to Reduce
   the System Order for Deadbeat Controller in Grid-Connected Inverter}},

Abstract = {{Deadbeat control is commonly used in grid-connected inverter with L
   filter, but it faces the challenge of having filter resonance in
   inverter with LCL filter. Although many active damping techniques have
   been proposed to tackle such phenomenon, their digital implementation
   would introduce nonminimum phase characteristics. Furthermore, the plant
   viewed by the deadbeat controller is of high order, making the system
   performance be susceptible to the drift of the filter parameters. This
   paper introduces a new perspective of using boundary control with
   second-order switching surface to reduce the order of the plant viewed
   by the deadbeat controller. The structure hybridizes the merits of the
   deadbeat control in its simplicity and the boundary control in achieving
   wide control bandwidth. Small-signal dynamic modeling of the boundary
   control is formulated. The performance sensitivities of the overall
   system to filter parameters and grid inductance variations are studied
   with the derived models. An online grid inductance estimation algorithm
   is proposed to assure sufficient phase margin under an extremely
   weak-grid condition. A 2-kW, 220-V, 50-Hz prototype with the switching
   frequency of 8 kHz has been built and evaluated. Its steady-state and
   transient behavior, and harmonic rejection capability under stiff-and
   weak-grid conditions are discussed.}},

   healing, grain boundary decohesion, and sub-grain formation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Stress-driven grain boundary motion is one of the main mechanisms
   responsible for microstructural evolution in polycrystalline metals
   during deformation. In this research, the interaction of shearcoupled
   grain boundary motion (SCGBM) in face-centered cubic metals with crack,
   which is a common type of structural defects in engineering materials,
   has been studied by using molecular dynamics simulations in simple
   bicrystal models. The influences of different parameters such as metal
   type, temperature, grain boundary structure, and crack geometry have
   been examined systematically. Three types of microstructural evolution
   have been identified under different circumstances, namely, crack
   healing, grain boundary decohesion, and sub-grain formation. The
   underlying atomistic mechanisms for each type of SCGBM-crack
   interaction, particularly grain boundary decohesion and crack healing,
   have also been examined. It is found that crack healing is generally
   favoured during the SCGBM-crack interaction at relatively high
   temperature in metals with relatively low stacking fault energy and
   grain boundary structure with relatively low misorientation angles. The
   results of this work may open up new opportunities for healing severely
   damaged materials. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{185}},
Pages = {{74-86}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the paper is to present an empirical Bayesian method
   combined with Akaike's Bayesian Information Criterion (ABIC) to estimate
   the contaminant release history of a source in groundwater starting from
   few concentration measurements in space and/or in time. From the
   Bayesian point of view, the ABIC considers prior information on the
   unknown function, such as the prior distribution (assumed Gaussian) and
   the covariance function. The unknown statistical quantities, such as the
   noise variance and the covariance function parameters, are computed
   through the process; moreover the method quantifies also the estimation
   error through the confidence intervals. The methodology was successfully
   tested on three test cases: the classic Skaggs and Kabala release
   function, three sharp releases (both cases regard the transport in a
   one-dimensional homogenous medium) and data collected from laboratory
   equipment that consists of a two-climensional homogeneous unconfined
   aquifer. The performances of the method were tested with two different
   covariance functions (Gaussian and exponential) and also with large
   measurement error. The obtained results were discussed and compared to
   the geostatistical approach of Kitanidis (1995). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{In an underlay cognitive radio network (CRN), in order to guarantee that
   all primary users (PUs) achieve their
   target-signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (target-SINRs), the
   interference caused by all secondary users (SUs) to the primary
   receiving-points should be controlled. To do so, the feasible cognitive
   interference region (FCIR), i.e., the region for allowable values of
   interference at all of the primary receiving-points, which guarantee the
   protection of the PUs, needs to be formally characterized. In the
   state-of-the-art interference management schemes for underlay CRNs, it
   is considered that all PUs are protected if the cognitive interference
   for each primary receiving-point is lower than a maximum threshold, the
   so called interference temperature limit (ITL) for the corresponding
   receiving-point. This is assumed to be fixed and independent of ITL
   values for other primary receiving-points, which corresponds to a
   box-like FCIR. In this paper, we characterize the FCIR for uplink
   transmissions in cellular CRNs and for direct transmissions in ad-hoc
   CRNs. We show that the FCIR is in fact a polyhedron (i.e., the maximum
   feasible cognitive interference threshold for each primary
   receiving-point is not a constant, and it depends on that for the other
   primary receiving-points). Therefore, in practical interference
   management algorithms, it is not proper to consider a constant and
   independent ITL value for each of the primary receiving-points. This
   finding would significantly affect the design of practical interference
   management schemes for CRNs. To demonstrate this, based on the
   characterized FCIR, we propose two power control algorithms to find the
   maximum number of admitted SUs and the maximum aggregate throughput of
   the SUs in infeasible and feasible CRNs, respectively. For two distinct
   objectives, our proposed interference management schemes outperform the
   existing ones. The numerical results also demonstrate how the assumption
   of fixed ITL values leads to poor performance measures in CRNs.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a code-based discovery protocol for cellular device-to-device
   (D2D) communications. To realize proximity-based services such as mobile
   social networks and mobile marketing using D2D communications, each
   device should first discover nearby devices, which have mobile
   applications of interest, by using a discovery protocol. The proposed
   discovery protocol makes use of a short discovery code that contains
   compressed information of mobile applications in a device. A discovery
   code is generated by using either a hash function or a Bloom filter.
   When a device receives a discovery code broadcast by another device, the
   device can approximately find out the mobile applications in the other
   device. The proposed protocol is capable of quickly discovering massive
   number of devices while consuming a relatively small amount of radio
   resources. We analyze the performance of the proposed protocol under the
   random direction mobility model and a real mobility trace. By
   simulations, we show that the analytical results well match the
   simulation results and that the proposed protocol greatly outperforms a
   simple non-filtering protocol.}},

Abstract = {{A novel distributed power control paradigm is proposed for dense small
   cell networks co-existing with a traditional macrocellular network. The
   power control problem is first modeled as a stochastic game and the
   existence of the Nash Equilibrium is proven. Then, we extend the
   formulated stochastic game to a mean field game (MFG) considering a
   highly dense network. An MFG is a special type of differential game
   which is ideal for modeling the interactions among a large number of
   entities. We analyze the performance of two different cost functions for
   the mean field game formulation. Both of these cost functions are
   designed using stochastic geometry analysis in such a way that the cost
   functions are valid for the MFG setting. A finite difference algorithm
   is then developed based on the Lax-Friedrichs scheme and Lagrange
   relaxation to solve the corresponding MFG. Each small cell base station
   can independently execute the proposed algorithm offline, i.e., prior to
   data transmission. The output of the algorithm shows how each small cell
   base station should adjust its transmit power in order to minimize the
   cost over a predefined period of time. Moreover, sufficient conditions
   for the uniqueness of the mean field equilibrium for a generic cost
   function are also given. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is
   demonstrated via numerical results.}},

Title = {{Robust Ergodic Uplink Resource Allocation in Underlay OFDMA Cognitive

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{419-431}},

Abstract = {{The ergodic resource allocation (ERA) problem for uplink transmission in
   underlay cognitive radio networks (CRNs) is investigated. The objective
   is to maximize the ergodic sum-rate of secondary users (SUs) considering
   the unavailability of perfect channel state information (CSI), and
   subject to transmit power limitations of SUs, and the interference
   threshold constraint to guarantee the quality of service of primary
   users. Since with average-based formulation of ERA, the interference
   threshold constraint and transmit power limitations of SUs do not hold
   instantaneously, one can replace the average-based constraints in ERA
   with their outage-based counterparts. For the uncertainty on the CSI
   values, we utilize the robust optimization theory where the uncertain
   parameters are modeled as a sum of the estimated value and error which
   is assumed to be bounded. We then map the considered ERA problems to
   their robust counterparts. Generally, the robust approaches degrade the
   performance (e.g., sum rate of SU), as they conservatively consider the
   error to be in the maximum extent and try to preserve the constrains
   under any condition of error (worst-case scenario). We aim to moderate
   this effect by using appropriate models for uncertain parameters,
   relaxing the worst-case scenario, and stochastically preserving the
   constraints. Moreover, robust problems are in general non-convex and
   suffer from high computational complexity due to the existence of
   uncertain system parameters. Therefore, we use effective suboptimal
   approaches to solve them with a reasonable complexity. This includes
   methods based on chance constraint approach as well as an iterative
   scheme. The proposed solutions provide a trade-off between robustness,
   performance, and complexity. Simulation results reveal that by using the
   proposed schemes, stable sum-rate of SUs in the presence of CSI
   uncertainties can be achieved while the instantaneous power and
   interference constraints are met with a desired probability.}},

Abstract = {{Thick film screen-printing technology is employed to introduce planar
   dielectric antennas. The micron-size-thick film is made from
   high-permittivity dielectric paste, which is printed on a low-loss
   low-permittivity microwave substrate to operate as a magnetic wall
   boundary. A simplified theoretical model is developed to analyze the
   antenna structure. The accuracy of this model is evaluated by the
   results of a commercial three-dimensional (3-D) electromagnetic field
   solver. The model works well with less than 5\% deviation from
   time-consuming simulations, providing the permittivity contrast between
   the film and substrate is kept high (e.g., > 30). The impact of
   dielectric loss of the film in antenna performance is significantly less
   than that of the substrate, allowing medium-loss films (e.g., epsilon `'
   = 3) results in highly efficient antennas with over 95\% radiation
   efficiency. A prototype was made using screen printing and
   experimentally characterized at Ku-band. The experimental results
   confirm the theoretical achievements. The measured - 10 dB impedance
   bandwidth of the printable planar dielectric antenna having dimensions
   of 0.2 lambda(0) x 0.2 lambda(0) is over 10\% with a measured gain
   ranging from 4.5 to 5.5 dBi. Broadside radiation patterns with cross
   polarization levels of lower than -20 dB are achieved. This process is
   compatible with low-temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) technology where
   similar idea can be applied to other passive microwave components.}},

Abstract = {{The fundamental (TM11) mode of a circular patch antenna is generally
   used for broadside gain applications. However, other TM1m modes (m = 2,
   3 ... ) also radiate in the broadside direction with high directivities,
   but are avoided due to the occurrence of sidelobes in the radiation
   pattern. Here, a simple high-gain disc antenna configuration, using high
   dielectric constant substrates, operating in the TM12 mode, is
   presented. At first, through an analytical study, it is shown that by
   selecting an appropriate value of the dielectric constant, both high
   directivity and low sidelobe level (SLL) can be attained. Next, it is
   demonstrated that the excitation of adjacent modes can be reduced
   significantly by a proper selection of feed location. For a practical
   antenna design, it is also shown that the SLL can be further reduced
   using a finite ground plane size.}},

Abstract = {{Four common Portuguese rice varieties Thaibonnet, Gladio, Albatros, and

   zeamais Motschulsky, a common pest of stored rice in Portugal and in
   tropical countries. Physical (moisture content, hardness, length, and
   width) and chemical (by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy) properties of rice kernels were measured. Insect
   bioassays measured median developmental time, Dobie's index of
   susceptibility, percentage of damaged grains and weight loss, and
   progeny developed. This was done for paddy, brown rice, and polished
   rice for each variety. There were small, but significant, differences in
   insect resistance among the varieties. However, it was different for
   paddy and polished rice. In paddy, these differences were correlated
   with hull damage, and Eurosis was the most susceptible variety. In
   polished rice, resistance was correlated with hardness, and Thaibonnet
   was the most susceptible variety. In general, paddy rice was more
   resistant to insect attack, followed by polished rice and then brown
   rice. Paddy kernels selected with undamaged hull were completely

Abstract = {{Culverts are used to preserve pavement embankments by draining water
   from the structures. However pavement roughness caused by excessive
   bumps, sags, and depressions at a culvert location are signs of failure
   or improper construction. The surface roughness at a culvert location
   can be caused by inadequate compaction of granular base material,
   erosion of the backfill or supporting materials, and (or) differential
   frost heaving. Pavement roughness can adversely affect ride quality and
   create potentially unsafe driving conditions. The objective of this
   study is to recommend construction and maintenance solutions to mitigate
   bumps, sags, and depressions at through-grade culverts on highways in
   Manitoba. The study consists of a review of the state of the art
   practices in culvert construction and maintenance; a survey
   questionnaire to obtain construction and performance history of
   through-grade culverts in Manitoba; and a forensic investigation and
   case study analysis of failed culverts with excessive bump, dip or sags.
   Culverts with minor or no pavement roughness were also investigated to
   identify design and construction elements that favor good performance.
   The results of the forensic investigation and recommended best practices

Abstract = {{The poor safety record of the construction industry raises concerns
   about the extent to which it is able to integrate workers disabled as a
   result of a workplace injury back to the workplace. A review of the
   literature indicates there is little empirical evidence about the status
   of disability management (DM) in the Canadian construction industry,
   specifically with respect to injured construction workers returning to
   the workplace with a disability. To address this limitation, a web-based
   survey was administered to a sample of Manitoban construction
   organizations to enquire about workers disabled as a result of a
   workplace injury in the industry, practices in place to accommodate
   them, and barriers to their employment. The analysis of the responses of
   88 organizations showed that the majority of responding organizations
   employed few disabled workers. Disabilities due to musculoskeletal
   injuries were the most common, followed by physical mobility and hearing
   impairments. Respondents saw retaining valued and experienced employees
   and maintaining employee morale as the main reasons for implementing a
   DM program. They also found the lack of suitable modified or alternate
   work to be the most important barrier to DM; however, they identified
   the provision of such work as the most common practice implemented by
   them, raising questions about this work's suitability to disabled
   workers.}},

Abstract = {{Sediment erosion and deposition rates are two of the most important
   factors that influence fluvial geomorphology. Several experimental
   devices have been constructed to estimate cohesive sediment erosion
   rate. However, estimated erosion rates may not be reliable for large
   rivers due to limited soil sampling and a high dependency of cohesive
   sediment behaviour on several physical, mechanical, and electrochemical
   properties of the sediment and eroding fluid. A new methodology has been
   developed to estimate the erosion and deposition rate of wide rivers
   using in situ measurements. To test this methodology, an acoustic
   Doppler current profiler was used to collect bathymetry and velocity
   profiles over a study area along the Red River in Winnipeg, Canada.
   Sediment concentration profiles along an 8.5 km reach of the river were
   measured several times under different flow conditions. Finally, an
   advection-dispersion equation was numerically solved using measured and
   calculated streamwise dispersion coefficients, flow and channel
   characteristics to calculate net erosion and deposition over the study
   area. Moreover, an exponential relationship was obtained between the
   river discharge and longitudinal dispersion coefficient for the Red
   River.}},

   resist joint shear stress equal to 1.1 times the square root of the
   concrete compressive strength up to 6\% drift ratio. In some cases, the

Abstract = {{This paper presents the test results of five full-scale reinforced
   concrete (RC) interior slab-column connections. Each specimen consisted
   of a 2,800-mm square slab with a thickness of 200 and 300-mm square

   reinforced with steel bars. The connections were subjected to eccentric
   load with a moment-to-shear ratio equal to 0.15m. The test parameters
   included the type and ratio of the reinforcement and concrete
   compressive strength. Test results revealed that increasing the GFRP
   reinforcement ratio or the concrete strength increased the connection
   capacity and decreased the deformation of the tested slabs. Moreover,
   the GFRP-RC connection that has similar reinforcement rigidity to the
   steel-RC one showed comparable capacity and deflection at failure. Test
   results were compared with different available models and design

Abstract = {{A total of seven large-scale continuous concrete beams reinforced with

   with steel bars and stirrups and six beams were reinforced

   showed that no significant increase in the shear strength occurred when
   the shear reinforcement ratio increased by using a larger stirrup
   diameter. On the other hand, the FE models showed that increasing the
   transverse reinforcement ratio through decreasing the stirrup spacing is

Title = {{A biomechanical sorting of clinical risk factors affecting osteoporotic
   hip fracture}},
Journal = {{OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{423-439}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Osteoporotic fracture has been found associated with many clinical risk
   factors, and the associations have been explored dominantly by
   evidence-based and case-control approaches. The major challenges
   emerging from the studies are the large number of the risk factors, the
   difficulty in quantification, the incomplete list, and the
   interdependence of the risk factors. A biomechanical sorting of the risk
   factors may shed lights on resolving the above issues. Based on the
   definition of load-strength ratio (LSR), we first identified the four
   biomechanical variables determining fracture risk, i.e., the risk of
   fall, impact force, bone quality, and bone geometry. Then, we explored
   the links between the FRAX clinical risk factors and the biomechanical
   variables by looking for evidences in the literature. To accurately
   assess fracture risk, none of the four biomechanical variables can be
   ignored and their values must be subject-specific. A clinical risk
   factor contributes to osteoporotic fracture by affecting one or more of
   the biomechanical variables. A biomechanical variable represents the
   integral effect from all the clinical risk factors linked to the
   variable. The clinical risk factors in FRAX mostly stand for bone
   quality. The other three biomechanical variables are not adequately
   represented by the clinical risk factors. From the biomechanical
   viewpoint, most clinical risk factors are interdependent to each other
   as they affect the same biomechanical variable(s). As biomechanical
   variables must be expressed in numbers before their use in calculating
   LSR, the numerical value of a biomechanical variable can be used as a
   gauge of the linked clinical risk factors to measure their integral
   effect on fracture risk, which may be more efficient than to study each
   individual risk factor.}},

Title = {{Lignin biosynthesis in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.): its response to
   waterlogging and association with hormonal levels}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Lignin is an important structural component of plant cell
   wall that confers mechanical strength and tolerance against biotic and
   abiotic stressors; however it affects the use of biomass such as wheat
   straw for some industrial applications such as biofuel production.
   Genetic alteration of lignin quantity and quality has been considered as
   a viable option to overcome this problem. However, the molecular
   mechanisms underlying lignin formation in wheat biomass has not been
   studied. Combining molecular and biochemical approaches, the present
   study investigated the transcriptional regulation of lignin biosynthesis
   in two wheat cultivars with varying lodging characteristics and also in
   response to waterlogging. It also examined the association of lignin
   level in tissues with that of plant hormones implicated in the control
   of lignin biosynthesis.
   Results: Analysis of lignin biosynthesis in the two wheat cultivars
   revealed a close association of lodging resistance with internode lignin
   content and expression of 4-coumarate: CoA ligase1 (4CL1), p-coumarate
   3-hydroxylase1 (C3H1), cinnamoyl-CoA reductase2 (CCR2), ferulate
   5-hydroxylase2 (F5H2) and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase2 (COMT2),
   which are among the genes highly expressed in wheat tissues, implying
   the importance of these genes in mediating lignin deposition in wheat
   stem. Waterlogging of wheat plants reduced internode lignin content, and
   this effect is accompanied by transcriptional repression of three of the
   genes characterized as highly expressed in wheat internode including
   phenylalanine ammonia-lyase6 (PAL6), CCR2 and F5H2, and decreased
   activity of PAL. Expression of the other genes was, however, induced by
   waterlogging, suggesting their role in the synthesis of other
   phenylpropanoid-derived molecules with roles in stress responses.
   Moreover, difference in internode lignin content between cultivars or
   change in its level due to waterlogging is associated with the level of
   cytokinin.
   Conclusion: Lodging resistance, tolerance against biotic and abiotic
   stresses and feedstock quality of wheat biomass are closely associated
   with its lignin content. Therefore, the findings of this study provide
   important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying lignin
   formation in wheat, an important step towards the development of
   molecular tools that can facilitate the breeding of wheat cultivars for
   optimized lignin content and enhanced feedstock quality without
   affecting other lignin-related agronomic benefits.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the findings of a sensitivity study of parameters in
   the shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model in a commercial
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code to predict an experiment from
   the Generation IV International Forum Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor
   (GIF SCWR) 2013-2014 seven-rod subchannel benchmark exercise. This study
   was motivated by the result of the benchmark exercise that all the CFD
   codes gave similar results to a subchannel code, which does not possess
   any sophisticated turbulence modeling. Initial findings were that the
   CFD codes generally underpredicted the wall temperatures on the B2 case
   in the region where the flow was supercritical. Therefore, it was
   decided to examine the effect of various turbulence model parameters to
   determine if a CFD code using the SST turbulence model could do a better
   job overall in predicting the wall temperatures of the benchmark
   experiments. A sensitivity study of seven parameters was done, and
   changes to two parameters were found to make an improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Multiobjective memetic optimization algorithms (MMOAs) are recently
   applied to solve nonlinear optimization problems with conflicting
   objectives. An important issue in an MMOA is how to identify the
   relative best solutions to guide its adaptive processes. Pareto
   dominance has been used extensively to find the relative relations
   between solutions for the fitness assessment in multiobjective
   optimization based on evolutionary algorithms (MOEA). However, the
   approach based on the Pareto dominance criterion decreases its
   convergence speed when the number of objectives increases. In this
   paper, we propose an effective information-theoretic criterion based on
   the multiscale relative Renyi entropy to guide the adaptive selection,
   clustering, and local learning processes in our framework of adaptive
   multiobjective memetic optimization algorithms (AMMOA). The
   implementation of AMMOA is applied to several benchmark test problems
   with remarkable results.}},

Abstract = {{Host Based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) are gaining traction in
   discovering malicious software inside a host operating system. In this
   paper, the authors have developed a new cognitive host based anomaly

   incorporated in the original AdaBoost machine learning algorithm to
   assign higher weight to the classifier that estimates wrong hypothesis.
   An agent based host sensor is developed that continuously gathers and
   extracts network profile of all the host processes and the modules
   spawned by each process of a Microsoft Windows 7 operating system. The
   main contributions of this paper are that a malware testing sandbox is
   developed using Microsoft native APIs and an information fractal
   (cognitive) based AdaBoost algorithm is designed and developed. Our
   results on empirical data set shows that the malware detection
   performance of the proposed algorithm outperforms original AdaBoost
   algorithm in detecting positives including the reduction of false

Abstract = {{This paper compares the probability similarities between a cyberattack,
   the distributed denial-of-service, and the mathematical model of
   probability, Levy walks. This comparison aims to explore the validity of
   Levy walks as a model resembling the DDoS probability features. This
   research also presents a method, based on the Smirnov transform, for
   generating synthetic data with the statistical properties of Levy-walks.
   This method for synthetic data generation can be utilized for generating
   arbitrary prescribed probability density functions (pdf). The Smirnov
   transform is used to solve a cybersecurity engineering problem
   associated with Internet traffic. The synthetic Levy-walk process is
   intertwined with sections of other distinct characteristics (uniform
   noise, Gaussian noise, and an ordinary sinusoid) to create a composite
   signal, which is then analyzed with zero-crossing rate (ZCR) within a
   varying-size window. This paper shows that it is possible to identify
   the distinct sections present in the composite signal through ZCR. The
   differentiation of these sections shows an increasing ZCR value as the
   section under analysis exhibits a higher activity or complexity (from
   the sinusoid, to a synthetic Levy-walk process, and uniform and Gaussian
   noise, respectively). The advantages of the ZCR computation directly in
   the time-domain are appealing for real-time implementations. The varying
   window in the ZCR produces more defined values as the window size
   increases. The changing world of security systems is deeply considered,
   in an approach for its improvement. This as our society is highly
   dependent on electronically interconnected systems-of-systems demanding
   operational robustness and security. The approach proposed for providing
   a higher degree of security aiming to the development of cognitive
   security systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the incentive mechanism design issue for device-to-device
   (D2D) content-sharing communications is discussed. In literature, most
   of works are based on auction/game theory, where all content owners
   first report their ask prices/costs towards the base station (BS) which
   finally decides only one winner from them to transmit data towards the
   content requester. One disadvantage of these works is that content
   owners may be frequently activated to provide auction/game information
   (such as prices/costs), leading to high energy consumption, but finally
   may not win to gain benefit. To address this, we propose a sequential
   posted price mechanism where the BS sends offers with posted prices to
   content owners in sequence and activates only one owner each time. The
   BS stops sending new offers as long as there is already an owner
   accepting an offer or when the BS finds the expected cost of sending a
   new offer is larger than the cost of direct transmission. The optimal
   posted prices and offer-stopping rule of the BS are derived by the
   backward principle of dynamic programming. Simulation results show that
   the proposed mechanism can effectively limit the proportion of content
   owners being activated while the BS maintains an acceptable expected
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the design of a truthful mechanism for prioritized
   medical packet transmissions in e-health networks is studied. Unlike
   most of existing works, we focus on beyond wireless body area networks
   (beyond-WBANs), and consider the absolutely prioritized scheduling,
   i.e., emergent medical signals have to always be transmitted prior to
   normal ones. In our model, medical packets arrive randomly at each
   WBAN-gateway, and their transmission requests are reported to the base
   station (BS) with different packet priorities. The BS then dynamically
   manages the beyond-WBAN transmission service by following the proposed
   mechanism constructed on a multi-class multi-server queueing system.
   Theoretical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
   mechanism can guarantee all gateways to truthfully report their packet
   priorities, and can incentivize the BS to provide exclusive channel

Abstract = {{The virtually-grounded grid-connected voltage-source three-phase
   inverter has been proven to be more effective in alleviating the
   common-mode noise than the one without the virtual ground and in
   extending the utilization of DC bus voltage, as compared to the
   four-wire configuration. However, similar to the four-wire
   configuration, such virtually-grounded configuration would have DC bus
   unbalance, which would cause modulation saturation and output current
   distortion. Typically, two splitting capacitor voltages are measured and
   compared to produce a common-mode DC bias voltage to the output voltage
   of the inverter and thereby eliminate such effect. To reduce the number
   of sensors, a DC voltage feedforward injection method, which utilizes
   the intra-cycle average value of the duty cycles of the gate signals, is
   proposed to mitigate possible modulation saturation and output current
   distortion under the unbalanced condition of DC splitting voltage. A 3kW
   prototype has been built and evaluated to investigate the effectiveness
   of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Cascaded boundary-deadbeat controller has been proven to be effective in
   controlling single-phase grid-connected inverter with LCL output filter.
   Such architecture mitigates filter resonance and offers good stability
   under stiff and weak grid conditions. However, its merits are offset by
   requiring many sensors and high-precision intra-cycle information of the
   circuit variables to dictate the states of the switches. Moreover, the
   system will also be in variable switching frequency operation, due to
   coupling circuit variables amongst phases, in controlling three-phase
   three-wire inverter. This paper presents a boundary controller that
   utilizes second-order switching surface to track directly the output
   current of the three-phase three-wire grid-connected inverter with an
   LCL filter. By applying the 60-degree discontinuous pulsewidth
   modulation scheme for a fictitious decoupled dual-buck structure in each
   operation sector, two separate sets of switching criteria with reduced
   number of current sensors, fixed frequency operation and recovered
   intra-cycle information of circuit variables for dictating the states of
   the switches of two half-bridge legs are formulated. A 3kW, 127V/ 50Hz
   prototype is built to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control
   method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the digital implementation of a boundary controller
   with unipolar switching characteristic for single phase voltage source
   full bridge inverters, which will be used as an interface between a low
   voltage DC microgrid and AC loads. This paper expands the second order
   switching surface control method for single phase inverters by unipolar
   switching with the use of a finite-state machine. Compared to bipolar
   switching, unipolar switching has the advantage of lower switching
   losses and filter size. Besides, the switching losses can be equally
   distributed among semiconductor switches compared to conventional
   three-level inverter switching scheme. The operating principles of
   proposed control scheme and mathematical derivation of the switching
   functions will be given. A 550 VA, 120 V, 60 Hz voltage source inverter
   (VSI) with a digital signal processor has been implemented to verify the
   theoretical predictions. Experimental results for steady state operation
   at different loading conditions show a tightly regulated output voltage,
   for large-signal disturbances the control is fast and precise.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a new bridgeless Power Factor Correction (PFC)
   topology, using a recently proposed controllable LCL filter, namely
   Active Virtual Ground (AVG) to achieve efficient power conversion and
   high frequency (HF) common mode voltage (CM) reduction. The proposed PFC
   circuit consists of high frequency semiconductors for shaping inductor
   current, and low frequency semiconductors to form two different LCL
   structures for different conditions. This reduces grid differential mode
   (DM) current ripple or inductance. Besides, the PFC CM voltage, a main
   problem of bridgeless PFCs, is significantly reduced, since the
   capacitor in the LCL filter clamps the voltage between the grid and the
   converter ground. The performance of the proposed PFC is experimentally
   verified. The results show that the proposed PFC guarantees sinusoidal
   input current, low high frequency common-mode voltage noise and has a
   good agreement with the theoretical findings.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method is proposed to enhance the performance of optimization
   algorithms to obtain impulse generator settings. This method resolves
   two major problems encountered in tradition optimization-enabled
   electromagnetic transient simulation (OE-EMTS) approach. First, a new
   technique is introduced to model a transformer in an electromagnetic
   transient (EMT) simulator. This technique uses the frequency response of
   the transformer to calculate time-domain quantities without synthesizing
   the transformer circuit. As a results, most of the major issues
   attributed to the frequency-response based EMT modeling are solved, such
   as appearance of negative resistive elements in the synthesized circuit
   and generation of highly complex/dense branch networks. Second, multiple
   optimization algorithms are implemented to optimize impulse generator
   settings. Combination of multiple algorithms has balanced the effects of
   convergence speed and accuracy for better results. The proposed approach
   is verified by two case studies, involving different resistor
   arrangements. The simulated waveforms are compared with those obtained
   from measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Snoring is common in the general population and the irregularity could
   lead to the presence of Obstructive sleep apnea. Diagnosis of OSA could
   therefore be made by snoring sound analysis. However, there is still a
   shortage of robust methods to automatically detect snoring sounds
   without the need to calibrate for every individual. In this paper, a
   novel method based on neural network is proposed to classify breathing
   sound episodes from snoring and non-snoring sound segments. Our snore
   detection algorithm was applied to the tracheal sounds of nine
   individuals with different OSA severities. On the testing dataset, the
   classifier achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 95.9\% and 97.6\%
   respectively. Our results indicate that using such a method could help
   to detect snoring sounds with high accuracy which would be useful in the
   diagnosis of sleep apnea.}},

   evaluate the switching losses at different load currents. The
   computational effort needed to estimate switching loses with the
   proposed method is much less than the effort required when using the
   detailed dynamic models of IGBT. But the accuracy of the loss

   estimation in the edges points of their domain. We refer to the model
   y(i) = R( x(i)) + is an element of(i), i = 1, 2,... n, where x(i) is
   assumed to be the set of deterministic inputs, x(i) is an element of D,
   y(i) is the set of probabilistic outputs, and is an element of(i) is a
   measurement noise with zero mean and bounded variance. R(.) is a
   completely unknown function. The possible solution of finding unknown
   function is to apply the algorithms based on the Parzen kernel
   {[}13,31]. The commonly known drawback of these algorithms is that the
   error of estimation dramatically increases if the point of estimation x
   is drifting to the left or right bound of interval D. This fact makes it
   impossible to estimate functions exactly in edge values of domain.
   The main goal of this paper is an application of NMS algorithm (
   introduced in {[}11]), basing on integral version of the Parzen method
   of function estimation by combining the linear approximation idea. The
   results of numerical experiments are presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a reactive power control technique for single-phase
   Photovoltaic (PV) inverters, especially unfolding inverter. The proposed
   system retains the benefit of the unfolding inverters having low BOM
   cost and semiconductor losses, and tackles the drawback of the standard
   unfolding inverter not having capability of reactive power injection. It
   is important to note that reactive power delivery is mandatory for PV
   inverters according to the recent announced regulations. The concept is
   based on changing the shape of the grid current waveform but keeping the
   same zero crossing points as in the unity power factor condition. The
   current waveform is governed by real power and reactive power, at the
   price of an acceptable deformation. The operating principles of the
   proposed technique and mathematical derivations of the grid current
   function are provided in the paper. Experimental results in a grid-tie
   inverter prototype have shown a good agreement with the derived theory,
   and they confirm the feasibility of using the proposed technique in
   grid-tie inverters.}},

   energy of the nodes in the network and allows the source node to make

   packets incorporates load balancing in the network which maximizes
   network lifetime and minimizes energy consumption. The results show that
   the proposed algorithm has lower residual energy (84\%, 78\%, and 60\%
   less) and longer network lifetime (394\%, 195\%, and 105\%) than
   directed diffusion and its variants.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminium Matrix Composites (AMCs) have received considerable attention
   among researchers and emerging as a prominent choice material for
   building and construction purposes. The preference of AMCs as
   replacement for conventional aluminium alloys is chiefly due to its
   excellent strength-to-weight ratio. However, the problem of accelerated
   corrosion attributed to the reinforcement particles used in the
   production of AMCs is well documented in the literature and serves as
   potential limitations for its applications. In this work, an attempt was
   made to study the influence of chromium (Cr) additions on the corrosion
   behaviour of A16063-SiC-Cr composites. The novel A16063-12\%SiC-Cr
   composites were prepared with 0, 3 and 6 wt. \% Cr by using a double
   stir casting technique. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was
   used to study the corrosion behaviour of the as cast composites surfaces
   when immersed in 3 wt. \% Sodium Chloride buffered to a pH of 8 +/- 0.3
   using 0.1M Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) solution for 72 hours. From the
   Nyquist plots and equivalent circuit fitting results, the charge
   transfer resistance values were observed to change from 10 to 3.7 K
   Omega, 30 to 9.5 K Omega, 19 to 2.8 K Omega for 0, 3 and 6 wt. \% Cr
   content respectively after 72 hours of exposure. The increase in charge
   transfer resistance (Rct) values obtained with increasing Cr content was
   a clear indication of improved resistance to corrosion. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {{Microbial production of fuels such as ethanol, butanol, hydrogen (H-2),
   and methane (CH4) from waste biomass has the potential to provide
   sustainable energy systems that can displace fossil fuel consumption.
   Screening for microbial diversity and genome sequencing of a wide-range
   of microorganisms can identify organisms with natural abilities to
   synthesize these alternative fuels and/or other biotechnological
   applications. Clostridium species are the most widely studied strict
   anaerobes capable of fermentative synthesis of ethanol, butanol, or
   hydrogen directly from waste biomass. Clostridium termitidis CT1112 is a
   mesophilic, cellulolytic species capable of direct cellulose
   fermentation to ethanol and organic acids, with concomitant synthesis of
   H-2 and CO2. On the basis of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and chaperonin 60
   (cpn60) gene sequence data, phylogenetic analyses revealed a close
   relationship between C. termitidis and C. cellobioparum. Comparative
   bioinformatic analyses of the C. termitidis genome with 18 cellulolytic
   and 10 non-cellulolytic Clostridium species confirmed this relationship,
   and further revealed that the majority of core metabolic pathway genes
   in C. termitidis and C. cellobioparum share more than 90\% amino acid
   sequence identity. The gene loci and corresponding amino acid sequences
   of the encoded enzymes for each pathway were correlated by percentage
   identity, higher score (better alignment), and lowest e-value (most
   significant ``hit{''}). In addition, the function of each enzyme was
   proposed by conserved domain analysis. In this chapter we discuss the
   comparative analysis of metabolic pathways involved in synthesis of
   various useful products by cellulolytic and non-cellulolytic biofuel and
   solvent producing Clostridium species. This study has generated valuable
   information concerning the core metabolism genes and pathways of C.
   termitidis CT1112, which is helpful in developing metabolic engineering
   strategies to enhance its natural capacity for better industrial
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive wireless sensor networks exploit the spectrum heterogeneity to
   access the different spectrum bands for data transmission. The various
   spectrum access schemes proposed in the previous work assume that each
   node can access and transmit their data using a single spectrum band at
   any given time, with the access to the different spectrum bands being
   dynamic and relative to the wireless medium conditions. However, this
   approach may not be enough to address the networks with a large number
   of nodes that are exchanging high volumes of data. In this paper, we
   propose a transmission scheduling policy for allowing the sensor nodes
   to transmit its data across a multiple number of spectrum bands, and
   simultaneously. We also present a mathematical model to analyze the
   performance of the sensor nodes that employ our proposed scheduling
   policy. The results of the analysis can further be used to determine the
   optimal policy parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Most research on the mathematical modelling of wireless sensor networks
   (WSNs) have focussed mainly on the optimization aspects, such as those
   relating to sensor placements, data routing, reliability, etc.
   Surprisingly the issue relating to performance analysis of data
   processing and transmission at the nodes, have not received as much
   attention. A considerable amount of delay to data actually happens at
   the nodes as a result of queue build up. Hence, understanding the role
   of queueing in WSN modelling is very important. In this paper we study
   the literature of queueing as applied to WSNs and provide insight to the
   current state of the art and directions for the future. The utilization
   of queueing theory in WSNs is broadly classified into four categories,
   namely, congestion control methods, power allocation schemes, network
   performance evaluation techniques and scheduling schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Initial condensation on the sample surface during superheated steam (SS)
   drying leads to increased sample moisture affecting its mechanical and
   thermal properties. A study was conducted to understand the effect of
   temperature and velocity of SS on the amount of initial condensation on
   distillers' spent grain pellets with an initial moisture content of 25\%
   (wet basis). These pellets were dried using SS at 120, 150, and 180
   degrees C with velocities 0.5, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4m/s. Separate
   experiments were conducted for recording mass and surface temperature of
   the pellets during SS drying. Mass recorded over the drying period was
   then compared with the predicted mass obtained by solving the standard
   heat balance and film condensation equations. The predicted values of
   mass flux due to initial condensation were in close agreement with
   directly measured values with a maximum mean square error of 0.20. There
   was a 60-64\% decrease in the amount of initial condensation as the
   temperature of SS was increased from 120 to 180 degrees C. The results
   indicate that the initial condensation can be minimal when the
   temperature of SS is equal or above 180 degrees C with SS velocity equal
   or above 1m/s using a preheated drying chamber.}},

Abstract = {{Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs) and Industrial Symbioses (IS) have provided
   several cost-effective and environmental friendly solutions for the
   economic growth of countries. The need for excessive materials, water
   and energy can be reduced by exchanging wastes, by-products and energy
   among different clusters of industries, which is the fundamental goal of
   establishing synergies among industries. Symbioses design looks for the
   best set of connections among industries to satisfy defined objectives.
   However, there are not enough data to support the design of a new EIP
   for some industries. The existing research contains multiple objective
   optimization methods, but lacks details in the real industrial world to
   consider comprehensive criteria in design of flow exchanges due to the
   large cost and long establishment time for those synergies. This paper
   presents a multi-objective model to decide the best network of
   industries for several exchanges among them. The model helps minimizing
   costs for multiple product exchanges while considering environmental
   impacts to be reduced. Moreover, this paper investigates uncertainties
   affecting synergies within EIPs by incorporating in a modeling process.
   The presented models are validated through optimizing symbioses in an
   EIP. The efficiency of single and multiple objective models is analyzed
   for effects of the selected uncertainties. Future research directions
   are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Design and implementation of Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs) is a practical
   and scientific solution to achieve sustainable industries. Specifically,
   energy exchange networks can significantly contribute to the pollution
   reduction by recovering and sharing wasted heat generated in industrial
   processes. Despite this perceived fact, the existing research seems
   mainly looking for one to one relation and lacks in methods for modeling
   and optimizing multi-synergy symbioses that is essential for EIPs. This
   paper reviews main concepts in designing industrial symbioses and
   proposes an optimization model to exchange the residual energy between
   individual industries in an EIP. Using mathematical programming, the
   model decides the best set of connections between energy suppliers and
   users to minimize the total cost and maximize energy symbioses. The
   presented models analyze perspectives to potential symbioses for
   individual industries and EIP managers. A detailed discussion clarifies
   how these perspectives can affect the optimized symbioses. The model is
   validated using anonym ized data of a real case. The result shows that
   various perspectives to the model provide Offerent energy network
   topographies.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient and intersection-free model offsetting framework is
   introduced in this paper to generate shell models for 3D printing. The
   basic concept of the framework is to offset vertices of the input mesh
   to obtain an approximate discrete signed distance field for
   reconstructing the offsetting mesh. The framework first offsets vertices
   of the mesh by a given distance along their normal directly. These
   vertices are then adjusted or discarded according to the given
   offsetting distance to form an approximate discrete signed distance
   field using a binary space partition (BSP) tree. These reserved vertices
   are finally reconstructed using Poisson reconstruction algorithms to
   form the inner surface of the shell model. Results of the framework are
   intersection and non-manifold free for an arbitrary distance. It also
   allows different parts of a model for different offsetting distances
   from user interactions. Several examples are given to demonstrate that
   the framework is effective and robust for 3D printing.}},

Abstract = {{It is beneficial to conduct LCA(Life Cycle Assessment) during early
   stages of product development, as the earlier the environmental problems
   associated with the product life cycle are discovered, the less costly
   and more effective the preventing measures are. However, due to the lack
   of data communication tools between CAD and LCA systems, life cycle data
   collection during design stage is difficult. This paper presents a
   feature-based method of UGNX-LCA integration for sustainable product
   development. A feature-based multi-view life cycle model for integrating
   product-process-LCI (Life Cycle Inventory) data is developed based on
   mapping mechanism between engineering domains of product design, process
   planning and LCA. Data migration from UGNX models to LCA, including UG
   modeling feature identification, UG-LC(Life Cycle) feature
   transformation and LC feature model output are realized by embedded
   integrator. A case study of data migration from UGNX to LCA is presented
   to demonstrate the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{3D printing technologies have been widely used in Tissue Engineering.
   The pneumatic dispensing system is one of the promising dispensing
   technologies to fabricate scaffolds with controllable pore sizes and
   porosities. There are many factors to affect the printing quality in
   pneumatic systems. An effective method is required to help users to
   systematically select proper operational parameters to print strands
   with desired width. In this paper, the DoE method is introduced to
   evaluate operational parameters and their interactions. The solution is
   further verified using regression tests. Based on the proposed solution,
   a five steps parameters selection method is proposed and verified to
   select operational parameters for two targeted strand widths.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the soil cone index (CI) is important in agricultural
   engineering and agronomy as it affects the energy requirement of field
   machines and the development of plant roots. In this study, a discrete
   element model (DEM) was developed to simulate a micropenetrometer and
   its interaction with soil using Particle Flow Code in Three Dimensions
   (PFC3D). The dynamic behavior of the model was investigated for
   different container sizes and probe interactions. To calibrate and
   validate the model, laboratory and field tests were conducted to measure
   the CI of a loamy fine sand soil using a micropenetrometer. The
   calibrated value of particle stiffness was 10,300 N m(-1) for the soil.
   The CI values simulated using the model were comparable with the field
   measurements with relative errors below 15\% for hard and soft soil
   conditions. The results showed that increasing the penetration speed in
   the model resulted in higher CI outputs and less computational time. The
   model allowed monitoring of CI at different soil bulk densities. The
   simulation results showed that the soil CI increased linearly with the
   increase in bulk density.}},

   coupled non-linear heat, mass, and momentum transfer equations. An
   experiment was conducted in a large-scale (commercial) warehouse storage
   facility to measure temperature distributions in the stored paddy rice
   to validate the CFD model. The stored grain was aerated for 30 h, and
   temperature was measured at five depths within the grain bulk and at 24
   locations for each depth. The simulated temperatures were in good
   agreement with the measured values, with relative differences less than
   6.3\%. The CFD model was shown to be effective in assessing the
   uniformity of temperature distribution in the grain bulk during aeration
   and the performance of the aeration system.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicles in the near future will be equipped with dedicated short-range
   communications (DSRC) transceiver which holds great promise of
   significantly reducing vehicle collisions by enabling vehicle-to-vehicle
   (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V21) communications. In addition,
   modern vehicles will be equipped with different on-board sensors such as
   GPS receivers and ranging sensors (e.g., cameras, radars, and lidars).
   Using these technologies, this paper proposes a comprehensive system
   design to improve the positioning of a host vehicle based on Kalman
   filters. In this approach, the host vehicle fuses its own position
   information obtained by the on-board GPS receiver with position
   information of nearby vehicles collected by the on-board ranging
   sensor(s) and the messages received via the DSRC transceiver from other
   equipped vehicles. This process also involves performing track matching
   using a multi-sensor multi-target track association algorithm. We
   provide insights on the system design and present simulation results
   that show significant performance gains of the proposed method in terms
   of localization accuracy and matching accuracy.}},

   from 2620 to 7900. The offset height ratio was fixed at 2 during the
   experiments. The jet reattached to the free surface and the reattachment
   length decreased with increase of Reynolds number. Free surface showed
   significant effect on the maximum velocity decay, jet spread, streamwise
   mean velocity distribution, Reynolds shear and normal stresses in the
   upper jet. The decay and spread rate of the lower jet was comparable to
   free jet due to less confinement effect. The mean and turbulent
   quantities reported herein were nearly independent of Reynolds number.
   Proper orthogonal decomposition was performed to reveal the dynamic role

Abstract = {{Experimental study was carried out to investigate the Reynolds number
   effects on surface jet characteristics. The surface jet was produced
   using orifice nozzle with offset height ratio of 2. Six different
   Reynolds numbers ranging from 2300 to 11900 were investigated. Potential
   core region of the jet decreased with Reynolds number up to the Reynolds
   number of 5500. Reattachment point was sensitive to Reynolds number
   within the range of the present study. The maximum velocity decay and
   jet spread were nearly independent of Reynolds number. The streamwise
   mean velocity, streamwise turbulence intensity and Reynolds shear stress
   distribution along surface normal direction were affected by the free
   surface and showed Reynolds number independency at the Reynolds numbers
   beyond 5500.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a queueing model for analyzing performances of
   prioritized data transmissions in Medical Wireless Body Area Networks
   (mWBANs). Unlike the existing works, we consider the medical packet
   priority jointly with the delay-dependent dynamic priority in
   transmission scheduling at sensor nodes. The interaction between
   priority queues and instantaneous delay limits make the analysis much
   more complicated. Based on the transient queueing analysis, we develop a
   buffer overflowing queueing principle to approximate the over-deadline
   queueing principle in this prioritized transmission scheduling system.
   Numerical and simulation results show that the proposed approximation
   queueing model works as a good tit to this prioritized data transmission
   system in mWBANs, and the proposed delay-dependent falling priority
   principle makes medical packets' transmission more reasonable in terms
   of timeliness issues.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hybrid active filter to suppress harmonic
   resonances and to reduce harmonic distortion under unbalanced conditions
   in medium voltage industrial networks. The proposed hybrid filter is a
   combination of a three-phase, two-level, voltage-source converter
   connected in parallel with the inductor of a shunt, single-tuned,
   passive filter. This topological structure greatly decreases the voltage
   and current stress over the elements of the active filter. Since in the
   industrial networks the voltages and currents are usually unbalanced,
   the control algorithm also has to ensure sufficient filtering of
   unbalanced harmonics. We propose using a proportional-resonant (PR),
   multi-loop controller, that allows to half the number of resonators,
   compared with the conventional solution of using proportional-integral
   (PI) control principle. Theoretical analyses and design considerations
   are presented, and experimental results obtained with a Real-Time
   Digital Simulator (RTDS) and DSP coded control algorithm are provided to
   validate viability and effectiveness of the proposed hybrid filter.}},

   of the following steps: (i) Finding normal and anomalous patterns of
   power consumption to train the proposed method, (ii) Applying wavelet
   transform to power consumption patterns to extract features, (iii)
   Applying the VFD to the extracted features from Step 3 as an input, (iv)
   Training an ANN with the extracted features from Step 3, and (v)
   Launching the trained ANN from Step 4 to detect the anomalous power
   consumption attack based on a threshold. The proposed method can detect
   an anomalous power consumption attack with 51\% accuracy in the worst
   case scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed generation (DG) is playing an increasingly important role in
   modern power systems as the carbon emission concern and electricity
   demand are increasing. It facilitates the development of small scaled
   distributed grid networks and their technologies. Microgrid is an
   emerging technique and it comprises a variety of distributed generators,
   energy storage, loads and power electronic interfaces. Most of DGs do
   not provide a constant amount of power generation, thus, a proper
   control technique is necessity to keep a microgrid stable and reliable.
   This paper gives a review of literature with regard to the
   state-of-the-art microgrid architectures and control methods.
   Comparisons are made between different microgrid structures and control
   techniques. Pros and Cons are given as reference for further Microgird

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study a problem where multiple operators (OPs) need to
   share a common pool of spectrum with each other. Our objective is to
   maximize the social welfare, defined as the overall weighted sum rate of
   the OPs. The problem is decomposed into two parts: the first part is to
   allocate RBs to OPs, which we do so by extending the framework of
   many-to-one matching game with externalities. The second part is to
   allocate power of small cell base stations (SBSs) belonging to each OP,
   which is accomplished using reinforcement learning. Assuming that the
   SBSs associated with each OPs are spatially distributed according to
   Poisson point process (PPP), we show that pairwise stable matchings
   achieve local maximas of the social welfare function. We propose two
   algorithms to search for the stable matchings. Simulation results show
   that these algorithms are well behaved in terms of convergence and
   efficiency of the solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed resource allocation is considered as a significant feature
   of future self-organizing wireless networks. On the other hand,
   full-duplex transmission is an emerging technology which can
   theoretically double the data rate. and hence enhance the performance of
   wireless networks significantly. In this work, we address the problem of
   distributed power control in a two-tier network with full-duplex small
   cells underlaying one macro cell in a co-channel deployment scenario. We
   first formulate the corresponding distributed power control problem as a
   non-cooperative game and then extend it to a repeated game with
   imperfect public monitoring. The repeated game setting is used as it can
   withstand cheating. We show the existence and uniqueness of the Nash
   equilibrium of the formulated noncooperative game and characterize the
   set of perfect public equilibrium for the repeated game. A two phase
   distributed algorithm is then proposed to achieve a power profile which
   is also a perfect public equilibrium. The power control algorithm is
   cheat-proof and needs only a small amount of information exchange among
   network nodes. The effectiveness of the algorithm is shown using
   numerical results. Our proposed algorithm and analysis are also valid
   for a half-duplex system as it is a special case of the full-duplex
   model presented in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Oil spills may be detected in ice-covered waters through the observed
   changes in its normalized radar cross section ( NRCS) data. In this
   paper, the NRCS sensitivity to the presence of an oil layer beneath the
   young sea ice is investigated for various sea ice versus oil layer
   thicknesses. To this end, time-series measurements on artificially-grown
   sea ice performed at Sea-ice Environmental Research Facility (SERF) at
   University of Manitoba are used to model the dielectric profile of a
   young sea ice. Next, three scenarios are introduced that consider the
   absence, or presence of the oil layer. To achieve our goal, the NRCS
   values associated with each case are simulated utilizing the boundary
   perturbation theory. Subsequently, the discrepancies between different
   scenarios are calculated. The simulated discrepancies indicate the
   possibility of a successful oil detection through inversion algorithms
   that utilize NRCS data.}},

   ad-hoc classifier with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a family of
   ensemble learners on classification of patients with Meniere's disease
   (MD) based on Electrovestibulography (EVestG) signals. The ad-hoc
   classifier was developed based on the average vote of classifiers each
   built for a single feature using Linear Discriminant analysis (LDA). The
   training and test datasets included EVestG signals recorded from 14 MD
   patients and 16 age-matched healthy controls for training and 9 MD
   patients and 10 age-matched controls for test dataset. The feature space
   was built based on the EVestG characteristic signals produced in
   response to side tilt stimulation. The most discriminative features of
   the training set were selected using the minimum-redundancy-maximum
   relevancy (mRMR) algorithm following one-way analysis of variance
   (ANOVA). SVM and three ensemble methods, including Bagging, Adaptive
   Boosting (AdaBoost) and Random Subspace methods were used for comparing
   the classification performance with that of our ad-hoc voting

Abstract = {{This paper presents a model for a Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC)
   using extended-frequency dynamic phasors. The model is based upon a
   series of harmonic-frequency representations that are obtained for the
   fundamental and dominant harmonic components. Depending on the
   requirements of the study to be conducted and the desired level of model
   accuracy, a low-order model (i.e., average-value) or an arbitrarily
   wide-band model may be constructed. The paper describes the principles
   of modeling using extended-frequency dynamic phasors, and applies them
   to an MMC connected to a power system represented using a Thevenin
   equivalent. The model contains details of the MMC's control system
   including its high-level control circuitry, as well as voltage balancing
   and synchronization components. The developed model is then validated by
   comparing it against a fully-detailed electromagnetic transient (EMT)
   simulation model developed in PSCAD/EMTDC simulator. Comparisons are
   made to establish the accuracy of the model (both its low-order and
   wide-band variants) and to assess the computational advantages it offers
   compared to conventional EMT models. (C) 2016 Sharif University of

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an approach for identifying resonances between a
   STATCOM and the connected ac network, using frequency scan information
   from a time domain model of the STATCOM. A D-Q based scanning scheme is
   presented, which avoids complementary frequency interference seen in a
   sequence-component based scheme. An analytical model of the STATCOM with
   rudimentary controls is used to validate the approach. Results show that
   the decoupled (Type I) controller structure results in the STATCOM
   exhibiting a low admittance to the network; hence it is expected to have
   a smaller effect on the network modes than a fixed modulation index
   (Type II) controller. The frequency response matrices of the network and
   the STATCOM can be combined to yield the frequency response admittance
   matrix of the full system. From this it is possible to anticipate
   unstable STATCOM-network interactions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method, based on the Smirnov transform, for
   generating synthetic data with the statistical properties of Levy-walks.
   This method for synthetic data generation can be utilized for generating
   arbitrary prescribed probability density functions (pdf). The Smirnov
   transform is used to solve a cybersecurity engineering problem
   associated with Internet traffic. The synthetic Levy-walk process is
   intertwined with sections of other distinct characteristics (uniform
   noise, Gaussian noise, and an ordinary sinusoid) to create a composite
   signal, which is then analyzed with zerocrossing rate (ZCR) within a
   varying-size window. This paper shows that it is possible to identify
   the distinct sections present in the composite signal through ZCR. The
   differentiation of these sections shows an increasing ZCR value as the
   section under analysis exhibits a higher activity or complexity (from
   the sinusoid, to a synthetic Levy-walk process, and uniform and Gaussian
   noise, respectively). The advantages of the ZCR computation directly in
   the time-domain are appealing for real-time implementations. The varying
   window in the ZCR produces more defined values as the window size
   increases.}},

Abstract = {{A novel surface integral equation (IE) formulation for
   magneto-quasi-static analysis of current flow in two-dimensional
   conductors situated in lossy layered substrates is proposed. Traditional
   approach is based on the volume IE formulated with respect to the
   unknown current distribution in the conductors cross-section. In this
   work, we transform the volume IE to a surface IE via representation of
   the volumetric current density as a superposition of the waves emanating
   from the conductors boundaries. The resulting surface IE features a
   single unknown surface current density unlike the traditional surface
   IEs which require both electric and magnetic surface current densities.
   Also, the resultant single-source surface IE formulation involves only
   the electric field Greens functions instead of both electric and
   magnetic field Greens functions as required by the traditional surface
   IE formulations. The latter property makes the proposed IE formulation
   particularly suitable for analysis of current flow in conductors
   embedded in lossy layered substrates.}},

Abstract = {{A wavelet-based tolerance Nearness Measure (tNM) makes possible to
   measure fine-grained changes in shapes in pairs of images. The image
   correspondence utilizes image matching tactics to establish closeness

   vision. The problem considered that how can we measure the nearness or
   apartness of digital images. In case when it is important to detect
   conversion in the contour, position, and approximal orientation of
   bounded regions. However, the solution of this problem is that results
   from an application of anisotropic (direction dependent) a tolerance and
   wavelets near set approach to detecting affinities in pairs of images.
   It has been shown that tolerance near sets can be used in a
   concept-based approach to discovering correspondences between images. In
   this paper we are showing detail survey on near set approach. By near
   set approach an effective means of images is nothing but grouping
   together that correspond to each other relative to diminutive
   similarities in the features of bounded regions in the images.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of control system design for longitudinal axis of a
   small-size flying wing is studied. The new controller proposed is
   comprised of two controllers working together to provide robust
   stability and step reference tracking for the nonlinear dynamics of
   SmartFly UAV. More precisely, Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is used
   together with Proportional, Integral, Derivative (PID) controller. The
   inspiration comes from the fact that each of the mentioned controllers
   have advantages and disadvantages that cannot be neglected. LQR, as an
   optimal in terms of energy-like regulator, provides robust stability
   with a minimized energy-like performance index. It is also very
   computationally efficient. But, when it comes to the transient of
   particular output, LQR is not the best solution. On the other hand, PID
   has the advantage of a possibility to tune the gains for optimized
   transient behavior, especially for well-behaving plants. Furthermore,
   PID controller is particularly useful for tracking problems. However,
   PID is often not robust (in terms of parameter uncertainties) and it is
   also difficult to tune PID parameters for unstable systems. By
   differentiating between system stability and performance in the
   controller design process, it is possible to benefit from both
   controllers, using them along side together in one system. Functionality
   of this method was verified through computer simulation in
   MATLAB/SIMULINK for a nonlinear model of SmartFly UAV. Closed-loop
   system performance was evaluated in terms of robustness and step
   reference tracking.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the development of a graphical user interface
   for a commercially available humanoid robot to study its interaction
   with children. The interface has been designed to facilitate the overall
   operation of the robot, and ultimately improve the interaction with
   children. Four pilot cases are studied to investigate overall
   effectiveness of the developed robotic setup in interacting and
   educating children. Case studies included communication with children in
   university environment, a day nursery, a junior high school, and at the
   Winnipeg Children's Hospital. Children and their parents/staffs were
   asked to provide feedback on how they/their children felt about
   interacting with the robot. Responses were then translated into
   quantitative measures. The measures received by each group of children
   and parents/staffs were compared using the ANOVA test. Results failed to
   reject the null hypothesis of equality in means of all measures.
   Therefore, the feedback, provided by both groups using questionnaires,
   was considered very close to each other. In other words, results
   indicated that children and parents/staffs expressed great interest in
   use of the developed system, and believed that such a robot could be a
   helpful tool in child therapy like autism.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are a new breed of internet based
   smart threats, which can go undetected with the existing
   state-of-the-art internet traffic monitoring and protection systems.
   With the evolution of internet and cloud computing, a new generation of
   smart APT attacks has also evolved and signature based threat detection
   systems are proving to be futile and insufficient. One of the essential
   strategies in detecting APTs is to continuously monitor and analyze
   various features of a TCP/IP connection, such as the number of
   transferred packets, the total count of the bytes exchanged, the
   duration of the TCP/IP connections, and details of the number of packet
   flows. The current threat detection approaches make extensive use of
   machine learning algorithms that utilize statistical and behavioral
   knowledge of the traffic. However, the performance of these algorithms
   is far from satisfactory in terms of reducing false negatives and false
   positives simultaneously. Mostly, current algorithms focus on reducing
   false positives, only. This paper presents a fractal based anomaly
   classification mechanism, with the goal of reducing both false positives
   and false negatives, simultaneously. A comparison of the proposed
   fractal based method with a traditional Euclidean based machine learning
   algorithm (k-NN) shows that the proposed method significantly
   outperforms the traditional approach by reducing false positive and
   false negative rates, simultaneously, while improving the overall
   classification rates.}},

Abstract = {{The discontinuous Galerkin method (DGM) is a flexible high-order forward
   solver for time-harmonic scattering problems in electromagnetics that
   results in a typically sparse system of linear equations. However, when
   exact radiating boundary conditions (ERBCs) are used to truncate the
   computational domain, a dense block is introduced into the DGM system
   that relates elements on a Huygens surface to elements on the boundary
   of the computational domain. In the context of iterative solution
   methods, this dense block can dominate the cost of evaluating
   matrix-vector-products and should be accelerated. Herein, we investigate
   the application of Hierarchical Matrices (H-matrices) to compress and
   accelerate the evaluation of the dense ERBC sub-matrix. Results are
   limited to high-order 2D transverse magnetic problems but demonstrate
   that effective compression resulting in substantial memory and time
   savings can be achieved even for relatively small problem sizes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a stacked multiple coil design for simultaneous
   multi-parameter narrow-band sensing with RLC-type near-field coupled
   resonators. The resonant frequency and Q-factor of each RLC sensor is
   dependent on change of stored energy and loss in response to the
   parameter of interest. One challenge with these types of sensors is
   mutual coupling between coils and thus interdependence of parameters. In
   order to null mutual coupling between coils and reduce sensing area the
   coils are stacked in a designed overlapping configuration. The
   configuration enables the response of each sensor and thus sensed
   parameters to be independent. The swept frequency impedance response of
   an interrogator coil, inductively coupled to the sensors, remotely
   tracks the parameters of each sensor. EM simulation and experiments with
   a two-parameter (relative humidity and temperature) sensor shows the
   stacked overlapping structure accomplishes narrow-band multi-parameter
   sensing without substantial increase in size. The approach has
   application in flexible thin-film substrate printed sensors.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents results from a study that investigates the impact
   of errors in patient-specific prior information on image quality in the
   context of near-field microwave (MW) breast imaging. Perturbations in
   dielectric property information and the corresponding changes in
   reconstruction quality are reported. Patient specific structural
   information is acquired using radar-based MW methods that form regional
   maps of the breast. Regional maps with differences in electrical
   properties are incorporated into an MW tomography (MWT). The study is
   primarily carried out using numerical 2D breast models constructed from
   MRI scans, however reconstructions formed with a 3D numerical breast
   model support the conclusions for 3D scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Naturally occurring high permeability materials are widely used in
   antenna miniaturization at VHF-UHF frequency range. However, they are
   unable to be used at frequencies beyond 500 MHz due to their high loss.
   The main idea of this paper is to reproduce the magnetic behavior using
   metallic inclusions for low-loss microwave applications. In this paper,
   an artificial magneto-dielectric resonator antenna (AMDRA), operating at
   3.857 GHz, based on split ring resonator (SRR) is presented. The
   simulation results are compared to those of the conventional dielectric
   resonator antenna (DRA) with high permittivity. It is shown that the
   size of the proposed antenna is 1.8 times smaller than that of the
   conventional DRA, with an efficiency of 88\% and a gain of 5.8 dBi. This
   demonstrates that the artificially induced permeability can be
   effectively used in dielectric antenna miniaturization.}},

Abstract = {{New single-source integral equation (SSIE) of computational
   electromagnetics has been recently proposed. Unlike the previously known
   SSIEs which are derived from traditional surface integral equations (IE)
   through elimination of either electric or magnetic equivalent current,
   the new SSIE is obtained from the volume IE stated for homogeneous
   objects. Thus far, the novel electric field SSIE has been demonstrated
   to be applicable to the problems of magneto-quasi-statics with both
   homogeneous and layered medium background. It has been also successfully
   applied to both the scalar and vector problems of full-wave scattering
   on homogeneous penetrable 2D scatterers. This paper overviews the novel
   SSIE and problems to which it has been successfully applied to.}},

Abstract = {{We present a facile approach that achieves four-point electrical
   characterization of silicon microwires fabricated using a bottom-up
   vapour-liquid-solid process. Tungsten probes are brought into direct
   contact with silicon microwires using piezoelectrically driven probe
   actuators. This technique can be applied to silicon microwires without
   the need for high-temperature lithographic preparation or the additional
   use of In/Ga to ensure reliable electrical contact between the probe and
   the wire. Comparison between two-point probe and four-point probe
   measurements demonstrates the robustness of the four-point approach.
   Significantly, the four-point characterization technique is not impacted
   by native oxides at the microwire/tungsten probe interface. The
   four-point technique can be applied to sense electrical responses in
   half-cell and full-cell representations of artificial photosynthesis
   systems, regardless of catalysts or functional groups attached to the
   microwire sidewalls.}},

Title = {{Polycaprolactone nanofibrous mesh reduces foreign body reaction and
   induces adipose flap expansion in tissue engineering chamber}},
Journal = {{International Journal of Nanomedicine}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{6471-6483}},
Abstract = {{Tissue engineering chamber technique can be used to generate engineered
   adipose tissue, showing the potential for the reconstruction of soft
   tissue defects. However, the consequent foreign body reaction induced by
   the exogenous chamber implantation causes thick capsule formation on the
   surface of the adipose flap following capsule contracture, which may
   limit the internal tissue expansion. The nanotopographical property and
   architecture of nanofibrous scaffold may serve as a promising method for
   minimizing the foreign body reaction. Accordingly, electrospinning
   porous polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibrous mesh, a biocompatible
   synthetic polymer, was attached to the internal surface of the chamber
   for the reducing local foreign body reaction. Adipose flap volume, level
   of inflammation, collagen quantification, capsule thickness, and adipose
   tissue-specific gene expression in chamber after implantation were
   evaluated at different time points. The in vivo study revealed that the
   engineered adipose flaps in the PCL group had a structure similar to
   that in the controls and normal adipose tissue structure but with a
   larger flap volume. Interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and transforming
   growth factor-beta expression decreased significantly in the PCL group
   compared with the control. Moreover, the control group had much more
   collagen deposition and thicker capsule than that observed in the PCL
   group. These results indicate that the unique nanotopographical effect
   of electrospinning PCL nanofiber can reduce foreign body reaction in a
   tissue engineering chamber, which maybe a promising new method for
   generating a larger volume of mature, vascularized, and stable adipose
   tissue.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient single-phase grid-connected voltage source inverter (VSI)
   topology by using the proposed Active Virtual Ground (AVG) technique is
   presented. With AVG, the conventional output L filter can be
   reconfigured to LCL structure without adding additional inductor. High
   frequency differential mode (DM) current ripple can be significantly
   suppressed comparing to the prior single-phase grid-connected inverter
   topologies. Additionally, strong attenuation to the high frequency
   common mode (CM) voltage is achieved. It is particularly important for
   some applications such as photovoltaic (PV). High efficiency can be
   achieved due to fewer component involved in the conduction loss. Cost of
   the inverter can be minimized since the required inductance of the
   filter is small Performance of the proposed inverter has been evaluated
   analytically. Experimental verification is performing on a 50W, 100V
   input, and 60Vrms output prototype.}},

Title = {{LIQUID JET TRAJECTORY IN A SUBSONIC GASEOUS CROSS-FLOW: AN ANALYSIS OF
   PUBLISHED CORRELATIONS}},
Journal = {{ATOMIZATION AND SPRAYS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1083-1110}},
Abstract = {{Liquid jet penetration/trajectory in a gaseous subsonic cross-flow has
   been studied extensively. Numerous correlations were proposed to predict
   the penetration of a liquid jet in a gaseous cross-flow. However, there
   are considerable inconsistencies between these correlations that
   negatively affect the reliability of this wealth of data. Therefore the
   objective of the present study was to address this issue. To do so,
   published correlations were grouped/categorized based on jet liquid type
   and ambient conditions of cross-flow. This resulted in four groups: (1)
   water jet in a cross-flow at room conditions, (2) liquid (excluding
   water) jet in a cross-flow at room conditions; (3) liquid (including
   water) jet in a cross-flow at room temperature and elevated pressure
   (i.e., P = 1-20 bar), and (4) liquid (including water) jet in a
   cross-flow at elevated pressure and temperature conditions (i.e., P =
   1-20 bar and T = 280-650 K). A thorough analysis of published
   correlations in each group was carried out based on the most influencing
   factors/parameters. For instance, gas (cross-flow) Weber number has a
   significant effect on a liquid jet trajectory at low We, whereas it has
   a negligible effect at high We. A liquid jet with high viscosity and
   surface tension exhibited a trajectory closer to the wall. An increase
   in cross-flow temperature and pressure yielded a decrease in jet
   penetration height at a fixed momentum flux ratio and Weber number. On
   the basis of these analyses, a universal correlation form was developed
   to predict the penetration (or trajectory) of a liquid jet in a subsonic
   cross-flow. Finally, it should be noted that only jets issuing from
   injectors/nozzles with rounded exit circular orifices were considered in
   this study.}},

Abstract = {{Smooth operation of heavy-duty forestry cranes is not an easy task for
   the operators with the current joystick-based control method that is
   complex and non-intuitive. Moreover, abrupt movements of the same
   joysticks provoke aggressive signals that can lead to oscillatory
   motions in the actuators and in the entire crane. These oscillations,
   not only contribute to wear of the joint actuators but also can cause
   damage to both the operators and the environment; therefore, they must
   be attenuated. The proposed approach in this paper uses the popular
   input shaping control technique combined with a practical switching
   logic to deal with different frequency payload oscillations induced by
   the motion of the inner boom actuator of a forwarder crane. The results
   show a significant improvement in terms of visible oscillation reduction
   monitored through their appearance in the torque signal computed from
   pressure measurements. Experiments performed on a down-sized forestry
   crane verifies the effectiveness of the approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we give the semiparametric statistics perspective on the
   problem of identification of a class of nonlinear dynamic systems. We
   present a framework for identification of the so-called block-oriented
   systems that can be represented by finite-dimensional parameters and an
   infinite-dimensional set of nonlinear characteristics that run typically
   through a nonparametric class of univariate functions. We consider
   systems which are expressible exactly in this form and the case when
   they are approximative models. In the latter case, we derive
   projections, that is, solutions which minimize the mean L-2 error. The
   chief benefit of such an approach is to make classical nonparametric
   estimates amenable to the incorporation of constraints and able to
   overcome the celebrated curse of dimensionality and system complexity.
   The developed methodology is explained by examining semiparametric
   versions of popular block-oriented structures, i.e., Hammerstein,
   Wiener, and parallel systems.}},

   addition, the effect of the nozzle slot discharge angle was
   investigated. A low-swirl strength (25 degrees-angle vanes) was used in
   the co-airflow, and the biogas fuel composition was kept constant (60\%
   CH4 and 40\% CO2 by volume). The results revealed that the swirl is
   essential for stabilizing a turbulent non-premixed biogas lifted flame.
   More importantly, fuel nozzle was found to influence drastically both

Title = {{Dynamic User Clustering and Power Allocation for Uplink and Downlink
   Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) Systems}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{6325-6343}},
Abstract = {{Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has recently been considered as a
   key enabling technique for 5G cellular systems. In NOMA, by exploiting
   the channel gain differences, multiple users are multiplexed into
   transmission power domain and then non-orthogonally scheduled for
   transmission on the same spectrum resources. Successive interference
   cancellation (SIC) is then applied at the receivers to decode the
   message signals. In this paper, first, we briefly describe the
   differences in the working principles of uplink and downlink NOMA
   transmissions in a cellular wireless system. Then, for both uplink and
   downlink NOMAs, we formulate a sum-throughput maximization problem in a
   cell such that the user clustering (i.e., grouping users into a single
   cluster or multiple clusters) and power allocations in NOMA clusters can
   be optimized under transmission power constraints, minimum rate
   requirements of the users, and SIC constraints. Due to the combinatorial
   nature of the formulated mixed integer non-linear programming problem,
   we solve the problem in two steps, i.e., by first grouping users into
   clusters and then optimizing their respective power allocations. In
   particular, we propose a low-complexity sub-optimal user grouping
   scheme. The proposed scheme exploits the channel gain differences among
   users in an NOMA cluster and groups them into a single cluster or
   multiple clusters in order to enhance the sum-throughput of the system.
   For a given set of NOMA clusters, we then derive the optimal power
   allocation policy that maximizes the sum-throughput per NOMA cluster and
   in turn maximizes the overall system throughput. Using Karush
   Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions, closed-form solutions for optimal
   power allocations are derived for any cluster size, considering both
   uplink and downlink NOMA systems. Numerical results compare the
   performances of NOMA and OMA and illustrate the significance of NOMA in
   various network scenarios.}},

Title = {{A SOLUTION FOR NONLINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS OF QFT CONTROLLERS DESIGNED

Abstract = {{Quantitative feedback theory (QFT) is a well-established technique to
   design robust and linear controllers. However, the important open
   problem of extending the small signal stability to nonlinear stability
   verification has remained an ongoing research in the design of QFT
   controllers. In this paper, we show that Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy
   modeling approach and its stability theory provide a new opportunity to
   study the nonlinear stability of QFT controllers in fluid power systems.
   To validate the approach, two case studies are provided first. The first
   case study establishes the reliability of the approach by confirming the
   results for a hydraulic system of which nonlinear stability has already
   been proven. The second case study establishes that using the proposed
   approach, we can further study and extend the stability region of
   previously developed hydraulic controllers to include parametric
   uncertainty. Followed by the successful validation of the effectiveness
   of our approach through these two case studies, the stability of a QFT
   position controller, for which the nonlinear stability was never proven,
   is investigated.}},

Abstract = {{In this case study, a man at the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was
   enrolled in a cognitive treatment program based upon spatial navigation
   in a virtual reality (VR) environment. We trained him to navigate to
   targets in a symmetric, landmark-less virtual building. Our research
   goals were to determine whether an individual with AD could learn to
   navigate in a simple VR navigation (VRN) environment and whether that
   training could also bring real-life cognitive benefits. The results show
   that our participant learned to perfectly navigate to desired targets in
   the VRN environment over the course of the training program.
   Furthermore, subjective feedback from his primary caregiver (his wife)
   indicated that his skill at navigating while driving improved noticeably
   and that he enjoyed cognitive improvement in his daily life at home.
   These results suggest that VRN treatments might benefit other people
   with AD.}},

Abstract = {{The low density of meteorological stations in parts of Canada
   necessitates using numerical weather prediction (NWP)/assimilation
   output for hydrological modelling. In this study, comparisons are made
   of simulated land surface variables when using field observations versus
   NWP output as forcing for two well-instrumented sites: the mountainous
   and forested Marmot Creek Basin (MCRB) in the Canadian Rocky Mountains,
   and a prairie cropland/grassland site (Kenaston). The Canadian Land
   Surface Scheme 3.6 (CLASS) was used for modelling. The Global
   Environmental Multiscale (GEM) model with Canadian Precipitation
   Analysis (CaPA) was also used as forcing. There was good agreement
   between observed meteorology and GEM/CaPA, though some deficiencies in
   GEM/CaPA were identified: the effects of sub-grid topography on incoming
   radiation and wind speed were not accounted for at MCRB, and CaPA did
   not capture some convective rainfall events at Kenaston. CLASS
   simulations using both sets of forcing showed difficulties in simulating
   snow depth, soil moisture and evapotranspiration; certain difficulties
   were linked to GEM/CaPA deficiencies and/or CLASS. Both sets of forcing
   tended to overestimate the duration of snow cover at MCRB, but during
   different years. With GEM/CaPA as forcing, CLASS overestimated the
   duration of frozen soils. The GEM/CaPA precipitation difficulties at
   Kenaston degraded soil moisture simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new design algorithm to optimize the building
   height for a set of parameters, including a fixed roof surface area with
   aspect ratio (1.0, 1.5, 2.0), orientation (ast, South, and West), and
   integrated Photovoltaics (PV) technology (Crystalline Silicon, Thin
   Film), efficiency (10\%, 15\%, 19\%), and inclination angle (90 degrees,
   70 degrees). Four different scenarios were examined in accordance with
   the contextual boundary conditions. For each case, the algorithm yielded
   the optimum number of floors as an output so that the building maintains
   its net-zero energy rating. The preliminary results indicated that
   utilizing a PV system with premium 19\% efficiency yielded the maximum
   building height as compared to a system with 15\% and 10\% efficiency by
   a factor of 2.3 and 5.7 respectively, especially for low energy
   consumption levels. The performance with a vertical inclination angle of
   70 degrees tilt was consistently superior to that from an angle of 90
   degrees (a 43\% improvement with 15\% efficiency). For an aspect ratio
   of 2.0, the South facades contribution is 2 to 2.8 times more than that
   from the East/West facades. Overall, the site shading factor induces a

Title = {{Validation of Long-Term Pavement Performance Prediction Models for
   Resilient Modulus of Unbound Granular Materials}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{29-37}},
Abstract = {{Reliable characterization of unbound granular material and subgrade
   resilient modulus requires repeated load triaxial testing, advanced
   dynamic loading equipment, and technical experience not typically
   available in many geotechnical laboratories. For Level 2 design inputs,
   the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide recommends correlation
   models to estimate the resilient modulus of unbound granular material
   and subgrade from basic material properties (e.g., gradation, unconfined
   compressive strength, and California bearing ratio). These correlation
   models are developed from data on a wide range of soil and material
   types; this wide range increases the associated error with resilient
   modulus prediction. This paper compares laboratory measured resilient
   modulus for two types of locally available unbound granular materials to
   the predicted values; models developed under the Long Term Pavement
   Performance (LTPP) program were used. Resilient modulus tests of six
   gradations of two types of material-100\% crushed limestone and
   gravel-were conducted at two levels of moisture content. Results showed
   that the LTPP models significantly underestimated resilient modulus for
   the limestone material and showed high residuals associated with
   evaluating resilient modulus of both gravel and limestone materials. The
   coefficient of variation of the root mean square error was 50.3\% for
   gravel and 55.6\% for limestone. The high residuals associated with
   evaluating resilient modulus with the LTPP models justify the
   development of local prediction models to improve the reliability of
   Level 2 design inputs for unbound granular materials.}},

Title = {{Understanding and Estimating In-Service Axle Weights of Transit Buses}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2539}},
Pages = {{178-187}},
Abstract = {{Despite evidence that certain transit buses exceed axle weight limits
   (sometimes without any passengers on board) and mostly anecdotal
   indications of the concomitant pavement impacts, relatively little
   empirical evidence substantiates these impacts. The number of transit
   buses exceeding weight limits has been exacerbated by regulatory changes
   directed at improving emissions and accessibility. These changes have
   required manufacturers to include heavy auxiliary equipment, such as
   emissions reduction components and hydraulic systems, on transit buses
   and have been introduced without commensurate increases in the weight
   limits of transit buses. Public agencies have limited knowledge about
   transit bus weights and their pavement impacts. Further, estimating
   in-service weights of transit buses is difficult. To help improve
   knowledge about issues of transit bus weights, this paper describes the
   legal and regulatory factors surrounding transit bus weight, basic
   estimates of in-service bus weights, contributing factors to transit bus
   weights, challenges for reducing bus weights, pavement impacts of
   transit buses, and challenges for estimating in-service weights of
   transit buses. The paper also develops and applies a methodology for
   estimating in-service weights of transit buses by using Winnipeg,
   Manitoba, Canada, as a case study. Application of this methodology (a)
   demonstrates the need for reliable local data when in-service weights of
   transit buses are estimated and (b) empirically corroborates regulatory
   compliance and pavement-related concerns by using data collected from
   in-service transit buses.}},

Abstract = {{The anticipated massive deployment of the small cells entail wireless
   backhauling for 5G cellular networks. However, the scarcity of radio
   frequency (RF) spectrum in the licensed bands is a major limitation
   which necessitates efficient spectrum planning for backhaul/access links
   of 5G small cells. This paper investigates the problem of channel
   assignment in the backhaul/access of small cells. We first formulate a
   problem to maximize the common achievable rate at the backhaul and
   access links of the small cells. Due to the NP-hard nature of the
   problem, we transform the original problem into a less complex convex
   programming problem and solve it numerically. We then propose and
   comparatively analyze the performance of two simple distributed backhaul
   channel allocation criteria, namely, maximum received signal power
   (max-RSP) and minimum received signal power (min-RSP) criteria. For
   these criteria, we theoretically derive the number of allocated backhaul
   channels and coverage probability for a given target rate of each small
   cell given its distance from the centralized wireless backhaul hub.
   Simulation results provide insights about the performance gap between
   the centralized and distributed schemes. Further, it is observed that
   the min-RSP criterion outperforms the max-RSP criterion which implies
   that more backhaul channels should be allocated to small cells that are
   located near the cell-edge.}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares pavement texture measurements from a
   three-dimensional (3-D) line-laser scanner and from a two-dimensional
   (2-D) spot-laser circular track (CT) meter to determine whether
   correlations exist between their texture parameters. Measurements with
   the two devices were taken simultaneously on pavements at the Minnesota
   Department of Transportation MnROAD test facilities. The 3-D texture
   heights were decomposed by using a discrete wavelet transform to
   separate microtexture from macrotexture. Macrotexture parameters from
   the two devices were analyzed. A linear relationship, with an R-2 value
   of .94, was found between the 2-D mean profile depth and the 3-D
   digitally simulated mean texture depth. Similarly, the R-2 value was .98
   between the 2-D root mean square roughness and the 3-D root mean square
   deviation. These correlations are essential and can be used by road
   agencies to predict texture indexes between 2-D and 3-D measurements for

Pages = {{90571-90578}},
Abstract = {{Clinically, patches for hernia repair have two existing concerns:
   antibacterial and tissue adhesion. The modification of medical device
   surfaces with antibacterial properties has recently shown to be an
   effective means to control bacterial-caused infection. On the other
   hand, hydrogel of gelatin and polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been
   verified for reducing tissue adhesion. Herein, we report a novel
   muscle-inspired and nano-silver coated, polyethyleneglycol (PEG)/gelatin
   hydrogel-impregnated polyurethane (NSPU) mesh. We hypothesize that an
   outside coated nano-silver is antiseptic to inflammations and infection.
   The PEG and gelatin hydrogel can remarkably reduce the postoperative
   adhesion in the abdomen; moreover, the flexible nanofibrous PU provides
   the necessary mechanical support as well. The composite mesh exhibited
   good antibacterial property in vitro. In vivo, after the implantation,
   it significantly reduced the postoperative adhesion in the abdomen
   compared to commercial polypropylene (PP) meshes. The composite also
   shows the graft accommodation in the abdominal wall tissue from
   hematoxylin-eosin (H\&E) staining and immunohistochemistry analysis of
   CD3 (lymphocyte), CCR7 (M1 phenotype macrophage) and CD163 (M2 phenotype
   macrophage). Therefore, our NSPU mesh is promising for ventral hernia

Title = {{ANAEROBIC STORAGE OF COMMERCIAL PIG MANURES TO DISSOLVE PHOSPHORUS FOR
   STRUVITE PRECIPITATION}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{285-292}},
Abstract = {{Removal of excess P from pig manure can be accomplished by the
   precipitation reaction to form struvite (MgNH4PO4 center dot 6 H2O).
   However, recovery is limited by the concentration of dissolved
   phosphorus, in form PO4-P, as it is typically only about 10\% of total
   phosphate in liquid pig manure. To increase P recovery, manure can be
   stored anaerobically to increase acidity, which has been to shown to
   produce higher concentrations of PO4-P.. However, manures from different
   farms can vary markedly in chemical properties and this technique may
   not be effective in all cases. This experiment investigated chemical
   changes from anaerobic fermentation of manures collected from several
   commercial pig operations in Manitoba. Fresh manures were placed in
   triplicate stirred anaerobic digesters and monitored daily for pH and
   analyzed for total solids, volatile solids (VS), alkalinity, volatile
   fatty acids (VFA), dissolved and total nutrients (P, Mg, and Ca) on days
   0, 4, 8, and 12. Under identical storage conditions, manures displayed
   different pH and PO4-P responses, varying from almost no response to a
   significant drop in pH with corresponding increase in dissolved PO4-P
   and Mg. Manure pH and PO4-P concentration were negatively correlated in
   all manures (-0.63 to -0.98). Through comparison with these and other
   manures, a relationship was found between manure alkalinity buffering
   and the acid forming effects of VS, expressed as mg/L of total
   alkalinity to g/L VS. Manures with low alkalinity/VS ratios became
   acidic during anaerobic fermentation and consequently increased in PO4-P
   concentration. Both VS and alkalinity are easily performed analyses and
   the ratio could be used to predict the suitability of a manure to
   release PO4-P during anaerobic storage, which increases the total
   recoverable P by struvite precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a combined method to detect islanding conditions.
   The method combines two approaches in a two stage process, and is based
   on the injection of reactive current as a disturbance to detect
   islanding. In the first stage, the method tests the voltage rate of
   change and the frequency rate of change. Once an islanding situation is
   presumed in the first stage, then in the second stage, a positive
   feedback scheme is enabled to confirm the islanding condition. This
   combined detection method is more effective and precise, avoids false
   tripping out by reducing the sensitivity to other perturbations, and
   avoids instabilities as the positive feedback is not connected all time.
   Simulations are presented to assess the performance of the proposed
   combined detection method.}},

   and dynamically accesses the different spectrum bands based on the
   wireless medium conditions and permissions. The various spectrum access
   schemes proposed in the previous work have limited such access to a
   single spectrum band at any given time. This limitation may be
   insufficient for networks with a large number of nodes that are
   exchanging high volumes of data. In this paper, we propose a
   probabilistic transmission scheduling policy that allow the sensor nodes
   to transmit their data simultaneously across a multiple number of
   spectrum bands. We further present a mathematical model to analyze the
   performance of the sensor nodes that employ the proposed scheduling
   policy. The model can also be utilized for determining the optimal

   area where many faults occur, and inspect the wafers manually with a
   microscope. The main goal of this work is to find a methodology to
   detect these cable faults in a non-destructive way so that the quality
   of the cable may be assessed, and its remaining lifetime be estimated

   were able to detect faults in this XLPE material and verified the

Abstract = {{With the recent advances in radio modules capable of carrying out full
   duplex (FD) communication, the spectrum efficiency promised by the
   concept of Cognitive radio (CR) can be stretched even further by
   incorporating full duplex transceivers in CRs. This incorporation brings
   about certain challenges in the resource allocation. In this work we try
   to address some of the challenges in joint channel and power allocation.
   We proposed a decentralized scheme which is capable of selecting which
   channels to be used as half duplex and which to be used as FD between a
   pair of CRs. Then we decomposed the problem into two sub-problems one
   dealing with channel assignment and the other dealing with power
   allocation. In the power allocation we did not assume the signal to
   interference plus noise ratio to be high like most work in the
   literature. The monotonic optimization framework was used to solve the
   power allocation problem. Then the channel assignment problem was
   approximated by a linear objective function and was solved as a linear
   integer program.}},

Abstract = {{Effector functions and cellular properties of natural killer (NK) cells
   are regulated by cellular and extracellular factors shaped by the
   microenvironments. NK cells express specific chemokine and non-chemokine
   receptors to aid preferential migrations or localizations in tissues.
   Good understanding of how NK-cell migratory properties are regulated in
   physiological and pathological microenvironments will provide further
   insights into the development of NK cell-based therapeutic approaches.
   In contrast to the commonly used conventional in vitro migration assays
   such as Trans-well assays that measure movements of a population of the
   migratory cells, microfluidic-based devices support live-cell imaging of
   cell migrations under a well-defined chemical gradient(s) at microscale.
   Subsequent analyses at single-cell level provide quantitative
   measurements of cell-migration parameters such as speed and Chemotactic
   Index, and permit distinguishing chemotaxis, chemokinesis, and
   chemo-repulsion. Our recent work established the use of a Y-shaped
   microfluidic device to study NK cell migrations in vitro. In this
   chapter, we described the detailed method of acquiring and analyzing NK
   cell migration in the microfluidic devices.}},

Abstract = {{An energy harvester in the road pavement made from a piezoelectric
   composite plate is designed and studied to collect energy from the
   passing vehicles for the ice melting aim. Piezoelectric material has the
   ability to produce electric charge on its surface when strain takes
   place due to any external loading. Based on this property, a rectangular
   composite plate harvester is developed consisting of piezoelectric
   material as the energy generation coating layer and A514 steel as the
   substrate layer to realize the energy harvesting process from the
   variable pressure generated in the road pavement by passing vehicles.
   Based on Westergaards stress model, a numerical model is developed to
   calculate the three dimensional stress distribution in the pavement.
   Numerical simulations are conducted to study the optimization of various
   parameters of the harvester, such as depth of the harvester in the
   pavement, length and width as well as thicknesses of piezoelectric layer
   and the substrate. By taking in to consideration the maximum stress that
   can be sustained by both of the piezoelectric material and also the
   substrate material, an optimum design of the piezoelectric couple
   composite plate energy harvester is suggested. It is seen that the
   maximum output power, which can be generated by a single patch of
   0.2m{*}0.2m{*}0.0026m dimension with a vehicle passing at 22.2 m/s, can
   reach up to 23.36 W. With the well-designed pavement energy harvesters,
   it is feasible to collect enough energy to rise the temperature of the
   ice with the thickness of 1cm covering a 5m width road by 20 degree
   Celsius within 2.5 hours. This technique can be applied to melt the ice
   on the roads and bridges especially in cold countries.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional offset jet flow over a surface mounted square rib
   was investigated using particle image velocimetry at Reynolds number of
   7600. The square rib was mounted at three different locations downstream
   of the nozzle exit. Contour and profile plots in the symmetry plane were
   used to investigate the effect of the rib on the mean flow distribution
   and turbulence statistics. Changing the rib location enhanced the mixing
   and entrainment characteristics of the jet thereby leading to larger
   wall-normal spread rates. The quadrant analysis revealed a significant
   contribution of all events towards the Reynolds shear stress. The joint
   probability density function analysis showed that the structures within
   the outer shear layer of the jet differed from those of boundary layers.
   Results from the two-point correlation analysis indicated that the
   introduction of a surface mounted rib modified the flow structures
   within the developing region. However, there was no significant
   structural difference between the flow with mounted rib and the no rib
   case within the self-similar region. The proper orthogonal decomposition
   was used to examine how changes in rib location modified the dynamics of
   the energetic modes towards the turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds
   shear stress within the developing and self-similar regions.}},

Abstract = {{A cantilever beam with a breathing crack is studied to detect and
   evaluate the crack using entropy measures. Closed cracks in engineering
   structures lead to proportional complexities to their vibration
   responses due to weak bi-linearity imposed by the crack breathing
   phenomenon. Entropy is a measure of system complexity and has the
   potential in quantifying the complexity. The weak bi-linearity in
   vibration signals can be amplified using wavelet transformation to
   increase the sensitivity of the measurements. A mathematical model of
   harmonically excited unit length steel cantilever beam with a breathing
   crack located near the fixed end is established, and an iterative
   numerical method is applied to generate accurate time domain dynamic
   responses. The bi-linearity in time domain signals due to the crack
   breathing are amplified by wavelet transformation first, and then the
   complexities due to bi-linearity is quantified using sample entropy to
   detect the possible crack and estimate the crack depth. It is observed
   that the method is capable of identifying crack depths even at very
   early stages of 3\% with the increase in the entropy values more than
   10\% compared with the healthy beam. The current study extends the
   entropy based damage detection of rotary machines to structural analysis
   and takes a step further in high-sensitivity structural health
   monitoring by combining wavelet transformation with entropy
   calculations. The proposed technique can also be applied to other types
   of structures, such as plates and shells.}},

Abstract = {{Low-trauma hip fracture, usually caused by fall from standing height,
   has become a main source of morbidity and mortality for the elderly.
   Factors affecting hip fracture include sex, race, age, body weight,
   height, body mass distribution, etc., and thus, hip fracture risk in
   fall differs widely from subject to subject. It is therefore necessary
   to develop a subject-specific biomechanical model to predict hip
   fracture risk. The objective of this study is to develop a two-level,
   image-based, subject specific biomechanical model consisting of a
   whole-body dynamics model and a proximal-femur finite element (FE) model
   for more accurately assessing the risk of hip fracture in lateral falls.
   Required information for constructing the model is extracted from a
   whole-body and a hip DXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) image of the
   subject. The proposed model considers all parameters
   subject-specifically, which will provide a fast, accurate, and
   non-expensive method for predicting hip fracture risk.}},

Abstract = {{Low-trauma hip fracture, usually caused by fall from standing height,
   has become a main source of morbidity and mortality among the elderly.
   However, the hip fracture risk is subject-dependent as it is related to
   the subject's anthropometric parameters, the kinematic/kinetic variables
   in fall, and the hip anatomy. A compound fracture risk indicator is
   proposed in this study to define the correlation between the hip
   fracture risk and subject's parameters such as anthropometric
   parameters, bone mineral density (BMD), height of body mass center
   (HMC), and hip soft tissue thickness (STT). In this study, a two-level,
   subject-specific biomechanical model composed of a whole-body dynamics
   model and a proximal femur finite element model was used to predict the
   hip fracture risk for 80 subjects. The required information was obtained
   from the subject's whole body and hip DXA (dual energy X-ray
   absorptiometry) images. Then, multivariate nonlinear least square fits
   of power functions were used to investigate the effect of parameters on
   hip fracture risk. Results indicated that although BMD is the dominant
   parameter affecting the hip fracture risk, other parameters such as hip
   soft tissue thickness and anthropometric parameters also have
   considerable effects. This finding suggests that the hip fracture risk
   cannot be accurately predicted by the currently available single factor
   predictors as they do not consider all multifactorial parameters.
   However, the proposed function can properly predict the risk of hip
   fracture in the absence of any computational simulation and
   biomechanical model. It also quantifies the effect of musculoskeletal-,
   and organ-level parameters on hip fracture risk and demonstrates which
   individual is more likely to experience hip fracture.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major concerns for adaptable products is to ensure the
   products to meet customer preferences. As customers may update their
   preferences over the product lifetime, designers need methods to measure
   those preferences. Lack of knowledge (uncertainty) in customer
   preferences could endanger the product success. If designers can update
   their views for customer requirements, a product can be designed to
   follow the user requirements. Huge data are generated continuously in
   product user behavior, product usage, manufacturing cost etc., now
   called as Big Data. Collecting, managing and applying such huge set of
   data in an innovative method can reduce uncertainties. In this paper, a
   method is discussed to minimize uncertainty effects on products to
   improve the product adaptability Uncertainty is considered as changes of
   the customer preference. The proposed method uses Big Data (BD) in the
   analysis of uncertainty. The effect of quantified uncertainties on
   product adaptability is investigated. The method is concluded with the
   most affected parts and functional requirements to be updated to meet
   changing requirements. The proposed method is compared to a developed
   agent-based modeling (ABM) method in a case study. Although there are
   some differences between both methods in the uncertainty effect
   evaluation, The BD method provides more confidence for the design
   solution. The paper also proposes some future research directions for
   design of adaptable products using Big Data.}},

Abstract = {{The stochastic nature of energy demand and renewable energy (RE)
   resources make the design of hybrid renewable energy systems as a
   complex problem. In this paper, an innovative stochastic optimization
   approach is proposed for optimal sizing of hybrid renewable energy
   systems (HRES) incorporating existing uncertainties in RE resources and
   energy load. The design problem is formulated based on multi-objective
   optimization framework with three objective functions including minimize
   total net present cost (NPC), maximize renewable energy ratio (RER), and
   minimize fuel emission. The reliability index named loss of load
   probability (LLP) is considered as a constraint with a desirable level.
   The Pareto front (PF) of developed multi-objective optimization problem
   is approximated with the help of the integration of dynamic
   multi-objective particle swarm optimization (DMOPSO) algorithm,
   simulation module, and sampling average method. Synthetic data
   generation approaches are applied to tackle the randomness in wind
   speed, solar irradiation, ambient temperature, and energy load. A
   building located in Canada is used as the case study to assess the
   performance of the developed model. Finally, the obtained PF by the
   stochastic optimization approach is examined against the deterministic
   PF using the most famous performance metrics.}},

Abstract = {{The optimization of facility location decisions is critical for the
   success of a supply chain in a market since it can contribute to
   long-term performance of the supply chain. In the last two decades, the
   number of research in this field has been growing to address more
   realistic problems such as incorporating uncertainties in repair time
   and demand. In this paper, a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO)
   is employed to locate repair shops in a stochastic environment. The
   problem aim is to decide about the location and the capacity of local
   repair shops as well as identifying the capacity of central repair shop
   to minimize total expected cost. It is assumed that customers select the
   closest local repair shop. In the local repair shops, services are
   available to repair customer's broken items and a number of spare parts
   are stored to supply customers' needs. Additionally, each repair shop is
   allowed to open some servers, depending on the number of customers, to
   serve its customers. If a stock-out happens, a customer should wait
   until the part is repaired in that shop. When a local repair shop is
   unable to repair a part, the part is sent to the central repair shop to
   be repaired. The central repair shop follows similar strategy for spare
   part inventory. The contribution of this paper is to employ a
   meta-heuristic solution approach based on particle swarm optimization
   for locating repair shops problem. In order to evaluate the performance
   of the employed solutions approach, its result is compared to other
   methods and differences are highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{A 3D object can be recovered from scanned point data, which requires
   accurate estimating normal directions of the object surface from the
   cloud data. Many point cloud processing algorithms rely on the accurate
   normal as input to generate an accurate 3D surface model. The
   neighborhood of a data point in its smooth region can be well
   approximated by a plane. However, the neighborhood of a feature point
   employed for the normal estimation is isotropic which would enclose
   points belonging to different surface patches across the sharp feature.
   In this paper, isotropic neighborhoods are segmented to search
   anisotropic neighborhoods for the accurate normal estimation. Normals
   and candidate feature points are first estimated by the principal
   component analysis (PCA) method. Neighborhoods of the feature point are
   then mapped into a Gaussian image. A k-means clustering algorithm is
   then used for the Gaussian image to identify an anisotropic
   sub-neighborhood for the data point. The normal of the candidate feature
   point is finally estimated by the anisotropic neighborhood with the PCA
   method. The proposed method can accurately estimate normal directions
   while preserving sharp features of the object surface. Applications have
   demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{With larger data sets and more sophisticated analyses, it is becoming
   increasingly common for neuroimaging researchers to push (or exceed) the
   limitations of standalone computer workstations. Nonetheless, although
   high-performance computing platforms such as clusters, grids and clouds
   are already in routine use by a small handful of neuroimaging
   researchers to increase their storage and/or computational power, the
   adoption of such resources by the broader neuroimaging community remains
   relatively uncommon. Therefore, the goal of the current manuscript is
   to: 1) inform prospective users about the similarities and differences
   between computing clusters, grids and clouds; 2) highlight their main
   advantages; 3) discuss when it may (and may not) be advisable to use
   them; 4) review some of their potential problems and barriers to access;
   and finally 5) give a few practical suggestions for how interested new
   users can start analyzing their neuroimaging data using cloud resources.
   Although the aim of cloud computing is to hide most of the complexity of
   the infrastructure management from end-users, we recognize that this can
   still be an intimidating area for cognitive neuroscientists,
   psychologists, neurologists, radiologists, and other neuroimaging
   researchers lacking a strong computational background. Therefore, with
   this in mind, we have aimed to provide a basic introduction to cloud
   computing in general (including some of the basic terminology, computer
   architectures, infrastructure and service models, etc.), a practical
   overview of the benefits and drawbacks, and a specific focus on how
   cloud resources can be used for various neuroimaging applications.}},

   experimental results allow a complete LuGre model, which facilitates,
   but not limited to, other advanced friction modeling and high
   performance controller design if needed. In addition, several well-known
   dynamic friction features (varying break-away force, friction lag and
   presliding) are successfully demonstrated by our rig, which indicates
   the adequacy of our approach for capturing highly sophisticated and
   dynamic friction behavior over a wide range of operating conditions. The

Abstract = {{Studies on renewable energy harvesting have experienced significant
   growth due to the increasing demand of portable electronic devices and
   wireless sensor networks. We introduce the first time a beam energy
   harvester coupled with piezoelectric layers and stack actuators
   subjected to harmonic base excitation for achieving efficiency energy
   harvesting with a new developed self-frequency-tuning process. The
   self-frequency-tuning process of the harvester is realized by an
   adjustable axial force, which is generated by a piezoelectric stack
   actuator, through a feedback filtering electrical circuit. By the
   feedback filtering circuit, the value of axial force is determined by
   the amplitude of the output voltage generated on piezoelectric layers to
   tune the first natural frequency of the beam harvester close to the
   excitation frequency leading to a resonance of the harvester system. To
   describe and simulate the energy harvesting and the self-tuning process,
   a mathematical model is presented to calculate the dynamic response of
   the harvester as well as the output electric charge and voltage from
   piezoelectric layers for adjusting the axial force. It is noted that an
   iteration process is indispensable for the tuning process because of the
   transient nature of the vibrating system. A novel iteration numerical
   model is hence developed, and the whole energy harvesting process is
   divided into many short periods to represent the iteration steps and the
   self-tuning process. From numerical simulations, it shows that the
   self-tuning process helps increase the efficiency of the harvester,
   especially when the harvester is tuned close to its resonant state.}},

Abstract = {{This work performs stability analysis on a control system partially
   modeled by LuGre friction model. Such a friction model has been proved
   sufficient to account for many features of friction. However; two
   parameters in the friction model, ob and 01 are extremely difficult to
   be identified in real-world applications and the parameter errors
   (disturbances) coming from the measurements are therefore expected. In
   this work, we present a systematic methodology to rigorously analyze the
   effect of the disturbances mentioned above on the control system
   stability. The obtained analysis result clearly shows the robustness of
   the selected control law (input-output linearization control law).
   Lyapunov exponents calculated for two disturbed systems and our
   stability analysis result are in good agreement. The proposed
   methodology can be applied to other control laws of interest to examine
   their robustness.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops an advanced technique to significantly increase the
   frequency based damage detection sensitivity on a beam structure through
   a mode shape tuning process with the optimal design of the piezoelectric
   actuators. Piezoelectric sensors and actuators are mounted on the
   surface of the host beams to generate the feedback voltage and the
   active controlled excitations respectively. The excitations induced by
   the piezoelectric effect will be utilized to change the curvature
   distribution of the vibration mode shapes of the host beam structure so
   as to magnify the natural frequency difference between the intact beam
   and the damaged one to realize the high sensitivity damage detection. In
   this paper, theoretical models of the cantilever beams with and without
   mode shape tuning induced by piezoelectric layers are built first, while
   the damage is represented by a fixed end crack. Then, through the
   numerical simulations, the vibration mode shapes and corresponding
   natural frequencies of the beams can be solved to study the sensitivity
   improvement by using the proposed technique. In order to improve the
   detection efficiency, a couple of piezoelectric actuators are installed
   symmetrically on the upper and lower surface of the host beam,
   generating shifty bending moments to tune the vibration mode shapes. The
   actuation voltages applied on the actuators are determined by applying
   certain gain to the voltage from the piezoelectric sensors. Different
   gain factors are applied to the mode shape tuning process to reveal
   their effects on damage detection sensitivity improvement. As a result
   of the control process with proper gain factor, the curvature is more
   concentrated at the position close to the crack in the first vibration
   mode shape of the damaged beam comparing with the one without mode shape
   tuning. Therefore, the first natural frequency variation induced by the
   crack effect with mode shape tuning is much more significant than the
   one without mode shape tuning. In addition, further numerical
   simulations also indicate that the improvement of the detection
   sensitivity is closely related to the dimensions of the piezoelectric
   actuators. To realize better detection results, the optimal design of
   the size of the piezoelectric actuators is presented. The optimal length
   of the piezoelectric actuators is found leading to the best performance
   on damage detection. The theoretical studies and numerical simulations
   reflect that the proposed technique with mode shape tuning and optimally
   designed actuators is effective and promising in the field of damage
   detection. It is noted that the proposed technique can also be applied
   to improve the sensitivity of frequency based damage detection on other
   structures, e.g. plates and frames}},

   differently-sized primary iron-oxide nanoparticles (3 nm and 10 nm) were
   synthesized and coated with silica and (3-chloropropyl)triethoxysilane,
   allowing subsequent introduction of N-chloramine precursors - dimethyl
   hydantoin (DMH) and quaternized dimethyl hydantoin (QDMH). The
   functionalized MNPs (MNP@DMH and MNP@QDMH) have a clear core-shell
   structure as evidenced by TEM images. Fe3O4 was identified (by combining
   X-ray diffraction with Mossbauer spectroscopy) to be the iron oxide in
   the 10 nm MNPs, while gamma-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 were the 3 nm MNP's oxide
   phases. Both MNPs (3 nm and 10 nm) have good magnetic responses, with
   saturation magnetizations of 40 +/- 4 emu g(-1) and 65 +/- 2 emu g(-1),
   respectively. Chlorination activated the antibacterial function and
   yielded two antibacterial MNPs: MNP@DMCl and MNP@QASCl. At the
   equivalent {[}Cl+] of 50 ppm, both coatings demonstrated fast
   inactivation of the model bacteria methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus
   aureus (MRSA) and multi-drug resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For
   either size of primary MNPs, MNP@QDMCl is more effective than MNP@DMCl.
   A hand-held magnet could quickly remove >99\% of the functionalized MNPs
   from a wound simulant within 2 minutes.}},

Abstract = {{Polymeric ultrathin membranes that are compatible with cells offer
   tremendous advantages for tissue engineering. In this article, we report
   a free-standing nanomembrane that was developed using a layer-by-layer
   self-assembly technique with a safe and sacrificial substrate method.
   After ionization, two oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, alginate and
   chitosan, were alternately deposited on a substrate of a solidified
   gelatin block to form an ultrathin nanomembrane. The space between the
   two adjacent layers was similar to 200 nm. The thickness of the
   nanomembrane was proportional to the number of layers. The
   temperature-sensitive gelatin gel served as a sacrificial template at 37
   degrees C. The free-standing nanomembrane promoted bone marrow stem cell
   adhesion and proliferation. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used
   to analyze green-fluorescent-protein-positive mesenchymal stem cells
   from the wounds, which showed a significantly high survival and
   proliferation from the nanomembrane when cells were transplanted to
   mouse dorsal skin that had a full-thickness burn. The
   bone-marrow-stem-cell-loaded nanomembrane also accelerated wound
   contraction and epidermalization. Therefore, this methodology provides a
   fast and facile approach to construct free-standing ultrathin scaffolds
   for tissue engineering. The biocompatibility and free-standing nature of
   the fabricated nanomembrane may be particularly useful for stem cell
   delivery and wound healing.}},

Title = {{2 Study of stress variations in single-stance and sideways fall using
   image-based finite element analysis}},
Journal = {{BIO-MEDICAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Abstract = {{Image-based finite element analysis (FEA) has been considered an
   effective computational tool to predict hip fracture risk. The patient
   specific FEA gives an insight into the inclusive effect of
   three-dimensional (3D) complex bone geometry, and the distribution of
   inhomogeneous isotropic material properties in conjunction with loading
   conditions. The neck region of a femur is primarily the weakest in which
   fracture is likely to happen, when someone falls. A sideways fall
   results in the development of greater tensile and compressive stresses,
   respectively, in the inferior and superior aspects of the femoral neck,
   whereas the state of stress is reversed in usual gait or stance
   configuration. Herein, the variations of stresses have been investigated
   at the femoral neck region considering both single-stance and sideways
   fall. Finite element models of ten human femora have been generated
   using Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) scan datasets and have been
   simulated with an equal magnitude of load applied to the aforementioned
   configurations. Fracture risk indicator, defined as the ratio of the
   maximum compressive or tensile stress computed at the superior and
   inferior surfaces to the corresponding yield stress, has been used in
   this work to measure the variations of fracture risk between
   single-stance and sideways fall. The average variations of the fracture
   risk indicators between the fall and stance are at least 24.3\% and 8\%
   at the superior and inferior surfaces, respectively. The differences may
   interpret why sideways fall is more dangerous for the elderly people,
   causing hip fracture.}},

Abstract = {{This article introduces proximal relator spaces. The basic approach is
   to define a nonvoid family of proximity relations R-delta Phi (called a
   proximal relator) on a nonempty set. The pair (X,R-delta Phi) (also

   example, the traditional closure of a subset of the Sz'az relator space
   (X,R) can be compared with the more recent descriptive closure of a
   subset of (X,R-delta Phi). This leads to an extension of fat and dense
   subsets of the relator space (X,R) to proximal fat and dense subsets of
   the proximal relator space (X,R-delta Phi).}},

Abstract = {{The impact of pH variation on aerobic granular sludge stability and
   performance was investigated. A 9-day alkaline (pH = 9) and acidic (pH =
   6) pH shocks were imposed on mature granules with simultaneous chemical
   oxygen demand (COD), nitrogen and phosphorus removal. The imposed
   alkaline pH shock (pH 9) reduced nitrogen and phosphorus removal
   efficiency from 88\% and 98\% to 66\% and 50\%, respectively, with no
   further recovery. However, acidic pH shock (pH 6) did not have a major
   impact on nutrient removal and the removal efficiencies recovered to
   their initial values after 3 days of operation under the new pH
   condition. Operating the reactors under alkaline pH induced granules
   breakage and resulted in an increased solids concentration in the
   effluent and a significant decrease in the size of the bio-particles,
   while acidic pH did not have significant impacts on granules stability.
   Changes in chemical structure and composition of extracellular polymeric
   substances (EPS) matrix were suggested as the main factors inducing
   granules instability under high pH.}},

Abstract = {{The City of Winnipeg and southern Manitoba have a long history of
   flooding, with flood events being recorded soon after the region was
   settled in the early nineteenth century. A devastating flood on the Red
   River in 1950 resulted in some of the earliest benefit-cost analyses in
   Canada with respect to flooding, and justified the construction of major
   flood mitigation projects on the Red and Assiniboine Rivers in the 1960s
   and 1970s. These projects were primarily designed to reduce the risk to
   the City of Winnipeg. Other projects have been constructed outside of
   the Winnipeg area, which have reduced flood damages to towns, individual
   farmsteads and rural residences. The level of flood protection has been
   re-evaluated every time a new flood of record occurs, and this has
   resulted in significant upgrading of existing works and the addition of
   more communities with permanent flood protection. As a result of the
   flood protection system that has been developed in Manitoba over the
   last 60 years, the damage caused by floods has been significantly
   reduced over natural conditions. The purpose of this paper is to provide
   context to flooding in Manitoba with a consideration of how flooding,
   flood damage and the impact on citizens of Manitoba have been mitigated
   by permanent flood protection works.}},

Abstract = {{The Red River once again experienced significant flooding in spring 2009
   due to high antecedent soil moisture from the previous fall and a deep
   snowpack and deep frost penetration. The peak stage at Fargo, North
   Dakota, broke the previous record set in 1897, and the peak stage at
   Grand Forks, ND, was the third largest in its 126 years of record. The
   computed natural river crest in Winnipeg, Manitoba, was the second
   largest experienced since official records began in 1912, and the
   unregulated flow volume at Selkirk, Manitoba, was the highest on record
   since 1852. Beyond its statistical significance, the 2009 Red River
   flood was unique due to the magnitude and frequency of ice-related
   issues throughout the duration of the flood. Ice jams developed within
   Winnipeg and near the community of Lockport, and went through phases of
   formation and release that made it difficult to forecast water levels.
   The presence of ice also affected operation of the Floodway Inlet
   Control Structure, and a small ice jam even developed within the
   Floodway itself. Despite the magnitude of the flood event and the
   challenges associated with the ice conditions, the extensive level of
   flood protection along the Red River generally reduced the level of
   inconvenience and flood damage. The exception was the area downstream of
   the City of Selkirk that underwent flooding of a magnitude that had not
   been experienced for a century and a half. A large number of homes along
   this reach of the river were damaged beyond repair and were subject to a
   government buyout after the flood.}},

Abstract = {{The 2011 Red River flood event was the third largest event since the
   operation of major flood control structures in the Province of Manitoba
   (exceeded by 1997 and 2009), and the fifth largest on record (including
   1800s events). However, the flooding experienced on the Red River in
   2011 has only an estimated 22-year (James Avenue) to 58-year (Grand
   Forks, ND) return period. Flooding in 2011 was the result of the second
   highest soil moisture index ever recorded (in 2010) prior to freeze up,
   lower-than-normal winter temperatures (causing significant frost
   penetration), high winter flows and above-average snow cover across the
   basin. The flood had the potential to be much more severe had it not
   been for favourable weather conditions within the basin during the
   spring of 2011. Below-normal precipitation, warm temperatures resulting
   in high evaporative losses from saturated soils, the non-coincident peak
   flows of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, and lower-than-anticipated
   tributary inflows between Emerson, MB, and the City of Winnipeg
   mitigated the potential flood peak. The floodway had been expanded after
   the 1997 flood and further upgrades and maintenance following the 2009
   flood allowed an additional 141.6 m(3)/s of flow to be diverted around
   the city, resulting in approximately a 0.38-m reduction in the James
   Avenue water level. The 2011 flood resulted in the fifth highest
   floodway peak on record, with flood control works in both the Red and
   Assiniboine systems estimated to have reduced James Avenue stage in the
   City of Winnipeg by 3.5 m. The majority of data presented in this paper
   have been taken from the Manitoba 2011 Flood Review Task Force Report

Abstract = {{In spring and summer of 2011, the Assiniboine River and its tributaries
   underwent a flood of unprecedented proportions. It was, by several
   measures, including the computed return period and duration of flooding,
   a more extreme event than the 1997 Red River ``Flood of the Century,{''}
   and may have been the most severe flood experienced in the history of
   Canada. The 2011 flood was the largest recorded in the over 100 years
   that flow records have been kept on the Assiniboine River. As reported
   in the 2013 Manitoba 2011 Flood Review Task Force Report, antecedent
   conditions, winter snowpack and summer rains combined to produce one of
   the largest floods ever experienced in Manitoba. The spring of 2011 was
   preceded by a very wet fall in 2010 when precipitation averaged between
   150 and 200\% of normal over a wide area in Manitoba and Saskatchewan
   This produced extremely high regional antecedent moisture conditions
   whereby soil moisture levels were 100 to 250\% of the long-term average.
   Added to this, the winter snowpack was relatively high, varying
   geographically in the range of 90 to 130\% of normal snow water content
   and lower-than-normal winter temperatures, causing significant frost
   penetration. The combination of high soil moisture in the previous
   summer/fall and deep frost penetration reduced the soil's ability to
   absorb spring meltwater and increased runoff volumes contributing to the
   magnitude of the spring peak. The severe winter was followed by a series
   of rainfall events that resulted in unprecedented rainfall volumes in
   the region throughout the months of May, June and July, when some areas
   received rainfall amounts that were 350\% of normal and produced up to
   two additional flood peaks at some locations. Flooding on the
   Assiniboine River near Brandon lasted for 120 days. Large volumes of
   floodwater were diverted to Lake Manitoba due to the use of the Portage
   Diversion to mitigate flooding downstream of the City of Portage La
   Prairie. This large volume of inflow resulted in a
   wind-effect-eliminated Lake Manitoba level that peaked at 249.1 m in
   late July of 2011, which was close to 1 m higher than flood stage and
   almost 1.5 m higher than the top of the desirable range. Peak outflow
   from Lake Manitoba into the Fairford River was almost double historic
   maxima and resulted in Lake St. Martin levels that peaked in July of
   2011 at 245.55 m, which was more than 0.6 m higher than the historic
   peak that occurred under natural conditions in 1955, and 1.4 m above
   flood stage. The damage estimate for this flood event has not been
   finalized but is likely in excess of CAD \$1 billion. The majority of
   flood damages were incurred by communities and infrastructure along
   major tributaries like the Souris and Qu'Appelle Rivers, and the
   communities on Lake Manitoba and Lake St. Martin. The Lake St. Martin
   First Nations community was virtually destroyed, and as of 2014 some
   First Nations people from the communities along Lake St. Martin are
   still evacuated and waiting for their homes and communities to be
   rebuilt. Temporary flood control works were largely effective in
   preventing infrastructure damage to communities along the Assiniboine
   River, such as Brandon, although the agricultural damage and damage to
   individual properties were extensive.}},

Title = {{Assessing the impact of climate change on the frequency of floods in the
   Red River basin}},
Journal = {{CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{331-342}},
Abstract = {{The impact of climate change on the frequency distribution of spring
   floods in the Red River basin is investigated. Several major floods in
   the last couple of decades have caused major damages and inconvenience
   to people living in the Red River flood plain south of Winnipeg, and
   have raised the question of whether climate change is at least partly
   responsible for what appears to be more frequent occurrences of high
   spring runoff. To investigate whether this is the case, a regression
   model is used to associate spring peak flow at the US-Canada border with
   predictor variables that include antecedent precipitation in the
   previous fall (used as a proxy for soil moisture at freeze-up), winter
   snow accumulation and spring precipitation. Data from the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project - Phase 5 (CMIP5) are used to derive information
   about possible changes to the predictor variables in the future, and
   this information is then used to derive flood distributions for future
   climate conditions. While mean monthly precipitation during the winter
   months is expected to increase, winters are expected to be shorter in
   warmer climates and evaporation losses are expected to be higher,
   resulting in a net reduction in average snow pack accumulations. On the
   other hand, precipitation during the active snowmelt period is expected
   to increase. The average of future flood distributions obtained from an
   ensemble of 16 climate models is close to the distribution fitted to
   observed data, but there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the
   average, highlighting the difficulty in assessing changes in the
   frequency of extreme events.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a robust, fixed-gain, and linear controller is designed
   for the output pressure of an electro-hydraulic actuator with parametric
   uncertainties. Quantitative feedback theory (QFT) is selected as the
   design technique. The objective is to satisfy specified performance
   criteria in terms of tracking, stability, and disturbance rejection. To
   design the QFT controller, the required family of frequency responses is
   obtained by linearizing the hydraulic nonlinear function around
   operating points of interest, and constructing an equivalent linear
   plant set. As a result, the stability of the closed-loop system is
   guaranteed only around the limited number of operating points, and
   specified values for system parameters. To overcome this limitation,
   Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy modeling is employed. This way the nonlinear
   stability of the closed-loop system is investigated and ensured for a
   continuous range of parametric uncertainties and region of operating
   points. Having successful results from stability analysis, the QFT
   controller is applied on the experimental set-up. The experimental
   results are in accordance with the specified criteria.}},

Title = {{Analyte discrimination with chemically diverse sensor array based on
   electrocopolymerized pyrrole and vinyl derivatives}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{39}},
Pages = {{32549-32559}},
Abstract = {{The development of chemically diverse arrays has gained the attention of
   researchers due to their anticipated capacity to mimic the function of
   olfactory receptors in the mammalian olfactory system. A major hurdle
   facing the field is the limited ability to generate large numbers of
   different sensing elements out of the relatively limited number of
   conducting polymers. In this work, chemically distinct
   electrocopolymerized sensors were created with pyrrole by using
   different substituted vinyl groups (e.g., styrene, m-styrene,
   4-chlorostyrene, 4-chloromethylstyrene, 4-t-butylstyrene,
   4-t-butoxystyrene, divinyl benzene and vinyl pyridine) as monomers.
   Copolymer films were grown at different potentials that created an
   additional level of sensor diversity by altering the relative amount of
   each of the components. By controlling the deposition conditions in this
   way, as well as setting different redox potentials to the films after
   growth changes the copolymer's composition and the amount of dopant
   anion that is incorporated into the sensing films respectively. The
   composition of the sensing films was also altered by changing the
   dopant-type during copolymer growth, thereby providing another mechanism
   for varying the chemical nature of the sensing materials. The chemical
   diversity among the 27 different sensing polymers used in this work is
   demonstrated with differential partitioning of 12 analytes, ranging from
   alcohols and solvents to fuels. This process of generating significant
   numbers of chemically distinct sensors represents a significant
   advancement in the efforts to approach the number of olfactory receptors
   in mammals. The fact that the sensing polymers can be electropolymerized
   onto very small conducting contacting electrodes shows that this
   approach is compatible with integrated circuit technology.}},

Abstract = {{Four-arm Archimedean spiral antennas, capable of generating both senses
   of circular polarization with broadside radiation patterns, are
   investigated as a primary feed in symmetrical parabolic reflector
   antennas with circular rims. Unidirectional, center-fed, and compact
   spiral antennas are studied, backed by a planar reflector as a ground
   plane. Both right-and left-handed circularly polarized fields with
   broadside radiation patterns, according to the first and third modes of
   the spiral, are realized by confining the radiation zone to less than a
   three-wavelength circumference. The proposed feed exhibits excellent
   pattern symmetry and axial ratios well below 0.5 dB at the boresight
   direction for both senses of polarization. In this letter, the
   performance of the proposed spiral antenna is fully addressed as primary
   feeds in symmetrical parabolic reflector antennas. Different antenna
   parameters such as gain, cross polarization, and efficiency are studied
   for paraboloids, having different focal-length-to-diameter ratios, for
   both senses of circular polarization. Efficiencies of 70\% and higher
   are obtained over a frequency band of 2.5-5.0 GHz.}},

   bilayer collagen conduit promoting sciatic nerve growth}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{1383-1394}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we fabricated glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor
   (GDNF)-loaded microspheres, then seeded the microspheres in
   gelatin-methacrylamide hydrogel, which was finally integrated with the
   commercial bilayer collagen membrane (Bio-Gide (R)). The novel composite
   of nerve conduit was employed to bridge a 10 mm long sciatic nerve
   defect in a rat. GDNF-loaded gelatin microspheres had a smooth surface
   with an average diameter of 3.9 +/- 1.8 mu m. Scanning electron
   microscopy showed that microspheres were uniformly distributed in both
   the GelMA gel and the layered structure. Using enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay, in vitro release studies (pH 7.4) of GDNF from
   microspheres exhibited an initial burst release during the first 3 days
   (18.0\%+/- 1.3\%), and then, a prolonged-release profile extended to 32
   days. However, in an acidic condition (pH 2.5), the initial release
   percentage of GDNF was up to 91.2\%+/- 0.9\% within 4 hours and the
   cumulative release percentage of GDNF was 99.2\%+/- 0.2\% at 48 hours.
   Then the composite conduct was implanted in a 10 mm critical defect gap
   of sciatic nerve in a rat. We found that the nerve was regenerated in
   both conduit and autograft (AG) groups. A combination of
   electrophysiological assessment and histomorphometry analysis of
   regenerated nerves showed that axonal regeneration and functional
   recovery in collagen tube filled with GDNF-loaded microspheres (GM + CT)
   group were similar to AG group (P>0.05). Most myelinated nerves were
   matured and arranged densely with a uniform structure of myelin in a
   neat pattern along the long axis in the AG and GM + CT groups, however,
   regenerated nerve was absent in the BLANK group, left the 10 mm gap
   empty after resection, and the nerve fiber exhibited a disordered
   arrangement in the collagen tube group. These results indicated that the
   hybrid system of bilayer collagen conduit and GDNF-loaded gelatin
   microspheres combined with gelatin-methacrylamide hydrogels could serve
   as a new biodegradable artificial nerve guide for nerve tissue
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal cord injury leads to severe sensory ormotor damage in the human
   body. Efforts have beenmade to activate the nerve function by trying
   physical and biochemical strategies. Carbon nanotubes as conductive
   materials have been used to transmit electrical signals to improve
   cell-cell communication and cross-talk, besides providing an
   extracellular scaffold for neurons. We reported a thermally sensitive
   hydrogel using copolymerization of n-isopropylacrylamide, the oligomeric
   amphiphilic crosslinker of polyethylene glycol
   diacrylate-dodecylamine-1-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine (PEGDA-DD-AEP), and
   single-walled carbon nanotubes. We hypothesized that carbon nanotubes in
   the gel could improve neurite outgrowth and nerve regeneration. In order
   to overcome the aggregation issue of carbon nanotubes, the hydrophobic
   chains of the amphiphilic crosslinker were used to stabilize the
   nanotubes. The carbon nanotube-poly(n-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAM)
   hydrogel was injectable and improved the electrical conductivity. We
   found that the hydrogel may have potential to promote the growth of
   SH-SY5Y cells, with significant neurite outgrowth while electrical
   stimulation was given. In a spinal cord injury model, creating a 1 mm x
   1 mm x 1 mm cavity at C7, we found that the hydrogel promoted nerve
   tissue regeneration and reduced the formation of scar tissue. Therefore,
   the hydrogel may be a potential repairing biomaterial for neuron network
   reconstruction and spinal cord regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Portable electronic devices and wireless communication systems enable a
   broad range of applications such as environmental and food safety
   monitoring, personalized medicine and healthcare management.
   Particularly, hybrid smartphone and microfluidic devices provide an
   integrated solution for the new generation of mobile sensing
   applications. Such mobile sensing based on microfluidic devices (broadly
   defined) and smartphones (MS2) offers a mobile laboratory for performing
   a wide range of bio-chemical detection and analysis functions such as
   water and food quality analysis, routine health tests and disease
   diagnosis. MS2 offers significant advantages over traditional platforms
   in terms of test speed and control, low cost, mobility,
   ease-of-operation and data management. These improvements put MS2 in a
   promising position in the fields of interdisciplinary basic and applied
   research. In particular, MS2 enables applications to remote infield
   testing, homecare, and healthcare in low-resource areas. The marriage of
   smartphones and microfluidic devices offers a powerful on-chip operating
   platform to enable various bio-chemical tests, remote sensing, data
   analysis and management in a mobile fashion. The implications of such
   integration are beyond telecommunication and microfluidic-related
   research and technology development. In this review, we will first
   provide the general background of microfluidic-based sensing,

Abstract = {{Recovery of manure P as magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate
   (MgNH4PO4 center dot 6H(2)O), commonly known as struvite, can mitigate
   the risk of P contamination of surface water bodies from hog operations.
   The slow release of P from struvite may help improve crop P use
   efficiency. This greenhouse bioassay evaluated the agronomic
   effectiveness of liquid hog manure recovered struvite. Struvite,
   monoammonium phosphate (MAP), and polymer-coated MAP (CMAP) were
   evaluated for canola (Brassica napus L.) grown in rotation with spring
   wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in two low soil test P (Olsen P < 6 mg
   kg(-1)) soils: a sandy Gleyed Regosol (Typic Haplaquent) and a clay
   loamy Orthic Black Chernozem (Udic Boroll). The fertilizers were applied
   either in the seed row or in a sideband at 1.1 and 2.2 g P m(-2) rates.
   In both soils, struvite produced canola dry matter (DM) yield (DMY, 2.4
   g kg(-1) soil), P uptake (5.9 mg P kg(-1) soil), P recovery efficiency
   (43\%), and agronomic efficiency (0.15 g DM mg(-1) P) that were similar
   to those of MAP and CMAP in the first crop phase. Moreover, at the 2.2 g
   P m(-2) rate, struvite produced significantly greater canola DMY than
   MAP in the second crop phase and both MAP and CMAP in the third crop
   phase. Overall, wheat did not produce significant responses to P
   fertilization. These results indicate that struvite recovered from
   liquid hog manure can supply sufficient P to sustain yields and P use
   efficiency matching or exceeding those for MAP.}},

Abstract = {{Digital design technologies have been applied extensively in dental
   medicine, especially in the field of dental restoration. The all-ceramic
   crown is an important restoration type of dental CAD systems. This paper
   presents a robust tooth surface reconstruction algorithm for all-ceramic
   crown design. The algorithm involves three necessary steps: standard
   tooth initial positioning and division; salient feature point extraction
   using Morse theory; and standard tooth deformation using iterative
   Laplacian Surface Editing and mesh stitching. This algorithm can retain
   the morphological features of the tooth surface well. It is robust and
   suitable for almost all types of teeth, including incisor, canine,
   premolar, and molar. Moreover, it allows dental technicians to use their
   own preferred library teeth for reconstruction. The algorithm has been
   successfully integrated in our Dental CAD system, more than 1000
   clinical cases have been tested to demonstrate the robustness and
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Detection of fungal infection in five different pulses using near.
   infrared hyperspectral imaging}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STORED PRODUCTS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{13-18}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The five major pulse crops grown in Canada are: chick peas, green peas,
   lentils, pinto beans and kidney beans. Potential causes of fungal
   infection in these pulses are Aspergillus flavus and Penicillium
   commune. Early stages of fungal infections in pulses are not detectable
   with human eyes and traditional microbial methods require significant
   time to detect fungal infection. Near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral
   imaging system is an advanced technique widely being assessed for
   detection of insect infestation and fungal infection in cereal grains
   and oilseeds. The primary objective of this study was to assess the
   feasibility of the NIR hyperspectral imaging system to identify fungal
   infections in pulses. Hyperspectral images of healthy and fungal
   infected chick peas, green peas, lentils, pinto beans and kidney beans
   were acquired and features (six statistical and 10 histogram) were used
   to develop classification models to identify fungal infection caused by
   A. flavus and P. commune. Images of healthy and fungal -infected kernels
   were acquired at 2 week intervals (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks from
   artificial inoculation). Six-way (healthy vs the five different stages
   of infection) and two-way (healthy vs every stage of infection) models
   were developed and classifications were done using linear discriminant
   analysis (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classifiers.
   The LDA classifier identified both types of fungal infections with
   90-94\% accuracy while using the six-way model, and with 98-100\%
   accuracy when using the two-way models for all five types of pulses. The
   QDA classifier also showed promising results as it gave 85-90\% accuracy
   for the six -way model and 96-100\% accuracy for the two-way models. The
   two fungal species could not be differentiated by the hyperspectral
   imaging. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A study was done to detect Aspergillus glaucus, and Penicillium spp.,
   infection and Ochratoxin A contamination in stored wheat using a
   Near-Infrared (NIR) Hyperspectral Imaging system. Fungal infected
   samples were imaged every two weeks, and the three dimensional
   hypercubes obtained from image data were transformed into two
   dimensional data. Principal component analysis was applied to the two
   dimensional data and based on the highest factor loadings, 1280, 1300,
   and 1350 nm were identified as significant wavelengths. Six statistical
   features and ten histogram features corresponding to the significant
   wavelengths were extracted and subjected to linear, quadratic and
   Mahalanobis discriminant classifiers. All the three classifiers
   differentiated healthy kernels from fungal-infected kernels with a
   classification accuracy of more than 90\%. The quadratic discriminant
   classifier provided classification accuracy higher than the linear and
   Mahalanobis classifiers for pair-wise, two-way and six way
   classification models. The Ochratoxin A contaminated samples had a
   unique significant wavelength at 1480 nm in addition to the two
   significant wavelengths corresponding to fungal infection. The peak at
   1480 nm was identified only in the Ochratoxin A contaminated samples.
   The Ochratoxin A contaminated samples can be detected with 100\%
   classification accuracy using NIR hyperspectral imaging system. The NIR

Abstract = {{Hyperspectral imaging is a non-destructive technique with great
   capability to detect food defects and diseases. In this research,
   infection of pistachio kernels by two different isolates of Aspergillus
   flavus, KK11 and R5, was determined using long-wave near-infrared
   hyperspectral imaging. Seven fungal growing stages on pistachio kernels,
   for both isolates, were investigated. The features from the hypercubes
   of healthy and infected pistachios were extracted, selected and then
   used for classification by linear discriminant analysis and quadratic
   discriminant analysis (QDA) methods which were performed by 10-fold
   cross validation technique in MATLAB 2010a. The QDA model gave the
   highest classification accuracy for all classes (healthy and infected
   kernels by different fungi and at different stages). For classification
   of infection by different fungi at the last fungal growing stage, QDA
   had the accuracy of 91.7\%. As KK11 is an aflatoxin-producing and R5 is
   a non-aflatoxin-producing fungus isolate, the importance of the
   technique to detect aflatoxin contamination in pistachio is significant.}},

   size effect on shear strength. In addition, test results were compared
   to prediction models and design provisions that were developed based on
   testing FRP-RC simple structures. It was found that the current shear
   provisions and models could reasonably predict the shear strength of

   integration of the multi-layer product representation and the optimal
   search in product selective disassembly planning. The multilayer
   representation is based on the product structure formed in product
   design. The method enables an efficient search for the disassembly
   sequence. Unlike the existing product representation methods, the
   multi-layer representation is a dynamic product data model integrated
   with an ant colony search process for a near optimal solution.
   Industrial applications have proven the method effectiveness. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A new approach is introduced to show that bulk polymers with metallic
   plates/strips can be employed to design compact lightweight resonator
   antennas. A new fundamental mode is excited inside the polymer, based on
   the special boundary conditions enforced by the metallic plates and
   strip. By properly adjusting the physical parameters (e.g., the gap
   between metallic plate and strip), the mode is excited in an appropriate
   shape and significant miniaturization along with good radiation
   performance is achieved. An antenna structure is fabricated using
   acrylic (epsilon(r) = 3) and the measured results are compared with the
   results of other compact antennas, which can be realized using very
   high-permittivity materials. Besides over 70\% reduction in weight,
   outstanding antenna features such as 10\% impedance bandwidth, 5.7 dBi
   gain, over 90\% efficiency, and dimensions smaller than lambda/6, make
   the proposed approach more suitable for designing compact lightweight
   antennas.}},

Abstract = {{The dermal papilla cell (DPC) is a type of highly specialized
   mesenchymal cells located in hair follicles (HF). Due to the primary
   role in the epithelial-mesenchymal interaction that enables
   hair-follicle morphogenesis and hair cycling, DPC has become an
   attractive cell source for hair regeneration to treat alopecia patients.
   However, DPCs tend to lose their function during in vitro culture.
   Hence, there exists a clear need to develop a microenvironment that can
   recapitulate the interactions within the native milieu of DPCs. Since
   layer-by-layer (LBL) nano-coating with biocompatible materials on the
   cell surface displays the versatility with tunable loading and release
   properties, which can provide a remodeled microenvironment for
   regulating cell function. Here, we developed a LBL self-assembly
   technique to single DPCs to create a nano-scale ultrathin extracellular
   matrix (ECM). We studied that the single cell-based LBL-encapsulation
   would not impact the viability, morphology, proliferation and intrinsic
   properties of DPCs using Western blot and mRNA expressions of
   beta-catenin, ALP and alpha-SMA. We then included fibroblast growth
   factor-2 (FGF-2) into the LBL nano-structure to regulate the DPC
   function. Finally, we performed in vivo hair reconstitution assays using
   LBL-encapsulated DPCs combined with freshly isolated epidermal cells
   (EPCs) and found this strategy can treat hair loss.}},

Pages = {{395-408}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Various concrete structures/elements are at risk of physical salt attack
   (PSA) during service; however, there is currently no standard test
   method in North America for PSA of cement-based materials. Therefore, an
   accelerated laboratory test, based on sodium sulfate, was developed in
   this research to assess the resistance of concrete to PSA. The effects
   of w/cm, fly ash and two types of nanoparticle (nano-silica {[}NS] and
   nano-alumina {[}NA]) addition on the resistance of concrete to PSA were
   also investigated. The assessment criteria were based on physical
   properties (visual appearance, mass loss and penetrability), and the
   alteration of microstructure by microscopy, thermal and mineralogical
   analyses. The results showed that the proposed procedure can
   successfully reflect the performance of concrete under PSA within a
   relatively short time interval (120 days). Also, adverse effects of
   higher w/cm (0.5) and nanoparticle addition on the resistance of
   concrete to PSA were captured. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The pressure losses of air-water mixtures passing through a horizontal,

   the liquid distribution between the inlets. All experiments were
   conducted at room temperature and a nominal absolute pressure at the

   three legs of the tee was determined using 43 pressure taps distributed
   among the three sides and monitored using pressure transducers to
   produce accurate measurements of the pressure losses. New empirical
   coefficients are provided for an existing model and allow accurate

Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{4-15}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This article introduces proximal three-way decision-making. This form of
   3-way decision-making stems from the proximity structures that result
   from endowing each nonempty set of social network triangulation nodes

   connecting every pair of nearest neighbour nodes with a straight edge.
   The proposed approach to 3-way decision-making results from the analysis
   of Delaunay graphs (spatial) as well as friendship network (social) of
   location-based social network nodes. The knowledge gained from proximal
   three-way decision-making is in the form of information granules that
   are near sets of nodes representing interaction between either casual
   users or friends in a social network. A practical illustration of
   proximal three-way decision-making is given in terms of a public domain

   Jurisdictions and Resulting Load Stresses on Single-Span Bridges}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper identifies and characterizes existing bridge formulas from
   international regions and presents the results of an analysis of the
   allowable gross vehicle weights and bridge load stress effects on
   single-span bridges resulting from these formulas. This is done to
   provide insight into this method of regulating truck size and weight to
   identify influencing factors and considerations for future decisions
   regarding the creation of new bridge formulas, or modification of
   existing ones. It is found that bridge formulas vary significantly in
   terms of the level of restrictiveness of allowable loads and imposed
   load effects due to the design criteria used in their development
   including truck configurations, bridge design methods, design loads, and
   allowable load rating. Bridge formulas should be designed to limit the
   imposed stresses on bridges based on criteria suitable to a
   jurisdiction's truck fleet and infrastructure characteristics in order
   to adequately regulate truck sizes and weights. Many issues may result
   from the implementation of an unsuitable bridge formula for the
   infrastructure and transportation characteristics of a jurisdiction in
   terms of the design overstress criteria and additional axle spacing and
   weight limits. The unintended, and possibly undesirable, outcomes of
   implementation of a bridge formula must be monitored and resolved for
   safety, dynamic performance, and infrastructure impacts. With the
   continuously changing infrastructure and truck transportation
   characteristics, bridge formulas must be reevaluated and updated to
   ensure the adequacy of limit weights.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of how autonomous cognitive nodes (CNs) can arrive
   at an efficient and fair opportunistic channel access policy in
   scenarios where channels may be non-homogeneous in terms of primary user
   (PU) occupancy. In our model, a CN that is able to adapt to the
   environment is limited in two ways. First, CNs have imperfect
   observations (such as due to sensing and channel errors) of their
   environment. Second, CNs have imperfect memory due to limitations in
   computational capabilities. For efficient opportunistic channel access,
   we propose a simple adaptive win-shift lose-randomize (WSLR) strategy
   that can be executed by a two-state machine (automaton). Using the
   framework of repeated games (with imperfect observations and limited
   memory), we show that the proposed strategy enables the CNs (without any
   explicit coordination) to reach an outcome that: 1) maximizes the total
   network payoff and also ensures fairness among the CNs; 2) reduces the
   likelihood of collisions among CNs; and 3) requires a small number of
   sensing steps (attempts) to find a channel free of PU activity. We
   compare the performance of the proposed autonomous strategy with a
   centralized strategy and also test it with real spectrum data collected
   at RWTH Aachen.}},

Abstract = {{Thiophene moieties have been attached to Si microwires (Si MWs) by a
   two-step chlorination/alkylation reaction method. X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy indicated that saturation of the surface occurred after 30
   min of reaction time. Electrical measurements using a standard probe
   station indicated that the junction between individual
   thiophene-functionalized Si MWs and the conducting polymer
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)
   became more ohmic as more thiophene was added to the MW surface. Under a
   light-limited current of 20 nA, representative of operation of Si MWs
   under 1 Sun illumination conditions, the iR loss of thiophene-n-Si
   MW/PEDOT-PSS contacts was 20 mV, representing an order of magnitude
   reduction compared with PEDOT-PSS junctions formed with methyl
   terminated n-Si MWs. Such iR losses are much less than typical catalytic
   overpotentials for fuel formation, and hence the
   thiophene-functionalized Si MW contacts will not limit the performance
   of a Si MW array-based solar fuels device under 1 Sun illumination.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to permit bone marrow mesenchymal stem
   cells (BMSCs) to reach their full potential in the treatment of chronic
   wounds. A biocompatible multifunctional crosslinker based temperature
   sensitive hydrogel was developed to deliver BMSCs, which improve the
   chronic inflammation microenvironments of wounds. A detailed in vitro
   investigation found that the hydrogel is suitable for BMSC encapsulation
   and can promote BMSC secretion of TGF-beta 1 and bFGF. In vivo,
   full-thickness skin defects were made on the backs of db/db mice to
   mimic diabetic ulcers. It was revealed that the hydrogel can inhibit
   pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage expression. After hydrogel association
   with BMSCs treated the wound, significantly greater wound contraction
   was observed in the hydrogel + BMSCs group. Histology and
   immunohistochemistry results confirmed that this treatment contributed
   to the rapid healing of diabetic skin wounds by promoting granulation
   tissue formation, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix secretion, wound
   contraction, and re-epithelialization. These results show that a
   hydrogel laden with BMSCs may be a promising therapeutic strategy for
   the management of diabetic ulcers.}},

Abstract = {{Presented in this work is a novel and facile approach to fabricate an
   elastic, attachable, and cost-efficient carbon nanotube (CNT)-based
   strain gauge which can be efficiently used as bodily motion sensors. An
   innovative and unique method is introduced to align CNTs without
   external excitations or any complicated procedure. In this design, CNTs
   are aligned and distributed uniformly on the entire chewing gum by
   multiple stretching and folding technique. The current sensor is
   demonstrated to be a linear strain sensor for at least strains up to
   200\% and can detect strains as high as 530\% with a high sensitivity
   ranging from 12 to 25 and high durability. The gum sensor has been used
   as bodily motion sensors, and outstanding results are achieved; the
   sensitivity is quite high, capable of tracing slow breathing. Since the
   gum sensor can be patterned into various forms, it has wide applications
   in miniaturized sensors and biochips. Interestingly, we revealed that
   our gum sensor has the ability to monitor humidity changes with high
   sensitivity and fast resistance response capable of monitoring human
   breathing.}},

Abstract = {{In machining of free-form or compound surfaces, machining areas are
   sometimes required to be expressed in a boundary representation. To
   extract the boundary easily, Z-map models are commonly employed. Using
   traditional approaches, boundaries cannot be extracted precisely from a
   Z-map model. A boundary extraction algorithm for the machining area
   detection is proposed based on morphological image processing in this
   paper. Firstly, the Z-map model is transformed into a binary image with
   a slicing plane. The binary image is then dilated and the boundary
   pixels of the dilated image are extracted and coded. Finally, preferable
   accurate boundaries are generated. Experimental results show that the
   machining area boundaries extracted by this algorithm are more precise
   and smoother than those using traditional Z-map methods.}},

Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Oriented strand board (OSB) face sheets adhered to polyurethane (PUR)
   foam have been used to make structural insulated panels (SIPs) for
   energy-efficient buildings for many years. One challenge for more
   widespread use is lack of a clear indication of service life and
   durability. Many regulatory agencies do not allow the use of SIPs
   without dimensional lumber framing, asserting OSB is typically not a
   principal structural member and citing a concern for service life. This
   paper presents the results of research focused on the evaluation of bond
   strength between the OSB skins and the PUR foam core as one measure of
   service life and fabrication quality. A total of 120 pull-off tests were
   conducted on panels subjected to various environments. A total of 120
   tests were conducted on new to highly weathered, aged panels. Only 2.5\%
   of these tests displayed partial debonding between the OSB and foam. Of
   the remaining specimens, 77.5\% exhibited shear failure within the foam,
   indicating acceptable bond strength. The remaining 20\% failed within
   the OSB skin. This paper discusses the findings and potential
   implications for service life of OSB skins and PUR foam core.}},

Abstract = {{Background This paper presents the experimental evaluation of three
   commercially available haptic hand-controllers to evaluate which was
   more suitable to the participants.
   Methods Two surgeons and seven engineers performed two peg-in-hole tasks
   with different levels of difficulty. Each operator guided the
   end-effector of a Kuka manipulator that held surgical forceps and was
   equipped with a surgical microscope. Sigma 7, HD2 and PHANToM Premium
   3.0 hand-controllers were compared. Ten measures were adopted to
   evaluate operators' performances with respect to effort, speed and
   accuracy in completing a task, operator improvement during the tests,
   and the force applied by each haptic device.
   Results The best performance was observed with the Premium 3.0; the
   hand-piece was able to be held in a similar way to that used by surgeons
   to hold conventional tools.
   Conclusions Hand-controllers with a linkage structure similar to the
   human upper extremity take advantage of the inherent human brain
   connectome, resulting in improved surgeon performance during
   robotic-assisted surgery. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A finite element model (FEM) was constructed using specialized
   three-dimensional (3D) software to investigate the punching shear
   behavior of interior slab-column connections subjected to a
   moment-to-shear ratio of 0.15 m. The FEM was then verified against the
   experimental results of full-scale interior slab-column connections
   reinforced with glass fiber reinforcement polymer (GFRP) bars previously
   tested by the authors. The FEM results showed that the constructed model
   was able to predict the behavior of the slabs with reasonable accuracy.
   Afterward, the verified model was used to conduct a parametric study to
   investigate the effects of reinforcement ratio, perimeter-to-depth
   ratio, and column aspect ratio on the punching shear behavior of such

Abstract = {{The stochastic attribute of renewable energy sources and the variability
   of energy load is a preeminent barrier to design hybrid renewable energy
   systems. In this paper, a new methodology is advanced to incorporate the
   uncertainties associated with RE resources and load in sizing an HRES in
   the application of buildings with low to high renewable energy ratio
   (RER). Dynamic multi-objective particle swarm optimization (DMOPSO)
   algorithm, simulation module, and sampling average technique are used to
   approximate a Pareto front (PF) for an HRES design through a
   multi-objective optimization framework. The main aim of design is to
   simultaneously minimize total net present cost (NPC), maximize renewable
   energy ratio, and minimize fuel emission while satisfy a desirable level
   of loss of load probability (LLP). The existing randomness in wind
   speed, solar irradiation, ambient temperature, and energy load is
   considered using synthetically data generation and sampling average
   method. The performance of the model has been examined in a building
   located in Canada as the case study, in which RER of the building is
   increased by using renewable energy technologies. The generated PF by
   the stochastic approach is compared to a deterministic PF using
   well-known performance metrics. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is
   carried out where the economic characteristics of the model are varied.

Abstract = {{Energy harvesting in cellular networks is an emerging technique to
   enhance the sustainability of power-constrained wireless devices. This
   paper considers the co-channel deployment of a macrocell overlaid with
   small cells. The small cell base stations (SBSs) harvest energy from
   environmental sources whereas the macrocell base station (MBS) uses
   conventional power supply. Given a stochastic energy arrival process for
   the SBSs, we derive a power control policy for the downlink transmission
   of both MBS and SBSs such that they can achieve their objectives
   {[}e.g., maintain the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR); at
   an acceptable level] on a given transmission channel. We consider a
   centralized energy harvesting mechanism for SBSs, i.e., there is a
   central energy storage (CES) where energy is harvested and then
   distributed to the SBSs. When the number of SBSs is small, the game
   between the CES and the MBS is modeled as a single-controller stochastic
   game and the equilibrium policies are obtained as a solution of a
   quadratic programming problem. However, when the number of SBSs tends to
   infinity (i.e., a highly dense network), the centralized scheme becomes
   infeasible, and therefore, we use a mean field stochastic game to obtain
   a distributed power control policy for each SBS. By solving a system of
   partial differential equations, we derive the power control policy of
   SBSs given the knowledge of mean field distribution and the available
   harvested energy levels in the batteries of the SBSs.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous daily simulation of watershed-derived nutrient and sediment
   loads is required to estimate nearshore water quality in Lake Ontario
   and the impact of watershed beneficial management practices on lake
   water quality. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)
   is used to build watershed models that incorporate detailed information
   about representative land operation activities applicable to
   agricultural watersheds in Southern Ontario. SWAT is calibrated in a
   multi-objective simulation-optimization framework for the Rouge River
   watershed with a relatively high spatial resolution monitoring network.
   These parameters were directly applied to the model for an adjacent
   watershed, Duffins Creek. The model performed satisfactorily in both
   watersheds in terms of water balance and temporal, vertical, and spatial
   redistribution of water. Assessment of the model performance metrics
   shows a good agreement in the frequency distribution of measured and
   simulated water quality constituents. Both watersheds are experiencing
   rapid urbanization, so decision makers in the region may find the
   developed model useful to analyze the impact of future landuse and
   operation changes on watershed-derived sediment and nutrients to be
   delivered into Lake Ontario. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{We investigate highly-disturbed turbulent flows in a square channel with
   V-shaped ribs mounted on one wall. A planar particle image velocimetry
   (PIV) system is used to measure the fully developed turbulent flow at
   the channel midspan and two off-center planes. V-shaped rib
   configurations with three different inclinations (60 degrees, 45 degrees
   and 30 degrees) are studied and compared to the perpendicular (90
   degrees) rib case. The highly-disturbed turbulent flow in the V-shaped
   rib cases are studied by investigating the statistics of first and
   second order moments, including the mean velocity, mean shear, mean
   vorticity and Reynolds stresses. Owing to the geometrical skewness of
   the V-shaped ribs, strong secondary flows are induced which appear in
   the pattern of a pair of streamwise counter-rotating roll cells and have
   a significant impact on the momentum transport process. Near the channel
   midspan of the V-shaped ribs, turbulent intensity is suppressed above
   the ribs but enhanced below the rib height, and turbulent vortical
   motions exhibit isotropic patterns due to the strong disturbances from
   the ribs. The coherent flow structures have been systematically analyzed
   based on studying two-point auto-correlation coefficient, quadrant
   decomposition of Reynolds stresses, swirling strength, and proper
   orthogonal decomposition of the turbulent flow. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{This study developed a kind of magnetic-polymer nanocarrier with folate

   Folate-conjugated, pH-sensitive, amphiphilic poly(beta-aminoester)
   self-assembled with hydrophobic oleic acid-modified iron oxide
   nanoparticles, and the resulting hydrophobic interaction area is a
   reservoir for lipophilic DOX (F-P-DOX). Confocal microscopy illustrated
   that F-P-DOX treatment could keep higher DOX accumulation in cells than
   P-DOX (without folate conjugation), and therefore get a higher
   efficiency of DOX internalization at pH 6.5 than at pH 7.4. Electron
   microscope characterization and real-time polymerase chain reaction
   revealed cell apoptosis promoted by F-P-DOX. The better efficacy of
   F-P-DOX on GC than free DOX and P-DOX was determined by MTT assay and
   xenograft model. Moreover, the accumulation of F-P-DOX in the tumor site

Journal = {{BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{91-97}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{An oedometer was used to measure changes in bulk density of shelled corn
   at different compression pressures and moisture contents. An equivalent
   confining pressure (ECP) was introduced to quantify the compression
   action in grain bins by considering non-uniformity and variability of
   compression pressures. Two models were developed for predicting bulk
   density and bulk modulus, respectively, as functions of ECP and moisture
   content. It was found that the uncompressed bulk density of shelled corn
   (before applying compression pressure) decreased with grain moisture and
   the relationship could be adequately described by a linear equation in
   the moisture range from 12.6 to 17.1\% wb (wet basis). Shelled corn was
   more compressible at higher moisture content. However, bulk density
   approached to the same maximum value as compression pressure increased
   regardless of moisture content. In other words, moisture content had
   little effect on the maximum compressed bulk density. The equivalent
   bulk modulus of shelled corn increased with compression pressure and
   decreased with moisture content. The predicted bulk density and bulk
   modulus values were in good agreement with the experimental data. (C)

Title = {{Performance and emissions of a dual-fuel pilot diesel ignition engine
   operating on various premixed fuels}},
Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{322-336}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A multi-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model coupled
   with chemical kinetics mechanisms was applied to investigate the effect
   of various premixed fuels and equivalence ratios on the combustion,
   performance, and emissions characteristics of a dual-fuel indirect
   injection (IDI) pilot diesel ignition engine. The diesel fuel is
   supplied via indirect injection into the cylinder prior to the end of
   the compression stroke. Various premixed fuels were inducted into the
   engine through the intake manifold. The results showed that the
   dual-fuel case using hydrogen/diesel has a steeper pressure rise rate,
   higher peak heat release rate (PHRR), more advanced ignition timing, and
   shorter ignition delay compared to the natural gas/diesel and
   methanol/diesel dual-fuel cases. For leaner mixtures (Phi(p) < 0.32),
   the hydrogen/diesel case has a higher indicated mean effective pressure
   (IMEP) and indicated thermal efficiency CITE); however, the
   methanol/diesel case has the maximum IMEP and ITE for richer mixtures
   (Phi(p) > 0.32). For instance, with an equivalence ratio of 0.35, the
   ITE is 56.24\% and 60.85\% for hydrogen/diesel and methanol/diesel
   dual-fuel cases, respectively. For an equivalence ratio of 0.15, the
   natural gas/diesel simulation exhibits partial burn combustion and thus
   results in a negative IMEP. At equivalence ratios of 0.15, 0.2, and
   0.25, the methanol/diesel case experiences misfiring phenomenon which
   consequently deteriorates the engine performance considerably. As for
   the engine-out emissions, the hydrogen/diesel results display carbon
   monoxide (CO) free combustion relative to natural gas/diesel and
   methanol/diesel engines; however, considerable amount of nitrogen oxides
   (NOx) emissions are produced at an equivalence ratio of 0.35 which
   exceeds the Euro 6 NOx limit. Due to the larger area exposed to high
   temperature regions and the higher content of oxygen with increased
   methanol, soot and CO emissions are significantly reduced for richer
   premixed methanol mixtures. According to these findings, a dual-fuel
   engine operating on methanol and diesel performs better at rich
   conditions, whereas the performance of hydrogen and diesel is superior
   to that of natural gas/diesel and methanol/diesel mixtures at lean
   conditions. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

Abstract = {{This paper describes how to establish performance charts for selection
   of network parameters for effective utilization of a bilateral
   teleoperated manipulator working under a wireless communication channel.
   The goal is to construct a set of charts that help researchers and
   engineers to select appropriate parameters of wireless network setup for
   a known configuration of environment obstruction. To achieve this goal,
   a teleoperated setup comprising a master haptic device, a slave
   manipulator dynamic simulator, and a communication channel emulated
   using the network simulator version 2 (NS2) simulator is first
   developed. Next, performance indices are defined to evaluate the quality
   of position tracking of the slave manipulator end-effector and force
   tracking of the master haptic. Three indices chosen in this paper are
   the integral of squared position and force errors, the integral of
   absolute position and force error, and the amplitude of position and
   force overshoot. Extensive experiments on the developed setup are then
   conducted to study effects of time-varying packet loss on the
   performance of the teleoperated system. The largest mean packet loss, at
   which the system exhibits satisfactory tracking, is then quantified.
   This packet loss is used as an indicator to define regions representing
   the quality of tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is
   validated by testing a fully instrumented hydraulically actuated system
   under various real wireless channel scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, some tips and tricks for algebraic manipulations are
   utilized to explicitly get the mean and variance of the duration of the
   busy period in a discrete-time finite-buffer vacation queue. Applying
   the law of total expectation, the closed-form expressions for the first
   two moments of the busy period initiated with an arbitrary number of
   customers are firstly derived. Then, by employing the queue length
   distribution at vacation termination and the quantities that mentioned
   above, we give the stochastic decomposition structure of the busy
   period. Finally, in order to ensure the reliability of the analytical
   approach, an effective way to validate the correctness of our results
   along with a numerical example is also provided. We may find that these
   simple tips and tricks can greatly reduce the difficulty of problem

Abstract = {{The shear behaviour of continuous concrete beams reinforced with glass
   fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars without shear reinforcement has not
   been studied yet. However, the current codes and guidelines for
   FRP-reinforced concrete (RC) structures provide shear provisions that
   are applicable to both simple and continuous members. These provisions
   are based on test results of simple beams that do not account for the
   continuity of indeterminate structures. In this paper, the test results
   of large-scale GFRP-RC continuous beams without transverse reinforcement
   are presented. The test variables are the type and ratio of longitudinal
   reinforcement, and concrete strength aiming to evaluate the shear
   strength of such beams. The test results showed that moment and shear
   redistribution occurred. Also, the shear capacity of GFRP-RC continuous
   beams increased as both the longitudinal reinforcement and the concrete
   strength increased. Moreover, it was found that the continuity affected
   the concrete contribution to the shear strength where the ratio of
   experimental-to-predicted shear strength by different codes and
   guidelines was less than that of simply-supported beams.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to identify the range of applicability of

   (AOB) subjected to temperature time gradients through continuous
   titrimetric tests. An innovative online differential titrimetric
   technique was used to continuously monitor the maximum biologic ammonia
   oxidation rate of the biomass selected in a pilot scale membrane
   bioreactor, as a function of temperature time gradients. The monitoring
   technique is based on the measurement of alkalinity and hydrogen
   peroxide consumption rates in two parallel reactors operated in
   nonlimiting substrate conditions for AOB; both reactors were
   continuously fed with mixed liquor and in one of them AOB were inhibited
   with allylthiourea. The effects of temperature decrease rates in the
   range 1 to 4A degrees C center dot h(-1) were evaluated by controlling
   the titrimetric reactor in the temperature range 10A degrees C-20A
   degrees C. The dependence of growth kinetics on temperature time
   gradients and the range of applicability of Arrhenius model for
   temperature dependency of AOB growth kinetics were assessed. The
   Arrhenius model was found to be accurate only with temperature gradients
   lower than 2A degrees C center dot h(-1). The estimated Arrhenius
   coefficients (theta) were shown to increase from 1.07 to 1.6 when the
   temperature decrease rate reached 4A degrees C center dot h(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Multi Compartment Vehicle Routing Problem is an extension of the
   classical Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem where different products
   are transported together in one vehicle with multiple compartments.
   Products are stored in different compartments because they cannot be

   The problem is encountered in many industries such as delivery of food
   and grocery, garbage collection, marine vessels, etc. We propose a
   hybridized algorithm which combines local search with an existent ant
   colony algorithm to solve the problem. Computational experiments are
   performed on new generated benchmark problem instances. An existing ant
   colony algorithm and the proposed hybridized ant colony algorithm are
   compared. It was found that the proposed ant colony algorithm gives
   better results as compared to the existing ant colony algorithm. (C)

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{62-70}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Graphene nanosheets show unique material properties and are highly
   anisotropic in stiffness and strength. These materials are non-continuum
   in micro-structures. The mechanisms of load transfer from outside into
   the inner layers depend on the shear stress in the interphase between
   layers. In this work, the stress distribution in the layers and the
   interphases are investigated by using a modified shear-lag method, and
   the finite element results are also employed for comparison purpose. The
   loads examined include bending and tension. The effect of layer number
   and the equivalent shear modulus of the interphase are studied. The
   simulation results show that the length for saturated stress is around
   20 nm for the case of 10 layers and an interphase shear modulus of 4.2
   GPa. The shear modulus is sensitive to the load sharing efficiency. This
   work also reveals that the saturation length increases with an increase
   in the number of sheets in graphene nanosheets. This length increases
   from 5 nm to 60 nm when the sheet number changes from 5 to 20. The
   stresses are drastically varied and the interlayer shear stresses are
   the highest near the edge where the load is applied. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   The improved Prony algorithm which has the feature of extracting only

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Research has identified several transcription factors that regulate
   activity-dependent plasticity and memory, with cAMP-response element
   binding protein (CREB) being the most well-studied. In neurons, CREB
   activation is influenced by the transcription factor nuclear factor
   kappa B (NF-kappa B), considered central to immunity but more recently
   implicated in memory. The transcription factor early growth response-2
   (Egr-2), an NF-kappa B gene target, is also associated with learning and
   memory. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), an
   antioxidant transcription factor linked to NF-kappa B in pathological
   conditions, has not been studied in normal memory. Given that numerous
   transcription factors implicated in activity-dependent plasticity
   demonstrate connections to NF-KB, this study simultaneously evaluated
   protein levels of NF-kappa B, CREB, Egr-2, Nrf2, and actin in hippocampi
   from young (1 month-old) weanling CD1 mice after training in the Morris
   water maze, a hippocampal-dependent spatial memory task. After a 6-day
   acquisition period, time to locate the hidden platform decreased in the
   Morris water maze. Mice spent more time in the target vs. non-target
   quadrants of the maze, suggestive of recall of the platform location.
   Western blot data revealed a decrease in NF-kappa B p50 protein after
   training relative to controls, whereas NF-kappa B p65, Nrf2 and actin
   increased. Nrf2 levels were correlated with platform crosses in nearly
   all tested animals. These data demonstrate that training in a spatial
   memory task results in alterations in and associations with particular
   transcription factors in the hippocampus, including upregulation of
   NF-kappa B p65 and Nrf2. Training-induced increases in actin protein
   levels caution against its use as a loading control in immunoblot
   studies examining activity dependent plasticity, learning, and memory.}},

Abstract = {{Quasi-static damage in multidirectional polymer composite (PMC)
   laminates developing during manufacturing and quasi-static loading
   degrades the modulus and strength. A model to predict simultaneous
   evolution of quasi-static transverse cracking in multiple plies and its
   effect on modulus of multidirectional PMCs is presented. A 3-D
   variational analysis formulating the in-plane and out-of-plane stresses
   of the plies in occurrence of multiple cracking has been developed to
   work within a lamination theory-based model framework. The stress state
   in the plies is determined using the lamination theory during an
   incremental change in loading. The strain energy, determined using this
   stress state, is compared to strain energy-based failure criteria to
   determine if a ply cracks after the increment. If crack is predicted,
   crack density of the ply is updated and the variational analysis is used
   to determine the perturbation in ply stresses due to cracking. The new
   stress state is used to determine the laminate modulus after cracking
   and the ply stresses for the next increment. This procedure is repeated
   to determine the crack evolution and modulus until reaching the desired
   load. Model predictions compare very well with experimental results for
   a {[}+/-theta(m)/90(n)](s) laminate at two elevated test temperatures of
   80 degrees C and 180 degrees C. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The impact of applying a direct current (DC) field on the morphology and
   structural composition of municipal wastewater flocs and their bound
   water content was investigated. The effects on sludge dewaterability and
   membrane fouling were assessed using batch electro-bioreactors and
   continuous flow submerged membrane electro-bioreactor (SMEBR). Series of
   batch electro-bioreactors were tested at current densities (CD) ranging
   between 5 and 35 A/m(2) for three concentrations of mixed liquor
   suspended solids (from 3000 to 15,000 mg/l) and five electrical exposure
   modes (time-ON/time-OFF). Results of batch tests showed that CD of 15 to
   35 A/m(2) enhanced sludge filterability, represented as specific
   resistance to filtration (SRF), up to 200 Limes compared to sludge in
   the control reactor. Electrically enhanced sludge under continuous flow
   (SMEBR) exhibited a reduction of SRF over the conventional activated
   sludge from 8 to 86 times, while membrane fouling rate decreased by 6
   Limes, It was assumed that the removal of organic materials and soluble
   microbial products (SMP) through electro-coagulation (up to 90\% for
   polysaccharides and up to 50\% for protein), reduction of bound water by
   electroosmosis, increasing floc size through electro-bio-flocculation
   and the reduction of sludge organic/inorganic ratio were the major
   mechanisms contributed to SRF and membrane fouling reduction. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A universal, torque-mixing method for magnetic resonance spectroscopy is

   transverse component of a precessing dipole moment can be measured in
   sensitive broadband spectroscopy, here using a resonant mechanical
   torque sensor. Unlike induction, the torque amplitude allows equilibrium
   magnetic properties to be monitored simultaneously with the spin
   dynamics. Comprehensive electron spin resonance spectra of a
   single-crystal, mesoscopic yttrium iron garnet disk at room temperature
   reveal assisted switching between magnetization states and
   mode-dependent spin resonance interactions with nanoscale surface
   imperfections. The rich detail allows analysis of even complex
   three-dimensional spin textures. The flexibility of
   microelectromechanical and optomechanical devices combined with broad
   generality and capabilities of torque-mixing magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy offers great opportunities for development of integrated

Title = {{Quantitative `Omics Analyses of Medium Chain Length Polyhydroxyalkanaote
   Metabolism in Pseudomonas putida LS46 Cultured with Waste Glycerol and
   Waste Fatty Acids}},
Journal = {{PLoS One}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Transcriptomes and proteomes of Pseudomonas putida LS46 cultured with
   biodiesel-derived waste glycerol or waste free fatty acids, as sole
   carbon sources, were compared under conditions that were either
   permissive or non-permissive for synthesis of medium chain length
   polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHA). The objectives of this study were to
   elucidate mechanisms that influence activation of biopolymer synthesis,
   intra-cellular accumulation, and monomer composition, and determine if
   these were physiologically specific to the carbon sources used for
   growth of P. putida LS46. Active mcl-PHA synthesis by P. putida LS46 was
   associated with high expression levels of key mcl-PHA biosynthesis genes
   and/or gene products including monomer-supplying proteins, PHA
   synthases, and granule-associated proteins. `Omics data suggested that
   expression of these genes were regulated by different genetic mechanisms
   in P. putida LS46 cells in different physiological states, when cultured
   on the two waste carbon sources. Optimal polymer production by P. putida
   LS46 was primarily limited by less efficient glycerol metabolism during
   mcl-PHA synthesis on waste glycerol. Mapping the `Omics data to the
   mcl-PHA biosynthetic pathway revealed significant variations in gene
   expression, primarily involved in: 1) glycerol transportation; 2)
   enzymatic reactions that recycle reducing equivalents and produce key
   mcl-PHA biosynthesis pathway intermediates (e.g. NADH/NADPH,
   acetyl-CoA). Active synthesis of mcl-PHAs was observed during
   exponential phase in cultures with waste free fatty acids, and was
   associated with the fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. A putative
   Thioesterase in the beta-oxidation pathway that may regulate the level
   of fatty acid beta-oxidation intermediates, and thus carbon flux to
   mcl-PHA biosynthesis, was highly up-regulated. Finally, the data
   suggested that differences in expression of selected fatty acid
   metabolism and mcl-PHA monomer-supplying enzymes may play a role in
   determining the monomer composition of mcl-PHA polymers. Understanding
   the relationships between genome content, gene and gene product
   expression, and how these factors influence polymer synthesis, will aid
   in optimization of mcl-PHA production by P. putida LS46 using biodiesel
   waste streams.}},

   network white matter tracts: an fMRI-guided diffusion tensor imaging and
   tractography study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a powerful MRI technique that can be
   used to estimate both the microstructural integrity and the trajectories
   of white matter pathways throughout the central nervous system. This
   fiber tracking (aka, ``tractography{''}) approach is often carried out
   using anatomically-defined seed points to identify white matter tracts
   that pass through one or more structures, but can also be performed
   using functionally-defined regions of interest (ROIs) that have been
   determined using functional MRI (fMRI) or other methods. In this study,
   we performed fMRI-guided DTI tractography between all of the previously
   defined nodes within each of six common resting-state brain networks,
   including the: dorsal Default Mode Network (dDMN), ventral Default Mode
   Network (vDMN), left Executive Control Network (IECN), right Executive
   Control Network (rECN), anterior Salience Network (aSN), and posterior
   Salience Network (pSN). By normalizing the data from 32 healthy control
   subjects to a standard template using high dimensional, non-linear
   warping methods we were able to create probabilistic white matter
   atlases for each tract in stereotaxic coordinates. By investigating all
   198 ROI-to-ROI combinations within the aforementioned resting-state
   networks (for a total of 6336 independent DTI tractography analyses),
   the resulting probabilistic atlases represent a comprehensive cohort of
   functionally defined white matter regions that can be used in future
   brain imaging studies to: (1) ascribe DTI or other white matter changes
   to particular functional brain networks, and (2) compliment resting
   state fMRI or other functional connectivity analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional turbulent offset jets were investigated using a
   particle image velocimetry technique. Detailed measurements were
   performed for offset height ratios of 0, 2 and 4. The presence of
   backflow influenced the distribution of the mean velocity and Reynolds
   stresses. A two-point correlation analysis was used to investigate the
   spatial distribution of large-scale structures within the inner shear
   layer of the flow domain. The results revealed that large-scale
   structures dominate the inner layer of the self-similarity region.
   Proper orthogonal decomposition was performed on the fluctuating
   velocity field within the symmetry and lateral planes using the snapshot
   approach. Results from the reconstructed field provided insight into the
   contributions of the most energetic structures to the turbulence
   statistics. The energetic structures contributed more to the Reynolds
   shear stress and streamwise turbulence intensity, while contributing
   less to the wall-normal turbulence intensity.}},

Abstract = {{The exact relationship between the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) method of
   moments (MoM) and the locally corrected Nystrom (LCN) method for the
   mixed-potential (MP) electric field integral equation (EFIE) is
   presented as an extension to our work where we established analogous
   exact relationship for solving the EFIE in its vector-potential (VP)
   form. It is shown that in order to achieve one such relationship for the
   MP EFIE, the first-and zeroth-order LCN methods must be, respectively,
   used for the discretization of the VP and scalar-potential terms of the
   MP EFIE. The resulting numerical scheme is a point-based RWG MoM
   discretization of the MP EFIE via the Nystrm method. Due to the MP
   formulation of the EFIE, the proposed method establishes notably higher
   accuracy compared to either RWG MoM or LCN discretizations of the EFIE
   in the VP form. The increased accuracy is attributed to the analytical
   cancellation of the line charge contributions in the MP formulation as
   opposed to numerical cancellation inherent in the VP formulation of the
   EFIE. The detailed study and explanations of the above cancellations is
   presented along with their impact on the accuracy of the respective
   schemes for both canonical and realistic scattering targets at different
   frequencies.}},

Title = {{Grain bin monitoring via electromagnetic imaging}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{133-141}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Stored grain monitoring is an important post-harvest stage of the food
   production chain. Grains are usually stored in large metal containers
   referred to as bins or silos. During storage, there is a possibility for
   grain to spoil and become unusable. Therefore, monitoring of grain bins
   is essential to detect conditions leading to spoilage within the bin.
   Most current grain bin monitoring techniques lack sensitivity as they
   require conditions leading to spoilage to surpass a certain limit before
   detection is possible, and consequently a large amount of stored grain
   is lost during monitored storage. This paper presents the advances in
   developing a novel grain-monitoring technique using electromagnetic
   imaging, a modality that can provide global, quantitative images of
   grain properties throughout the bin. Side-mounted antennas illuminate
   the contents of the bin and a set of receivers measures the
   electromagnetic energy within the bin at discrete locations. Using these
   measurements an optimization algorithm attempts to reconstruct the
   contents of the bin - herein a finite-element contrast source inversion
   (FEM-CSI) algorithm was used. The result is a global map of the
   electrical properties of the grain throughout the bin. In this work we
   first present a synthetic validation of the proposed method for a model
   of a full scale hopper bin using simulations to produce the
   electromagnetic field data. Next, a scaled experimental system was used
   to collect data from grain that contained regions of induced
   contamination. This data was used to produce images that show the
   applicability of the method in practice. Results suggest that this
   technology has potential to provide farmers with a reliable and robust
   method to remotely monitor stored grain, preserving stored food
   resources and increasing their revenue. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Non-uniform system response detection for hyperspectral imaging systems}},
Journal = {{INFRARED PHYSICS \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{263-268}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Near infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has established itself
   as a powerful non-destructive tool for the chemical analysis of
   heterogeneous samples. However, one of the main disadvantages of NIR HSI
   is that the technique suffers from instrumentation-related problems,
   which in turn affect the acquired images. In general, focal plane array
   (FPA) based hyperspectral systems are affected by spatial and spectral
   non-uniform response, the presence of defective sensors (e.g. dead or
   saturated sensors), and temporal and spatial (e.g. dark current) noise.
   Another issue is each new camera system needs to be calibrated to assess
   its specific responses to light. To correct for these issues, we used
   known standards to measure the response of the sensors and capture the
   location of the field of view and defective sensors using linear and
   quadratic models. The parameters of these models were then used as input
   features for classification of sensor responses using a k-means
   algorithm. The results conclude that linear models are insufficiently
   precise for calibration but estimate sufficiently accurately the
   system's response and functionality. Specifically, it was shown that the
   classification method discriminates non-responsive regions effectively.

Abstract = {{Turbulent flow over a matrix of wall-mounted cubic obstacles along with
   continuous release of a passive scalar from a ground-level point source

   The cubes are fully submerged in a modeled urban atmospheric boundary

   been proposed to reproduce the high turbulence level of the approaching
   flow based on generation of grid turbulence. Coherent flow structures
   induced by the cubes and their influences on dispersion of the
   concentration plume in the context of the highly disturbed flow are also
   investigated. The spatial evolution and temporal cascades of the kinetic
   and scalar energies have been examined in terms of their transport
   equations and resolved spectra. In order to validate the LES approach,
   numerical predictions of turbulence statistics for both velocity and

   Effect of environmental conditions}},
Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{62-73}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Most of codes and guidelines for glass fiber reinforced polymers (GFRP)
   - Reinforced Concrete (RC) are based on modifying corresponding
   formulas, originally developed for steel bars, taking into account the
   differences in properties and behavior between FRP and steel. The main
   objective of this research is to investigate the effect of cyclic
   environments on early-age cracking of GFRP-RC bridge deck slabs
   experimentally. Two full-scale (measuring 2500-mm long x 765-mm wide x
   180-mm thick) cast-in-place slabs reinforced with similar amounts of
   reinforcement ratio of 0.7\% with GFRP and steel bars, respectively,
   were tested in adiabatic laboratory conditions as control specimens. In
   comparison, two other GFRP-RC deck slabs were tested under freezing
   thawing and wetting drying conditions. The test results are presented in
   terms of materials degradation, cracking pattern, crack width, and
   spacing, and strains in reinforcement and concrete. Test results
   indicate that the minimum reinforcement ratio (0.7\%) recommended by the
   Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code 2006 (CHBDC 2006) for bridge deck
   slabs reinforced with GFRP bars satisfied the serviceability
   requirements after being subjected to the simulated cyclic exposures.

Title = {{Construction of Markov chains for discrete time MAP/PH/K queues}},
Journal = {{PERFORMANCE EVALUATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{17-26}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Two GI/M/1 type Markov chains associated with the queue length are often
   used in analyzing the discrete time MAP/PH/K queue. The first Markov
   chain is introduced by tracking service phases for servers; a method we
   call TPFS. The transition probability matrix of the Markov chain can be
   constructed in a straightforward manner. The second Markov chain is
   introduced by counting servers for phases; which we call CSFP. An
   algorithm is developed for the construction of the transition
   probability matrix of the second Markov chain, which is the main
   contribution of this paper. Whereas the construction of the matrices for
   the case of continuous time is available in the literature, it is not
   available for the discrete time case. The effort in constructing the
   matrices for the discrete time case is extensively more involved than
   for the continuous time case. Some basic properties of the constructed
   transition blocks are shown. We demonstrate that for queueing systems
   with a large number of servers and many service phases, there is a
   considerable saving in the matrix sizes. For example, when those values
   are 30 and 2, respectively, the block size for TPFS is more than 3 x
   10(7) times that of CSFP; a major saving. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of
   slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW) in reducing pathogens on pure
   cultures and on cotton fabric surfaces in the presence of organic matter
   and estimate its efficacy in comparison with povidone iodine solution
   for reducing pathogenic microorganisms on internal surfaces of layer
   houses. Pure cultures of E. coli, S. enteritidis, and S. aureus and
   cotton fabric surfaces inoculated with these strains were treated with
   SAEW in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA). In the absence of
   BSA, complete inactivation of all strains in pure cultures and on cotton
   fabric surfaces was observed after 2.5 and 5 min treatment with SAEW at
   40 mg/L of available chlorine concentration (ACC), respectively. The
   bactericidal effficiency of SAEW increased with increasing ACC, but
   decreased with increasing BSA concentration. Then, the surfaces of the
   layer houses were sprayed with SAEW at 60, 80, and 100 mg/L of ACC and
   povidone iodine using the automated disinfection system at a rate of 110
   mL/m(2), respectively. Samples from the floor, wall, feed trough, and
   egg conveyor belt surfaces were collected with sterile cotton swabs
   before and after spraying disinfection. Compared to tap water, SAEW and
   povidone iodine significantly reduced microbial populations on each
   surface of the layer houses. SAEW with 80 or 100 mg/L of ACC showed
   significantly higher efficacy than povidone iodine for total aerobic
   bacteria, staphylococci, coliforms, or yeasts and moulds on the floor
   and feed trough surfaces (P < 0.05). SAEW was more effective than
   povidone iodine at reducing total aerobic bacteria, coliforms, and
   yeasts and moulds on the wall surface. Additionally, SAEW had similar
   bactericidal activity with povidone iodine on the surface of the egg
   conveyor belt. Results suggest that SAEW exerts a higher or equivalent
   bactericidal efficiency for the surfaces compared to povidone iodine,
   and it may be used as an effective alternative for reducing microbial
   contamination on surfaces in layer houses.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper was to identify which parameters influence the
   micromotion at the head-neck taper interface of modular hip prostheses.
   Finite element analysis was performed where 3D models of the head-neck
   taper interface were subjected to an assembly force, 3300 N of
   compression, and 100 N of tension. The micromotion increased as the head
   size, assembly force, and taper size increased. The micromotion also
   increased when a mixed alloy material combination (CoCr head and Ti6Al4V
   neck) was used instead of all CoCr alloy prosthesis and when the center
   of the femoral head was in a more superior position relative to the
   center of the neck taper. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Using the stress strain response data obtained from an experimental
   investigation carried out by the first author (Polyzois, 2014), a finite
   element model was developed in Matlab and explicit FEA software ANSYS
   and LSDYNA to simulate Adiabatic Shear Band (ASB) formation in AISI 4340
   steel on the microstructural level under high strain rate impact. This
   FEA model uses the Voronoi Tessellation to generate geometry simulating
   the microstructure of heat treated AISI 4340 steel in a 2D axi-symmetric
   cross-section based on the prior austenite grain size and 2D geometric
   orientation of martensitic lath blocks. It also incorporates the
   microstructural material inhomogeneity between the grains and the grain
   boundaries. The model was discretized using the meshless Smooth Particle
   Hydrodynamics (SPH) method and utilizes the Johnson-Cook plasticity
   model parameters for various heat treatments of the steel as well as a
   rupture failure criterion. The model provides a good representation of
   the kinematics of ASB formation based on grain refinement showing a
   progressive reorientation and elongation of the grains in the direction
   of shear in 2D. Severe strain localization and ASB formation were shown
   to nucleate at the grain boundaries of the elongated grains, creating
   micro-voids, which grew and propagated as micro-cracks through the
   grains, separating them into smaller sizes. Under continued deformation,
   the grains continued to elongate and refine. Final refined grain size
   within the band is represented by the size of the smallest cluster of
   intact SPH particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a simulation-based meta-heuristic approach that determines
   the optimal size of a hybrid renewable energy system for residential
   buildings. This multi-objective optimization problem requires the
   advancement of a dynamic multi-objective particle swarm optimization
   algorithm that maximizes the renewable energy ratio of buildings and
   minimizes total net present cost and CO2 emission for required system
   changes. Three proven performance metrics evaluate the quality of the
   Pareto front generated by the proposed approach. The obtained results
   are compared against two reported multi-objective optimization
   algorithms in the related literature. Finally, an existing residential
   apartment located in a cold Canadian climate provides a test case to
   apply the proposed model and optimally size a hybrid renewable energy
   system. In this test application, the model investigates the potential
   use of a heat pump, a biomass boiler, wind turbines, solar heat
   collectors, photovoltaic panels, and a heat storage tank to produce
   renewable energy for the building. Furthermore, the utilization of
   plug-in electric vehicles for transportation reduces gasoline use where
   all power is generated by the building, and the utility provides the
   means to match intermittent renewable generation from solar and wind to
   the building electrical loads. Model results show that under the chosen
   meteorological conditions and building parameters a wind turbine, and
   plug-in electric vehicle technologies are consistently the optimal
   option to achieve a target renewable energy ratio. In particular, the
   optimization result shows that the renewable energy ratio can achieve
   near 100\% by installing a 73 kW wind turbine, a 200 kW biomass boiler,
   and using plug-in electric vehicles. This option has a net present cost
   of C\$705,180 and results in total CO2 emission of 2.4 ton/year.
   Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the impact
   of economic constants on net present cost of the obtained non-dominated
   solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, direct numerical simulation is performed to investigate a
   pulsatile flow in a constricted channel to gain physical insights into
   laminar-turbulent-laminar flow transitions. An in-house computer code is
   used to conduct numerical simulations based on available
   high-performance shared memory parallel computing facilities. The
   Womersley number tested is fixed to 10.5 and the Reynolds number varies
   from 500 to 2000. The influences of the degree of stenosis and pulsatile
   conditions on flow transitions and structures are investigated. In the
   region upstream of the stenosis, the flow pattern is primarily laminar.
   Immediately after the stenosis, the flow recirculates under an adverse
   streamwise pressure gradient, and the flow pattern transitions from
   laminar to turbulent. In the region far downstream of the stenosis, the
   flow becomes re-laminarised. The physical characteristics of the flow
   field have been thoroughly analysed in terms of the mean streamwise
   velocity, turbulence kinetic energy, viscous wall shear stresses, wall
   pressure and turbulence kinetic energy spectra.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Digital media and gaming have received considerable interest
   from researchers and clinicians as a model for learning a broad range of
   complex tasks and facilitating the transfer of skills to daily life.
   These emerging rehabilitation technologies have the potential to improve
   clinical outcomes and patient participation because they are engaging,
   motivating, and accessible. Our research goal is to develop preventative
   and therapeutic point-of-care eHealth applications that will lead to
   equivalent or better long-term health outcomes and health care costs
   than existing programs. We have produced a novel computer-aided
   tele-rehabilitation platform that combines computer game-based exercises
   with tele-monitoring.
   Objective: Compare the therapeutic effectiveness of an in-home,
   game-based rehabilitation program (GRP) to standard care delivered in an
   outpatient physical therapy clinic on measures of balance, gaze control,
   dizziness, and health-related quality of life.
   Methods: A randomized, controlled, single-blind pilot trial will be
   conducted. Fifty-six participants with a diagnosis of peripheral
   vestibular disorder will be randomly assigned to either usual physical
   therapy (comparator group) or to a game-based intervention (experimental
   group). Measures to be assessed will include gaze control, dynamic
   balance, and self-reported measures of dizziness.
   Results: The project was funded and enrollment was started in August
   2014. To date, 36 participants have been enrolled. There have been 6
   drop-outs. It is expected that the study will be completed January 2016
   and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in
   Spring of 2016.
   Conclusions: A successful application of this rehabilitation program
   would help streamline rehabilitation services, leverage therapist time
   spent with clients, and permit regular practice times at the client's
   convenience.}},

Abstract = {{An electronic nose (e-nose) was used to characterize sesame oils
   processed by three different methods (hot-pressed, cold-pressed, and
   refined), as well as blends of the sesame oils and soybean oil. Seven
   classification and prediction methods, namely PCA, LDA, PLS, KNN, SVM,
   LASSO and RF, were used to analyze the e-nose data. The classification
   accuracy and MAUC were employed to evaluate the performance of these
   methods. The results indicated that sesame oils processed with different
   methods resulted in different sensor responses, with cold-pressed sesame
   oil producing the strongest sensor signals, followed by the hot-pressed
   sesame oil. The blends of pressed sesame oils with refined sesame oil
   were more difficult to be distinguished than the blends of pressed
   sesame oils and refined soybean oil. LDA, KNN, and SVM outperformed the
   other classification methods in distinguishing sesame oil blends. KNN,
   LASSO, PLS, and SVM (with linear kernel), and RF models could adequately
   predict the adulteration level (\% of added soybean oil) in the sesame
   oil blends. Among the prediction models, KNN with k = 1 and 2 yielded
   the best prediction results.}},

Abstract = {{The dispersion and mixing of passive scalars released from two
   near-ground point sources into an open-channel flow are studied using
   direct numerical simulation. A comparative study based on eight test
   cases has been conducted to investigate the effects of Reynolds number
   and source separation distance on the dispersion and interference of the
   two plumes. In order to determine the nonlinear relationship between the
   variance of concentration fluctuations of the total plume and those
   produced by each of the two plumes, the covariance of the two
   concentration fields is studied in both physical and spectral spaces.
   The results show that at the source height, the streamwise evolution of
   the cross correlation between the fluctuating components of the two
   concentration fields can be classified into four stages, which feature
   zero, destructive and constructive interferences and a complete mixing
   state. The characteristics of these four stages of plume mixing are
   further confirmed through an analysis of the pre-multiplied co-spectra
   and coherency spectra. From the coherency spectrum, it is observed that
   there exists a range of `leading scales', which are several times larger
   than the Kolmogorov scale but are smaller than or comparable to the
   scale of the most energetic eddies of turbulence. At the leading scales,
   the mixing between the two interfering plumes is the fastest and the
   coherency spectrum associated with these scales can quickly approach its
   asymptotic value of unity. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{Riverbank erosion on the Red River in Winnipeg, Manitoba has raised
   concerns over the last 20 years and more. Although several recent
   studies have shown that fluvial erosion can reduce riverbank stability
   and promote geotechnical slope failure, there are too few that have
   focused on this phenomenon. The present study includes field
   measurements, experimental testing, and numerical modelling to quantify
   fluvial erosion through a 10 km reach of the Red River. Results have
   shown that seasonal freeze-thaw processes can dramatically reduce the
   critical shear stress and increase erodibility of the riverbanks.
   Moreover, a simple method has been employed using hydrodynamic numerical
   models to define the applied shear stresses on the river banks based on
   the river water level, which will be useful for further research and
   design purposes. The TEMP/W numerical model was used to define seasonal
   frost depth to estimate freeze-thaw effects. Finally all field
   measurements, experimental and numerical models results were used to
   predict annual fluvial erosion through this reach of the river. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Developing efficient backhauling solutions for small cells is considered
   as one of the most significant challenges in the rollout of the upcoming
   5G cellular systems where massive numbers of small cells will be
   deployed. In this article, we first review small cell evolutions and the
   consequent radio access network architecture evolution toward
   heterogeneity and centralized baseband processing. The backhaul
   solution, which is mainly determined by the availability of existing
   backhaul infrastructures and service demand, will lead to a
   heterogeneous backhaul network architecture. Radio resource management
   issues including cell association, and interference management and
   scheduling with inter-node coordination, as well as how they are related
   to backhaul solutions are discussed. Based on the existing RRM solutions
   and their limitations in multi-tier 5G systems with heterogeneous
   backhaul network architecture, backhaul-aware RRM strategies are
   envisioned. Results from a simple case study of joint cell association
   and bandwidth allocation with a massive MIMO-based in-band wireless
   backhauling framework are presented to demonstrate the performance gain
   with backhaul-aware RRM in a multi-tier cellular RAN. Several related
   open research issues are highlighted, and possible solution approaches
   are briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying cellular
   network is a promising concept to improve user experience and resource
   utilization. Unlike traditional D2D communication, where two mobile
   devices in the proximity establish a direct local link bypassing the
   base station, in this work, we focus on relay-aided D2D communication.
   Relay-aided transmission could enhance the performance of D2D
   communication when D2D user equipments (UEs) are far apart from each
   other and/or the quality of D2D link is not good enough for direct
   communication. Considering the uncertainties in wireless links, we model
   and analyze the performance of a relay-aided D2D communication network,
   where the relay nodes serve both the cellular and D2D users. In
   particular, we formulate the radio resource allocation problem in a
   two-hop network to guarantee the data rate of the UEs while protecting
   other receiving nodes from interference. Utilizing time sharing
   strategy, we provide a centralized solution under bounded channel
   uncertainty. With a view to reducing the computational burden at relay
   nodes, we propose a distributed solution approach using stable matching
   to allocate radio resources in an efficient and computationally
   inexpensive way. Numerical results show that the performance of the
   proposed method is close to the centralized optimal solution and there
   is a distance margin beyond which relaying of D2D traffic improves
   network performance.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we study radio resource allocation for multicasting in
   OFDMA based high altitude platforms (HAPs). We formulate and solve an
   optimization problem that finds the best allocation of HAP resources
   such as radio power, subchannels, and time slots. The problem also finds
   the best possible frequency reuse across the cells that constitute the
   service area of the HAP. The objective is to maximize the number of user
   terminals that receive the requested multicast streams in the HAP
   service area in a given OFDMA frame. A bounding subroutine in a branch
   and bound algorithm can be obtained by decomposing it into two easier
   subproblems, due to its high complexity, and solving them iteratively.
   Subproblem1 turns out to be a binary integer linear program of no
   explicitly noticeable structure and therefore Lagrangian relaxation is
   used to dualize some constraints to get a structure that is easy to
   solve. Subproblem 2 turns out to be a linear program with a continuous
   knapsack problem structure. Hence a greedy algorithm is proposed to
   solve subproblem 2 to optimality. The subgradient method is used to
   solve for the dual variables in the dual problem to get the tightest
   bounds.}},

Abstract = {{The phase out of methyl bromide for the treatment of structures where
   grain is milled or processed has triggered a need to evaluate the
   effectiveness of alternative structural treatments such as sulfuryl
   fluoride and heat. Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (red flour beetle) and
   Tribolium confusum Jacquelin du Val (confused flour beetle) (Coleoptera:
   Tenebrionidae) are primary targets for structural treatments, and impact
   of treatments on these species was evaluated in this study. Efficacy was
   measured by comparing beetle captures in pheromone- and kairomone-baited
   traps immediately before and immediately after treatments. Studies were
   conducted primarily in commercial wheat mills and rice mills, with the
   treatments conducted by commercial applicators. A meta-analysis approach
   was used to evaluate efficacy data collected from 111 treatments applied
   in 39 facilities. Findings confirm that structural fumigations and heat
   treatments greatly reduce pest populations within food facilities, but
   there was significant variation in the efficacy of individual
   treatments. Generally, the different treatment types (sulfuryl fluoride,
   methyl bromide, and heat) provided similar reductions in beetle capture
   using multiple metrics of beetle activity. The novel application of
   meta-analysis to structural treatment efficacy assessment generated a
   robust estimate of overall treatment efficacy, provided insights into
   factors potentially impacting efficacy, and identified data gaps that
   need further research.}},

Abstract = {{The minimum temperature at which stored-product insects can move inside

   shaken), and minimum movement (TMmin, caught in probe pitfall traps)
   temperatures were determined at stepped-decrease of temperature. The
   ranges of SMh, CCT, and TMmin temperatures of the four stored-products
   beetles were 4.0 to 9.0A degrees C, 2.0 to 8.0A degrees C, and 6.0 to

Journal = {{BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{59-64}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Needle-free injection devices improve vaccinator safety and optimise
   vaccine delivery time by eliminating the use of needles involved with
   traditional vaccination techniques. Of significant importance is a full
   understanding of the relationships that exist between the injection
   properties and the depth and shape of the injectate's dispersion. Work
   has been done to characterise the distribution of human needle-free
   injection devices, but little research has been conducted on livestock
   injections, which operate at much higher pressures and volumes.
   Therefore, the aim of this research was to characterise the injection
   profile of a livestock needle-free injection device while varying the
   injection pressure and fluid volume and density. Water and porcine
   circovirus vaccine were injected into ballistic gelatin blocks and the
   injection mechanism was captured using high-speed photography. The
   volume was varied between 1.0 and 2.5 ml and orifice pressure between 40
   and 220 MPa. It was found that pressure influenced the depth of
   penetration, but had little effect on the shape of the injection
   profile. In contrast, the volume and density increased the penetration
   depth and varied the dispersion pattern. These results can be used to
   better understand how the injection profile of a needle-free injection
   device changes given an initial set of parameters. This will be
   important for developing administration protocols that successfully
   deliver intradermal, subcutaneous, and intramuscular livestock
   injections. (C) 2015 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Sideways fall-induced hip fracture is a major worldwide
   health problem among the elderly population. However, all existing
   biomechanical models for predicting hip fracture mainly consider the
   femur related parameters. Their accuracy is limited as hip fracture is
   significantly affected by loading conditions as well. The objective of
   this study was to develop a biomechanical model for improving assessment
   of hip fracture risk by subject-specific prediction of fall-induced
   loading conditions.
   Method: All information required to construct the models was extracted
   from the subject's whole-body and hip medical image in order to make the
   models subject-specific. Fall-induced hip fracture risk for eighty
   clinical cases was calculated under two sets of loading conditions:
   subject-specific determined by the proposed model, and
   non-subject-specific obtained from empirical functions. The predicted
   hip fracture risk indices were then compared with clinical observations.
   Findings: It was found that the subject-specific prediction of
   fall-induced loading conditions significantly improves the hip fracture
   risk assessment. Consistent to the clinical observations, the fracture
   risk predicted by the proposed model suggested that obesity is a
   protective factor for hip fracture and underweight subjects are more
   likely to experience a hip fracture.
   Interpretations: This study shows that hip fracture risk is affected by
   a number of factors, including body weight, body height, impact force,
   body mass index, hip soft tissue thickness, and bone quality. The
   proposed model provides a comprehensive, fast, accurate, and
   non-expensive method for prediction of hip fracture risk which should
   lead to more effective prevention of hip fractures. (C) 2015 Published

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a parallel multimodal optimization algorithm that is
   combined with electromagnetic transient simulation in a platform that
   unifies the setup, test, and execution of optimal designs for power
   systems. The algorithm speeds up the design of power systems as its
   computations can be executed independently on a highly parallelized
   environment. Additional speedup is achieved by using a surrogate model
   to estimate the objective function in regions of suspected local optima.
   The estimated functions can be used in the subsequent stages of
   postoptimization studies, such as sensitivity analyses. Comparative
   studies, in terms of computation time, are conducted against sequential
   execution of the proposed algorithm. The optimal design of a VSC-HVDC
   transmission is described to demonstrate the capabilities of the
   proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an assessment of the operational system used by the
   Meteorological Service of Canada for producing near-real-time
   precipitation analyses over North America. The Canadian Precipitation
   Analysis (CaPA) system optimally combines available surface observations
   with numerical weather prediction (NWP) output in order to produce
   estimates of precipitation on a 15-km grid at each synoptic hour (0000,
   0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC). The validation protocol used to assess the
   quality of the CaPA has demonstrated the usefulness of the system for
   producing reliable estimates of precipitation over Canada, even in areas
   with few or no weather stations. The CaPA is found to be better in
   autumn, spring, and winter than in summer. This is because of the
   difficulty in correctly producing convective precipitation in the NWP
   because of the low spatial resolution of the meteorological model. An
   investigation of the quality of the precipitation analyses in the 15
   terrestrial ecozones of Canada indicates the need to have a sufficient
   number of observations (at least similar to 1.17 stations per 10 000
   km(2)) in order to produce a precipitation analysis that is
   significantly better than the raw NWP product. Improvements of the CaPA
   system by including provincial networks as well as radar and satellite
   information are expected in the future.}},

Abstract = {{A persistent challenge in tissue engineering is the fabrication of
   manipulatable scaffolds for implantation in clinical treatments and use
   in disease models for drug screening. Electrospinning of nanofibrous
   membranes is an emerging technology in artificial extracellular matrix
   (ECM) design that can offer precisely tunable microenvironments upon
   assembly into three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds that mimic the in vivo
   ECM structure. In this study, we report a facile and versatile strategy
   for preparing 3D multilayered constructs from Fe3O4/polycaprolactone
   (PCL)/gelatin nanofibrous membranes. This method combines membrane
   assembly with noncontact magnetic force to preserve the mechanical
   integrity and interconnectivity of the 3D scaffolds. An ordered layer
   structure can be achieved using a magnetic control technique through the
   addition of magnetic nanoparticles into the PCL/gelatin nanofibers. We
   first verified the magnetic properties and structures of magnetic
   nanofibers according to X-ray diffraction, hysteresis, scanning electron
   microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. We tested the
   potential toxicity and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem
   cells seeded on the layered scaffolds. To add further functionality to
   the scaffolds, the membranes were coated with silver nanoparticles and
   shown to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus
   aureus, which are responsible for most cases of infection-related
   implant failure. Finally, we tested the utility of magnetic membranes
   implanted in an animal model as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance
   imaging. Scaffolds formed using the presented magnetically guided
   fabrication strategy have the potential to mimic the structure and
   function of human tissues and also may be applied in disease models to
   study cell-cell interactions.}},

Abstract = {{We use stochastic geometry to develop a comprehensive modeling framework
   for K-tier uplink cellular networks with RF energy harvesting from the
   concurrent cellular transmissions. In the considered system model,
   channel inversion power control is used and cellular users are equipped
   with energy storage units. We also use tools from queueing theory,
   namely, Markov chain analysis, to model the level of stored energy in
   each user's battery. A successful transmission is assumed only when the
   amount of energy stored in a user's battery is sufficient to perform
   channel inversion with a received signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)
   above a predefined threshold. The performance of the proposed system
   model is evaluated in terms of the transmission probability, the SIR
   coverage probability, and the overall success probability. Using Poisson
   point processes (PPPs) enables us to derive simple expressions for these
   performance metrics in order to obtain insights for network design and
   optimization. We show the effect of varying the different network
   parameters such as the spatial density of BSs and the receiver
   sensitivity. In addition, we discuss several special cases and provide
   guidelines on the extensions of the proposed framework. We show that the
   gain of using RF energy harvesting can be highly improved by a proper
   choice of the network design parameters.}},

Abstract = {{While LEO and GEO are used for most satellite missions, Highly
   Elliptical Orbits (HEOs) are also used for satellite missions covering
   Polar Regions of Earth. Satellites in HEO are exposed to a relatively
   harsher radiation environment than LEO and GEO. The mass of
   traditionally used aluminum radiation shield, required to attenuate the
   radiation to a level below a certain threshold that is safe for the
   satellite bus and payload, scales with the level of radiation. It has
   been shown (Emmanuel et al., 2014) that materials with low atomic number
   (Z) such as polyethylene (PE) can result in a lighter shield than
   aluminum (Al) in HEO. However, PE has to be reinforced with relatively
   high Z fibers such as graphite (G) to improve its mechanical properties.
   The effect of introduction of G and the resulting composite structure
   (that meets the requirements on mechanical properties, manufacturing and
   service) on the radiation shielding effectiveness of PE was studied
   through simulation using a layered PE-G composite. The Total Ionization
   Dose (TID), deposited in a silicon detector behind the composite shield,
   has been found to be function of layer volume fraction, layer thickness
   and stacking sequence of the PE and G layers. One composite
   configuration has resulted in a TID lower than that for PE,
   demonstrating the possibility of tailoring the mechanical properties of
   PE-based composite radiation shield with minimal negative impact on its
   radiation shielding effectiveness. (C) 2015 COSPAR. Published by

Abstract = {{Sleep stage detection is needed in many sleep studies and clinical
   assessments. Generally, sleep stages are identified using spectral
   analysis of electrocephologram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) signals.
   This study, for the first time, has investigated the feasibility of
   detecting sleep stages using tracheal breathing sounds, and whether the
   change of breathing sounds due to sleeping stage differs at different
   periods of sleeping time; the motivation was seeking an alternative
   technique for sleep stage identification. The tracheal breathing sounds
   of 12 individuals, who were referred for full overnight polysomnography
   (PSG) assessment, were recorded using a microphone placed over the
   suprasternal notch, and analyzed using higher order statistical
   analysis. Five noise-and-snore-free breathing cycles from wakefulness,
   REM and Stage II of sleep were selected from each subject for analysis.
   Data of the REM and Stage II were selected from beginning, middle and
   close to end of sleeping time. Hurst exponent was calculated from the
   bispectra of the inspiratory sounds of each subject at each sleeping
   stage in different periods of sleeping time. The participants' sleep
   stage were determined by sleep lab technologists during the PSG study
   using EEG and EOG signals. The results show separate and non-overlapping
   clusters for wakefulness, REM and Stage II for each subject. Thus, using
   a simple linear classifier, we were able to classify REM and Stage II of
   each subject with 100\% accuracy. In addition, the results show that the
   same pattern existed as long as the REM and Stage II segments were close
   (less than 3 h) to each other in terms of time.}},

Abstract = {{Bubble dynamics near a perforated plate in a vertical cylinder is
   investigated using a combined boundary element-finite difference method.
   First, we determined the critical cylinder diameter for which the
   cylinder wall would not affect the bubble dynamics. Then for the case
   without cylinder wall effect, the effects of plate hole size and the
   bubble-hole distance were studied. Finally, the simultaneous effect of
   plate hole and cylinder diameter on the bubble behavior was evaluated.
   It was found that, for normalized bubble-hole distances H' <= 0.8, there
   is only a liquid jet from the bottom surface of the bubble directing
   away from the hole, which becomes stronger as the normalized hole size
   d' is decreased. For H' >= 1.8, there is only a liquid jet from the top
   surface of the bubble directing toward the hole, which becomes stronger
   as the hole size d' is decreased. For 0.8 < H' < 1.8, there are two
   liquid jets from both the top and the bottom surface of the bubble,
   which depending on the bubble-hole distance, one of these jets becomes
   stronger as the hole size is decreased. In addition, smaller cylinder
   diameter would prolong the lifetime of the bubble. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Recrystallization is one of the most important physical phenomena in
   condensed matter that has been utilized for materials processing for
   thousands of years in human history. It is generally believed that
   recrystallization is thermally activated and a minimum temperature must
   be achieved for the necessary atomic mechanisms to occur. Here, using
   atomistic simulations, we report a new mechanism of dynamic
   recrystallization that can operate at temperature as low as T = 10 K in
   metals during deformation. In contrast to previously proposed
   dislocation-based models, this mechanism relies on the generation of
   disclination quadrupoles, which are special defects that form during
   deformation when the grain boundary migration is restricted by
   structural defects such as triple junctions, cracks or obstacles. This
   mechanism offers an alternative explanation for the grain refinement in
   metals during severe plastic deformation at cryogenic temperature and
   may suggest a new method to tailor the microstructure in general

Abstract = {{A model to predict time-dependent evolution of simultaneous transverse
   cracking developed in multiple plies during creep loading and its
   effects on creep of multidirectional polymer matrix composite laminates
   is presented. The stress states in the intact regions of the plies are
   determined using the lamination theory during an incremental change in
   time. The stored elastic energy, determined using this stress state, is
   compared with a critical stored elastic energy value for damage to
   determine if a ply would fracture after the increment. If fracture is
   predicted, variational analysis is used to determine the perturbation in
   ply stresses due to cracking. This procedure is repeated to determine
   the crack evolution and creep strain. Model predictions compared well
   with experimental results for a {[}+/-theta(m)/90(n)](s) laminate. (C)

Abstract = {{Defects on product surfaces affect quality of the product. Machine
   vision provides an efficient tool for the surface defect detection.
   Threshold is commonly used to separate objects from the image background
   in the vision-based inspection method. The Otsu method is one of the
   most used approaches to decide the threshold for a satisfied result when
   the image histogram is bimodal, but it fails when the histogram of an
   image is unimodal or close to unimodal. Defects in product surfaces can
   range from small to large sizes, which results in distributions of the
   image histogram change from unimodal to bimodal. An improved Otsu
   method, named the weighted object variance (WOV), is proposed in this
   research to detect defects on product surfaces. A parameter that equals
   the cumulative probability of defects occurrence is weighted on the
   object variance of between-class variance. The weight ensures that the
   threshold always be a value that locates at the valley of two peaks or
   at the left bottom rim of a single peak histogram. It is essential to
   have a high detection rate and low false alarm rate for the defect
   detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   improved Otsu method in the defect detection of various surfaces.
   Compared to other thresholding methods such as maximum entropy, Otsu,
   valley-emphasis, and modified valley-emphasis methods, the WOV method
   provides better segmentation results. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published

Abstract = {{Well-defined polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogel was synthesized on the
   surface of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film via surface-initiated
   activators regenerated by electron transfer atom transfer radical
   polymerization (SI-ARGET-ATRP). Following the deposition of an ATRP
   initiator (2bromoisobutyrylbromide) on PET film, PAM hydrogel was
   grafted from the functionalized PET surface via ARGET-ATRP. XPS and
   FTIR-ATR confirmed that PAM hydrogel was successfully grafted on the PET
   surface. Results from AFM, SEM, and FTIR-FPA microscopic investigations
   showed that PAM hydrogel uniformly covers the surface of PET film. The
   grafting yield increases linearly with increasing reaction time,
   indicating that the growth of PAM hydrogel on the surface of PET is well
   controlled. In a cell adhesion assay, PAM hydrogel grafted PET films
   (PAM hydrogel-g-PET) showed low adhesion to keratinocyte cells. To
   impart PAM hydrogel-g-PET with antibacterial function, AgNPs were
   self-assembled along the amide side chains of PAM hydrogel. AgNPs
   loaded-PAM hydrogel-g-PET shows 99\% reduction in the number of
   multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa within 3 h contact. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This study investigates the mechanism of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC)
   removal from water with high alkalinity and DOC, typical in the Canadian
   Prairie, by three aluminum based coagulants: aluminum sulphate (alum),
   polyaluminum chloride (PACl), and aluminum chlorohydrate (ACH). Our
   focus is to discern the role of aluminum species: Al-a, Al-b, and Al-c
   to explain the performance of these coagulants in the removal of DOC.
   Removal of organic compounds is quantified by measurement of DOC, DOC
   fractions, and UV254.
   Results show that coagulation with alum at pH of 6.0 achieves highest
   DOC removal attributed to the highest content of in situ formed
   polymeric species (Al-b). At pH adjusted to 7 and 8 ACH shows the
   highest content of Al-b and consequently better removal of DOC compared
   to alum and PACl. When no pH adjustment is applied, coagulation with ACH
   achieves the highest DOC and UV removal, because of the highest
   concentration of Al-b and Al-c species in the solution.
   Trihalomethane Formation Potential (THMFP) of the water after the
   application of coagulation has also been studied. Water coagulated with
   alum shows the lowest trihalomethane formation potential (94.7 mu g L-1
   T) in comparison to the raw water (202.4 mu g L-1) followed by ACH and
   PACl. This can be related to the coagulant effectiveness in reduction of
   hydrophobic acid (HPOA) as the main precursor for THMs formation.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of carbon source variation on the physical and chemical
   characteristics of aerobic granular sludge and its biological nutrient
   (nitrogen and phosphorus) removal performance was investigated. Two
   identical sequencing batch reactors, R1 and R2, were set up. Granular
   biomass was cultivated to maturity using acetate-based synthetic
   wastewater. After mature granules in both reactors with simultaneous
   chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium and phosphorus removal capability
   were achieved, the feed of R2 was changed to municipal wastewater and R1
   was continued on synthetic feed as control. Biological phosphorus
   removal was completely inhibited in R2 due to lack of readily
   biodegradable COD; however, the biomass maintained high ammonium and COD
   removal efficiencies. The disintegration of the granules in R2 occurred
   during the first two weeks after the change of feed, but it did not have
   significant impacts on settling properties of the sludge. Re-granulation
   of the biomass in R2 was then observed within 30 d after granules'
   disintegration when the biomass acclimated to the new substrate. The
   granular biomass in R1 and R2 maintained a Sludge Volume Index close to
   60 and 47 mL g(-1), respectively, during the experimental period. It was
   concluded that changing the carbon source from readily biodegradable
   acetate to the more complex ones present in municipal wastewater did not
   have significant impacts on aerobic granular sludge characteristics; it
   particularly did not affect its settling properties. However, sufficient
   readily biodegradable carbon would have to be provided to maintain
   simultaneous biological nitrate and phosphorus removal.}},

Abstract = {{In fermentation processes, it is typically assumed, but seldom
   justified, that the off-gas composition is an adequate indicator of the
   dissolved gas concentrations to which the microbes are exposed. The
   objective of this study was to measure dissolved gas concentrations and
   assess the impact of elevated H-2(aq) and CO2(aq) (due to mass transfer
   limitations) on carbon balances, electron balances, and metabolic flux
   during thermophlilic fermentation with Clostridium thermocellum. A
   membrane inlet mass spectrometer (MIMS) was used for direct on-line
   measurement of dissolved gases (H-2 and CO2) during fermentation of
   cellobiose in a bioreactor sparged with N-2 gas. Two conditions were
   evaluated: (1) 10 mL min(-1) N-2 sparging, 100 rpm mixing, no surface
   mixing, and a corresponding Reynolds number (Re) of 12,000; and (2) 100
   mL min(-1) N-2 sparging, 200 rpm mixing, surface mixing, and a
   corresponding Re of 23,000. When Re = 12,000, both H-2 and CO2 were
   supersaturated. At Re = 23,000, the H-2 supersaturation ratio decreased,
   while CO2 showed no significant supersaturation. This re-evaluation of
   the actual concentrations of H-2(aq) and CO2(aq) led to improvements in
   both the carbon recovery and the redox balance, and may help explain the
   distribution of soluble end-products observed. Major conclusions were
   that dissolved gas species (both H-2 and to a lesser extent CO2) tend to
   be underestimated when assumed to be at equilibrium with the gas phase
   even during varied hydrodynamic conditions, and elevated {[}H-2]((aq))
   and {[}CO2]((aq)) can impact carbon balances, redox balances, and
   metabolic flux, which is partly controlled by mass transfer at the
   liquid-to-gas interface.}},

Abstract = {{Biomass and contaminant accumulation and partitioning in plants
   determine the harvest stage for optimum contaminant uptake during
   phytoremediation of municipal biosolids. This wetland microcosm bioassay
   characterized accumulation and partitioning of biomass, nutrients (N and
   P), and trace elements (Zn, Cu, Cr, and Cd) in cattail (Typha latifolia
   L.) in a growth room. Four cattail seedlings were transplanted into each
   20-L plastic pail containing 3.9 kg (dry wt.) biosolids from an
   end-of-life municipal lagoon. A 10-cm-deep water column was maintained
   above the 12-cm-thick biosolids layer. Plants were harvested every 14 d
   over a period of 126 d for determination of aboveground biomass (AGB)
   and belowground biomass (BGB) yields, along with contaminant
   concentrations in these plant tissues. Logistic model fits to biomass
   yield data indicated no significant difference in asymptotic yield
   between AGB and BGB. Aboveground biomass accumulated significantly
   greater amounts of N and P and lower amounts of trace elements than BGB.
   Maximum N accumulation in AGB occurred 83 d after transplanting (DAT),
   and peak P uptake occurred at 86 DAT. Harvesting at maximum aboveground
   accumulation removed (percent of the initial element concentration in
   the biosolids) 4\% N, 3\% P, 0.05\% Zn, 0.6\% Cu, 0.1\% Cd, and 0.2\%
   Cr. Therefore, under the conditions of this study, phytoremediation
   would be most effective if cattail is harvested at 86 DAT. These results
   contribute toward the identification of the harvest stage that will
   optimize contaminant uptake and enhance in situ phytoremediation of
   biosolids using cattail.}},

Abstract = {{With recent advances in technical standards of wireless sensor networks
   (WSNs) and semiconductor manufacturing technology, WSNs are used for
   large-scale industrial applications, especially for real-time monitoring

   proposed and developed Our design is characterized with low-power and
   rapid self-organization; and can enable the sensor nodes to awaken on

   the gateway node to control the sensor nodes in real time. The protocol
   stack and hardware platform are compatible with commercial WSNs real

   system with 4 gateway nodes and 85 sensor nodes has been successfully
   applied in warehouses of tobacco-alcoholization process storage in

Abstract = {{Drying is the major post-harvest operation carried out to reduce the
   moisture content of harvested grains to increase storage period and
   reduce storage losses. A prototype horizontal airflow in-bin drying
   system was developed and evaluated for drying wheat. The results proved
   that the moisture front moved radially from the center to the sidewall
   of the bin throughout the grain bulk and there were no significant
   differences (p<0.05) in drying at the bottom, middle, and top layers of
   the grain bulk when the airflow control valve was set at 2 m (equal to
   radius of the bin) from the top surface of the grain bulk. When the
   airflow control valve was set at 4 m (diameter of the bin), there were
   significant dfferences among the drying patterns at the three different
   heights. The results of the air pressure measurements showed that the
   air pressure distribution was equal around the radius of the bin. These
   results indicated that the current prototype dried the grain evenly from
   bottom to top of the grain bulk and can be used effectively at
   commercial level to dry grain in hopper bottom bins (tested) as well as
   in flat-bottom bins.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{107}},

Abstract = {{Ni-based superalloy Haynes 230 is used in many applications such as very
   high temperature reactor (VHTR) or solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) where
   it is exposed to high temperature service environment. In order to
   improve the resistance for high temperature oxidation, the effect of
   crystallographic orientation on the early stage oxidation was
   investigated. It was demonstrated that different oxide thicknesses are
   formed on grains having different orientations. Comparison of electron
   backscatter diffraction (EBSD) orientation maps before and after
   oxidation at 900 degrees C indicates that grains near (111) orientation,
   especially with the deviation angle from < 111 > that is smaller than
   20, are more oxidation resistant than grains of other orientations.
   Correlation between the results of electron backscatter diffraction
   (EBSD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to compare the
   oxidation rate of grains having different crystallographic orientation.
   The oxidation rate was found to change with the crystallographic
   orientation as follows (111) < (110) < (100), also it was demonstrated
   that the oxidation rate changes are a nearly linear function of the
   angle of deviation from < 111 > direction. The morphology of surface
   oxide also depends on the orientation of grains. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{We propose a statistical algorithm for sizing the energy storage system
   required for delivering baseload electricity to a selected confidence
   level for a wind farm. The proposed algorithm can be utilized by
   utilities to assess wind integration and to investigate better capacity
   credits for wind farms connected to the grid, by wind farm operators to
   potentially increase their return on investment by designing a baseload
   wind farm to a selected confidence level, and by financial institutions
   to calculate the confidence level for baseload wind farm projects.
   Methods introduced are based on parametric and nonparametric statistical
   models using wind resource assessment data and available wind turbine
   information that reflect different stages of a wind farm project from
   site selection to operational status. To study the performance of each
   method, we apply these to a North America operational wind farm data
   set. We use averaged 10-min and hourly data to calculate and compare the
   firm capacity of the wind turbine for each proposed method. The results
   show that for different stages of the wind farm development, and
   depending on the available information, the proposed algorithm can
   properly estimate the energy storage capacity required to deliver
   constant power to a user selected confidence level. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Wireless-powered cellular networks (WPCNs) are currently being
   investigated to ensure the reliability as well as improved battery
   lifetime of wireless devices. A WPCN leverages on a centralized base
   station (BS) that takes care of both wireless information and energy
   transfer. However, the harvested energy and, in turn, the spectral
   efficiency of uplink transmission of the users may significantly vary
   depending on the locations of the users and the channels used for energy
   and information transfer purposes. To this end, this paper theoretically
   characterizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) outage zones in a WPCN and
   comparatively analyzes the performance of three useful configurations of
   dedicated energy sources that can potentially minimize the SNR outage
   zones. These configurations are: (i) harvesting energy from and
   information transfer to a full-duplex BS. This is considered as a
   baseline configuration; (ii) harvesting energy from symmetrically
   deployed power beacons (PBs) and information transfer to a conventional
   half-duplex BS; and (iii) harvesting energy from-symmetrically deployed
   PBs that are colocated with the distributed antenna elements (DAEs) of a
   conventional half-duplex BS. For all the listed cases, we characterize
   the SNR outage probability and spectral efficiency of an arbitrarily
   located user within the cellular region. Based on the derived
   expressions, we also optimize the distance of the PBs from the BS to
   minimize the SNR outage probability and provide closed-form solutions
   for special cases. The optimum distance of the PBs is shown to be a
   function of the number of PBs and the coverage area of the BS. Numerical
   results validate the accuracy of the derived expressions, provide design
   insights related to WPCNs, and reveal the significance of the limited
   number of optimally placed PBs over a large number of randomly deployed
   PBs.}},

Abstract = {{Planar microwave components are very desirable for many applications and
   are mainly realized by metallic structures. In this work, a planar
   dielectric waveguide is proposed. A high-permittivity micrometer-size
   thick film is patterned on a low-loss microwave substrate and is
   considered as a nearly perfect magnetic wall to realize the waveguide
   structure. The permittivity contrast between the film and substrate is
   kept high (e.g., >30) in order to minimize the leakage power, and
   consequently, the insertion loss. The waveguide structure is
   theoretically analyzed using an approximation method and the results are
   confirmed by a simulation-based numerical method. The impact of
   dielectric loss of the film in waveguide performance is much less than
   that of the substrate, allowing waveguides with films having a medium or
   high loss (e.g., epsilon `' = 3) result in a low insertion loss (e.g.,
   up to 0.04 dB/mm at 40 GHz). Several prototypes are fabricated by
   screen-printing of barium-strontium-titanate (BST) pastes and
   characterized at 40 GHz. Using the extremely lossy BST film (tan delta =
   0.2, epsilon `' = 70), the insertion loss of the waveguide is measured
   to be 0.18 dB/mm. Based on the current technologies, the printable
   planar dielectric waveguide can achieve 0.08 dB/mm in insertion loss.
   Further improvements are expected in the future as the materials and
   fabrication technologies progress.}},

Abstract = {{Novel photoresist-based artificial bulk dielectrics with tall-embedded
   metal grids are investigated and their radiation characteristics are

   (around six times) the effective permittivity of the low permittivity

   microstrip feed to radiate effectively at frequencies similar to a
   high-permittivity dielectric resonator antenna (DRA). Moreover, the grid
   changes the near fields inside the resonator and introduces novel modes

Abstract = {{A new E(sic)-shape coupled inductor structure and its magnetic circuit
   models are presented. The proposed E(sic)-shape coupled inductor
   structure retains the advantages of high power density and tackles the
   drawback of high air-gap fringing flux losses in conventional

   E(sic)-shape structure gives the advantages of shorter winding length
   and more uniform thermal distribution compared with the conventional
   E(sic)-shape structure. The proposed E(sic)-shape structure and its
   magnetic models are successfully simulated by ANSYS and Maxwell 2-D, and
   implemented to apply to interleaving bidirectional dc/dc converters. The
   simulated and experimental results show that the proposed E(sic)-shape
   structure of coupled inductors is superior to the same volume
   E(sic)-shape structure of coupled inductors in terms of temperature,
   inductance, losses, inductor ripple currents, and efficiencies. The

Abstract = {{The rise of Bluetooth-equipped devices in personal consumer electronics
   and in in-car systems has revealed the potential to develop Bluetooth
   sensor systems for applications in intelligent transportation systems.
   These applications may include measurements of traffic presence,
   density, and flow, as well as longitudinal and comparative traffic
   analysis. A basic Bluetooth sensor system for traffic monitoring
   consists of a Bluetooth probe device (s) that scans for other
   Bluetooth-enabled device (s) within its radio proximity, and then stores
   the data for future analysis and use. The scanned devices are typically
   on-board vehicular electronics and consumer devices carried by the
   driver and/or passengers which use Bluetooth communications, and which
   then reasonably proxy for the vehicle itself. This paper surveys the
   scope and evolution of these systems, with system attributes and design
   decisions illustrated via a reference design. The work provides
   motivation for continued development of non-invasive systems that
   leverage the existing communication infrastructure and consumer devices
   that incorporate short range communication technology like Bluetooth.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a control scheme is designed for stable haptic
   teleoperation of hydraulic manipulators. The controller results in a
   stable position tracking for the hydraulic actuator (slave) in both
   unconstrained and constrained motions. The force feedback at the haptic
   (master) side is a combination of two different sensations. For free
   motion, the haptic device provides a haptic force based on the position
   error between the displacements of the master and the slave. The force
   also serves to alert the operator when the slave is ahead or behind in
   position tracking of the master. Once the slave comes in contact with
   the environment, the haptic force is augmented by the interaction force.
   The uniqueness, continuation, and existence of the Filippov solution to
   this system with the discontinuity surfaces are proven first. The
   extension of Lyapunov's stability theory to nonsmooth systems is then
   employed to prove the stability by constructing a Lyapunov function. The
   effectiveness of the controller is validated via experimental studies.
   It is shown that while stable, the system performs well in terms of
   position tracking of the hydraulic actuator and providing a haptic feel
   to the operator. The measurements required by the controller are supply
   pressure, actuator's line pressures, interaction force, and
   displacements of the master and slave.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical model for a dual-mass piezoelectric ring tire harvester is
   developed by an iteration method to determine the energy harvested from
   excitations of vehicle tires by rough roads. The piezoelectric ring
   harvester is made of a series of discrete PZT4 patches in a square shape
   circumferentially embedded in a polymer ring evenly. The harvester is
   placed between two the steel belts tightly pasted in the inner liner of
   tires for the harvesting process. The influences of some practical
   considerations, such as the central angle 0 of the tire sector to
   measure the contact section of a tire, the width of patches, the number
   of piezoelectric patches in the direction of the tire width, the
   thickness of patches, the radius of the piezoelectric ring, the speed of
   a vehicle and the road roughness, on the root mean square of the
   generated electric power are discussed. The results show that a power up
   to 42.08 W can be realized from a harvester with the central angle of
   theta, the radius of the piezoelectric ring, the width, the thickness,
   and the number of the PZT4 patch in the direction of the tire width
   being 30 degrees, 0.25 m, 0.01 m, 0.01 m and 3, respectively. The
   research on the theoretical model develops a novel technique for an

Abstract = {{Polyaniline tends to degrade with cycling in aqueous electrolytes and it
   can be alleviated using gel electrolytes. A low-cost solid-state
   supercapacitor of high energy density and good cyclic stability is
   fabricated with a facile method. The electrodes of the supercapacitor
   are made of a freestanding composite film of polyaniline and
   acid-treated carbon particles using phytic acid as a crosslinker, and
   the gel electrolyte is composed of sulfuric acid and polyvinyl alcohol.
   The electrochemical performances of the as-fabricated supercapacitor are
   investigated with cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Our results show that a maximum
   capacitance of 272.6 F/g (3.63 F/cm(2)) at a current density of 0.63 A/g
   can be achieved by the supercapacitor, which is significantly higher
   than most solid-state ones reported in the literature. The ability to
   achieve a high-capacitance supercapacitor with good cyclic stability is
   mainly attributed to excellent infiltration of the gel electrolyte into
   the electrodes. The developed lightweight, thin, flexible, and
   environmental friendly supercapacitor would have potential applications
   in various energy storage devices, such as wearable electronics and
   hybrid electric vehicles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) offers significant
   advantages over conventional techniques for measuring the
   centimeter-scale surface roughness of natural surfaces, such as sea ice.
   However, the laser scanning technique is inherently limited, principally
   by the following: 1) the high inclination scanning angle of the sensor
   with respect to nadir; 2) the precision of the laser ranging estimate;
   and 3) the beam divergence of the laser. In this paper, we introduce a
   numerical model that has been designed to simulate the acquisition of
   LiDAR data over a regular rough surface. Results from the model compare
   well (r(2) = 0.97) with LiDAR observations collected over two
   experimental surfaces of known roughness that were constructed from
   medium-density fibreboard using a computer numerical control three-axis
   router. The model demonstrates that surface roughness parameters are not
   sensitive to minor variations in the LiDAR sensor's range and laser beam
   divergence, but are slightly sensitive to the precision of the ranging
   estimate. The model also demonstrates that surface roughness parameters
   are particularly sensitive to the inclination angle of the LiDAR sensor.
   The surface RMS height is underestimated, and the correlation length is
   overestimated as either the inclination angle of the sensor or the true
   roughness of the surface increases. An isotropic surface is also
   increasingly observed as an anisotropic surface as either the
   inclination angle or the true surface roughness increases. Based on the
   model results, we propose a set of calibration functions that can be
   used to correct in situ LiDAR measurements of surface roughness.}},

   classification accuracy. When classifying new data samples, in addition
   to the conventional classification techniques used in the past
   literature to classify new data in the manifold space, we introduce a
   point-to-manifold distance (PMD) metric used to measure the distance
   between points and manifolds. Experimental results reported in this
   paper compare the recognition rates for a number of different manifold
   learning methods. The proposed MM-LLE technique has various applications
   in classification and object recognition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All
