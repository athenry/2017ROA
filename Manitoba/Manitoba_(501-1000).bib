Abstract = {{Low-relief and highly engineered prairie landscapes present many
   challenges for water quality modelling. Limited investigation has been
   carried out to determine whether drains, canals and diversions
   (artificial waterways) impact water quality relative to natural or
   naturalized systems or to assess the value of stable water isotopes as
   predictor variables for specific water quality metrics. The goal of this
   paper is to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of water
   chemistry in a typical prairie watershed by (1) comparing water quality
   and stable water isotopic ratios between naturalized and artificial
   waterways; (2) evaluating the relationships between topographic and land
   use characteristics, water quality and stable water isotopic ratios; and
   (3) expressing and predicting PO4 concentrations as a function of stable
   water isotopic ratios. Focus was on the 2509km(2) mostly agricultural
   Seine River Watershed located in southern Manitoba, Canada. Twenty-four
   sampling sites located along naturalized river reaches, drains and
   diversions were visited once a week from May to June 2013. Surface water
   samples were collected and tested for physical water quality parameters
   and PO4 concentrations, H-2 and O-18. Kruskal-Wallis tests show no
   significant differences in water chemistry among waterway types, while
   strong correlations were found between physical water quality
   parameters, PO4 concentrations, isotopic ratios and watershed
   characteristics. PO4 concentrations were successfully predicted from
   isotopic ratios using linear regression models. These results bear
   significant importance for the mostly ungauged prairie watersheds,
   thanks to the relative ease and lower cost of measuring stable water
   isotopic ratios in comparison to nutrient concentrations. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impact of CO2 removal from the headspace of
   a continuous flow biohydrogen production system on the H-2 yield and
   microbial community structure. A comparative study was conducted in the
   Integrated Biohydrogen Reactor Clarifier System (IBRCS) with and without
   potassium hydroxide in the reactor headspace to sequester CO2 using
   glucose. Headspace CO2 sequestration increased the H-2 yield by 22\% to
   2.96 +/- 0.14 mol/molhexose. The impact of headspace CO2 sequestration
   was not limited to the improvement in H-2 yield and gas quality, as it
   also influenced the metabolic pathway increasing acetate concentration,
   and decreasing butyrate and propionate concentrations. Detailed analyses
   of the microbial community structure in the IBRCS before and after CO2
   sequestration revealed that removal of CO2 from the headspace of the
   bioreactor had a significant impact on the microbial diversity and
   species distribution which rationalize the observed changes in the
   metabolic pathways. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications,

Abstract = {{The design and analysis of a miniaturised double-ridged horn antenna for
   active microwave imaging application are presented in this study. For
   such an application, a physically small horn is required. For effective
   signal penetration, a low frequency of operation (about 1.4 GHz) is
   selected. An array of these sensors is intended for use in a cylindrical
   breast imaging system, which is under development in the authors
   laboratory. The miniaturisation is achieved by loading the double-ridged
   horn antenna with distilled water (epsilon(r) = 76), a high
   permittivity, but easily available material. Further size reduction is
   achieved by reducing the aperture size and flare length in the horn
   section. The frequency response and both near- and far-field patterns
   were studied. Two simplified prototypes were fabricated, and as per the
   system requirements, tested in a cylindrical container filled with
   distilled water. Measured and simulated reflection and transmission
   responses are discussed. Measured radiation patterns are compared with
   the simulated ones to validate the analysis.}},

Title = {{Hybrid algorithm for rotor angle security assessment in power systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Transient rotor angle stability assessment and oscillatory rotor angle
   stability assessment subsequent to a contingency are integral components
   of dynamic security assessment (DSA) in power systems. This study
   proposes a hybrid algorithm to determine whether the postfault power
   system is secure due to both transient rotor angle stability and
   oscillatory rotor angle stability subsequent to a set of known
   contingencies. The hybrid algorithm first uses a new security measure
   developed based on the concept of Lyapunov exponents (LEs) to determine
   the transient security of the post-fault power system. Later, the
   transient secure power swing curves are analysed using an improved Prony
   algorithm which extracts the dominant oscillatory modes and estimates
   their damping ratios. The damping ratio is a security measure about the
   oscillatory security of the post-fault power system subsequent to the
   contingency. The suitability of the proposed hybrid algorithm for DSA in
   power systems is illustrated using different contingencies of a
   16-generator 68-bus test system and a 50-generator 470-bus test system.
   The accuracy of the stability conclusions and the acceptable
   computational burden indicate that the proposed hybrid algorithm is
   suitable for real-time security assessment with respect to both
   transient rotor angle stability and oscillatory rotor angle stability
   under multiple contingencies of the power system.}},

Abstract = {{A microwave frequency reflectometer with atto-farad capacitance
   sensitivity has been designed and tested for detection of particles and
   cells in a microfluidic channel. The design is implemented on a printed
   circuit board. Capacitance sensitivity up to 1.25 aF is achieved in a 50
   Hz bandwidth. The sensor was used for detection of 5.7 mu m polystyrene
   spheres and Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells flowing over co-planar
   electrodes in a microfluidic chip. The reflectometer was used in a
   dielectrophoresis cytometer. A statistical analysis of particle
   defection demonstrated that the microwave sensing voltages are below the
   limit required to prevent actuating beads and cells by
   dielectrophoresis. The use of a reflected signal rather than one
   transmitted through a resonator has eliminated the bulky resonator and
   allowed for a much more integrated design. The sensor nulling is
   accomplished by changing the RF generator frequency and the need for
   stable and bulky mechanical phase shifters required for resonator
   designs is eliminated. The open line design is less sensitive to media
   conductivity compared to resonator based cytometer and the sensitivity
   changes by less than 34\% for media conductivities from 0.1 to 3 S/m.

Abstract = {{The parametric excited vibration of a pipe under thermal loading may
   occur because the fluid is often transported heatedly. The effects of
   thermal loading on the pipe stability and local bifurcations have rarely
   been studied. The stability and the local bifurcations of the lateral
   parametric resonance of the pipe induced by the pulsating fluid velocity
   and the thermal loading are studied. A mathematical model for a simply
   supported pipe is developed according to the Hamilton principle. Two
   partial differential equations describing the lateral and longitudinal
   vibration are obtained. The singularity theory is utilized to analyze
   the stability and the bifurcation of the system solutions. The
   transition sets and the bifurcation diagrams are obtained both in the
   unfolding parameter space and the physical parameter space, which can
   reveal the relationship between the thermal field parameter and the
   dynamic behaviors of the pipe. The frequency response and the
   relationship between the critical thermal rate and the pulsating fluid
   velocity are obtained. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of
   the single-mode expansion of the solution and the stability and local
   bifurcation analyses. It also confirms the existence of the chaos. The
   presented work can provide valuable information for the design of the
   pipeline and the controllers to prevent the structural instability.}},

Abstract = {{A wavelet-based technique for blind deconvolution and denoising of
   ultrasound scans is introduced. The target application is near-field
   ultrasound imaging for non-destructive testing. Existing blind
   deconvolution techniques for ultrasound such as cepstrum-based methods
   and the work of Adam and Michailovich - based on discrete wavelet
   transform (DWT) shrinkage of the log-spectrum - estimate the pulse by
   exploiting the pulse log-spectrum smoothness relative to the material
   reflectivity function. In the proposed technique, the log-spectrum is
   localised with respect to time as the continuous wavelet transform (CWT)
   log-scalogram to deal with the non-stationarity of the near-field
   ultrasound signals in both the pulse estimation and deconvolution. The
   pulse is estimated in the wavelet domain via DWT shrinkage of the
   log-scalogram and is deconvolved by wavelet-domain Wiener filtering.
   Extensions of the proposed technique include: using separate CWT domains
   for estimation and deconvolution, as inspired by the WienerChop
   denoising method; and training the algorithm parameters on a subset of
   scans.}},

Abstract = {{Dual phase (DP) steels are designed to consist of hard martensite
   dispersed in a relatively soft ferrite matrix, which offers a favorable
   combination of high strength with good deformability. Fiber laser
   welding (FLW) is becoming increasingly important for joining advanced
   materials due to its flexibility and deep penetration. In this study,
   the microstructure of a DP steel, DP980, welded by FLW technique was
   carefully analyzed. Gleeble thermo-mechanical simulation coupled with
   analytical transmission electron microscopy revealed that the FLW
   process produced significant microstructural changes in a narrow
   heat-affected zone (HAZ) and fusion zone (FZ), which can result in
   dramatic changes in mechanical properties. This is reflected in the
   micro-hardness profile obtained across the welded material. The salient
   phase transitions induced by the FLW, including the formation of new
   martensite grains in the upper-critical HAZ and FZ, are discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{A novel optimization-enabled electromagnetic transient simulation
   approach is proposed for calculating the resistor setting of a
   multistage impulse generator for insulation impulse testing of
   high-voltage transformers. This approach enables test engineers to
   overcome most of the major challenges attributed to the use of
   conventional trial-and-error methods for determining resistor settings,
   including the excessive time consumption and the potential damage to the
   test transformer due to a greater number of trial tests. The proposed
   method uses the frequency response of the test transformer to synthesize
   a circuit model for it. The test setup, including the test transformer
   and the impulse generator, is simulated using an
   electromagnetic-transients-type simulator. A genetic-algorithm-based
   approach is used to optimize the setting of the impulse generator.
   Optimized resistor values are then used in impulse testing of a
   three-phase power transformer. Different cases of impulse generator
   resistor arrangements are studied in this paper and simulated waveforms
   are compared with those obtained from measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Development of a designed coculture that can achieve aerotolerant
   ethanogenic biofuel production from cellulose can reduce the costs of
   maintaining anaerobic conditions during industrial consolidated
   bioprocessing (CBP). To this end, a strain of Caldibacillus debilis
   isolated from an air-tolerant cellulolytic consortium which included a
   Clostridium thermocellum strain was characterized and compared with the
   C. debilis type strain. Characterization of isolate C. debilis GB1 and
   comparisons with the type strain of C. debilis revealed significant
   physiological differences, including (i) the absence of anaerobic
   metabolism in the type strain and (ii) different end product synthesis
   profiles under the experimental conditions used. The designed cocultures
   displayed unique responses to oxidative conditions, including an
   increase in lactate production. We show here that when the two species
   were cultured together, the noncellulolytic facultative anaerobe C.
   debilis GB1 provided respiratory protection for C. thermocellum,
   allowing the synergistic utilization of cellulose even under an aerobic

Abstract = {{There is an urgent need to develop new combustion strategies such as
   homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) mode to meet current and
   future emissions regulations. In this study, experiments and a coupled
   AVL-CHEMKIN CFD (computational fluid dynamic) model were adopted to
   compare combustion phasing, engine performance and emissions in term of
   equivalence ratio for both HCCI combustion engines with and without
   pre-combustion chamber to investigate the effect of pre-combustion
   chamber on HCCI combustion engine. Results revealed that with an
   equivalence ratio of 0.2, HCCI engine with pre-combustion chamber (comet
   MK.V) tolerates misfiring process, while HCCI engine without
   pre-combustion chamber (modified chamber) experiences a complete
   combustion. HCCI engine with modified chamber has higher combustion
   pressure, narrower heat release rate (HRR), more advanced start of
   combustion (SOC) and higher indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) in
   comparison with comet MK.V chamber. For equivalence ratios between 0.2
   and 0.5, the average increase in IMEPs is 49.3\%. Furthermore, HCCI
   engine with modified chamber generates higher work per kg fuel compared
   to comet MK.V chamber. While a high level of nitrogen oxide (NOx)
   emissions is produced by HCCI combustion with modified chamber, both
   carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions decreased
   drastically. In terms of combustion phasing, engine performance and
   emissions, the HCCI engine with modified combustion chamber is preferred
   at low equivalence ratios (Phi < 0.3) compared with comet MK.V chamber.

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the stability of turbulent flames is a key for the design
   of efficient combustion systems. The present paper reports an
   experimental study on the effect of the internal geometry of a
   rectangular orifice on the characteristics/stability of a turbulent
   methane flame. Three rectangular nozzles with different orifice lengths
   having an identical exit aspect ratio (AR) of 2 were used. The
   co-airflow strength was also varied to evaluate its effect on the jet
   flow emerging from the rectangular nozzle. The experimental data
   revealed that the jet initial conditions affect both the flow
   characteristics and the liftoff of turbulent diffusion methane flame.
   That is, increasing the orifice length of the rectangular nozzle
   resulted in delaying the occurrence of the axis-switching phenomenon,
   reducing the length of the jet potential core, and accelerating the
   liftoff transition of the attached flame. The co-airflow was found to
   reduce the velocity strain rate in the shear layer, displace the
   occurrence of axis-switching farther downstream of the jet, and delay
   flame detachment. The results revealed also that there is a clear
   interplay between the flame liftoff and the jet near-field molecular
   mixing and flow characteristics. That is, a rectangular jet which
   spreads faster and generates higher near-field velocity strain and
   turbulence intensity causes flame detachment at a lower fuel jet
   velocity. Based on this, a correlation was found between the flame
   liftoff velocity, the fuel molecular thermal diffusivity, the
   stoichiometric laminar flame speed, and the fuel jet strain rate at the
   nozzle exit. This relationship was shown to successfully predict the
   liftoff velocity of methane flame as well as other common gaseous
   hydrocarbons and hydrogen flames.}},

Abstract = {{Information on insect infestation inside stored grain bulks is required
   for safe grain storage. A new method to rapidly detect both adults and
   larvae of Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens) in grain was developed
   based on the principle of microwave heating and insect behaviour under
   elevated temperature. The designed apparatus and processing procedure
   were tested to extract both the adults and larvae inside wheat with
   14\%, 16\% and 18\% moisture contents by using a domestic microwave oven
   (referred to as the microwave method). The recovery percentage of the
   introduced insects associated with the microwave method was compared
   with that of the Berlese funnel method (810 cm(3) wheat in a funnel
   under an incandescent light bulb). The microwave method recovered 97.8\%
   of introduced adults, while 90.6\% of adults were recovered by the
   Berlese funnel method. The recovery percentage of the larvae inside
   marked wheat kernels was 83.3 +/- 3.3\% with the microwave method and
   less than 27\% with the Berlese funnel method. There was no significant
   difference in extraction percentage between old and young larvae when
   the microwave method was used. The moisture content of the treated grain
   did not significantly influence the extraction percentage of the pest
   insect. The total processing time of the microwave method was less than
   30 min compared to 6 h required for the Berlese funnel method. (C) 2015

   1600 nm at 61 evenly distributed wavelengths. Four wavelengths 1100,
   1130, 1250 and 1300 nm were identified as significant wavelengths and
   were used in statistical discriminant analysis. Pair-wise, two-class and
   six-class classification models were developed to classify the healthy
   and different stages of fungal infected samples. Linear, quadratic and
   Mahalanobis discriminant classifiers were used to classify healthy, five
   stages of A. glaucus and five stages of Penicillium spp infected canola
   seeds. All the three classifiers classified healthy and fungal infected
   canola seeds with a classification accuracy of more than 95\% for
   healthy canola seeds and more than 90\% for the initial stages of A.
   glaucus and Penicillium spp infected canola seeds. The classification
   accuracy increased to 100\% with increase in fungal infection level
   (length of time since inoculation). All the samples subjected to imaging
   were tested for seed germination and free fatty acid value (FAV). The
   germination decreased with increase in amount of fungal infection,
   whereas FAV increased with increase in amount of fungal infection. Crown

Abstract = {{Leachate from Brady Road Resources Management Facility (Manitoba,
   Canada) was evaluated to determine the most effective pre-treatment
   method to reduce the high concentrations of COD (1900 mg/L) and ammonia
   (640 mg/L) present. Four pre-treatment options were studied: (a) air
   stripping (b) chemical coagulation (c) electro-coagulation and (d)
   advanced oxidation with sodium ferrate. Each one of the procedures was
   evaluated under different conditions (pH, dose, contact time, etc.) to
   determine the operating conditions that best reduce the effluent COD and
   ammonia concentrations. Chemical coagulation exhibited the highest COD
   removal at 43\% while in terms of ammonia removal, air stripping with
   86\% removal rate, was far superior to the other treatments.
   Electro-coagulation and advanced oxidation with sodium ferrate were
   found not suitable as pre-treatment options for this particular
   leachate, while combining air stripping and chemical coagulation removed
   approximately 50\% COD and 85\% ammonia, providing the highest removal
   percentages. Batch nitrification kinetics tests were used to assess the
   impact on nitrification performance of blending untreated and
   pre-treated leachate with municipal wastewater at varying percentages:
   0.5\%, 1\%, 5\% and 10\% by volume. Pre-treatment was successful in
   allowing unhindered nitrification in the activated sludge bioreactor.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive spectrum access (CSA) in in-band D2D-enabled cellular networks
   is a potential feature that can promote efficient resource utilization
   and interference management among coexisting cellular and D2D users. In
   this article, we first outline the challenges in resource allocation
   posed by the coexistence of cellular and D2D users. Next, we provide a
   qualitative overview of the existing resource allocation and
   interference management policies for in-band D2D-enabled cellular
   networks. We then demonstrate how cognition along with limited
   information exchange between D2D users and the core network can be used
   to mitigate interference and enhance spectral efficiency of both
   cellular and D2D users. In particular, we propose a CSA scheme that
   exploits channel sensing and interference-aware decision making at the
   D2D terminals. This CSA scheme at the D2D terminals is complemented by a
   D2D-aware channel access method at the cellular BSs. The performance
   gains of the proposed CSA scheme are characterized in terms of channel
   access probability for a typical D2D transmitter and spectral
   efficiencies for both cellular and D2D transmissions. Finally, potential

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of joint subchannel and power allocation for an
   orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA)-based cognitive
   radio network (CRN). We formulate the downlink resource-allocation
   problem as a generalized spectral footprint (SF) (bandwidth-power
   product) minimization problem under the interference threshold at the
   primary users (PUs), as well as the total power and quality-of-service
   constraints. A cognitive base station (BS) solves this nonconvex
   mixed-integer programming problem iteratively by dividing it into a
   subchannel-allocation master problem and a power-allocation subproblem.
   The subchannel assignment problem for secondary users (SUs) is solved by
   applying a modified Hungarian algorithm, whereas the power-allocation
   subproblem is solved by using a Lagrangian technique. Specifically, we
   propose a low-complexity modified Hungarian algorithm for subchannel
   allocation that exploits the local information in the cost matrix. To
   apply the modified Hungarian algorithm, we require knowledge of the
   exact number of subchannel requirements of each user in every iteration.
   Hence, we develop an algorithm to update the number of subchannels
   required by each user in each iteration based on the SF difference of
   each user. An asymptotic analysis is carried out for the single SU case,
   and a closed-form expression is derived for the optimal number of
   subchannels that minimizes the SF. The performance of our generalized SF
   minimization technique is compared with the water-filling
   power-allocation scheme and a scheme based on brute-force search. In
   addition, several applications of the proposed algorithms are outlined.}},

Abstract = {{Resource reuse schemes in relay-enhanced cooperative orthogonal
   frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) networks have been well
   studied in the literature from an interference mitigation perspective
   and with cell-partitioning being the basis. In this paper however, we
   study dynamic intra-cell subcarrier reuse in cooperative OFDMA networks
   in which the users are allowed to share any subcarrier in the relay
   links provided that the resultant intra-cell interference is managed; an
   option not available in non-cooperative networks. Specifically, when the
   target data-rates of the users are not reachable in a conventional
   cooperative OFDMA network, dynamic intra-cell subcarrier reuse enables
   the users to achieve their target data-rates, even when the number of
   users surpasses the number of subcarriers. We formally define the
   problem of maximizing the system sum-rate subject to per node power and
   target data-rate constraints in a cooperative OFDMA single-cell network
   in which subcarriers are allowed to be reused in the relay links. After
   analyzing the problem in the dual domain and deriving the performance
   bounds, we propose a suboptimal resource allocation algorithm where
   subcarriers and links (relay and/or direct) are assigned to the users.
   Simulation results show that by employing our resource allocation
   algorithm, the system sum-rate and the outage ratio are significantly
   improved, specially in an overpopulated network.}},

Abstract = {{This paper characterizes the spectral efficiency of an uplink radio
   frequency (RF)-powered macrocell network considering
   harvest-then-transmit protocol such that the macrocell users transmit in
   the uplink while replenishing the energy from their serving base station
   (BS) in the downlink. Using the theory of order statistics, a tractable
   mathematical framework is developed to derive the uplink spectral
   efficiency and the downlink power consumption resulting due to wireless
   energy transfer. The framework captures the impact of the locations of
   the users that are selected for uplink transmission, their channel
   statistics for information and energy transfer, and different user
   selection schemes. We first analyze the performance of state-of-the-art
   greedy and round-robin scheduling schemes in RF-powered cellular
   networks. Closed-form expressions for the minimum power outage
   probability (i.e., the probability that the selected user is unable to
   harvest sufficient power for uplink transmission) are also derived. We
   then develop modified versions of the conventional user selection
   schemes that improve the spectral efficiency on a given uplink
   transmission channel with zero power outage probability (i.e.,
   probability of outage due to insufficient amount of harvested power).
   The developed schemes are shown to outperform the conventional user
   scheduling schemes in terms of the throughput and energy harvesting time
   with a trade-off in fairness among users. The accuracy of the
   expressions is validated via Monte-Carlo simulations. Numerical results
   highlight the trade-offs associated with the various user selection
   schemes as a function of network parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Cereal grains are an important part of human diet; hence, there is a
   need to maintain high quality in these grains. Contaminants (foreign
   materials, dockage, and animal excreta) are the major impurities in
   cereal grains. A procedure was developed to differentiate these
   contaminants from wheat using near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging.
   Three experiments were conducted to identify the best combinations of
   spectral pre-processing technique and statistical classifier to classify
   contaminants represented by seven foreign material types (barley,
   canola, maize, flaxseed, oats, rye, and soybean); six dockage types
   (broken wheat kernels, buckwheat, chaff, wheat spikelets, stones, and
   wild oats); and two animal excreta types (deer and rabbit droppings)
   from Canada Western Red Spring (CWRS) wheat. The raw NIR reflectance
   spectra of these contaminants and wheat were collected in the NIR range
   (1000-1600 nm). These spectra were processed using five spectral
   preprocessing techniques (first derivative, second derivative,
   Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing and differentiation, multiplicative
   scatter correction (MSC), and standard normal variate (SNV)) to reduce
   signal noises and improve the generalised capability of statistical
   classifiers. The raw and pre-processed data were classified using
   Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and k-nearest
   neighbours (k-NN) classifiers. In each study, two-way classifications
   were conducted to understand the classification of each contaminant type
   from wheat and multi-way classifications were conducted to understand
   the classification of all contaminant types from wheat. Contaminants and
   wheat were classified with highest classification accuracy when spectral
   data were pre-processed using the SNV technique and classified using the
   k-NN classifier. (C) 2015 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Quantitative proteomic analysis of the cellulolytic system of
   Clostridium termitidis CT1112 reveals distinct protein expression
   profiles upon growth on alpha-cellulose and cellobiose}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS}},

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Clostridium termitidis CT1112 is an anaerobic, mesophilic, cellulolytic
   bacterium with potential applications in consolidated bioprocessing of
   lignocellulosic biomass. To understand how C. termitidis degrades
   lignocellulose, iTRAQ-based 2D HPLC-MS/MS proteomics was used to measure
   protein expression in cell lysates and extracellular (secretome)
   fractions of C termitidis grown on alpha-cellulose and cellobiose at
   both exponential and stationary growth phases. Exoglucanases (GH48,
   GH9), endoglucanases (GH5, GH8, GH9), hemicellulases including xylanases
   (GH8, GH10, GH11, GH30) and mannanase (GH26) as well as extracellular
   adhesion proteins and cellulosome associated proteins, exhibited higher
   expression on cellulose-grown cells. The expression of these proteins
   increased with a decrease in growth rate. Non-cellulosomal proteins
   however did not change significantly between substrate conditions,
   although there were a few exceptions. Collectively, these would
   contribute to hydrolysis of lignocellulosic material for uptake through
   ABC sugar transport proteins. On cellobiose, chitinases (GH18) were
   expressed abundantly. Although a large number of proteins were shared
   between the fractions analyzed, some proteins were detected exclusively
   in the cellular fraction, while others were detected in the secretome.
   This study reports for the first time on the cellulolytic machinery
   employed by C termitidis to hydrolyze cellulosic substrate and provides
   an understanding of how this microbe deconstructs biomass.
   Biological significance
   The genome of C termitidis CT1112 contains genes for a wide variety of
   carbohydrate active enzymes. Based on bioinformatics analyses, many of
   these genes appear to encode cellulosome-associated proteins, while
   others may be secreted extracellularly. To understand how C. termitidis
   degrades and depolymerizes cellulosic substrates, cells were grown on
   simple and complex carbohydrates, and quantitative 4-plex iTRAQ-based 2D
   HPLC-MS/MS proteomics was applied to measure protein expression levels
   in biological replicates of both cell lysates and extracellular protein
   (secretome) fractions, at exponential and stationary phases of growth.
   The resulting data have provided insight into the range of substrates
   that may be hydrolyzed by C termitidis, and may be useful in determining
   potential industrial applications of C termitidis in biomass to
   bioenergy production via consolidated bioprocessing. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Chromatographic behavior of peptides containing oxidized methionine
   residues in proteomic LC-MS experiments: Complex tale of a simple
   modification}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{125}},
Pages = {{131-139}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{On average, the oxidation of a single Met residue to Mso (methionine
   S-oxide, methionine sulfoxide) and Msn (methionine S,S-dioxide,
   methionine sulfone) decreases peptide retention in RP HPLC by 2.37 and
   1.95 Hydrophobicity Index units (\% acetonitrile), respectively. At the
   same time, the magnitude of the retention shift varies greatly (-9.1 to
   + 0.4\% acetonitrile for Mso) depending on peptide sequence. The latter
   effects are mostly associated with the stabilization of secondary
   structures upon peptide interaction with the hydrophobic stationary
   phase: when an oxidized residue is located in the hydrophobic face of an
   amphipathic helix, the decrease in retention is profound. The same amino
   add positioning leads to complete or partial resolution of pairs of
   peptides containing diastereomeric Mso residues. Contrary to all
   previously reported observations, and the nature of this modification,
   we also demonstrate for the first time that methionine oxidation may
   increase peptide hydrophobicity. This behavior is characteristic for Met
   residues in the N3 position of an N-capping box stabilization motif
   prior to the amphipathic helix. All these findings indicate that the
   prediction of peptide secondary structures upon interaction with
   hydrophobic surfaces must become an integral part of peptide retention
   modeling in proteomic applications going forward. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Biodiesel production-derived waste glycerol (WG) was previously
   investigated as potential carbon source for medium chain length
   polyhydroxyalkanoate (mcl-PHA) production by Pseudomonas putida LS46. In
   this study, we evaluated the effect of impurities in the WG on P. putida
   LS46 physiology during exponential growth and corresponding changes in
   transcription and protein expression profiles compared with cells grown
   on pure, reagent grade glycerol. High concentration of metal ions, such
   as Na+, and numbers of heavy metals ion, such as copper, ion, zinc, were
   detected in biodiesel-derived WG. Omics analysis from the corresponding
   cultures suggested altered expression of genes involved in transport and
   metabolism of ammonia and heavy metal ions. Expression of three groups
   of heavy metal homeostasis genes was significantly changed (mostly
   upregulated) in WG cultures and included the following: copper-responded
   cluster 1 and 2 genes, primarily containing cusABC; two copies of copAB
   and heavy metal translocating P-type ATPase; Furregulated,
   TonB-dependent siderophore receptor; and several cobalt/zinc/cadmium
   transporters. Expression of these genes suggests regulation of
   intracellular concentrations of heavy metals during growth on
   biodiesel-derived glycerol. Finally, a number of genes involved in
   adapting to, or metabolizing free fatty acids and other nonheavy metal
   contaminants, such as Na+, were also upregulated in P. putida LS46 grown
   on biodiesel-derived glycerol.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, channel assignment for spectrum sensing is studied in
   multi-channel cognitive radio (CR) networks to maximize the number of
   channels satisfying sensing performance (called available channels).
   Beginning with a nonlinear integer programming problem, we derive the
   upper bound of optimal value through many-to-many assignment problem and
   then propose three algorithms for both centralized and distributed
   scenarios. In centralized case, a heuristic scheme is proposed based on
   the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) over all primary channels (PCs). Then,
   a greedy scheme is proposed to reduce the reported information from the
   CRs. In distributed case, a novel scheme with multi-round operation is
   designed following the coalitional game theory. In each round, each CR
   selects some PCs based on SNRs. Then, the CRs selecting the same channel
   play coalitional game, and thereby, multiple games are played
   concurrently over multiple channels. Finally, the best coalition for
   each channel is chosen among the formed coalitions to perform the
   cooperative spectrum sensing. The simulation results show that the
   proposed schemes can significantly increase the number of available
   channels. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   shown that the classifier can be trained using a small set of data when
   the terms of the TEF are used as input features. The prediction accuracy

   inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry determined that the
   lab-scale SBR removed over 80\% of influent AgNP during continuous
   dosing. It was also determined that the North End Water Pollution
   Control Centre in Winnipeg, Canada, removed just under 50\% of influent
   AgNP, and that half of the reduction occurred before secondary

Abstract = {{Growth of stenosis is mainly due to the high concentration of plasma
   lipoprotein such as low density lipoprotein (LDL) near the art ery
   walls. Accurate prediction of LDL concentration especially near the
   stenosis and where the shear stress is low, can help to predict the
   plaque growth. In this paper, a novel model is introduced to predict the
   LDL concentration near a plaque. This model is based on variable
   diffusion coefficient of LDL due to the non-Newtonian behavior of the
   blood flow in low shear stress regions such as flow around plaques. The
   new model for diffusion coefficient consists of two parts: the
   stationary and the shear- induced particle diffusivity due to rotation
   of red blood cells. The results show that the new model predicts the LDL
   concentration well and unlike the constant diffusion coefficient which
   is used by others, produces more physical and meaningful results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a discrete-time single-server finite-buffer queue
   with Markovian arrival process and generally distributed
   batch-size-dependent service time. Given that infinite service time is
   not commonly encountered in practical situations, we suppose that the
   distribution of the service time has a finite support. Recently, a
   similar continuous-time system with Poisson input process was discussed
   by Banerjee and Gupta (2012). But unfortunately, their method is hard to
   apply in the analysis of discrete-time case with versatile Markovian
   point process due to the fact that the difference equation governing the
   boundary state probabilities is more complex than the continuous one. If
   we follow their ideas, we will eventually find that some important joint
   queue length distributions cannot be computed and thus some key
   performance measures cannot be derived. In this paper, replacing the
   finite support renewal distribution with an appropriate phase-type
   distribution, the joint state probabilities at various time epochs
   (arbitrary, pre-arrival and departure) have been obtained by using
   matrix analytic method and embedded Markov chain technique. Furthermore,
   UL-type RG-factorization is employed in numerical computation of
   block-structured Markov chains with finitely-many levels. Some numerical
   examples are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
   algorithm for several service time distributions. Moreover, the impact
   of the correlation factor on loss probability and mean sojourn time is
   also investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present model and measurement results for C-band HH
   and VV normalized radar cross-sections (NRCS) from winter snow-covered
   first-year sea ice with average snow thicknesses of 16, 4, and 3 cm. The
   brine content in snow pack was low in all three case studies, which is
   typical for cold winter conditions. We used the first-order
   approximation of the small perturbation theory accounting for surface
   scattering from the air-snow and snow-ice rough interfaces and
   continuously layered snow and sea ice. The experimental data were
   collected during the Circumpolar Flaw Lead system study in the winter of
   2008 in the southern Beaufort Sea from the research icebreaker Amundsen.
   Good agreement between the model and experimental data were observed for
   all three case studies. The model results revealed that the scattering
   at the snow-ice rough interface is usually stronger than that at the
   air-snow interface. Furthermore, both model and experimental NRCS values
   (at VV and HH polarizations) were considerably higher for thin-snow
   cover compared with the thick-snow-cover case. We associate this effect
   with the lower attenuation of the propagated wave within the thin-snow
   pack in comparison to the thick-snow pack. We also demonstrated that
   different brine volume contents in snow with close thicknesses of 4 and
   3 cm did not affect the backscattering coefficients at certain incidence
   angles and polarization. Our findings provide the physical basis for
   winter snow thickness retrieval and suggest that such retrievals may be
   possible from radar observations under particular scattering conditions.}},

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{A dual-mass piezoelectric bar harvester is developed for energy
   harvesting from ambient vibrations of a vehicle suspension system
   subjected to roughness of road surfaces. The harvester is made of a
   sprung mass (body mass) and an unsprung mass (wheel mass) connected by a
   piezoelectric bar transducer which is equivalently modeled as a
   suspension spring and a damper in a mathematics model. The dual-mass
   piezoelectric bar harvester is practically designed in a vehicle
   suspension system on wheels to generate an electric charge. To describe
   the energy harvesting process, a mathematics model is developed to
   calculate the output charge and voltage from the harvester by an
   iteration method in the temporal domain. The influences of some
   practical considerations, such as the width of the piezoelectric bar,
   the speed of vehicles, and the class of the road roughness, on the root
   mean square of the generated electric power are discussed. Our results
   show that a power up to 738 W can be realized for a practical design of
   the harvester with a width and height of the piezoelectric bar of 0.015
   m and 0.1 m respectively. This research develops a new design method for
   efficient and practical energy harvesting from vehicle vibrations. (C)

   at least two types of different elements, monatomic metallic glass (MMG)
   in body-centered cubic metals has recently been vitrified experimentally

   by molecular dynamics simulations and used as a model system to explore
   the atomistic mechanism of hardening in MG under cyclic loading well
   below the yield point. It was found that significant structural ordering
   was caused during the elastic cycling without accumulating apparent
   plastic strain, which ultimately led to the crystallization of MG that
   has been long conjectured but rarely directly proved before. It was also
   revealed that tensile stresses were more likely to induce structural
   ordering and crystallization in MG than compressive stresses.}},

Abstract = {{The fabrication of highly effective is an important strategy for coping
   with the growing concern of bacterial resistance. In this study,
   N-chloramine-functionalized hollow hemispherical structures were
   designed and prepared to examine possible enhancement of antimicrobial
   performance. Antimicrobial testing was carried out On Gram-negative
   (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Baccilus Cereus) bacteria in the
   presence and absence of biological medium. The efficacy of the hollow
   hemispherical particles functionalized with various N-chloramines in
   killing bacteria was compared among themselves with that Of small
   organic molecules and spherical particles to investigate the effect of
   the surface charge, chemical. structure, and shape Of the particles.
   Results demonstrated that quaternary,ammonium salt or amine functions in
   the,chemical structure enhanced the antimicrobial activity of the
   particles-and made the particles more effective than the small molecules
   in the presence of biological medium. The importance of particle shape
   in the killing tests was also confirmed.}},

Abstract = {{Different strategies have been proposed to reduce patient waiting time
   in hospitals. Previous investigations indicate that up to 50\% or more
   patients can be treated in a ``fast track{''} process compared to the
   standard procedure in some emergency departments. However most studies
   on emergency department (ED) fast tracks were based on evidence without
   using an efficient decision tool to show applicability of the results.
   An agent-based simulation tool is proposed in this research to evaluate
   fast track treatment (FTT) in an ED. The tool can study the behavior
   change of entities and resources in a complex ED system. Static and
   dynamic FTT processes are evaluated. The static process uses a fixed
   duration in the daily ED operation. In the dynamic process, FTT is
   triggered based on the current patient waiting time and the state of ED
   operations. The simulation results provide details and information for
   the process of the FTT implementation at the ED to reduce patient
   waiting time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Some desired antenna specifications for performing two-dimensional (2D)
   transverse magnetic (TM) microwave tomography imaging are presented and
   discussed. These desired specifications are governed by the need to
   reduce the discrepancy between the 3D measurement configuration and the
   utilized 2D TM inversion algorithm, as well as the desire to enhance the
   achievable image accuracy and resolution. Driven by these
   specifications, an existing compact ultrawideband antenna element is
   modified. These modifications attempt to make the near-field
   distribution of this antenna more focused in the two orthogonal planes
   in the forward near-field zone of the antenna, while keeping its
   physical size relatively small and maintaining multiple frequencies of
   operation for this antenna. The final antenna has a physical size of
   26x29x38.5 mm(3) and can operate at two different frequency bands
   (2.34-5.04 GHz and 8.06-13 GHz based on the vertical bar S-11 vertical
   bar <= -8 dB impedance bandwidth definition). The measured near-field
   distribution of this antenna is presented in the imaging plane and the
   plane perpendicular to the imaging plane.}},

Abstract = {{Pushing the limits of elastic deformation in nanowires subjected to
   stress is important for the design and performance of nanoscale devices
   from elastic strain engineering. Particularly, introducing nanoscale
   twins has proved effective in rising the tensile strength of metals.
   However, attaining ideal elastic strains in nanotwinned materials
   remains challenging, because nonuniform twin sizes locally affect the
   yielding behavior. Here, using in situ high-resolution transmission
   electron microscopy tensile testing of nanotwinned {[}111]-oriented gold
   nanowires, we report direct lattice-strain measurements that demonstrate
   a strong Hall-Petch type relationship in the elastic strain limit up to
   5.3\%, or near the ideal theoretical limit, as the twin size is
   decreased below 3 nm. It is found that the largest twin in nanowires
   with irregular twin sizes controls the slip nucleation and yielding
   processes in pure tension, which is in agreement with earlier atomistic
   simulations. Continuous hardening behavior without loss of strength or
   softening is observed in nanotwinned single-crystalline gold nanowires,
   which differs from the behaviors of bulk nanocrystalline and
   nanotwinned-nanocrystalline metals. These findings are of practical
   value for the use of nanotwinned metallic and semiconductor nanowires in
   strain-engineered functional microdevices.}},

Abstract = {{Energy harvesting from ambient sources is emerging as a sustainable and
   environment-friendly technique to prolong the lifetime of wireless
   devices. However, harvesting energy from these sources may not be
   feasible for quality-of- service (QoS)-constrained wireless
   applications. As such, dedicated wireless-powered cellular networks
   (WPCNs) are currently being investigated to ensure the reliability as
   well as improved battery lifetime of the wireless devices. With emerging
   WPCNs, a true wireless network can be envisioned, which is free of
   connectors, cables, and battery access panels, and guarantees freedom of
   mobility. To illustrate and understand the design requirements of WPCNs,
   this article first points out the key challenges of designing
   energy-harvesting cellular networks. These include the doubly near-far
   problem, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) outage experienced by the
   energy-harvesting devices located toward the cell-edge, the spatial
   characterization of the SNR outage zone, the additional resource
   consumption at energy transmitting sources, and the problems related to
   designing fairness-constrained user scheduling schemes. A brief overview
   of the related research advancements in WPCNs and a summary of their
   limitations are then provided. Finally, we list a few suggestions and
   design considerations that can potentially tackle the major challenges
   in emerging WPCNs and open up new research directions.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate optimal call admission control (CAC) policy for multicast
   streaming services (MSS) in 3rd generation (3G) and beyond wireless
   mobile networks. Several MSS sessions are supported simultaneously in a
   bandwidth-limited network. Active sessions are those that are currently
   serving some users, and inactive sessions are those that are currently
   not serving any users. An admission decision in MSS is required only
   when an inactive session is requested, unlike in unicasting. For this
   reason, if a user request for an inactive MSS session arrives, we should
   make an admission decision in anticipation of (i) the possible reward
   earned based on users served during a session active time generated by
   accepting it, and (ii) the influence of the session active time upon the
   future status of network bandwidth and admission decisions. Our
   objective is to determine when to admit or block a user asking an
   inactive MSS session to achieve the optimality in rewards. We formulate
   this problem as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP), and a value
   iteration algorithm is used to obtain an optimal stationary
   deterministic policy. We also derive the user blocking probability of
   the optimal policy by analyzing an embedded Markov chain induced by it.}},

Title = {{Neutrophil migration under spatially-varying chemoattractant gradient
   profiles}},

Abstract = {{Chemotaxis plays an important role in biological processes such as
   cancer metastasis, embryogenesis, wound healing, and immune response.
   Neutrophils are the frontline defenders against invasion of foreign
   microorganisms into our bodies. To achieve this important immune
   function, a neutrophil can sense minute chemoattractant concentration
   differences across its cell body and effectively migrate toward the
   chemoattractant source. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in various
   studies that neutrophils are highly sensitive to changes in the
   surrounding chemoattractant environments, suggesting the role of a
   chemotactic memory for processing the complex spatiotemporal chemical
   guiding signals. Using a microfluidic device, in the present study we
   characterized neutrophil migration under spatially varying profiles of
   interleukine-8 gradients, which consist of three spatially ordered
   regions of a shallow gradient, a steep gradient and a nearly saturated
   gradient. This design allowed us to examine how neutrophils migrate
   under different chemoattractant gradient profiles, and how the migratory
   response is affected when the cell moves from one gradient profile to
   another in a single experiment. Our results show robust neutrophil
   chemotaxis in the shallow and steep gradient, but not the saturated
   gradient. Furthermore, neutrophils display a transition from chemotaxis
   to flowtaxis when they migrate across the steep gradient interface, and
   the relative efficiency of this transition depends on the cell's
   chemotaxis history. Finally, some neutrophils were observed to adjust
   their morphology to different gradient profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Particle size distribution (PSD) in distiller's spent grain compacts was

   Volumetric change and stress-relaxation characteristics, in terms of
   hardness and asymptotic modulus (EA) for a 40\% deformation, were
   analysed during the warm-up period (5 s) and after reaching the moisture
   levels of 40, 30 and 20\% (w.b.) in SS. Results showed that particle
   size was inversely correlated with the expansion or the increase in
   volume of the compact during SS drying, and the hardness as well as the
   EA of the compact increased with a decrease in particle size of the
   compact. A stepwise regression method was used to determine appropriate
   variables for developing a multiple linear regression model for
   predicting the EA of the compact. (c) 2015 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{BackgroundSignificant numbers of patients with obsessive compulsive
   disorder (OCD) respond minimally to currently available treatments.
   Furthermore, the application of both high- and low-frequency repetitive
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex has shown to be ineffective in the reduction of OCD symptoms. In
   this study, we instead targeted the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and
   applied low-frequency rTMS to patients with OCD and assessed their
   clinical response.
   MethodsIn an open-label design, 10 OCD patients with no other current
   axis I psychiatric disorders were recruited. Twelve hundred pulses of
   1-Hz frequency were applied over the mPFC (Brodmann areas 24 and 32)
   using a double-cone coil for 10 days. Regions of interest were located
   on participants' MRIs using neuronavigation software. Patients' symptoms
   were rated using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS).
   ResultsAll patients demonstrated improvement in their OCD symptoms after
   10 sessions of rTMS as shown by a mean improvement in Y-BOCS score of
   39\% (SD = 15\%; P < .001, F = 62.95). This improvement persisted 1
   month following the last session of rTMS.
   ConclusionsOur results suggest the use of low frequency deep rTMS as a
   promising and robust intervention in OCD symptom reduction. However,
   this study is limited by its open-label nature and its lack of a control
   group, so further randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm these
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Electrocochleography (ECOG) is a low-amplitude electrophysiological
   measurement technique primarily used as an assistive tool for the
   diagnosis of M,niSre's disease. Of the two types of ECOG, transtympanic
   (TT) and extratympanic (ET), ET-ECOG has gained popularity due to its
   noninvasive nature; however, it suffers from increased susceptibility to
   various types of noise, due to the low-signal amplitude (similar to 1 A
   mu V scale) associated with the method. Therefore, reliably obtaining
   ECOG recordings involves an environment that minimally interferes with
   the recording, a low-noise signal recorder, and a carefully executed
   recording protocol. We propose a new method that involves a modified ear
   electrode and electrode placement protocol that offers a solution to
   reducing noise in ET-ECOG. Noise suppression is achieved by minimizing
   background biological noise, and thermal noise from electrode
   impedances, which were identified to be the main contributors to signal
   degradation in ET-ECOG. Results show that the proposed method yields a >
   2.6 dB improvement in SNR in comparison with the conventional method (p
   < 0.05); thus, a SNR obtained with similar to 880 repetitions using
   conventional method can be achieved with similar to 360 repetitions.
   Improved SNR demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of
   achieving faster recordings, while maintaining similar or better SNR
   compared to conventional methods.}},

Title = {{The influence of foot orthoses on foot mobility magnitude and arch

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Flexible flat foot is described as a reduction in the height
   of the medial longitudinal arch and may occur from abnormal foot
   pronation. A foot orthosis is thought to modify and control excessive
   pronation and improve arch height.
   Objective: To compare the immediate effect of three types of orthoses on
   foot mobility and the arch height index in subjects with flexible flat
   feet.
   Study design: A quasi-experimental study.
   Method: The dorsal arch height, midfoot width, foot mobility and arch
   height index were assessed in 20 participants with flexible flat feet
   (mean age = 23.2 3 years) for three different foot orthosis conditions:
   soft, semi-rigid and rigid University of California Biomechanics
   Laboratory (UCBL).
   Results: Maximum midfoot width at 90\% with arch mobility in the coronal
   plane was shown in the semi-rigid orthosis condition. The semi-rigid
   orthosis resulted in the highest mean foot mobility in 90\% of weight
   bearing, and the rigid orthosis (UCBL) had the lowest mean foot
   mobility. The soft orthosis resulted in foot mobility between that of
   the rigid and the semi-rigid orthosis. UCBL orthosis showed the highest
   arch height index, and the semi-rigid orthosis showed the lowest mean
   arch height index.
   Conclusion: Due to its rigid structure and long medial-lateral walls,
   the UCBL orthosis appears to limit foot mobility. Therefore, it is
   necessary to make an orthosis that facilitates foot mobility in the
   normal range of the foot arch. Future studies should address the dynamic
   mobility of the foot with using various types of foot orthoses.
   Clinical relevance Although there are many studies focussed on flat foot
   and the use of foot orthoses, the mechanism of action is still unclear.
   This study explored foot mobility and the influence of foot orthoses and
   showed that a more rigid foot orthosis should be selected based on foot
   mobility.}},

Abstract = {{In modular hip implants, fretting corrosion at the head/neck and
   neck/stem interfaces has been identified as a major cause of early
   revision in hip implants, particularly those with heads larger than 32
   mm. It has been found that the type of fluid used to simulate the
   fretting corrosion of biomedical materials is crucial for the
   reliability of laboratory tests. Therefore, to properly understand and
   effectively design against fretting corrosion damage in modular hips,
   there is the need to replicate the human body environment as closely as
   possible during in vitro testing. In this work, corrosion and fretting
   corrosion behavior of CoCrMo in 0.14 M NaCl, phosphate buffered saline,
   and in a clinically relevant novel simulated body fluid was studied
   using a variety of electrochemical characterization techniques and
   tribological experiments. Electrochemical, spectroscopy and
   tribo-electrochemical techniques employed include Potentiodynamic
   polarization, Potentiostatic polarization, Electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, augur electron
   spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, and
   pin-on-disk wear simulation. The presence of phosphate ions in PBS
   accounted for the higher corrosion rate when compared with 0.14 M NaCl
   and the clinically relevant novel simulated body fluid. The low
   corrosion rates and the nature of the protective passive film formed in
   the clinically relevant simulated body fluid make it suitable for future
   corrosion and fretting corrosion studies.}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: This paper presents an approach to numerical modeling of
   hypervelocity impact on carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP).
   Methods: The approach is based on the detailed meso-scale representation
   of a composite laminate. Material models suitable for explicit modeling
   of laminate structure, including fiber-reinforced layers and resin-rich
   regions, are described. Two numerical impact tests with significantly
   different impact energies were conducted on thermoplastic AS4/PEEK
   materials with quasi-isotropic layups. Simulations employed both SPH and
   Finite element methods.
   Results: Results of simulations are verified against experimental data
   available from the literature and demonstrate good correlation with the
   experiments.
   Conclusions: Developed modeling approach can be used in simulations
   where post-impact damage progression in composite material is of the
   main focus. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common lung disease
   characterized by breathing difficulty as a consequence of narrowed
   airways. Previous studies have shown that COPD is correlated with
   neutrophil infiltration into the airways through chemotactic migration.
   However, whether neutrophil chemotaxis can be used to characterize and
   diagnose COPD is not well established. In the present study, we
   developed a microfluidic platform for evaluating neutrophil chemotaxis
   to sputum samples from COPD patients. Our results show increased
   neutrophil chemotaxis to COPD sputum compared to control sputum from
   healthy individuals. The level of COPD sputum induced neutrophil
   chemotaxis was correlated with the patient's spirometry data. The cell
   morphology of neutrophils in a COPD sputum gradient is similar to the
   morphology displayed by neutrophils exposed to an IL-8 gradient, but not
   a fMLP gradient. In competing gradients of COPD sputum and fMLP,
   neutrophils chemotaxis and cell morphology are dominated by fMLP.}},

Abstract = {{The reconstruction of the dielectric profile of snow-covered sea ice
   from simulated bistatic radar cross-section data is investigated. To
   this end, a cost function representing the discrepancy between the true
   radar cross-section data and the calculated radar cross-section data due
   to a predicted dielectric profile is formed. This cost function is
   iteratively minimized using the differential evolution algorithm so as
   to reconstruct the unknown dielectric profile. Herein, four different
   formulations for this cost function are considered. These formulations
   are distinguished by their utilized weighting factors for each data
   point within the bistatic radar cross-section data set. Although these
   cost functions use the same simulated bistatic normalized radar
   cross-section data set, it will be shown that the reconstruction
   accuracy achievable from each of them will be different. Finally, an
   appropriate weighting scheme for bistatic data sets, which emphasizes
   the scattering data points collected at the vicinity of the specular
   angle, is presented. It will be shown that the use of this weighting
   scheme results in enhanced reconstruction accuracy as compared to the
   other formulations. It is speculated that the proposed weighting scheme
   balances the individual data points more properly, thus, resulting in
   enhanced accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Seed distribution in soil has important implications for agronomic
   performance of crop and design and evaluation of seeding equipment.
   Measurements were performed in two fields. One field was seeded with pea
   crop using a side-band opener, and the other field was seeded with
   canola crop using a single-row opener and a paired-row opener. Positions
   of seed in soil were measured in three dimensions (along the crop row,
   lateral, and vertical directions). Early crop growth characteristics
   (plant height and plant dry weight) were also measured. Results showed
   that laterally seeds were spread as wide as 60 mm in the soil by the
   side-band opener, 94 mm by the single-row opener, and 250 mm by the
   paired-row opener. Horizontally, seeds were highly scattered, and the
   average absolute. seed spacing was 48, 50, and 75 mm for the side-band,
   single-row, and paired-row openers respectively. Vertically, the
   side-band opener placed pea seeds at an average depth of 39 mm (SD: 13

Abstract = {{Modern industrial tote dumpers and lifters are equipped with long-stroke
   single-rod hydraulic cylinders. For years, valve-controlled cylinders
   have been used in tote dumpers. Valve-controlled actuators are highly
   inefficient due to huge power losses in throttling valves. They also
   need a cooling system to remove the wasted heat energy from the
   hydraulic oil. This article introduces a low-cost throttle-less
   hydraulic circuit to control the single-rod cylinder of a tote dumper.
   The system consists of a motor-driven gear pump, an On/Off solenoid
   valve, to redirect the differential flow of the single-rod hydraulic
   cylinder and a counterbalance valve, which makes the circuit
   controllable for assisting loads and keeps the load in position with no
   effort from the hydraulic pump. Experimental results demonstrate the
   performance of the circuit. A test rig has been designed to simulate a
   lifting load. The energy efficiency of the circuit is determined by
   comparing a valve-controlled circuit with the proposed circuit. The
   proposed circuit composition is not only efficient and simple but is
   also accurate in terms of position response using a proportional
   controller. The circuit is easy to control since the only needed
   measurement is the displacement of the actuator. The circuit, however,
   does not recycle energy.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in self-interference cancellation techniques enable
   in-band full-duplex (FD) transmission in which a wireless node can
   simultaneously transmit and receive in the same frequency band. However,

   layer issues such as inter-node collisions, fairness between half-duplex
   (HD) and FD users, opportunistic selection of different modes of FD
   transmission, and synchronization issues need to be resolved. To this
   end, this article first discusses the fundamental concepts, potential
   benefits, and primary network topologies of FD transmission. We then
   highlight immediate challenges (both in the PHY and MAC layers) that
   need to be addressed in designing FD wireless systems. A qualitative
   comparison among the existing full-duplex MAC (FD-MAC) protocols is then
   provided. Finally, the primary requirements and research issues for the
   design of FD-MAC protocols are discussed, and implications of FD

Abstract = {{While cognitive radio enables spectrum-efficient wireless communication,
   radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting from ambient interference is an
   enabler for energy-efficient wireless communication. In this paper, we
   model and analyze cognitive and energy harvesting-based device-to-device
   (D2D) communication in cellular networks. The cognitive D2D transmitters
   harvest energy from ambient interference and use one of the channels
   allocated to cellular users (in uplink or downlink), which is referred
   to as the D2D channel, to communicate with the corresponding receivers.
   We investigate two spectrum access policies for cellular communication
   in the uplink or downlink, namely, random spectrum access (RSA) policy
   and prioritized spectrum access (PSA) policy. In RSA, any of the
   available channels including the channel used by the D2D transmitters
   can be selected randomly for cellular communication, while in PSA the
   D2D channel is used only when all of the other channels are occupied. A
   D2D transmitter can communicate successfully with its receiver only when
   it harvests enough energy to perform channel inversion toward the
   receiver, the D2D channel is free, and the
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiver is above
   the required threshold; otherwise, an outage occurs for the D2D
   communication. We use tools from stochastic geometry to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed communication system model with general
   path-loss exponent in terms of outage probability for D2D and cellular
   users. We show that energy harvesting can be a reliable alternative to
   power cognitive D2D transmitters while achieving acceptable performance.
   Under the same SINR outage requirements as for the non-cognitive case,
   cognitive channel access improves the outage probability for D2D users
   for both the spectrum access policies. When compared with the RSA
   policy, the PSA policy provides a better performance to the D2D users.
   Also, using an uplink channel provides improved performance to the D2D
   users in dense networks when compared to a downlink channel. For
   cellular users, the PSA policy provides almost the same outage
   performance as the RSA policy.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Base flow recession analysis is required to estimate the long-term,
   reliable component of the hydrograph and water cycle, and for drought
   management, inflow design and analysis, and contaminant and nutrient
   transport. Operationally, recursive digital filtering (RDF) techniques
   are commonly applied; however, questions have been raised about the
   reliability and parameterization of these methods. A comparison of three
   base flow separation methods, including two popular RDFs and one
   hydrologic model, is performed in two base flow-dominant subbasins of
   the Grand River Basin in southern Ontario, Canada. The Eramosa River and
   Whiteman's Creek subbasins are similar in size (236 and 383km2,
   respectively) and have similar annual runoff distributions yet
   significantly different physiography governing runoff generation.
   Subbasin physiographic characteristics are found to result in
   significant differences in annual base flow distributions, which are
   well captured by the hydrologic model but not by the RDFs. Stable water
   isotopes (SWIs) are applied for verification of base flow separations
   using two-component mixing model separations and show better visual
   agreement with a base flow derived from the hydrologic model over the
   RDF methods. Limitations include insufficient isotope data to quantify a
   statistically significant model fit and results that are tied to
   subbasin physiography and basin-specific processes. Results support the
   application of SWIs for regional hydrograph separation and highlight the
   need for more efficient, yet physically based base flow separation in
   regions with complex physiography.}},

Abstract = {{Elastic and hardness properties of LiMn2O4 particles extracted from
   commercially available Li-ion batteries are investigated under different
   States of Charge (SoC). Instrumented indentation was used for
   quantitative measurements. It was found that the particles become
   stiffer for increasing SoC, ranging from 87 GPa (0\% SoC) to 104 GPa
   (100\% SoC). Nanoindentation could also detect dissimilar properties
   between particles of a same cathode. As its spatial resolution is
   limited, atomic force acoustic microscopy (AFAM) was used to generate
   stiffness maps. By combining it with micro-Raman spectroscopy as well as
   Electron Back-Scattered Diffraction (EBSD), elastic isotropy and
   homogeneity within single particles were found. On the other hand,
   different neighboring particles present different states of lithiation
   and stiffnesses. For reference, a \{1 1 1\} LiMn2O4 wafer was also
   synthesized and characterized. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{Modal strain energy (MSE) is a sensitive physical property that can be
   utilized as a damage index in structural health monitoring. Inverse
   problem solving-based approaches using single-objective optimization
   algorithms are also a promising damage identification method. However,
   the research into the integration of these methods is currently limited;
   only partial success in the detection of structural damage with high
   errors has been reported. The majority of previous research was focused
   on detecting damage in simply supported beams or plain structures. In
   this study, a novel damage detection approach using hybrid
   multiobjective optimization algorithms based on MSE is proposed to
   detect damages in various three-dimensional (3-D) steel structures.
   Minor damages have little effect on the difference of the modal
   properties of the structure, and thus such damages with multiple
   locations in a structure are difficult to detect using traditional
   damage detection methods based on modal properties. Various minor damage
   scenarios are created for the 3-D structures to investigate the newly
   proposed multiobjective approach. The proposed hybrid multiobjective
   genetic algorithm detects the exact locations and extents of the induced
   minor damages in the structure. Even though it uses incomplete mode
   shapes, which do not have any measured information at the damaged
   element, the proposed approach detects damage well. The robustness of
   the proposed method is investigated by adding 5\% Gaussian random white
   noise as a noise effect to mode shapes, which are used in the
   calculation ofMSE.}},

Abstract = {{Results from an experimental investigation showed that the formation of
   adiabatic shear bands (ASBs) in heat treated AISI 4340 steel is a
   microstructural phenomenon which depends highly on the grain size,
   shape, and orientation in the microstructure prior to deformation. Prior
   heat treatment (at various austenizing and tempering temperatures), as
   well as testing parameters, such as initial temperature and deformation
   strain rate, were shown to affect grain size in the steel tested.
   Optical microscopic examination of the microstructure showed that ASBs,
   formed in heat treated steel, exhibited zones of high hardness and small
   grain size. In specimens where ASBs formed, a progressive reorientation
   and elongation of the grain structure in the direction of maximum shear
   was observed. A much more refined grain structure was observed at the
   center of the bands. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effects of ozone as a stand-alone and coagulation-aid treatment on the
   reduction of trihalomethanes precursors from high DOC and hardness water}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{171-180}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the effect of ozone as a stand-alone and
   coagulation aid on the removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from
   the water with a high level of DOC (13.8 mgL(-1)) and calcium hardness
   (270 mgL(-1)) CaCO3.
   Natural water collected from the Assiniboine River (Manitoba, Canada)
   was used in this study.
   Effectiveness of ozone treatment was evaluated by measurement of DOC,
   DOC fractions, UV254, and trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP).
   Additionally, zeta potential and dissolved calcium concentration were
   measured to discern the mechanism of ozone reactions.
   Results indicated that 0.8 mg O-3/mg DOC ozone stand-alone can cause up
   to 86\% UV254 reduction and up to 27\% DOG reduction.
   DOC fractionation results showed that ozone can change the composition
   of DOC in the water samples, converting the hydrophobic fractions into
   hydrophilic ones and resulting in the reduction of THMFP. Also, ozone
   caused a decrease in particle stability and dissolved calcium
   concentration. These simultaneous ozonation effects caused improved
   water flocculation and enhanced removal of DOC. This resulted in
   reduction of the coagulant dosage when ozone doses higher than 0.2 mg
   O-3/mg DOG were applied prior to coagulation with ferric sulfate. Also,
   pre-ozonation-coagulation process achieved preferential THMFP removal
   for all of the ozone doses tested (0-0.8 mg O-3/mg DOC), leading to a
   lower specific THMFP in pre-ozonated-coagulated waters than in the
   corresponding ozonated waters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe the development of a new clinically applicable
   method for assessing vestibular function in humans with particular
   application in Meniere's disease.
   Study design: Sophisticated signal-processing techniques were applied to
   data from human subject undergoing tilts stimulating the otolith organs
   and semicircular canals. The most sensitive representatives of
   vestibular function were extracted as ``features{''}.
   Methods: After careful consideration of expected response features,
   Electrovestibulography, a modified electrocochleography, recordings were
   performed on fourteen Meniere's patients and sixteen healthy controls
   undergoing controlled tilts. The data were subjected to multiple signal
   processing techniques to determine which ``features{''} were most
   predictive of vestibular responses.
   Results: Linear discriminant analysis and fractal dimension may allow
   data from a single tilt to be used to adequately characterize the
   vestibular system.
   Conclusion: Objective, physiologic assessment of vestibular function may
   become realistic with application of modern signal processing

Abstract = {{In this article, we report a numerical and experimental study of
   turbulent dispersion of a passive scalar released from a continuous
   ground-level point source in a staggered array of 16x16 cubical
   obstacles. Experimental measurements of the flow and dispersion were

   fluorescence (for concentration) and laser Doppler velocimetry (for
   velocity). Numerical simulations of the flow and scalar fields for this
   experimental configuration were performed using two in-house computer
   codes based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) method.
   Results of a detailed comparison between water-channel measurements and
   model predictions of the mean flow, turbulence kinetic energy, mean
   concentration, and concentration variance are presented. An advanced
   model for the concentration variance dissipation rate is validated in
   the new context of plume dispersion within and above a staggered array

Abstract = {{Virtual fixtures can be used in haptic-enabled hydraulic
   telemanipulators to facilitate certain tasks. Using this concept,
   however, the operator may tend to move the master fast due to relying on
   the virtual fixture. As a result, the slave manipulator could start to
   lag due to latency in the hydraulic actuation control system. This paper
   describes how to mitigate the position errors between master and slave
   robots by overlaying an augmentation force on the master that is
   collinear but opposite of the master instantaneous velocity. The
   magnitude of this force is proportional to the position error at the
   slave end-effector. Experiments, conducted on a teleoperated hydraulic
   manipulator to perform several live-line maintenance tasks, show that
   the augmented scheme exhibits less position error at the slave side,
   better task quality, but longer task completion time as compared to the
   virtual fixture alone. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{T lymphocyte migration is crucial for adaptive immunity. Manipulation of
   signaling molecules controlling cell migration combined with in-vitro
   cell migration analysis provides a powerful research approach.
   Microfluidic devices, which can precisely configure chemoattractant
   gradients and allow quantitative single cell analysis, have been
   increasingly applied to cell migration and chemotaxis studies. However,
   there are a very limited number of published studies involving
   microfluidic migration analysis of genetically manipulated immune cells.
   In this study, we describe a simple microfluidic method for quantitative
   analysis of T cells expressing transfected chemokine receptors and other
   cell migration signaling probes. Using this method, we demonstrated
   chemotaxis of Jurkat transfectants expressing wild-type or C-terminus
   mutated CCR7 within,a gradient of chemokine CCL19, and characterized the
   difference in transfectant migration mediated by wild-type and mutant
   CCR7. The EGFP-tagged CCR7 allows identification of CCR7-expressing
   transfectants in cell migration analysis and microscopy assessment of
   CCR7 dynamics. Collectively, our study demonstrated the effective use of
   the microfluidic method for studying CCR7 mediated T cell transfectant
   migration. We envision this developed method will provide a useful
   platform to functionally test various signaling mechanisms at the cell
   migration level. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A fast and efficient forward scattering solver is developed for use in
   ultrasound tomography. The solver is formulated so as to enable the
   calculation of scattering from large and relatively high-contrast
   objects with inhomogeneous physical properties that vary simultaneously
   in acoustic attenuation, compressibility, and density. It is based on
   the method of moments in conjunction with a novel implementation of the
   conjugate gradient algorithm which requires the use of the adjoints of
   the scattering operators. The solver takes advantage of the symmetric
   block Toeplitz matrix with symmetric Toeplitz blocks property of the
   Green's function matrix to increase efficiency and only stores the first
   row of this matrix to reduce memory requirements. This row is then used
   for the matrix-vector multiplication using the fast Fourier transform
   technique, thus, resulting in the computational complexity of O(n log
   n). The marching-on-source technique is also used to provide a good
   initial guess which allows the conjugate gradient technique to converge
   faster than initializing with an arbitrary guess. This feature is
   important in tomographic inversion algorithms which require that the
   object to be imaged be interrogated via several incident fields. Forward
   scattering and inversion examples, based on the Conjugate Gradient Least
   Squares regularized Born Iterative Method, are shown, in two-dimensions,
   for objects varying in all three physical properties. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{An approach to transmitting multiple correlated sources over a Gaussian
   multiple-access channel (GMAC) using code-division multiple-access
   (CDMA) is investigated. A block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is
   presented which can be used to optimize CDMA signatures for a given
   source covariance matrix under individual transmitter power constraints.
   This algorithm can be used to design non-orthogonal CDMA signatures for
   GMACs with arbitrary input alphabets, fading, and colored noise. While
   the main focus has been the design of signatures which minimize the mean
   square error (MSE) of linear decoding, the algorithm can also be used to
   design signatures which maximize the input-output mutual information of
   the channel. This paper investigates the uncoded transmission of
   Gaussian sources and the coded transmission of binary sources over a
   GMAC using joint source-channel (JSC) optimized CDMA signatures under
   constraints on transmitter power and channel bandwidth, scenarios
   relevant to wireless sensor networks. By using simple coding schemes
   which only rely on linear multi-user detection and independent channel
   decoding of a large number of sources, it is demonstrated that
   CDMA-based JSC coding can exploit inter-source correlation to achieve
   lower distortion (Gaussian sources) or higher rates (binary sources)
   compared to conventional separate source-channel (SSC) coding over the
   same channel bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{Clostridium thermocellum produces ethanol as one of its major end
   products from direct fermentation of cellulosic biomass. Therefore, it
   is viewed as an attractive model for the production of biofuels via
   consolidated bioprocessing. However, a better understanding of the
   metabolic pathways, along with their putative regulation, could lead to
   improved strategies for increasing the production of ethanol. In the
   absence of an annotated pyruvate kinase in the genome, alternate means
   of generating pyruvate have been sought. Previous proteomic and
   transcriptomic work detected high levels of a malate dehydrogenase and
   malic enzyme, which may be used as part of a malate shunt for the
   generation of pyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate. The purification and
   characterization of the malate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme are
   described in order to elucidate their putative roles in malate shunt and
   their potential role in Clostridium thermocellum metabolism. The malate
   dehydrogenase catalyzed the reduction of oxaloacetate to malate
   utilizing NADH or NADPH with a k(cat) of 45.8 s(-1) or 14.9 s(-1),
   respectively, resulting in a 12-fold increase in catalytic efficiency
   when using NADH over NADPH. The malic enzyme displayed reversible malate
   decarboxylation activity with a k(cat) of 520.8 s(-1). The malic enzyme
   used NADP(+) as a cofactor along with NH4+ and Mn2+ as activators.
   Pyrophosphate was found to be a potent inhibitor of malic enzyme
   activity, with a K-i of 0.036 mM. We propose a putative regulatory
   mechanism of the malate shunt by pyrophosphate and NH4+ based on the
   characterization of the malate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the applicability of averaged-value models

   Analysis results show that the AVM is only effective as long as the

   each MMC sub-module. This paper also shows that previously developed MMC
   averaged models are not able to accurately simulate the transients under
   dc fault conditions. This paper introduces topology changes to a
   previously proposed averaged model that results in much improved
   simulation for such conditions. This paper also shows that the model can

Abstract = {{This paper reports an experimental investigation on the flow
   characteristics upstream of a lifted turbulent diffusion flame in the
   presence of a coflow. Three fuel nozzles made of a long pipe with
   different outlet geometry were examined. One pair of these nozzles has
   the same orifice diameter but different normalized lip thickness, and
   another pair has the same normalized lip thickness but different orifice
   diameter. The strength of the co-airflow was also varied to assess its
   impact on the liftoff height of the jet diffusion flame. Previously
   published studies reported the existence of a hysteresis phenomenon in
   the liftoff height of a turbulent diffusion flame in the presence of a
   high co-airflow. That is, as the fuel velocity decreases, the lifted
   flame base would first move upstream (toward the burner) to a local
   minima followed by a downstream movement before its reattachment. The
   results of the present study, however, showed that such a phenomenon
   does not appear for a fuel pipe having a very small lip thickness. The
   present results also revealed that in the hysteresis region, the flame
   base sits where the turbulence intensity experiences its local maxima in
   the upcoming unburnt mixture. This corroborates the premixed stability
   theory which is based on turbulence intensity. Based on this, a
   correlation was found between the flame liftoff height in the hysteresis
   region and the fuel and co-airflow velocity at the nozzle exit. This
   relationship predicts successfully the liftoff height trend as a
   function of the fuel jet and co-airflow velocity and nozzle geometry.
   Away from the hysteresis region, however, the flame base location tends
   more toward the outside of the local turbulence intensity maxima. This
   indicates the limitations of the premixed stability theory in predicting
   the flame behavior in this region where the effect of the flow
   large-scale structures becomes important.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of colloidal nanosilica on the fresh and rheological
   parameters, plastic shrinkage, heat of hydration, and compressive
   strength of cement-based grouts is investigated in this paper. The fresh
   and rheological properties were evaluated by the minislump flow, Marsh
   cone flow time, Lombardi plate cohesion meter, yield value, and plastic
   viscosity. The key parameters investigated were the dosages of
   nanosilica and superplasticizer and temperature of mixing water.
   Statistical models and isoresponse curves were developed to capture the
   significant trends. The dosage of nanosilica had a significant effect on
   the results. The increase in the dosage of nanosilica led to increasing
   the values of flow time, plate cohesion meter, yield stress, plastic
   viscosity, heat of hydration at 1 day and 3 days, and compressive
   strength at 1 day, while reducing the minislump, plastic shrinkage up 24
   h, and compressive strength at 3, 7, and 28 days. Conversely, the
   increase in the dosage of superplasticizer led to decreasing the values
   of flow time, plate cohesion meter, yield stress, plastic viscosity,
   heat of hydration at 1 day and 3 days, and compressive strength at 1
   day, while increasing the minislump, plastic shrinkage, and compressive
   strength at 3 and 7 days. Increasing the temperature of mixing water led
   to a notable increase in the results of minislump, flow time, plastic
   viscosity, heat of hydration at 3 days, and compressive strength at 1
   day, while it reduced the plate cohesion, compressive strength at 3, 7,
   and 28 days. The statistical models developed in this study can
   facilitate optimizing the mixture proportions of grouts for target
   performance by reducing the number of trial batches needed. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The warehouse beetle, Trogoderma variabile Ballion (Coleoptera:

   emerged as adults in 50 days. Diapausing larvae died after 142 days in
   the 10th instar. The cold tolerance at 0 degrees C from highest to
   lowest was; old larvae > pupae > adult = young larvae > eggs. The LT50
   (lethal time for 50\% of the population) for grouped (non-diapause)
   non-acclimated old larvae at 0 degrees C, -5 degrees C, -10 degrees C,
   -16 degrees C, and -19 degrees C were; 20, 11, 5, 1, and 1 day, the LT95

Title = {{Monitoring acidic and basic volatile concentration using a pH-electrode

Abstract = {{present a near-field coupled passive sensor capable of measuring acidic
   and basic volatile concentration in its surrounding environment. The
   sensor employs an LC resonant circuit consisting of a spiral inductor
   connected in parallel with a voltage dependent capacitor (varactor). The
   volatile detector comprises a hydrogel coated pH-sensitive electrode
   pair connected in parallel with the varactor. The hydrogel is used as an
   absorptive medium for the volatiles and acts to contain the electrolyte.
   On absorption of the acidic or basic volatiles the hydrogel pH changes,
   which in turn changes the voltage across the pH-sensitive electrode pair
   shifting the resonant frequency of the sensor. An interrogator coil is
   inductively coupled to the sensor inductor and remotely tracks the
   resonant frequency of the sensor. The ability to sense and quantify
   different concentration levels of ammonia and acetic acid vapor is
   demonstrated. The sensor has a linear response to the logarithm of the
   volatile concentration and a detection limit of 1.5 ppm and 2 ppm for
   ammonia, and acetic acid vapor, respectively. Effects of varying
   relative humidity, temperature and hydrogel coating thickness on the
   sensor's performance are presented. Exhibiting a response time of less
   than 20 min and irreversible operation in a closed environment, the
   sensor has potential in packaged food condition monitoring. (C) 2014

Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{Inclusion of statistical knowledge of the primary user (PU) channel
   usage had shown to be beneficial in dynamic spectrum access. Motivated
   by this fact, this paper investigated the importance of collecting and
   using statistics on neighboring secondary users (SUs) in selecting
   channels in addition to the knowledge of PU channel usage. The paper
   assumed that PU traffic characteristics of the channels are included in
   the radio environment map in the form of probabilistic suffix trees,
   which is a sequence predictor based on Markov property. In the proposed
   method, an intelligent sequence hopping-based common control channel and
   a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)/collision avoidance (CA)-based
   medium access control (MAC) protocol were introduced. As shown in the
   paper, selecting channels using statistics of both the neighboring SUs
   and PUs reduced the number of packet collisions compared to a scheme
   which only uses PU statistics. Furthermore, the simulation results
   showed that the scheme proposed had better throughput performance with
   respect to both the random channel selection scheme and the scheme which
   only uses PU statistics while having less training complexity.}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Marine hydrokinetic turbines experience non-uniform inflow conditions
   due currents, geometrical changes in water boundaries, objects located
   upstream in the flow, and flow disturbances from other marine turbines
   when multiple units are installed. This paper reports on a series of
   water tunnel testing to investigate the performance of a two bladed
   squirrel cage vertical marine kinetic turbine that more closely
   simulates an array of turbines with one diameter center to canter
   spacing operating in the wake zone. It provides general results how
   their performance is affected by wake structures. In this study wakes
   are created by different sizes of circular cylinders placed at various
   longitudinal and lateral upstream locations. Results show that a
   cylinder placed 1.5 diameters upstream of a turbine and centered with
   the turbine rotational axis has the most power reduction effect.
   However, moving the cylinders laterally moderates the negative effect of
   an upstream cylinder and can even improve the performance of a turbine
   by up to 35\% in a laboratory setting due to velocity enhancements on
   the high torque region of the rotating blade. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the flow characteristics within the

   image velocimetry technique. Measurements were performed for four nozzle
   offset height ratios of 0, 2, 4 and 8. The discharged jet entrained the
   ambient fluid as depicted by streamlines superimposed on the mean
   velocity contours. Analysis of the flow field showed that the maximum
   streamwise mean velocity decay rate increased with increasing offset
   height ratio. Wall-normal spread rates of 0.066 and 0.016 were obtained
   for jets with offset height ratios of 0 and 2, respectively, and lateral
   spread rates of 0.116, 0.114 and 0.096 for jets with offset height
   ratios of 0, 2 and 4, respectively. The reattachment lengths of the jets
   increased with increasing offset height ratio. Profiles of the mean
   velocities, Reynolds stresses and some of the budget terms
   (specifically, production, diffusion and convective terms) of the
   turbulent kinetic energy have been investigated. It was observed that
   increasing the offset height ratio influenced the distribution of these
   quantities within the recirculation region. A two-point velocity
   correlation analysis was performed to analyse the flow structures within
   the recirculation region. The two-point correlation revealed some
   large-scale structures which were observed to increase in size as the
   offset height ratio increased. The two-point correlation analysis also
   revealed that the estimated integral length scales within the
   recirculation region of the flow increased with increasing offset height
   ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Among the risks that the changing climate trends pose to various

   general, the effects of climate change on the quality of stored grain
   can be considered direct or indirect. Direct effects include role of
   climate change on the growth and developmental cycles of biotic
   components such as insect pests and indirect effects include the effect
   of rising global temperatures on grain drying conditions and other
   post-harvest unit operations that would ultimately affect stored grain
   quality. The effects on stored grains forecasted in both tropical and
   temperate regions of the world are summarised. The importance of
   mathematical modelling and the directions for research that can mitigate
   the effects of global climate change on stored food grain are also
   highlighted.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{113-133}},
Month = {{SPR}},
Abstract = {{Fabric, as a flexible formwork for concrete, gives builders, engineers,
   and architects the ability to form virtually any shape. This technique
   produces a superb concrete surface quality that requires no further
   touch up or finishing. Woven polyolefin fabrics are recommended for this
   application. The texture of this fabric allows water from concrete mix
   to bleed, and therefore reduces the water-cement ratio of the mix. Due
   to the reduction in the water-cement ratio, a higher compressive
   strength in fabric-formed concrete is achieved, which is also suggested
   by earlier studies. The current research study was conducted to
   investigate and document the changes in concrete strength and overall
   quality due to these woven polyolefin fabrics. Use of fabric formwork
   will result in a decrease in construction cost, construction waste, and
   greenhouse gas emissions. Two sets of tests were conducted in this
   research study: a comparison of the compressive strength of
   fabric-formed versus PVC-formed concrete cylinders, and a comparison of
   the behaviour of the fabric-formed columns versus cardboard-formed
   reinforced concrete columns. Variables in this research were limited to
   two types of fabric that included one with coarse and one with a more
   refined texture, and two types of concrete that included ordinary and
   flyash concrete.
   The laboratory results revealed that the effects of fabric formwork on
   concrete quality in a large member are limited mostly to the surface
   zone and the core of the concrete remains the same as a conventionally
   formed concrete. Even though fabric-formed cylinder tests showed an
   average of a 15\% increase in compressive strength of the concrete
   samples, the compressive strength of the reinforced columns did not
   dramatically change when compared to the companion cardboard formed
   control columns. This research confirmed that fabric formwork is a
   structurally safe alternative for forming reinforced concrete columns.}},

Abstract = {{A non-linear model that can explain the three-dimensional airflow
   pressure patterns in grains was developed and solved using the finite
   element method The model can simulate airflow distribution in both
   flat-bottom and hopper-bottom bins of different shapes such as square,
   rectangular, or cylindrical. Resistance to airflow through the grain bed
   was explained using a modified form of Darcys' equation. The airflow
   model was validated against experimental data obtained from studies
   conducted in a 4.72 m diameter hopper-bottom bin filled with wheat,
   aerated using a 1.82 m vertical rocket-type aerator. The relative error
   between the experimental and predicted static pressure values for the
   entire bin geometry was less than 3.2\%, with higher values at regions
   near the aerator. The validated model can be used to predict the static
   pressure patterns and airflow distribution (because airflow lines ate
   perpendicular to iso-pressure lines) in various grain beds and can
   handle variations in product type, moisture content, grain surface
   configurations, foreign material content, direction of airflow, and
   aeration duct designs. Using the validated model, airflow pressure
   patterns in a hopper-bottom cylindrical bin with 10 different duct
   configurations were predicted and results were discussed for their
   implications for aeration and near-ambient air drying. The airflow
   pressure patterns as affected by variations in airflow rate, grain
   surface configuration (peaked, levelled and conically cored), bin
   geometry, direction of airflow, and grain bed height (grain filled up to
   40\%, 60\%, and 80\% of the bin height) were also simulated and

Abstract = {{This paper presents the formation of an adaptive virtual array antenna
   in a symmetric parabolic reflector antenna illuminated by trimode
   circular waveguide feeds with different mode alignments. The modes of
   interest are the TE11, TE21, and TM01 type modes. The terms TE and TM
   stand for the transverse electric and transverse magnetic modes,
   respectively. By appropriately exciting these modes and varying the mode
   orientations inside the primary feed, the effective source of radiation
   is displaced on the reflector aperture, while the resulting secondary
   patterns remain axial. Different antenna parameters such as gain, cross
   polarization, and phase center locations are investigated. It is
   demonstrated that the extra third mode facilitates the formation of
   symmetric virtual array antennas with reasonable cross polarization
   discriminations at the diagonal plane.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperspectral imaging has been acknowledged as an emerging technology
   for monitoring quality parameters and improving grading of agricultural
   materials, such as field crops (e.g., cereals, pulses, oil seeds) and
   horticultural crops (e.g., apples, strawberries). It has become a
   popular research tool that facilitates thorough non-destructive analyses
   by simultaneous acquisition of both spectral and spatial information of
   agricultural samples. The technique is an extension of multispectral
   imaging, which provides a large data set by applying conventional
   imaging, radiometry, and spectroscopic principles when acquiring images.
   Hyperspectral imaging was initially used for remote sensing
   applications, but now has been developed to facilitate complete and
   reliable analyses of intrinsic properties and external characteristics
   of samples. This paper reviews applications of using hyperspectral
   imaging for routine grain industry operations such as grading,
   classification, and chemometric analyses of major constituents of
   agricultural materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We determined that the spatial heterogeneity in aquifer properties
   governing the reactive transport of volatile organic contaminants is
   defined by the arrangement of lithofacies. We measured permeability (k)
   and perchloroethene sorption distribution coefficient (K-d) for
   lithofacies that we delineated for samples from the Canadian Forces Base
   Borden Aquifer. We compiled existing data and collected 57 new cores to
   characterize a 30 m section of the aquifer near the test location of
   Mackay et al. (1986). The k and K-d were measured for samples taken at
   six elevations from all cores to create a data set consisting of nearly
   400 colocated measurements. Through analysis of variance (corrected for
   multiple comparisons), we determined that the 12 originally mapped
   lithofacies could be grouped into five relatively distinct
   chemohydrofacies that capture the variability of both transport
   properties. The mean of ln k by lithofacies was related to the grain
   size and the variance was relatively consistent. In contrast, both the
   mean and variance of ln K-d were greater for more poorly sorted
   lithofacies, which were also typically more coarse-grained. Half of the
   aquifer sorption capacity occurred in the three highest-sorbing
   lithofacies but comprised only 20\% of its volume. The model of the
   aquifer that emerged is that of discontinuous scour-fill deposits of
   medium sand, generally characterized by greater K-d and k, within
   laterally extensive fine-grained to very fine-grained sands of lower K-d
   and k. Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering source
   rock composition, transport, and deposition processes when constructing
   conceptual models of chemohydrofacies.}},

Title = {{Ocean wave energy harvesting with a piezoelectric coupled buoy structure}},
Journal = {{APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{110-118}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{An expedient piezoelectric coupled buoy energy harvester from ocean
   waves is developed. The harvester is made of several piezoelectric
   coupled cantilevers attached to a floating buoy structure, which can be
   easily suspended in the intermediate and deep ocean for energy
   harvesting. In the buoy structure, a slender cylindrical floater is
   attached on a large sinker. The energy harvesting process is realized by
   converting the transverse ocean wave energy to the electrical energy via
   the piezoelectric patches mounted on the cantilevers fixed on the buoy.
   A smart design of the buoy structure is developed to increase the energy
   harvesting efficiency by investigation of the effects of the sizes of
   the floater and the sinker. A numerical model is presented to calculate
   the generated electric power from buoy energy harvester. The research
   findings show that up to 24W electric power can be generated by the
   proposed expedient buoy harvester with the length of the piezoelectric
   cantilevers of 1 m and the length of the buoy of 20 m. The technique
   proposed in this research can provide an expedient, feasible and stable
   energy supply from the floating buoy structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this paper, a secure scheme is purposed for coalitional game in
   multi-channel cognitive radio networks. First, a distributed cooperative
   attack on multi-channel cooperative spectrum sensing is proposed. In the
   proposed attack, attackers play two coalitional games to maximize the
   number of invaded channels in a distributed manner. In the first game,
   attackers play with their fellow ones to allocate an optimal number of
   attackers for each channel, while in the second game, they play in the
   coalitions with other honest cognitive radios so as to conquer as many
   channels as possible. Then, a hierarchical ID-based key management
   scheme is proposed, where cognitive radios can only play on a certain
   number of requested channels and channel access for sensing is limited
   to the honest cognitive radios selected in the coalitional game.
   Simulation results show that the proposed attack can considerably
   decrease the number of potential channels with a low attack cost when
   security scheme is not considered, in addition to the energy efficiency
   of the proposed key management scheme. Finally, formal verification of
   the proposed key management scheme guarantees its immunity and
   effectiveness.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the estuarine turbulent flow from dams, channels, and
   pipes, as well as the river flow are very important due to the potential
   to cause damage to the bed of the river or channel and cause scouring of
   structures such as the saddles of bridges, because of the huge amount of
   the kinetic energy carried by the flow. One of the most efficient yet
   simple ways to dissipate this energy is to install a stilling basin at
   the discharge point to calm the flow. Turbulence data were recorded
   using acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV) for type VI2 of stilling basins
   for pipe outlets. During the study, various splitters and a cellular
   baffle were placed in the stilling basin, and the baffle locations were
   changed to assess the effect on the energy dissipation. Velocity at
   several locations in the basin was measured for different Froude numbers
   to investigate the effect of flow rate. Based on the findings of the
   experiments, several suggestions regarding the efficiency and geometry
   of stilling basins were made.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Device-to-device (D2D) communication technology is a promising add-on
   component for future wireless networks to provide local area services
   with increased spectrum efficiency and improved user experience. Three
   modes (i.e., cellular mode, reuse mode, and dedicated mode) can be used
   for D2D communication. A potential D2D user equipment (UE) can select a
   communication mode and dynamically adapt the mode selection according to
   the performance and the cost. This is referred to as the user-controlled
   mode selection problem. Also, a base station (BS) needs to reserve a
   spectrum band for the dedicated mode of operation, which we refer to as
   spectrum partitioning. The optimal spectrum partitioning needs to
   consider the utility of the BS that depends on the distribution of the
   users' mode selection, which, in turn, is governed by the spectrum
   partitioning. To jointly address the problems of spectrum partitioning
   and user-controlled mode selection (which are cyclically dependent on
   each other), we propose a dynamic Stackelberg game framework in which
   the BS and the potential D2D UEs act as the leader and the followers,
   respectively. Specifically, the adaptive mode selection of potential D2D
   UEs is formulated as a follower evolutionary game, and an evolutionary
   stable strategy is considered to be the solution. The dynamic control of
   spectrum partitioning by the BS is formulated as a leader optimal
   control problem. We also extend the formulation by considering
   information delays in control and state. Numerical analysis is performed
   to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, which shows
   that although the mode selection is performed in a distributed and
   user-controlled manner, the dynamic spectrum partitioning can be viewed
   as an effective incentive mechanism to drive the user distribution close
   to the optimal one.}},

Abstract = {{A tunable frequency selective surface (FSS) based on slotted ground is
   presented. Tuning of the resonance frequency is achieved by using a
   metallic MEMS bridge over the slot. The bridge acts as a capacitive
   load, increasing the equivalent capacitance, and so decreasing the
   resonance frequency. Electromagnetic and electromechanical simulations
   are performed to investigate the designed FSS. S-parameter measurements
   of the FSS unit cell are performed in a waveguide simulator, showing
   more than 1.7 GHz frequency shift in the X-band, achieved by using only
   one MEMS bridge. A measured bandwidth of 400 MHz at the resonance
   frequency of 9.59 GHz is achieved. The designed MEMS bridge benefits
   from an unconventional method of using SU-8 as the sacrificial layer,
   resulting in low loss at high frequencies (3.2 dB loss at the resonance
   frequency of 9.59 GHz). Devices with different heights of the MEMS
   bridge were fabricated to study the variation in the resonance
   frequency. The MEMS bridge was tested at fixed heights. Simulated and
   measured results show excellent agreement. An FSS array is designed
   based on the FSS unit cell results. The design procedure to maximize the
   quality factor and controllable frequency range, and improve the
   radiation characteristics of the FSS array is discussed. Further
   simulations are performed to examine the performance of the FSS array
   with regards to grating lobes, oblique incidence and tunability.}},

Abstract = {{We present a distributed power control algorithm to address the uplink
   interference management problem in cognitive radio networks where the
   underlaying secondary users (SUs) share the same licensed spectrum with
   the primary users (PUs) in multi-cell environments. Since the PUs have a
   higher priority of channel access compared to the SUs, minimal number of
   SUs should be gradually removed, subject to the constraint that all
   primary users are supported with their target
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs), which is assumed
   feasible. In our proposed algorithm, each primary user rigidly tracks
   its target-SINR by employing the conventional target-SINR tracking power
   control algorithm (TPC). Each transmitting SU employs the TPC as long as
   the total received power at the primary receiver is below a given
   threshold; otherwise, it decreases its transmit power in proportion to
   the ratio between the given threshold and the total received power at
   the primary receiver, which is referred to as the total
   received-power-temperature. We show that our proposed distributed
   power-update function has at least one fixed-point. We also show that
   our proposed algorithm not only improves the number of supported SUs but
   also guarantees that all primary users are supported with their
   (feasible) target-SINRs. Finally, we also propose an enhanced power
   control algorithm that achieves zero-outage for PUs and a better outage
   ratio for SUs. To this end, we provide a robust power control method
   that considers the uncertainties in channel gains.}},

Title = {{Tier-Aware Resource Allocation in OFDMA Macrocell-Small Cell Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{695-710}},

Abstract = {{We present a joint sub-channel and power allocation framework for
   downlink transmission in an orthogonal frequency-division multiple
   access (OFDMA)-based cellular network composed of a macrocell overlaid
   by small cells. In this framework, the resource allocation (RA) problems
   for both the macrocell and small cells are formulated as optimization
   problems. For the macrocell, we formulate an RA problem that is aware of
   the existence of the small cell tier. In this problem, the macrocell
   performs RA to satisfy the data rate requirements of macro user
   equipments (MUEs) while maximizing the tolerable interference from the
   small cell tier on its allocated sub-channels. Although the RA problem
   for the macrocell is shown to be a mixed integer nonlinear problem
   (MINLP), we prove that the macrocell can solve another alternate
   optimization problem that will yield the optimal solution with reduced
   complexity. For the small cells, following the same idea of
   tier-awareness, we formulate an optimization problem that accounts for
   both RA and admission control (AC) and aims at maximizing the number of
   admitted users while simultaneously minimizing the consumed bandwidth.
   Similar to the macrocell optimization problem, the small cell problem is
   shown to be an MINLP. We obtain a sub-optimal solution to the MINLP
   problem relying on convex relaxation. In addition, we employ the dual
   decomposition technique to have a distributed solution for the small
   cell tier. Numerical results confirm the performance gains of our
   proposed RA formulation for the macrocell over the traditional resource
   allocation based on minimizing the transmission power. Besides, it is
   shown that the formulation based on convex relaxation yields a similar
   behavior to the MINLP formulation. Also, the distributed solution
   converges to the same solution obtained by solving the corresponding
   convex optimization problem in a centralized fashion.}},

Abstract = {{Underwater vehicles (UWVs) have been widely used in oceanographic
   applications. Investigation of their interaction with free surface when
   they are moving near the free surface is of great importance. In the
   present work, the hydrodynamic characteristics of a standard UWV
   (Afterbody-1) moving in water and its interaction with free surface are
   studied numerically using CFD software ANSYS (TM) CFX. The total drag
   coefficient including the viscous and wave-making resistances acting
   over the UWV for its operating speeds ranging from 0.4 m/s (Re = 1.05 x
   10(5)) to 1.4 m/s (Re = 3.67 x 10(5)) at different depths of submergence
   ranging from 0.75 to 4.0, is obtained. Also the wake formed behind the
   UWV is characterized to better understand the hydrodynamic behavior of
   the UWV motion in water at different submergence depths and vehicle
   speeds. The results were compared with available measured data and good
   agreements were observed. It was found that, for all submergence depths
   as the Reynolds number was increased the drag coefficient was decreased.
   Besides, for a fixed Reynolds number as the submergence depth was
   decreased the drag coefficient was increased. Finally, for small
   submergence depths the effect of UWV motion on the free surface became
   more appreciable if the Reynolds number was increased. (C) 2014 Elsevier

   turbines}},
Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{215-225}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{The idea of wind turbine power enhancement by means of a shroud has been
   investigated for decades with no commercial success. However, due to
   some beneficial aspects, shrouds are poised to serve the hydrokinetic
   turbine industry. We report on the experimental measurements performed
   in a water tunnel on a 19.8 cm diameter horizontal axis hydrokinetic
   model turbine utilizing two shrouds. Power and thrust coefficients of
   the model turbine with and without the shrouds investigated are obtained
   over the range of the power curve. A maximum power enhancement of 91\%
   over the unshrouded turbine is obtained with one of the shrouds. Maximum
   power coefficients are recalculated based on the maximum area of shroud
   and are found to be comparable to that of the unshrouded turbine. At
   flow speed of 1 m/s, an extended blade that generates the same power as
   the shrouded turbine is found to have a diameter equal to the diameter
   of the shroud exit. This aspect is critical as the use of shrouds
   contrary to much of the literature is not to increase the hydrokinetic
   turbine efficiency, but to gain advantages in the powertrain design, and
   have the turbine power less impacted by changes in the flow direction.

Pages = {{39-48}},

Abstract = {{Liquid inclusions in sea ice are variable and dependent on the myriad of
   physical conditions of the atmosphere-sea ice environment in which the
   sea ice was grown, and whether or not melting processes affected the sea
   ice. In that light, there exist relatively few observations and
   resultant quantification of the morphology and vertical distribution of
   brine inclusions in sea ice. Using a magnetic (3.0 T) resonance (MR)
   imager using constructive interference steady state gradient echo
   sequence, we show that it is possible to image brine channels and
   pockets in an 18.5 cm young sea ice core in three-dimensions in only
   four and a half minutes following core storage at -20 degrees C. We
   present a three-dimensional image of a brine drainage channel feature in
   a young sea ice core, give the physical context for its formation by
   presenting the physical conditions of the atmosphere and water/sea ice
   prior to sea ice growth through the sampling date, and observe its
   physical characteristics. We illustrate that brine drainage channels may
   be established concurrently with ice growth, and indicate the amount and
   location of vertical and horizontal fluid connectivity in the young sea
   ice sample in the context of the environment in which it grew. Finally,
   we show that a vertical brine volume distribution profile can be
   calculated using MR image data, extending the (non-imaging) nuclear
   magnetic resonance work of others in this vein. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Metal nanowires are usually strong but are not able to maintain a high
   plastic flow due to a lack of strain hardening. In this study, we
   investigated the tensile deformation of a new category of metal
   nanowires with hollow interiors by atomistic simulations - the so-called
   metal nanotubes - and revealed that they possess a combination of
   ultrahigh strength and plastic flow. In particular, it was found that by
   controlling the wall thickness and axial orientation, ultrahigh plastic
   flow stress of more than 2 GPa could be maintained at up to similar to
   60\% tensile strain in Au nanotubes, whereas the solid Au nanowires of
   similar size yielded at tensile strain of less than 5\%, after which the
   stress dropped immediately below 1 GPa. Furthermore, a universal trend
   of surface reconstruction to the energetically favorable close-packed
   \{111\} orientation was found in Au nanotubes regardless of the initial
   orientation, which may be responsible for the unique plasticity in Au
   nanotubes with extremely thin walls. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

   volatile sensor}},
Journal = {{TALANTA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{718-723}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{A hydrogel-pH-electrode based near-field passive volatile sensor is
   described for real-time monitoring of fish spoilage. The sensor employs
   a varactor-based LC resonator that can be interrogated remotely using
   inductive coupling. The sensor's resonant frequency varies in response
   to the basic volatile spoilage compounds (total volatile basic nitrogen,
   TVB-N) in the headspace of packaged fish. The sensor is shown to have a
   linear response to logarithm of the ammonia gas concentration with a
   detection limit of 0.001 mg L-1 (1.5 ppm). Trials on tilapia at 24
   degrees C and 4 degrees C, employing direct comparison of sensor
   measurements with microbial analysis, indicate that the sensor response
   is correlated with the bacterial growth pattern in fish samples. It is
   shown that the sensor can distinctly identify when the product rejection
   level (107 cfu g(-1) bacterial population) occurs for both 24 degrees C
   and 4 degrees C storage conditions. This demonstrates a potential for
   real-time monitoring of fish spoilage. The wireless sensor is suited to
   embedding in packaging material and does not require an integrated
   circuit, making it amenable to inexpensive mass production using printed
   electronic technology. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Freeform surfaces, also called sculptured surfaces, have wide
   applications in clinical prosthesis and manufacturing. The free-form
   contour of product needs to be packed before it is machined from raw
   materials. The No-Fit Polygon methods are not suitable to the complex
   contours packing because calculating No-Fit Polygons for non-convex
   polygons is time-consuming. A contour packing algorithm for free-form
   contour machining is proposed in this paper. The parking area of
   materials is discretized based on a bottom-left and the lowest gravity
   center strategy. The packing contour is collided in four directions to
   increase the material utilization. Experimental results show that the
   packing time is reduced and the material utilization is improved using
   the proposed algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A meshfree interface-finite element method for modelling isothermal
   solutal melting and solidification in binary systems}},
Journal = {{FINITE ELEMENTS IN ANALYSIS AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{20-41}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, numerical modelling of isothermal solutal melting and
   solidification in binary systems is done using a new meshfree
   interface-finite element method (MI-FEM) where the implicitly
   represented liquid-solid interface is allowed to arbitrarily intersect
   the finite elements. A meshfree radial basis functions (RBFs) method is
   used for solving a distance-regularized level set (DRLS) equation such
   that re-initialization is completely eliminated and fast marching
   algorithms for interfacial velocity extension are not necessary
   resulting in a more efficient solution with excellent volume
   conservation. In the proposed method, intersection points between the
   mesh and the zero level set are used as meshiree nodes such that at the
   interface-embedded elements interpolants are constructed using meshfree
   RBFs ensuring both the partition of unity and Kronecker-delta properties
   are satisfied allowing for precise and easy imposition of Dirichlet
   boundary conditions (DBCs) on each side of the interface. A coupling of
   the MI-FEM with a new meshfree automata (MA) method is used to
   efficiently predict the microstructural evolution during solidification.
   Benchmark problems with strong discontinuities were solved where very
   good accuracy was obtained. The solute conservation and interfacial
   equilibrium equations describing solutal phase transformation in binary
   systems were solved using the newly developed method. Mathematical
   formulation and implementation followed by numerical results and
   analysis will be presented and discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Microwave scattering from sea ice is partially controlled by the ice
   surface roughness. In this paper, we propose a technique for calculating
   2-D centimeter-scale surface roughness parameters, including the rms
   height, correlation length, and form of autocorrelation function, from
   3-D terrestrial light detection and ranging data. We demonstrate that a
   single scale of roughness can be extracted from complex sea ice
   surfaces, incorporating multiple scales of topography, after
   sophisticated 2-D detrending, and calculate roughness parameters for a
   wide range of artificial and natural sea ice surface types. The 2-D
   technique is shown to be considerably more precise than standard 1-D
   profiling techniques and can therefore characterize surface roughness as
   a stationary single-scale process, which a 1-D technique typically
   cannot do. Sea ice surfaces are generally found to have strongly
   anisotropic correlation lengths, indicating that microwave scattering
   models for sea ice should include surface spectra that vary as a
   function of the azimuthal angle of incident radiation. However, our
   results demonstrate that there is no fundamental relationship between
   the rms height and correlation length for sea ice surfaces if the
   sampling area is above a threshold minimum size.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocoating of a single-cell with biocompatible materials creates a
   defined microenvironment for cell differentiation and proliferation, as
   well as a model for studies in cell biology. In addition, the acidic

   upon pH stimuli. Here, we report the encapsulation of single neural stem
   cells (NSCs) using a layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly technique with
   polyelectrolytes gelatin and alginate. Analysis of the NSCs showed that
   the LbL encapsulation would not affect the viability, proliferation, or
   differentiation of the cells. When insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)
   was loaded on the coating material alginate, its release from alginate
   into the medium presented in a time-dependent and pH-dependent way.
   IGF-1 significantly enhanced the proliferation of the encapsulated NSCs,
   demonstrating a drug-carrier function of the LbL single-cell
   nanocoating. It provided a potential treatment strategy for nervous

Abstract = {{Open architecture provides a sustainable product framework for mass
   personalised production. Applying personalised modules and common
   interfaces, an open-architecture product can satisfy changes in the user
   requirements of an application. Planning product modules for the
   open-architecture product structure using the existing method is
   challenging. The quality function deployment is extended in this study
   to decide the open-architecture product module types. The customer
   requirements are divided into two parts: basic function needs and
   changes of the individual customer needs. Based on the axiomatic design,
   the functional requirements are mapped into design parameters to
   establish the design matrix. A degree of variety is proposed as a
   quantitative measure for the component variability of product modules.
   According to the relationship of components and degree of variety, the
   product components are clustered into open-architecture product modules.
   The proposed method is used to design a paper-bag-folding machine to
   satisfy requirement changes during the machine application.}},

Abstract = {{Delineating spatial patterns of precipitation isotopes (isoscapes) is
   becoming increasingly important to understand the processes governing
   the modern water isotope cycle and their application to migration
   forensics, climate proxy interpretation, and ecohydrology of terrestrial
   systems. However, the extent to which these patterns can be empirically
   predicted across Canada and the northern United States has not been
   fully articulated, in part due to a lack of time series precipitation
   isotope data for major regions of North America. In this study, we use
   multiple linear regressions of CNIP, GNIP, and USNIP observations
   alongside climatological variables, teleconnection indices, and
   geographic indicators to create empirical models that predict the O-18
   of monthly precipitation (O-18(ppt)) across Canada and the northern
   United States. Five regionalization approaches are used to separate the
   study domain into isotope zones to explore the effect of spatial
   grouping on model performance. Stepwise regression-derived
   parameterizations quantified by permutation testing indicate the
   significance of precipitable water content and latitude as predictor
   variables. Within the Canadian Arctic and eastern portion of the study
   domain, models from all regionalizations capture the interannual and
   intraannual variability of O-18(ppt). The Pacific coast and northwestern
   portions of the study domain show less agreement between models and
   poorer model performance, resulting in higher uncertainty in simulations
   throughout these regions. Long-term annual average O-18(ppt) isoscapes
   are generated, highlighting the uncertainty in the regionalization
   approach as it compounds over time. Additionally, monthly time series
   simulations are presented at various locations, and model structure
   uncertainty and 90\% bootstrapped prediction bounds are detailed for
   these predictions.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of robust downlink power control in orthogonal
   frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based heterogeneous wireless
   networks (HetNets) composed of macrocells and underlaying small cells. A
   non-cooperative setting is assumed where the macro base stations (MBSs)
   and small cell base stations (SBSs) compete with each other to maximize
   their own capacities considering imperfect channel state information. A
   robust Stackelberg game (RSG) is formulated to model this hierarchical
   competition where the MBSs and SBSs act as the leaders and the
   followers, respectively. The formulated RSG can be expressed as an
   equilibrium program with equilibrium constraints (EPEC). A comprehensive
   study of this RSG is provided considering various power constraints
   (e.g., total and spectral mask), various interference constraints (e.g.,
   individual and global), and different uncertainty models (e.g.,
   column-wise and ellipsoidal). We show how the different constraints and
   uncertainty models change the property of the game (e.g., Nash
   equilibrium problem (NEP) or generalized Nash equilibrium problem
   (GNEP)) and accordingly impact the choice of analysis method (e.g., game
   theory or variational inequality (VI)), solution (e.g,. closed-form or
   numerical), and the design of algorithms and their distributive
   properties (e.g., totally distributed, semi-distributed, and
   centralized). A robust Stackelberg equilibrium (RSE) is considered to be
   the solution and its existence and uniqueness are investigated. Also,
   algorithms are proposed to arrive at the RSE. Numerical results show the
   effectiveness of robust solutions in an imperfect information
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Combinatorial effects of influential growth nutrients were investigated
   in order to enhance hydrogen (H-2) production during direct conversion
   of cellulose by Clostridium thermocellum DSM 1237. A central composite
   face-centered design and response surface methodology (RSM) were applied
   to optimize concentrations of cellulose, yeast extract (YE), and
   magnesium chloride (Mg) in culture. The overall optimum composition
   generated by the desirability function resulted in 57.28 mmol
   H-2/L-culture with 1.30 mol H-2/mol glucose and 7.48 mmol/(g center dot
   cell center dot h) when cultures contained 25 g/L cellulose, 2 g/L YE,
   and 1.75 g/L Mg. Compared with the unaltered medium, the optimized
   medium produced approximately 3.2-fold more H-2 within the same
   time-frame with 50\% higher specific productivity, which are also better
   than previously reported values from similar studies. Nutrient
   composition that diverted carbon and electron flux away from H-2
   promoting ethanol production was also determined. This study represents
   the first investigation dealing with multifactor optimization with RSM
   for H-2 production during direct cellulose fermentation.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This work presents the results of experiments conducted in a horizontal
   channel to characterize low Reynolds number turbulent flows in the
   presence of small solid particles. The particle diameter relative to the
   integral length scale, d(p)/Lambda(x), is approximately 0.02. Particles
   and fluid turbulence characteristics are measured for three average
   solid volume fractions of approximately phi(v) = 2.0 x 10(-4), 4.0 x
   10(-4), and 8.0 x 10(-4) under conditions where the particle number
   density is evolving due to deposition. The results indicate that the
   mean slip between particles and the fluid is important only close to the
   wall. Away from the wall, the particles and unladen fluid mean
   velocities are similar. Differences between particles and the unladen
   fluid statistics are more pronounced in the wall-normal velocity
   fluctuations than the streamwise velocity fluctuations and Reynolds
   shear stress due to the stronger effect of the gravitational force in
   the wall-normal direction. The fluid turbulent intensities show no
   dependency on loading, but the peak Reynolds shear stress is
   significantly reduced. A quadrant decomposition of the Reynolds shear
   stress revealed a corresponding reduction in the ejections and sweeps
   for the laden flow in comparison with the unladen flow. Swirling
   strength and vorticity root-mean-square fluctuations decayed due to the
   damping effect of particles. The influence of particles on the
   turbulence structure was examined using two-point correlations of the
   velocity fluctuations and swirling strength, where it was demonstrated
   that the wall structures are attached eddies which are more extensive
   (much larger) in the particle-laden flow compared to the unladen flow.

Journal = {{BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The non-uniform temperature distribution created in the processed
   materials limits the wide application of microwave treatment. The
   non-uniform temperature also increases the chance of insects surviving
   or moving out from the treated materials. Wheat (14, 16 and 18\%
   moisture contents, wet basis) with or without insects (Cryptolestes
   ferrugineus (Stephens)) was continuously or intermittently treated
   inside a microwave oven for 30, 60 and 90 s. Three dimensional
   distributions were determined by measuring temperatures and moisture
   contents at 27 locations inside a 10 x 9 x 9 cm(3) plastic container.
   The adults and larvae of Cryptolestes ferrugineus, which did not escape
   from the treated wheat, were sieved out or forced out using the Berlese
   funnel method. Temperatures and moisture contents had different mean,
   maximum and minimum values in different replicates when treatment time
   was 30 s. Long treatment time (90 s) generated a thy and hot spot at the
   same position even though the hot and dry spots were not at the same
   position in different replicates. Intermittent treatment did not
   generate more even distributions of temperatures and moisture contents
   in dry grain, while wet grain (>16\% MC) did. Most of the introduced
   adults were extracted and there was no significant difference between
   intermittent or continuous treatment methods. Microwave treatment did
   not kill all insects, however the number of offspring decreased by
   >75\%. Driving insects out of wheat could be an alternative method for
   insect disinfestation and detection. (C) 2014 IAgrE. Published by

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a spectrum auction system among heterogeneous
   secondary users (SUs) with various quality-of-service (QoS) requirements
   and a recall-based primary base station (PBS) that could recall channels
   after auction to deal with a sudden increase in its own demand.
   Beginning with proposing a recall-based single-winner spectrum auction
   (RSSA) algorithm, we further extend our work to allow multiple winners
   in order to improve the spectrum utilization and propose a recall-based
   multiple-winner spectrum auction (RMSA) algorithm. A combinatorial
   auction model is then formulated, and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
   mechanism is applied in the payment function. Moreover, the proposed
   RMSA algorithm focuses on a fair spectrum allocation among heterogeneous
   SUs and the increase in the PBS's auction revenue. Both theoretical and
   simulation results show that the proposed spectrum auction algorithm can
   improve the spectrum utilization with guarantees on SUs' heterogeneous
   QoS requirements.}},

Abstract = {{A 6 x 6 element multiple moving membrane capacitive micromachined
   ultrasonic transducer (M-3-CMUT) array has been developed for
   air-coupled detection purposes in the low megahertz frequency range.
   Unlike conventional capacitive MEMS transducers, the developed
   transducer array employs a novel cell configuration where more than one
   flexible membrane contributes in the transducer signal transmission and
   detection. In this structure, a stack of two vibrating membranes is
   suspended over a fixed grounded bottom electrode. The transducer array
   has been fabricated through employing a MEMS sacrificial technique, with
   the top and middle membrane radii of 65 and 42 mu m, respectively. The
   electrical, optical and acoustic evaluation results of this transducer
   array are presented in this paper. It is shown that using this
   configuration, the amplitude of membrane displacement is increased which
   enhances the transducer power output and sensitivity for a given bias
   condition. The experimental results demonstrate that this transducer
   array structure can be highly beneficial in high performance imaging
   application systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear thermal instability of moving sandwich plates subjected to
   a constant moving speed is investigated. The sandwich plates are made of
   a shape memory alloy (SMA) fiber reinforced composite core and two
   functionally graded (FG) face sheets (FG/SMA/FG). The Brinson model is
   used for Modeling of SMA behavior, and the geometrically nonlinear
   third-order shear deformation theory is used for modeling of sandwich
   plates. Thermomechanical properties of the sandwich plate are assumed to
   be temperature-dependent. Two types of in-plane boundary conditions are
   considered. The nonlinear instability is treated by the Galerkin
   technique. The results show that the initial equilibrium configuration
   of the sandwich plate becomes unstable at a critical moving speed.
   Results examine the effect of axial moving speed, SMA volume fraction,
   pre-strain of SMA fiber, core thickness, imperfection, in-plane boundary
   conditions, and thermal loading on the stability characteristics of the
   sandwich plates. It is found that a proper application of SMA fibers
   postpone the thermal buckling and critical moving speed. Furthermore,
   the induced tensile recovery stress of SMA fibers could also stabilize
   geometrically imperfect plates during the reverse martensite
   transformation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an evolutionary game theory (EGT)-based distributed resource
   allocation scheme for small cells underlaying a macro cellular network.
   EGT is a suitable tool to address the problem of resource allocation in
   self-organizing small cells since it allows the players with
   bounded-rationality to learn from the environment and take individual
   decisions for attaining the equilibrium with minimum information
   exchange. EGT-based resource allocation can also provide fairness among
   users. We show how EGT can be used for distributed subcarrier and power
   allocation in orthogonal frequency-division multiple access
   (OFDMA)-based small cell networks while limiting interference to the
   macrocell users below given thresholds. Two game models are considered,
   where the utility of each small cell depends on average achievable
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and data rate,
   respectively. For the proposed distributed resource allocation method,
   the average SINR and data rate are obtained based on a stochastic
   geometry analysis. Replicator dynamics is used to model the strategy
   adaptation process of the small cell base stations and an evolutionary
   equilibrium is obtained as the solution. Based on the results obtained
   using stochastic geometry, the stability of the equilibrium is analyzed.
   We also extend the formulation by considering information exchange delay
   and investigate its impact on the convergence of the algorithm.
   Numerical results are presented to validate our theoretical findings and
   to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in comparison to a
   centralized resource allocation scheme.}},

Abstract = {{An effective method of controlling chaos is proposed. The control
   mechanism of the proposed method can be interpreted as the
   synchronization of a chaotic system with a system of harmonic
   oscillators. It is a practically noninvasive method that does not change
   the solution of dynamical systems, but stabilizes their periodic
   behavior by applying only small perturbations. The proposed method has
   fairly simple structure that suggests a clear stabilizing mechanism, and
   allows a straightforward evaluation of stability properties. This
   control scheme can be implemented experimentally even if the dynamical
   system is not analytically known. The efficiency of the proposed method
   is demonstrated through numerical simulation as well as experimental

Abstract = {{We investigate the ergodic uplink resource allocation problem for secure
   communication in relay-assisted orthogonal frequency-division multiple
   access (OFDMA)-based cognitive radio networks (CRNs) in the presence of
   a set of passive eavesdroppers where relay nodes assist the legitimate
   users to transmit their messages. Previous works have commonly assumed
   the availability of channel state information (CSI) for this type of
   problems. However, due to the decentralized nature of CRNs and hidden
   activities of eavesdroppers, the assumption of availability of exact
   values of CSI is not realistic. In this paper, we consider uncertainty
   on the estimated values of CSI between different transmitters and
   receivers, e.g., CSI between each legitimate transmitter and its
   corresponding receiver and CSI of each legitimate user and each
   eavesdropper. We utilize the worst-case robust formulation to find power
   and sub-carrier allocations in such a way that under the worst condition
   of error, the regulatory constraints imposed to CRN are satisfied and
   the secrecy rate of each secondary legitimate user is stabilized. It is
   well known that the robust approaches impose a high computational
   complexity to the system and reduce the system performance as they
   conservatively consider the error in the maximum extent. We demonstrate
   how the robust formulation can be significantly simplified and tradeoff
   parameters can be introduced to moderate the effect of the worst-case
   approach. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance
   of CRNs for different uncertain system parameters.}},

   undergoing bend deformation}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN 12}},
Abstract = {{The piezoresistance of silicon has been studied over the past few
   decades in order to characterize the material's unique electromechanical
   properties and investigate their wider applicability. While bulk and
   top-down (etched) micro- and nano-wires have been studied extensively,
   less work exists regarding bottom-up grown microwires. A facile method
   is presented for characterizing the piezoresistance of released,
   phosphorus-doped silicon microwires that have been grown, bottom-up, via
   a chemical vapour deposition, vapour-liquid-solid process. The method
   uses conductive tungsten probes to simultaneously make electrical
   measurements via direct ohmic contact and apply mechanical strain via
   bend deformation. These microwires display piezoresistive coefficients
   within an order of magnitude of those expected for bulk n-type silicon;
   however, they show an anomalous response at degenerate doping
   concentrations (similar to 10(20) cm(-3)) when compared to lower doping
   concentrations (similar to 10(17) cm(-3)), with a stronger
   piezoresistive coefficient exhibited for the more highly doped wires.
   This response is postulated to be due to the different growth mechanism
   of bottom-up microwires as compared to top-down. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Conic open-channel flow as occurs in sub-drains, sewers, and culverts is
   computed by Manning's or Darcy's resistance equations for the
   cross-sectional average velocity only. Yet, fish passage culvert design
   requires the cross-sectional velocity distribution, which is proposed in
   this paper based on two hypotheses: (i) centreline velocity distribution
   follows the conventional log-law with a cubic deduction near the water
   surface; (ii) cross-sectional velocity distribution is described by Guo
   and Julien's modified log-wake-law but neglecting the squared sine
   function. These hypotheses result in a novel and simple velocity
   distribution model without any fitting parameter. Its graphical
   interpretation for the elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic channels
   indicates reasonable velocity contours with dip phenomenon. Further, it
   agrees well with circular pipe data related to the average shear
   velocity, velocity-dip position, centreline and cross-sectional velocity
   distributions. A potential application includes fish passage culvert
   design by specifying a low velocity zone near the wall.}},

Title = {{Identification of geographical influences and flow regime
   characteristics using regional water isotope surveys in the lower Nelson
   River, Canada}},
Journal = {{CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{Results are reported from a 3-year monitoring initiative (2010-2013) of
   stable water isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) at over 50 hydrometric
   sites in the lower portion of the Nelson River Basin, a key
   freshwater-marine corridor in Canada with global significance. Data are
   collected from annual synoptic surveys and a time-series monitoring
   program. Water isotope signals exhibit significant long-term average
   (with reported standard deviation) differences between the upper Nelson
   River (-10.5 parts per thousand delta O-18 +/- 0.18 parts per thousand)
   and Burntwood River (i.e. Churchill Basin; -12.8 parts per thousand
   delta O-18 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand) regions which are attributed to
   the geographic extent and origin of the water. Upper Nelson River
   flow-isotope signals suggest a more temperate climate, and exhibit
   reverse seasonal cycling (i.e. ice-on isotope enrichment; ice-off
   isotope depletion) due to the connectivity with and influence of Lake
   Winnipeg. In contrast, the Burntwood River behaves like a
   snowmelt-dominated river heavily influenced by wetland storage and
   enrichment during ice-off periods, exhibiting isotopic signals
   negatively correlated with headwater river discharge. Flow-weighted
   delta O-18 and delta H-2 show decreased variability in both regions at
   extreme low- and high-flow regimes, indicating a tendency towards a
   single dominant end member: wetland release (low-flow regime) or
   snowmelt/rainfall (high-flow regime). Mid- to normal-flow regimes
   exhibit increased isotopic variability, as do small headwater catchments
   resulting from varied source water contributions, residence times,
   mixing patterns and the role of landscape-specific features. The Stable
   Water Isotope Monitoring Network (SWIMN) presented enables the closure
   of water-isotope mass balance modelling that will facilitate the
   understanding of changes to freshwater-marine linkages.
   Les resultats sont bases sur une etude d'echantillonnage de 3 ans
   (2010-2013) d'isotopes stables de l'eau (delta O-18 et delta H-2) a plus
   de 50 stations hydrometriques dans la partie inferieure du bassin de la
   riviere Nelson, un corridor marin d'eau fraiche du Canada d'importance
   mondiale. Les donnees sont tirees d'etudes synoptiques annuelles et d'un
   programme de mesure de series chronologiques. Les signaux releves dans
   les isotopes de l'eau montrent des differences significatives dans les
   moyennes a long terme (avec ecart-type) entre les regions du haut de la
   riviere Nelson (-10.5 parts per thousand delta O-18 +/- 0.18 parts per
   thousand) et de la riviere Burntwood (c.-a-d. le bassin de Churchill;
   -12.8 parts per thousand delta O-18 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand) et sont
   attribuees a l'etendue geographique et a l'origine de l'eau. Les signaux
   d'isotopes instables du haut de la riviere Nelson suggerent un climat
   plus tempere et demontrent un cycle saisonnier inverse (c.-a-d. que
   lorsque les eaux sont recouvertes de gel, il y a enrichissement et
   qu'autrement, il y tarissement) resultant de la connexite avec le lac
   Winnipeg et de l'influence de ce dernier.
   A l'oppose, la riviere Burntwood reagit comme une riviere dominee par la
   fonte des neiges et fortement influencee par le stockage des terres
   humides et l'enrichissement au cours des periodes ou les eaux ne sont
   pas recouvertes de glace, presentant des signaux isotopiques
   negativement correles avec les eaux d'amont. Les niveaux de delta O-18
   et delta H-2 ponderes par le debit de l'eau presentent une diminution de
   la variabilite dans les deux regions lorsque les debits sont extremement
   bas ou eleves, indiquant une tendance vers une source unique : provenant
   des terres humides (faible debit) ou de la fonte des neiges ou d'averses
   de pluie (debit eleve). Les debits moyen a normal presentent une
   augmentation de la variabilite isotopique - comme c'est le cas pour les
   petits bassins recepteurs d'eau d'amont formes de sources d'eau variees
   - du temps de retention, de la composition des sources et du role des
   caracteristiques specifiques au paysage terrestre. Le Reseau de controle
   des isotopes d'eau stable (SWIMN) presente ici permet de preserver
   l'equilibre du bilan massique des isotopes d'eau, ce qui permettra de
   mieux comprendre les changements dans les liens entre les eaux douces et
   marines.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolomics is a dynamic and emerging research field, joining
   proteomics, transcriptomics and genomics in affording a comprehensive
   understanding of biological systems and how these systems are affected
   by environmental stimuli and/or genetic modification. Metabolomics is
   particularly helpful for identifying biomarkers of disease processes
   such as the effects of a high fat diet on cardiovascular disease,
   providing insight into the interaction between genes and diet. Nuclear
   Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Mass spectrometry (MS) are the most common
   analytical tools in metabolomics research. The high reproducibility of
   NMR-based techniques makes it superior to other analytical techniques
   especially in terms of searching for new and novel biomarkers in human
   diseases. Recently, NMR-based metabolomics approaches have been proposed
   as a promising and powerful technique for diagnosis of several human
   diseases. They have been used to investigate a wide range of diseases,
   through the examination of different kinds of human samples, including
   urine, blood plasma/serum, blister fluid, saliva, as well as intact
   tissue biopsies and tissue extracts. However, several factors can
   influence the metabolic balance within the human body and therefore in
   samples drawn from the body, including gender, age, fasting, diet,
   emotional stress, drug administration, physical activity and life style,
   thus complicating the use of NMR-based metabolomics approaches in
   diagnosing specific human disease. This chapter highlights the potential
   applications of NMR-based metabolomics approaches as a promising
   technique for diagnosis of human diseases.}},

   small cells, interference thresholds for macro UEs (MUEs), and practical
   fronthaul capacity constraints. This problem is a mixed integer
   nonlinear problem (MINLP). Moreover, the problem can become infeasible
   which necessitates the employment of some form of admission control
   (AC). Therefore, relying on the framework of successive convex
   approximation (SCA), we propose a low-complexity solution for the
   original non-convex MINLP by solving a series of convex problems, which
   is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum solution. Numerical results
   indicate the performance of the proposed formulation and demonstrate the
   underlying tradeoffs among the SUEs' QoS requirements, number of
   admitted SUEs, total downlink transmit power, and the available
   fronthaul capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advancements in the self-interference (SI) cancellation
   capability of low power wireless devices pave the way of implementing
   full-duplex (FD) self-backhauling in small-cell networks. FD
   self-backhauling allows the use of conventional radio access network
   (RAN) spectrum for backhaul as well as access links concurrently. In
   this paper, we model and analyze massive MIMO-enabled wireless backhaul
   networks that are composed of a mixture of small cells, configured
   either in inband or out-of-band backhaul mode with a certain
   probability. We consider a hierarchical network structure to model these
   networks and characterize the downlink coverage probability of a small
   cell base station (SBS) for both the in-band and out-of-band backhaul
   modes. The impact of co-tier and cross-tier backhaul interferences on
   downlink signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) coverage of small cell users
   is investigated. Numerical results demonstrate that implementing only
   either the in-band or out-of-band backhauling solutions may not be
   useful. Instead, a hybrid system with correct proportion of in-band and
   out-of-band small cells should be implemented.}},

Abstract = {{A novel physical-layer based security method that utilizes jammers to
   generate additional interference for devices that are eavesdropping on
   wireless network communication is proposed. The scheme involves the
   intelligent placement of continuous jammers in order to achieve maximum
   protection and data confidentiality for wireless mesh networks with
   multiple eavesdroppers, sources and destinations. Furthermore, the
   scheme is optimized in terms of the transmitting power associated with
   each jammer so that the energy expended by the jammers is kept at a
   minimum. The protection scheme precludes the use of any cryptographic
   techniques and is only physical-layer based. The security method is
   modeled as a minimization mixed integer non-linear problem and is
   approximated as the sequential solution of two linear optimization
   sub-problems relating to the placement and power allocation of the
   wireless jammers. The placement of the jammers takes the form of a
   multiple demand multidimensional knapsack problem with a minimization
   objective. The power allocation problem is modeled as a linear
   real-valued minimization optimization problem. The performance of the
   proposed security method is evaluated through appropriate simulations
   conducted on random network instances.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) network is currently an emerging technology for
   future wireless communications. In this paper, the problem of resource
   allocation for heterogeneous users in an underlay CR network is
   addressed. The objective is to maximize the weighted sum of the data
   rate for all the categories of secondary users within the network. The
   problem is first formulated as a non-linear optimization problem which
   is non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) hard. The problem is then
   cleverly re-formulated as an integer linear programming problem and
   solved through branch-and-bound method. The impact of the weights on the
   different categories of users is also investigated. The results obtained
   show that through the approach developed by the authors, optimal
   resource allocation is achievable for heterogeneous CR networks.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advancements in the self-interference (SI) cancellation
   capability of low-power wireless devices pave the way of implementing
   full-duplex (FD) self-backhauling in smallcell networks. FD
   self-backhauling allows exploiting the radio spectrum used by the radio
   access network (RAN) for back-haul links as well as access links
   concurrently. This paper characterizes the performance of FD
   self-backhauling for both downlink and uplink transmissions in a
   two-tier macrocell-small cell network and compares it against
   half-duplex (HD) self-backhauling. The performance of small cell base
   stations (SBSs) with adaptive FD scheme that switches between HD and FD
   modes depending on the network parameters such as the distance of
   backhaul link (i.e., link between the macrocell base station and SBS),
   SI cancellation value at the SBS, and the distance of the served user
   from the SBS is then numerically analyzed for two different user
   selection schemes used by the SBS. Numerical results show the usefulness
   of adaptive FD self-backhauling over FD self-backhauling, especially in
   fairness-constrained scheduling schemes.}},

   brightness, which is a traffic load related factor. By jointly
   considering the load balance in each BS group, the effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithm is demonstrated under two scenarios with different
   functions of brightness. In addition, the BS-off matching scheme and BS
   on/off weight are developed to improve the BSs power efficiency of. The
   simulation results show that our proposals can effectively save more

   signal belongs to a given parametric class of signals is considered. We
   examine the nonparametric situation as for a well-defined null
   hypothesis signal model we admit broad alternative signal classes that
   cannot be parametrized. For such a setup, we introduce testing
   procedures relying on nonparametric kernel-type sampling reconstruction
   algorithms properly adjusted for noisy data. The proposed testing
   procedure utilizes the L-2 - distance between the kernel estimate and
   signals from the parametric target class. The central limit theorem of
   the test statistic is derived yielding a consistent testing method.
   Hence, we obtain the testing algorithm with the desirable level of the
   probability of false alarm and the power tending to one.}},

   control optimization for a multichannel, multiple-user cognitive radio
   network. In particular, we investigate trade-off factors in designing
   efficient spectrum sensing techniques to maximize the throughputs and
   minimize the interferences. To maximize the throughputs of secondary
   users and minimize the interferences to primary users, it requires for a
   joint determination of the sensing and transmission parameters of the
   secondary users, such as sensing times, decision threshold vectors, and
   power allocation vectors. There is a conflict between these two
   objectives, thus a multiobjective optimization problem is introduced. We
   propose an analytical approach based on Newton's methods and nonlinear
   barrier method to solve this large-scale joint multiobjective
   optimization problem.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a cognitive feature extraction model based on
   scaling and multifractal dimension trajectory to analyze internet
   traffic time series. DNS (Domain Naming System) traffic time series is
   considered that contains tagged DNS Denial of Service attacks. The first
   step of the analysis involves transforming the DNS time series into a
   multifractal variance dimension trajectory keeping statistical
   stationarity of data intact. Then features of the trajectory are
   extracted to remove high variability noise. The extracted set of
   features indicates the presence of an attack when the denoised
   trajectory shows increasing variance fractal dimension. This technique
   is superior in finding changing patterns of a data series due to the
   presence of noise and denial of service attack because it is not
   dependent on integer dimensions and mono-scale measurement of variations
   in data series. Moreover, this technique provides adaptive and locally
   stationary windows in a highly non stationary data series.}},

Abstract = {{Multiport converter (MPC) can be identified as an effective conversion
   structure due to their higher power density and reduced component count.
   In traditional multiple-stage converter system, each input source and
   output load are interconnected through a DC bus using independent
   converters to exchange power. When the number of the input sources and
   output loads increases, the number of converters increases, thus
   resulting in more complicated structure. As a prominent alternative, MPC
   can be introduced to simplify the multiple-stage converter system. This
   paper presents some simple methods for deriving MPCs based on
   conventional two-port converters. By decomposing the two-port converters
   into pulsating source cells (PSCs) and output filter cells (OFCs), MPCs
   can be synthesized with multiple of those cells.}},

Abstract = {{In multi-tier cellular/small cell networks, user performance is largely
   affected by the varying transmit powers, distances, and non-uniform
   traffic loads of different BSs in both the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL)
   directions of transmission. To optimize user performance in such
   networks, decoupled ULDL association (DUDe) has recently been
   investigated. DUDe enables a user to be associated with different BSs
   for UL and DL transmissions. In this paper, we investigate the
   feasibility of DUDe in a full-duplex two-tier cellular network. Our
   objective is to associate users to their preferred BSs to maximize the
   overall user rate both in UL and DL with a provisioning for decoupled
   association. We formulate the UL and DL user association problem as a
   matching game where users and BSs rank one another using well-defined
   preference metrics such that their total UL and DL throughput is
   maximized. When compared to DUDe in half-duplex networks, in full-duplex
   networks it introduces new types of interferences such as UL to DL
   interference or DL to UL interference. The preference metrics are thus
   defined as a function of achievable UL and DL signal-to-interference
   noise ratio (SINR). Simulation results are presented to compare the
   performance of the proposed user association scheme with those of the
   traditional DUDe and coupled user association schemes where simple user
   association criteria (e.g., path-loss in the UL and received signal
   power in the DL) are used for UL and DL transmissions.}},

Abstract = {{In multi-tier cellular/small cell networks, decoupled uplink-downlink
   association (DUDe) enables a user to be associated with different base
   stations (BSs) for uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmissions. In this
   paper, we consider the overall UL and DL rate maximization problem of
   the users in such a network with a provisioning for decoupled
   association. In particular, we formulate the UL and DL user association
   problem as a matching game where users and BSs rank one another using
   well-defined preference metrics such that their total UL and DL
   throughput is maximized. The preference profiles of the users are
   dynamic subject to the unique interference conditions in DUDe networks
   resulting due to dynamic user associations. As such, considering the
   impact of externalities becomes crucial in a matching game. To this end,
   we propose an algorithm based on swap matching that enables players to
   find a stable association such that no user tries to change her
   association. Simulations are conducted to show the efficacy of the
   proposed swap matching algorithm over traditional user association in
   DUDe networks in which simple user association criteria are used for
   both the UL and DL transmissions (i.e., path-loss in the UL and received
   signal power in the DL).}},

Abstract = {{This study introduces a novel and low cost satellite imaging technique
   for hydrokinetic site selection in cold climate areas like central and
   northern Canada. In this technique, the potential hydrokinetic site is
   determined as a first approximation by analyzing the ice formation on
   the river system during winter time from satellite or aerial imagery.
   Open areas on the river surface during cold winter days, when the rest
   of the river is frozen, are potential sites for hydrokinetic turbine
   installation. This method relies on the fact that the surface ice is not
   forming in high velocity areas of the river and it remains open during
   cold winter months. Satellite or aerial imagery helps to narrow down the
   potential hydrokinetic sites on a large river system to limited number
   of unfrozen areas. The validity of this technique is investigated on
   Winnipeg River within a few kilometers stretch of the river from
   Manitoba/Ontario border to Lamprey falls. Preliminary results show that
   the flow velocity in ice opening indicated by satellite imagery ranges
   from 1.2 to 4.5 m/s during an exceptionally high flow of the Winnipeg
   River. This study proves the practicality of this novel satellite
   imagery technique for estimating river hydrokinetic sites. In the next
   step, the method will be refined and applied to a larger stretch of the
   Winnipeg River for normal flow years. The long term goal is to employ
   this technique and locate potential hydrokinetic sites in vicinity
   remote communities.}},

   convergent-divergent shroud model experiences negligible performance
   loss in yaw operation compared to the unshrouded turbine. Maximum
   reduction in performance of the turbine with the shroud in yawed flows
   is 6\% at three Reynolds numbers investigated. This is 17\% less than

Abstract = {{A procedure is proposed in the context of microwave breast imaging to
   iteratively refine the resolution of the reconstruction model for the
   glandular region used by the imaging algorithm. The reconstruction model
   begins with a small number of large reconstruction elements and the
   dielectric properties are estimated over these elements. For subsequent
   iterations, the density of the mesh elements within the glandular region
   increases. The imaging algorithm uses the results from the reconstructed
   image of the previous step to initialize the dielectric properties of
   the model elements. An incident field with a higher frequency than the
   previous step is used. Dielectric properties over the finer model
   elements are estimated from the scattered data which have a higher
   spectral content. The procedure continues until a satisfactory
   resolution of the reconstructed image is achieved. The aim of the
   strategy is to improve the resolution of the reconstructed profile while
   overcoming problems associated with solving a highly non-linear and
   severely ill-posed inverse scattering problem. The feasibility of the
   algorithm is evaluated with numerical results based on a synthetically

Abstract = {{Testing of newly designed protective relay logics is essential prior to
   the installation of the relay hardware in power systems. Real-time
   simulators (rts) are widely used to simulate the computer models of the
   power system in real-time to analyze the closed loop performance of the
   relay. This kind of simulation is expensive because high performance
   processing units are required for the rts systems. Also, the closed loop
   simulation results will be inaccurate if there are communication delays
   between the rts and the relay hardware. In this paper, a new iterative
   method for the closed loop performance test of protective relays is
   presented. The approach uses the iterative method of the Waveform
   Relaxation (WR) with the use of a specialized interface hardware called
   the Real-Time Player/Recorder (RTPR). The power system model is
   simulated in an off-line electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation
   program and the relay hardware is connected to the RTPR device. The
   off-line simulation results (waveforms) are recorded and then played
   back in real-time to the relay through the RTPR device. The RTPR records
   the relay response (trip signals) accordingly and makes them available
   to the EMT simulation. The EMT simulation is once again repeated with
   the new recorded waveforms and the results are compared with those from
   the previous iteration. If the waveforms are different, the above
   process is repeated. The converged results represent the closed loop
   response of the EMT simulation and the relay hardware. The approach is
   used to test the reclosing function of a commercially available relay
   (SEL-421). It is shown that some of the relay settings must be adjusted
   to facilitate this type of simulation. The relay is also tested by a
   real-time digital simulator for cross-validation of the proposed
   approach. Very similar results prove the high accuracy of the proposed
   method.}},

   network service providers (NSPs), small cell provider (SCP) and user
   interaction in heterogenous small cell networks is presented. In

   NSPs based on their prices. The NSPs have no dedicated hardware and need
   to rent from the SCP in term of radio resources, e.g., small cell base
   stations (SBSs) in order to provide satisfied services to the users. Due
   to the fact that the selfish parties involved aim at maximizing their
   own profits, a hierarchical dynamic game framework is presented to
   address interactive decision problem. In the lower level, a Stackelberg
   game is formulated to model and analyze the adaptive service selection
   of non-atomic users. In the upper level, the NSPs and SCP sequentially
   determine the leasing and pricing strategies, respectively, by taking
   into account the service selection in the lower-level game. Performance
   evaluation shows the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed game
   theoretic approaches.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, priority-aware scheduling to the coexistence of multiple
   wireless body area networks (WBANs) is addressed. The scheduling is
   formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem where the objective is to
   maximize system throughput while guaranteeing the priorities among
   WBANs. To overcome the inherent complexity issue, a new method, called
   recursive decomposition algorithm (RDA), is proposed to solve the
   original nonlinear problem by decomposing it into several linear
   subproblems. Each subproblem is then solved by a column generation
   method in order to avoid the large number of variables. Since the
   pricing problem in the column generation method is a 0-1 integer
   programming which is known to be NP complete, a heuristic weight-greedy
   algorithm with a much lower time complexity is proposed. The simulation
   results show that the proposed RDA can effectively guarantee the
   priorities among WBANs and can obtain near-optimal throughput
   performance even in the extremely high user density region.}},

   classes of services at the SU, delay sensitive (DS) and best effort (BE)
   services, while assigning a higher priority to the DS services. We
   propose a new queueing analytical model to address this priority issue
   and analyze the delay performance for the two services separately. Based
   on the analytical results, two Markov decision processes (MDPs) are
   formulated with objectives to minimize the average delay of both
   services, while guaranteeing the priority of the DS services. Simulation
   results show that the proposed MDP scheme greatly improved the delay
   performance for both DS and BE services, compared to the shortest queue

Abstract = {{In northern countries, ice storms can cause major power disruptions such
   as the one that occurred on December 2013 that left more than 300,000
   customers in Toronto with no electricity immediately after such an ice
   storm. Detection of ice formation on power cables can help on taking
   actions for removing the ice before a major problem occurs. A computer
   vision solution was developed to detect ice on difficult imaging
   scenarios such as images taken under fog conditions that reduces the
   image contrast, passing cars that are within the field of view of the
   camera as well as different illumination problems that can occur when
   taking images during different times of the day. Based on a neural
   network for classification and six image features that can deal with
   these difficult images, we reduced the errors on a set of images that
   was previously yielding 20 errors out of 50 images to only one error.}},

Abstract = {{Laminar film condensation is an important phenomenon which occurs in
   numerous industrial applications such as refrigeration, chemical
   processing, and thermal power generation industries. It is well known
   that film condensation heat transfer is greatly reduced in the presence
   of a non-condensing gas. The present work performs a numerical analysis
   of the steady-state, laminar film condensation from a vapour-gas mixture
   in vertical parallel plate channels to demonstrate a computer model that
   could assist engineering analysts designing systems involving these
   phenomena. The present model has three new aspects relative to other
   current work. First, the complete elliptic two-dimensional governing
   equations are solved in both phases. Thus, the entire channel domain is
   solved rather than using an approach that marches along the channel from
   inlet to a prescribed length. Second, a dynamically determined sharp
   interface is used between the phases. This sharp interface is determined
   during the solution on a non-orthogonal structured mesh. Third, the
   governing equations are solved in a fully-coupled approach. The
   equations for two velocities, pressure, temperature, and gas mass
   fraction are solved in a coupled method simultaneously for both phases.
   Discretisation has been done based on a finite volume method and a
   co-located variable storage scheme. An in-house computer code was
   developed to implement the numerical solution scheme. Detailed results
   are presented for laminar film condensation from steam-air mixtures
   flowing in vertical parallel plate channels. The results include
   velocity and pressure profiles, as well as axial variations of film
   thickness, Nusselt number and interface gas mass fraction. Detailed
   comparisons are made with results from a parabolic solution approach.}},

Abstract = {{Upper airway structure is known to be affected in individuals with
   obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In this pilot study, we investigated
   whether the changes of upper airway resistance (UAR) within a breathing
   phase, estimated from tracheal breathing sounds and airflow, is a
   predictor of OSA severity. Tracheal breathing sounds and airflow of 15
   individuals in three groups of mild, moderate and severe OSA during
   wakefulness, recorded in supine position, were used in this study. The
   grouping of the study subjects were done based on their apnea/hypopnea
   index (AHI) per hour, prospectively. The breathing sounds and airflow
   were recorded simultaneously with full overnight polysomnography (PSG)
   assessment. The sounds of 3 noise-free breathing cycles were extracted
   and sequestered into inspiratory and expiratory phase segments manually
   for each study subject. The power spectra of the sound signals of each
   respiratory phase were calculated in 15ms windows with 50\% overlap
   between adjacent windows. The UAR was then estimated as the ratio of the
   energy of power spectrum of each window within 100 to 2500 Hz, and its
   corresponding airflow. Then, the variance of the short-time windows'
   UAR, Var(UAR) during each respiratory phase was calculated. The ratio of
   the Var(UAR) in logarithmic scale between inspiration and expiration was
   found to be significantly different (p<0.01) between the three OSA
   groups; also it was found to be highly correlated with AHI. These
   results are congruent with the hypothesis that the upper airway patency
   is not kept constant in OSA population, and suggest the change in
   acoustic UAR during wakefulness maybe considered as a predictor of OSA.}},

Abstract = {{Rostral fluid shift during sleep from the lower body part into the neck
   can increase neck circumference (NC) and narrow the upper airway. Such
   narrowing in the upper airway may increase turbulence of airflow passing
   through the upper airway; thus, induce snoring. The objective of this
   study was to investigate the effects of changes in NC during sleep on
   snoring sound characteristics. Fifteen non-obese men slept supine, and
   their sleep was monitored by a regular polysomnography. Snoring sounds
   were recorded with a microphone attached to the neck. NC was measured
   before and after sleep with a measuring tape. Snoring sounds' average
   power was calculated in different frequency ranges of 100 - 4000 Hz, 100
   - 150 Hz, 150 - 450 Hz, 450 - 600 Hz, 600 - 1200 Hz, 1200 - 1800 Hz,
   1800 - 2500 Hz and 2500 - 4000 Hz. Statistical analysis showed that
   increases in NC after sleep were strongly correlated with higher average
   power of the snoring sounds in the frequency ranges of 100-4000 Hz
   (r=0.74, P=0.004), 100-150 Hz (r=0.70, P=0.008), 150-450 Hz (r=0.73,
   P=0.005), and 450 - 600 Hz (r=0.65, P=0.025). These results encourage
   the use of snoring sound analysis for monitoring the effects of fluid
   accumulation in the neck in relation to sleep apnea.}},

Abstract = {{Electrovestibulography (EVestG (TM)) is a new technology that
   objectively measures the vestibular response. It has the potential to
   objectively, quickly and cost-effectively screen concussion. EVestG
   signals are recorded painlessly and non-invasively from the external ear
   in response to vestibular stimuli, and consist of brainstem and
   peripheral sensory oto-acoustic signals modulated by the cortical
   responses. In this study, we investigated the relationship between
   characteristic features of the extracted field potentials (FPs) of
   EVestG signals in people with side-impact concussion in comparison with
   those of control participants. 10 side-impact concussed individuals (4
   Right and 6 left side-impact) and 10 age-and-gender-matched controls
   were tested by EVestG. The participants also completed comprehensive
   neuropsychological assessments. Characteristic features were extracted
   from the FPs during side tilt, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
   classification was applied to the extracted features using a
   leaveone-out routine. The results show the difference between the left
   and right FP area was significantly (P<0.05) different. The LDA
   classification resulted a sensitivity of 85\% and specificity of 69\%
   for separating concussed individuals from controls. EVestG appears to
   have diagnostic potential in diagnosing side impact concussion.}},

Abstract = {{The use of Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) to view Virtual Reality
   Environments (VREs) has received much attention recently. This paper
   reports on the difference between actual humans' navigation in a VRE
   viewed through an HMD compared to that in the same VRE viewed on a
   laptop PC display. A novel Virtual Reality (VR) Navigation input device
   (VRNChair), designed by our team, was paired with an Oculus Rift DK2
   Head-Mounted Display (HMD). People used the VRNChair to navigate a VRE,
   and we analyzed their navigational trajectories with and without the HMD
   to investigate plausible differences in performance due to the display
   device. It was found that people's navigational trajectories were more
   accurate while wearing the HMD compared to viewing an LCD monitor;
   however, the duration to complete a navigation task remained the same.
   This implies that increased immersion in VR results in an improvement in
   pathfinding. In addition, motion sickness caused by using an HMD can be
   reduced if one uses an input device such as our VRNChair. The VRNChair
   paired with an HMD provides vestibular stimulation as one moves in the
   VRE, because movements in the VRE are synchronized with movements in the
   real environment.}},

Abstract = {{Age-related deficits in explicit time perception has been reported by
   some studies. However, the findings are inconsistent about the
   preference of older adults to over/under-estimate the observed interval
   as well as the relationship between the time estimation and the
   participant's cognitive status. In this study, we used a verbal
   estimation task for the rotation time of a virtual building (40 seconds)
   to assess the explicit interval timing of participants. The performance
   of a cohort of 250 cognitively-healthy adults and 10 Alzheimer's
   patients was analyzed in relation to their age and cognitive scale,
   measured by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. The
   participants' performances were evaluated based on three measurements:
   Coefficient of variation (CV) for measuring stability, Absolute Error
   (AE) for measuring accuracy and Directional Error (DE) for measuring the
   degree of over/under-estimation. A significant difference was observed
   between the participants who overestimated the interval and those who
   underestimated it in terms of age, cognitive status and Absolute Error.
   We also found a significant effect of time estimation, with
   underestimation by cognitively healthy participants to mild
   over-estimation by 70+ year old and low-MoCA (MoCA score < 26)
   participants as well as severe overestimation by Alzheimer's disease
   patients. The result of regression analysis for predicting MoCA score

   propose a new threshold-based selection strategy which can achieve the
   transmission capacity balance between input and output links of every

Abstract = {{Future wireless networks are expected to be highly heterogeneous with
   the co-existence of macrocells and small cells and they will also
   provide support for device-to-device (D2D) communication. In such
   muti-tier heterogeneous systems, centralized radio resource allocation
   and interference management schemes will not be scalable. In this work,
   we propose an auction-based distributed solution to allocate radio
   resources in a muti-tier heterogeneous network. We provide the bound of
   achievable data rate and show that the complexity of the proposed scheme
   is linear with the number of transmitter nodes and the available
   resources. The signaling issues (e.g., information exchange over control
   channels) for the proposed distributed solution is also discussed.
   Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution in
   comparison with an optimal centralized resource allocation scheme.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate an online spectrum auction problem in
   cognitive radio networks with uncertain activities of primary users
   (PUs). In our framework, a primary base station (PBS), acted as the
   spectrum auctioneer, leases its under-utilized channels to secondary
   users (SUs) who request and access spectrum on the fly. Different from
   most of existing works in online spectrum allocation, we focus on a more
   practical situation that the auctioneer (or the PBS) has no prior
   knowledge of PUs' activities so that its channel states are not static.
   In order to balance the auction profits from granted SUs' spectrum
   requests and the potential penalties caused by incomplete services to
   PUs, we introduce the idea of virtual spectrum sellers and formulate the
   problem as an online double spectrum auction. We then propose a novel
   online admission and pricing mechanism which also considers the
   reusability of wireless spectrum. Theoretical analyses are provided to
   prove that our auction algorithm satisfies all desired economic
   properties in terms of budget-balance, individual rationality and
   truthfulness. Simulation results show that our proposed auction
   algorithm can increase the utility of the PBS, enhance spectrum
   utilization and achieve better satisfaction for SUs compared to
   counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{In an underlay cognitive radio network (CRN), in order to guarantee
   protection of primary users (PUs) (i.e., all PUs achieve their target
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios {[}SINRs]), the interference
   caused by all secondary users (SUs) to the primary receiving-points
   should be controlled. To do so, the feasible cognitive interference
   region (FCIR), i.e., the region for allowable values of interference at
   all of the primary receiving-points, which guarantee protecting the PUs,
   needs to be formally characterized. In the state-of-the-art interference
   management schemes for underlay CRNs, it is considered that all PUs are
   protected if the cognitive interference for each primary receiving-point
   is lower than a maximum threshold, the so called interference
   temperature limit (ITL) for the corresponding receiving-point. This is
   assumed to be fixed and independent of ITL values for other primary
   receiving-points. This corresponds to a box-like FCIR, which is not
   correct. In this paper, we analytically obtain the FCIR and show that,
   the FCIR is a polyhedron (i.e., the maximum feasible cognitive
   interference threshold for each primary receiving-point is not constant,
   and it depends on that for other primary receiving-points). Therefore,
   in practical interference management algorithms, it is not proper to
   consider a constant and independent ITL value for each of the primary
   receiving-points. This finding would significantly affect the design of
   practical interference management schemes for CRNs.}},

Abstract = {{Algotuf is a new steel which is proposed as a candidate for armour
   material. To assess this application, a study of the impact properties
   of this steel was conducted at the University of Manitoba using two
   types of Hopkinson Bar systems, namely a torsional bar equipment and a
   direct impact system capable of producing high strain rates and large
   strains. Stress strain curves for the steels were obtained in pure shear
   and in compression. Temperatures of 25 degrees C, 200 degrees C and 500
   degrees C were used in the testing. Following the testing, a
   microstructural examination of the specimens tested was carried out to
   investigate the effect of microstructure on the mechanism of failure of
   this material. It was found that, above a value of impact momentum
   corresponding to a high strain rate, adiabatic shear bands are formed.
   The microscopic examination showed that the initiation of these shear
   bands corresponded at locations where martensitic laths were present and
   around regions of maximum shear stresses. Generally, the shear bands act
   as precursors to the formation of microcracks that may lead to failure.
   On the other hand, the high strength and formability of the steel makes
   it suitable for use as an armour material.}},

Abstract = {{Pre-deformation and post-deformation microstructure characterization was
   conducted on tempered 4340 steel and commercial pure copper specimens
   under impact to determine the microstructural changes and the mechanism
   of grain refinement that occur during the evolution of ASBs. It was
   observed that the movement and multiplication of dislocations,
   elongation of grains, breaking of elongated grains, rotation, carbide
   fragmentation and boundary refinement of broken grains occur
   simultaneously during the evolution of ASBs in the impacted 4340 steel
   specimens. The extent of these mechanisms depends on the imposed local
   strain and strain rate. Extensive grain refinement coupled with high
   density of dislocations results in the shear band structures being more
   susceptible to crack nucleation and propagation. In copper, it was
   observed that sequential occurrence of emergence of dislocations,
   dislocation cell formations with varying cell boundaries and cell
   interiors, dynamic recovery and extensive micro-twinning results in the
   formation of the shear bands. The structure within the evolved shear
   bands becomes less brittle after the onset of dynamic recovery and
   micro-twinning. The differences in the mechanism of grain refinement and
   evolution of the shear bands in both materials is attributed to the
   differences in the mobility of dislocations, the rate of strain
   hardening and strain hardening exponents in both materials studied.}},

   work, pressboard samples were thermally stressed in air inside an oven
   to produce pressboards with differing levels of thermal aging and
   therefore varying surface irregularities. Another set of samples were
   immersed in insulating oil after thermal stressing, and stressed
   electrically to produce surface tracking partial discharges. A
   statistical texture analysis of the thermally and electrically stressed
   samples was used to demonstrate that the surface condition of pressboard

Abstract = {{Traditional low order numerical method of computational electromagnetics
   produce notably higher error when applied to analysis of plasmonic
   nano-structures compared to the structures with conventional values of

   observed at the junctions of the low-order elements on the surface of
   such structures. It is caused by the artificial geometrical
   discontinuities resulted from flat panelled approximation of the
   physically smooth surface. Increase of the low-order discretization
   density typically does not reduce such error effectively. In this work
   we describe higher-order boundary element modelling approach which
   eliminates such errors and provides error-controlled approximation of
   the fields in arbitrary smooth 3D structures down to machine precision

   low-loss microwave substrates and considered as nearly perfect magnetic
   walls to realize microwave components. The permittivity contrast between
   the substrate and film is kept high in order to minimize the leakage
   power and consequently the insertion loss. An approximate theoretical
   technique is used to analyze the structures. The theoretical results are
   confirmed by experimental results and the results from a
   simulation-based numerical method. The impact of dielectric loss of the
   film is much less than that of the substrate, allowing realization of
   highly efficient components using films with medium loss properties
   (e.g., epsilon'' = 3). Several prototypes including waveguide and
   antennas are fabricated by screenprinting and characterized at different

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},

Pages = {{1799-1808}},
Abstract = {{A mobile app for smartphones and tablets to document pressure ulcers was
   previously developed. The mobile app is part of the rapidly growing
   field of mobile health. The mobile app replaces paper-based
   documentation in a healthcare facility with an electronic record. In a
   user trial in 2013, a key finding was the high value attributed to wound
   image (photograph) galleries in the mobile app and wound tracking though
   graphing progression. Consequently, work was undertaken to enhance the
   imaging features by developing image analysis algorithms for size and
   color determination of wounds from wound images taken with an on-board
   smartphone or tablet camera, using no peripheral hardware or ancillary
   devices in setting up the image. The reliance solely on the internal
   smartphone sensors to generate high-accuracy measurements brings novelty
   to the work and specifically in the field of wound management. The work
   includes three components. The first component, referred to as mask
   image, obtains the dimensions of an object in the image. The second
   component, referred to as camera calibration, reconstructs an image
   taken on an angle (3-D) referenced back to a 2-D plane. The third
   algorithm determines the range of colors present in an image, separating
   the image into three component colors by extracting components from the
   Red Green Blue format of the image, and converting output to red yellow
   black. An expert system and/or machine learning is recommended to
   enhance the correlation of wound color to wound stage.}},

Abstract = {{Downlink cell association (CA) is studied for cellular heterogeneous
   networks (HetNets) where large-scale antenna array is implemented at the
   macro base station (BS), while the opportunistically deployed small
   cells are single-antenna nodes, and they rely on over-the-air links to
   the macro base station for backhaul. The coupling constraint due to
   in-band wireless backhaul becomes another key criterion for cell
   association. A duplex and spectrum sharing scheme based on reverse
   timedivision duplex (TDD) is considered for interference management in
   the HetNet under the wireless backhaul constraint. A sum
   logarithmic-throughput maximization problem is formulated to balance
   throughput and fairness. By relaxing the binary cell association
   indicator variables, the optimization problem is shown to be a convex
   problem. Dual decomposition for relaxed optimization is employed to
   solve the integer nonlinear CA problem, which results in a distributed
   CA algorithm. Improved performance and fairness are achieved with the
   proposed algorithm under the wireless backhaul constraint, and more
   small cells implemented within the macro cell range achieves better load
   balancing. As no additional radio frequency hardware is required by the
   proposed scheme, it allows low-cost and fast implementation of wireless
   backhaul enabled cellular HetNets.}},

Title = {{Modeling and quantifying uncertainty in the product design phase for

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to quantify external and internal
   uncertainties in product
   design process. The research addresses the measure of product future
   changes. Design/methodology/approach - Two methods are proposed to model
   and quantify uncertainty in the product life cycle. Changes of user
   preferences are considered as the external uncertainty. Changes stemming
   from dependencies between components are addressed as the internal
   uncertainty. Both methods use developed mechanisms to capture and treat
   changes of user preferences. An agent-based model is developed to
   simulate sociotechnical events in the product life cycle for the
   external uncertainty. An innovative application of Big Data Analytics
   (BDA) is proposed to evaluate the external and internal uncertainties in
   product design. The methods can identify the most affected product
   components under uncertainty.
   Findings - The results show that the proposed method could identify
   product changes during its life cycle, particularly using the proposed
   BDA method.
   Practical implications - It is essential for manufacturers in the
   competitive market to know their product changes under uncertainty.
   Proposed methods have potential to optimize design parameters in complex
   environments.
   Originality/value - This research bridges the gap of literature in the
   accurate estimation of uncertainty. The research integrates the change
   prediction and change transferring, applies data management methods
   innovatively, and utilizes the proposed methods practically.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio networks (CRN) has been depicted as one of the most
   important driving forces in achieving next generation wireless
   communication capabilities. To this end, several works are being done in
   describing and designing this new wireless communication paradigm. In
   this work, a study on how dynamic resource allocation can be used in
   achieving the desired quality of service (QoS) in a heterogeneous CRN
   environment is carried out. An underlay CRN model is developed where, in
   the resource allocation formulation, the demands of secondary users
   differ but must be met concomitantly. The objective is to maximize the
   weighted data rate of the different categories of users in the CRN, and
   by so doing, achieve some required QoS. The developed problem is both
   non-linear and also non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) hard.
   However, the problem is smartly re-formulated as an integer linear
   programming problem and the branch-and-bound approach is employed in
   obtaining optimal solutions. The QoS metrics evaluated are average data
   rate, throughput and outage probability. The results obtained show that
   optimal solutions with QoS satisfaction are achievable for the
   heterogeneous CRN.}},

Journal = {{PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{154}},
Pages = {{1-21}},
Abstract = {{Novel microwave imaging systems require flexible forward solvers capable
   of incorporating arbitrary boundary conditions and inhomogeneous
   background constitutive parameters. In this work we focus on the
   implementation of a time-harmonic Discontinuous Galerkin Method (DGM)
   forward solver with a number of features that aim to benefit tomographic
   microwave imaging algorithms: locally varying high-order polynomial
   field expansions, locally varying high-order representations of the
   complex constitutive parameters, and exact radiating boundary
   conditions. The DGM formulated directly from Maxwell's curl equations
   facilitates including both electric and magnetic contrast functions, the
   latter being important when considering quantitative imaging with
   magnetic contrast agents. To improve forward solver performance we
   formulate the DGM for time-harmonic electric and magnetic vector wave
   equations driven by both electric and magnetic sources. Sufficient
   implementation details are provided to permit existing DGM codes based
   on nodal expansions of Maxwell's curl equations to be converted to the
   wave equation formulations. Results are shown to validate the DGM
   forward solver framework for transverse magnetic problems that might
   typically be found in tomographic imaging systems, illustrating how
   high-order expansions of the constitutive parameters can be used to
   improve forward solver performance.}},

Abstract = {{The use of modeling in an agricultural context under cold climates is
   challenging because of processes such as freezing, thawing, and
   snowmelt, which have significant effects on field hydrology. DRAINMOD is
   one of the most widely used models for design and performance evaluation
   of drainage systems and has routines that represent cold-region
   hydrological processes. The objectives of this research were to validate
   DRAINMOD simulations of water table depth and drainage outflow under
   conditions prevailing in the Canadian Prairies and to use this model to
   evaluate the design criteria usually adopted in Manitoba. The dataset
   from one growing season was used to calibrate the model for water table
   depth and drainage outflow. Two additional growing seasons of data were
   used for validation. One year of data was used for model warm-up prior
   to the calibration year. The Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency (EF)
   ranged from 0.79 to 0.95 for water table and from 0.60 to 0.70 for
   drainage outflow simulations. The normalized percent error (NPE) ranged
   from 3.9\% to 14.5\% for drainage simulations, while the mean absolute
   error (MAE) ranged from 4.8 to 9.3 cm for water table simulations.
   Evaluation of drainage designs suggested for Manitoba using a 20-year
   dataset indicated that the design criteria generally adopted in this
   province (i.e., 0.9 m depth and 15 m spacing) need not be widely used
   across different soil types. For the sandy loam soils used in this
   study, a maximum drain spacing of 40 m could be used without significant
   yield losses. Simulated yields were found to be more sensitive to excess
   moisture conditions at the beginning of the growing season.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a method for the analysis of the motion of an
   electromagnet armature when given voltages are applied at its terminals.
   The nonlinearity of the ferromagnetic core is treated by the
   polarization fixed point method (PFPM), the magnetic polarization
   correction being performed iteratively in terms of the magnetic field
   intensity. A hybrid Finite Element Method (FEM) - Boundary Element
   Method (BEM) technique is employed in order to solve the electromagnetic
   field problem. The FEM is used for the computation of the field within
   the ferromagnetic bodies and, independently, the BEM is applied to the
   outside free space, the coupling between the FEM and BEM domains being
   performed by an iterative correction of the boundary conditions. The
   terminal voltages determine the coil magnetic fluxes and, then, the
   current density is obtained by integrating the vector potential over the
   coil cross sections. The variation with time of the terminal voltages is
   also taken into account in the solution of the coupled
   electro-mechanical problem. The response is determined for terminal
   voltages applied at various times within a period.}},

Abstract = {{The cost of managing an inventory of bridges can be significantly
   reduced by deferring replacement of bridges using the combination of
   testing and structural health monitoring (SHM). In the US it is
   estimated there are 63,522 structurally deficient bridges out of a total
   bridge inventory of 607,751. A surprisingly small number have been
   placed there based on structural testing. Bridges that are structurally
   tested are often, but not always, found to have a higher load capacity
   than that estimated by analysis alone {[}1]. The underestimates may be
   due to the prudent application of safety margins due to uncertainty
   about materials and construction. It may also be due to over simplified
   structural assumptions, inaccurate modelling of boundary conditions and
   ignoring the load bearing capacity of ``non-structural{''} elements.
   However, once results from testing are available, it is the updated
   estimate of the capacity that is the most appropriate to use. One can
   conclude that the replacement many bridges could be deferred through
   testing to ensure capacity and the application of monitoring to ensure
   ongoing capacity and safety. The economic return of deferring
   replacement is very high as the yearly borrowing cost for even modest
   structures exceeds the cost of typical SHM system. In this work, a
   bridge testing and SHM policy was used for model calculations on an
   inventory of bridges. Based on an annual model budget of \$100 million
   for structurally deficient bridge construction and \$5 million for
   construction per bridge. In this paper we will present cost simulations
   over ten years that utilize a policy of testing, monitoring or
   replacement to maximize the utilization of the bridge assets. The
   simulations predict application of SHM could reduce a ten year \$1
   billion budget by over \$600 million.}},

Abstract = {{Spring flooding in the Red River basin is a recurrent issue in the
   Province of Manitoba, Canada. There have been a number of flood events
   in recent years and climate change has been suggested as a potential
   cause. This paper employs a relatively simple model for predicting
   changes in the frequency distribution of annual spring peak discharge of
   the Red River as a response to increased GHG concentrations. A
   regression model is used to predict spring peak flow from antecedent
   precipitation in the previous fall, winter snow accumulation, and spring
   precipitation. Data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project -
   Phase 5 (CMIP5) are used to estimate changes in the predictor variables
   and this information is then employed to derive flood distributions for
   future climate conditions. Most climate models predict increased
   precipitation during winter months but this trend is partly offset by a
   shorter snow accumulation period and higher winter evaporation rates.
   The means and medians of an ensemble of 16 climate models do not suggest
   a particular trend toward more or less frequent floods of the Red River.
   However, the ensemble range is relatively large, highlighting the
   difficulties involved in estimating changes in extreme events.}},

Title = {{A Directional Antenna in a Matching Liquid for Microwave Radar Imaging}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The detailed design equations and antenna parameters for a directional
   antenna for breast imaging are presented in this paper. The antenna was
   designed so that it could be immersed in canola oil to achieve efficient
   coupling of the electromagnetic energy to the breast tissue. Ridges were
   used in the horn antenna to increase the operating bandwidth. The
   antenna has an exponentially tapered section for impedance matching. The
   double-ridged horn antenna has a wideband performance from 1.5 GHz to
   5GHz (3.75 GHz or 110\% of impedance bandwidth), which is suitable for
   breast microwave radar imaging. The fabricated antenna was tested and
   compared with simulated results, and similar bandwidths were obtained.
   Experiments were conducted on breast phantoms using these antennas, to
   detect a simulated breast lesion. The reconstructed image from the
   experiments shows distinguishable tumor responses indicating promising
   results for successful breast cancer detection.}},

Title = {{Polyhydroxybutyrate Production from Municipal Wastewater Activated
   Sludge with Different Carbon Sources}},
Journal = {{Air Soil and Water Research}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a sequencing batch reactor was set up and operated for
   over three months to cultivate polyphosphate-accumulating organisms
   polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs) in the enriched activated
   sludge. Batch studies were then carried out to study the effect of
   different carbon sources on phosphorus removal as well as
   polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production. The carbon sources investigated
   were acetate, glucose, wastewater, and beef extract. It was found that
   enhanced biological phosphorus removal could not be achieved using
   glucose as substrate. This suggested that glucose was not a good
   candidate for biological phosphorus removal. In terms of PHB production,
   using acetate and glucose as substrate resulted in PHB production of
   42\% and 40\%, respectively, of the dry cell weight (DCW). Lower PHB
   production was obtained from using municipal wastewater and beef extract
   as a carbon source. This resulted in similar to 15\% and 13\% of DCW. It
   was concluded that municipal wastewater activated sludge can be an
   economic alternative for PHB production if municipal wastewater is mixed
   with certain kinds of carbon-enriched industrial wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{The article concerns of the problem of regression functions estimation
   when the output is contaminated by additive nonstationary noise. We
   investigate the model yi = R(x(i)) + Z(i), i = 1, 2, ... n, where x(i)
   is assumed to be the set of deterministic inputs (d-dimensional vector),
   yi is the scalar, probabilistic outputs, and Z(i) is a measurement noise
   with zero mean and variance depending on n. R(.) is a completely unknown
   function. The problem of finding function R(.) may be solved by applying
   non-parametric methodology, for instance: algorithms based on the Parzen
   kernel or algorithms derived from orthogonal series. In this work we
   present the orthogonal series approach. The analysis has been made for
   some class of nonstationarity. We present the conditions of convergence
   of the estimation algorithm for the variance of noise growing up when
   number of observations is tending to infinity. The results of numerical
   simulations are presented.}},

Title = {{Assessment of Hip Fracture Risk Using Cross-Section Strain Energy
   Determined by QCT-Based Finite Element Modeling}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Accurate assessment of hip fracture risk is very important to prevent
   hip fracture and to monitor the effect of a treatment. A
   subjects-pecific QCT-based finite element model was constructed to
   assess hip fracture risk at the critical locations of femur during the
   single-leg stance and the sideways fall. The aim of this study was to
   improve the prediction of hip fracture risk by introducing a novel
   failure criterion to more accurately describe bone failure mechanism.
   Hip fracture risk index was defined using cross-section strain energy,
   which is able to integrate information of stresses, strains, and
   material properties affecting bone failure. It was found that the
   femoral neck and the intertrochanteric region have higher fracture risk
   than other parts of the femur, probably owing to the larger content of
   cancellous bone in these regions. The study results also suggested that
   women are more prone to hip fracture than men. The findings in this
   study have a good agreement with those clinical observations reported in
   the literature. The proposed hip fracture risk index based on strain
   energy has the potential of more accurate assessment of hip fracture
   risk. However, experimental validation should be conducted before its
   clinical applications.}},

Abstract = {{In view of the emerging resistance in bacteria against biocides, this
   work describes a novel combination of two existing biocides in one
   molecule to improve the bactericidal activity and overcome bacterial
   resistance. A new series of ``composite{''} biocides combining an amide
   based N-chloramine with a quaternary ammonium (QA) moiety in one
   molecule was synthesized and the antibacterial kinetics of each biocide
   was tested against two clinically retrieved bacteria:
   methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and multi-drug resistant (MDR) P.
   aeruginosa. The addition of multiple cationic centers into one
   N-chloramine molecule did not result in enhanced inactivation of
   bacteria. The bactericidal activity against both microbes increased
   dramatically when the length of the alkyl chain of QA moiety in these
   biocides increased to 12 and 14. Covalently bonding N-chloramine with
   long-chained QA moieties did result in faster kill of MRSA and MDR P.
   aeruginosa than the formulation with two separate counterparts
   (N-chloramine and long-chained QA salts). Uptake isotherm curves of the
   ``composite{''} biocides with long alkyl chain substitution revealed
   more uptakes of the ``composite{''} biocides by bacteria than the
   precursor mono-functional biocides (with only QA moieties). An improved
   antibacterial activity resulted from covalently bonding the two biocides
   (N-chloramine and long-chained QA salts) into one molecule.}},

   Our method involves extraction of texture statistical features (spatial
   gray level dependence matrix method), application of an unsupervised
   clustering algorithm (K-means) on these features, and mapping of the
   clustered regions: background, plaque, vascular tissue and an OCT
   degraded signal region in feature-space, back to the actual image. We
   verified the validity of our results by visual comparison to photographs
   of the vascular tissue with atherosclerotic plaque that were used to
   generate our OCT images. Our method could be potentially used in
   clinical studies in OCT imaging of atherosclerotic plaque.}},

   SOIL-ENGAGING TOOL}},
Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{987-996}},
Abstract = {{PFC3D is a discrete element modeling tool that has been used for
   simulations of soil-tool interaction in agriculture. However, existing
   studies have mainly focused on simulations of soil cutting forces, not
   soil flow. In this study, a soil-tool model was developed using the
   parallel bond model (PBM) of PFC3D to determine if the model could be
   used to simulate the soil flow characteristics resulting from a simple
   soil-engaging tool while satisfying the draft force prediction accuracy.
   In the simulations, soil was modeled as spherical particles with bonds
   between particles. The model outputs examined were the two most
   important soil dynamic properties: thrown-soil and draft force. By
   examining the effects of model microproperties on the simulated
   thrown-soil and draft force, we found that the feasible ranges of the
   model microproperties were: 1e4 to 5e6 Pa for the modulus of elasticity
   of particle, 1e5 to 1e8 Pa for the modulus of elasticity of bond, 1e4 to
   1e5 Pa for bond strength, 0.3 to 0.7 for local damping coefficient, and
   0 to 1.0 for viscous damping coefficient. For simulation of soil-tool
   interactions, the model microproperties should be selected within these
   feasible ranges. Otherwise, the behavior of the model particles would
   not reflect the behavior of real soil. Within these feasible ranges, the
   model outputs were influenced the most by the modulus of particle
   elasticity; the other model microproperties had little impact on the
   model outputs. Soil cutting tests were conducted in a sandy loam soil to
   evaluate the soil-tool model. The results showed that a modulus of
   particle elasticity of 2.5e5 Pa resulted in a good match between the
   simulated and measured draft forces. However, with this modulus, the
   simulated thrown-soil was significantly lower than the measured value.
   Further investigations showed that it may not be possible to match the
   simulated and measured thrown-soil using the PBM of PFC3D. Therefore,
   redefining the constitutive laws of particle contacts would be required
   to improve the accuracy of the model for simulations of soil flow
   behavior.}},

Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE}},

Abstract = {{Silo bags have been used by Canadian farmers in the last few years to
   temporarily store cereal grains, pulses, and oilseeds for up to one
   year. It is difficult to install temperature and moisture cables inside
   silo bags or conduct sampling because any cutting of the silo bag
   damages its hermeticity. Mathematical models could be used to predict
   spoilage during storage, and the accuracy of mathematical models is
   influenced by soil temperature. In this study, soil temperature models
   were developed based on the energy balance on the surface of the ground
   and heat conduction equations (HCE). The surface of the ground was
   covered with snow during winter and with vegetation during summer. The
   developed soil models were coupled with the developed three-dimensional
   transient heat, mass, and momentum transfer models inside silo bags. The
   developed models were validated using weather data (solar radiation,
   temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and snow covering) and
   temperatures collected inside bulk canola in silo bags with 9.1\% and
   10.5\% moisture contents. The prediction accuracy associated with the
   HCE models was compared with that associated with Fourier series, which
   has been used in the literature. The HCE models developed in this study
   had higher prediction accuracy than the Fourier series. The maximum
   absolute difference and average absolute difference between the measured
   and predicted (by the HCE models) canola temperature at 10 cm height of
   the canola from the bottom of the silo bag were 3.23 degrees C and <1.79
   degrees C +/- 0.04 degrees C, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional transient heat, mass, and momentum transfer model
   was developed to predict temperatures and moisture contents of canola
   stored inside silo bags under Canadian Prairie conditions. The developed
   model calculated the condensation and production of water and heat
   generated by the respiration of microorganisms inside silo bags. This
   model was coupled with the soil temperature model developed in part I.
   These developed models were validated using weather data as input and
   measured temperatures and moisture contents inside silo bags filled with
   canola at 9.1\%, 10.5\%, or 14.4\% initial moisture content (MC). The
   developed models had a poor prediction of the temperature and moisture
   content of the 14.4\% MC canola because the canola seeds spoiled and
   clumped together in less than four months. The developed models could
   explain more than 90\% of the measured temperatures inside the silo bags
   filled with 10.5\% MC canola without underestimation or overestimation.
   The average absolute difference was less than 1.9 degrees C +/- 0.1
   degrees C and 0.7 degrees C +/- 0.0 degrees C inside silo bags with
   9.1\% and 10.5\% initial MC, respectively. The developed models could
   explain more than 94\% of the measured moisture contents of canola
   stored inside the silo bags with <= 10.5\% initial MC. The average
   absolute difference between measured and predicted moisture contents of
   canola was <= 0.4\% +/- 0.0\% inside the silo bags filled with 9.1\% and
   10.5\% MC canola. Simulation results showed that condensation on the
   canola seeds mostly occurred at the boundary of silo bags, and canola
   inside hot spots might produce >= 2.5 fold of heat production, which was
   measured under small-scale laboratory conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Angiogenesis and re-epithelialization are critical factors in skin wound
   healing. Growth factors and stem cells have demonstrated their active
   roles in promoting these two processes. Peptides show similar effects
   with growth factors with lower cost and controllable properties. Here we
   report a biomimetic fragment of the laminin -Ser-Ile-Lys-Val-Ala-Val
   (SIKVAV)-conjugated chitosan hydrogel that can promote skin
   regeneration. In vitro we found that this peptide-conjugated hydrogel
   significantly promoted BMSC adhesion and proliferation. In vivo, this
   hydrogel accelerated wound contraction. The subcutaneous implantation
   test and H\&E staining results revealed that the peptide-modified
   chitosan hydrogel dramatically led to the formation of new blood
   vessels. Moreover, Masson staining showed that many newborn collagen
   fibers appeared in the peptide hydrogel group, while only a few newborn
   collagen fibers were found in control and chitosan hydrogel groups. The
   peptide chitosan hydrogel also re-epithelialized quickly, while the
   control and chitosan hydrogel took more time to complete. These results
   suggest that the SIKVAV peptide is an effective motif to significantly
   improve the function of chitosan in angiogenesis and
   re-epithelialization of skin.}},

Abstract = {{The support structure in a prototypical foreign credentials recognition
   program for internationally-educated engineers (immigrant engineers) was
   assessed via survey research with four cohorts of program participants

   the dynamics when one cultural group (in this case, Filipino) greatly
   outnumbers all other cultural groups represented within the overall
   cohort. The framework of collectivism is used to explain the underlying
   motives and intentions of group behaviours, and the framework of social
   capital sheds light on intra-and inter-group dynamics that may not be
   readily apparent to group members themselves. The findings can serve as
   a guide to other qualifications recognition programs and to initiatives,

Abstract = {{The load transfer index (U{*}), is a relatively new concept compared to
   its counterpart of structural stress analysis. The U{*} index
   characterises the internal stiffness distributions, which indicates the
   load transferring function of the prospective structure. Although the
   U{*} index and stress values have been proven to be useful indices in
   design, a systematic comparison between the conventional stress analysis
   and the loads transfer analysis (based on U{*} index) is lacking. In
   this study, using a component of the parcel rack from multiple passenger
   vehicles as an example, we demonstrate the unique capability of U{*},
   indicating the load transferring function. We further show how the
   combination of the load index U{*} and the stress distributions provides
   a comprehensive understanding of the structure's response to various
   loading conditions. More importantly, we will discuss how the U{*} can
   provide unique guidelines for structure design with the purpose of
   improving the load transfer capacity and reducing the weight.}},

Journal = {{BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{564-585}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce a method of the
   bottleneck detection for Emergency Department (ED) improvement using
   benchmarking and design of experiments (DOE) in simulation model.
   Design/methodology/approach - Four procedures of treatments are used to
   represent ED activities of the patient flow. Simulation modeling is
   applied as a cost-effective tool to analyze the ED operation.
   Benchmarking provides the achievable goal for the improvement. DOE
   speeds up the process of bottleneck search.
   Findings - It is identified that the long waiting time is accumulated by
   previous arrival patients waiting for treatment in the ED. Comparing the
   processing time of each treatment procedure with the benchmark reveals
   that increasing the treatment time mainly happens in treatment in
   progress and emergency room holding (ERH) procedures. It also indicates
   that the to be admitted time caused by the transfer delay is a common
   case.
   Research limitations/implications - The current research is conducted in
   the ED only. Activities in the ERH require a close cooperation of
   several medical teams to complete patients' condition evaluations. The
   current model may be extended to the related medical units to improve
   the model detail.
   Practical implications - ED overcrowding is an increasingly significant
   public healthcare problem. Bottlenecks that affect ED overcrowding have
   to be detected to improve the patient flow.
   Originality/value - Integration of benchmarking and DOE in simulation
   modeling proposed in this research shows the promise in time-saving for
   bottleneck detection of ED operations.}},

   duration of SWR during the spring. Analysis of limiting failure strain
   should be applied to other pavements to verify the findings. For the
   strain-based concept to be practical, use of the Minnesota thawing index

   can be further used for correcting experimental results obtained from
   conventional wind tunnels. When the derived correction factor is applied
   to a numerical simulation of a wind tunnel with a conventional test
   section (for points located in the front portion of the airfoil), the
   resulting pressure variations closely resembled that of a far-field
   numerical simulation. This methodology showed promising results for the
   specific configurations used in this research.}},

Abstract = {{A planar interdigitated sample substrate has been designed to support a
   thin-film sample of a polymer while the frequency-dependent dielectric
   properties of the thin film are measured. Trenches for the electrodes
   were etched into a SiO2/Si wafer surface. Chromium was used as an
   adhesion layer prior to thermal evaporation of copper for the body of
   the electrode. The device was placed in a standard probe station and the
   dielectric character was recorded as a function of frequency with an
   impedance analyser. Devices with 20 to 70 fingers were measured and the
   results compared to analytical and finite element simulations. At 1 kHz,
   the total capacitance of a typical 20-finger device was 8 pF. The
   capacitive contribution of the thin film due to the fringing field in
   the polymer was about 2\% of the total capacitance of the fabricated
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{Facial depressed defects are a common cosmetic problem. Temporary
   fillers need to be re-injected frequently to maintain the desired
   outcomes. Here, the feasibility of a novel type of injectable hydrogel
   for persistent effect is demonstrated. We first useed agmatine to
   synthesize a poly(amidoamine) (PAA) to form a cell-attachable
   crosslinker and then the crosslinker was co-polymerized with
   N-isopropylacrylamide to obtain an injectable and temperature sensitive
   hydrogel. H-1 NMR showed the successful synthesis of the crosslinker. In
   vitro tests, CCK-8 assay and live/dead viability test showed that the
   hydrogel was non-toxic to adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). SEM images
   also confirmed that ASCs could adhere to the hydrogel. Then we
   constructed a novel depressed defect model in rats and injected four
   different fillers in the depressed defects: (1) the hydrogel with ASCs,
   (2) the hydrogel only, (3) hyaluronic acid, and (4) PBS. After 4 weeks,
   gross and histological analyses showed the defects in hydrogel, hydrogel
   + ASCs, and HA groups improved significantly and there were no
   significant differences among them. Significant differences in thickness
   from skin to muscle in the defect was found between the hydrogel + ASCs
   group and the other groups after 6 months. The hydrogels degraded
   completely in defects in both the hydrogel group and the hydrogel + ASCs
   group, and were filled with adipocytes and multilocular immature
   adipocytes. Immunohistochemical study using s-100 and perilipin staining
   revealed adipocyte differentiation in the defect sites. We also used
   green fluorescent protein (GFP)-ASCs for tracing and found that
   exogenous added ASCs were involved in adipogenesis. In conclusion, such
   a cell attachable thermosensitive hydrogel has definite potential not
   only as a filler but also as a scaffold, and has a persistent effect for
   small depressed defects. It might ultimately become a new material in
   plastic and reconstructive surgery.}},

Abstract = {{We report an injectable aldehyded 1-amino-3,3-diethoxy-propane
   (ADEP)-hyaluronic acid (AHA)-chitosan (CS) hydrogel. This hydrogel can
   enhance wound healing by promoting cell migration, proliferation,
   granulation and angiogensis. During sol-gel transition, no chemical
   crosslinking agent was introduced and the structure of polysaccharide HA
   was grafted with a functional molecule, 1-amino-3,3-diethoxy-propane,
   but without using oxidation to break the HA structure as previously
   reported. Rheological tests showed the injectability and stability of
   this AHA-CS hydrogel. Full thickness skin defects (1 cm x 1 cm) were
   made on mice and the adipose derived stem cell loaded gel was tested in
   the healing-impaired wound. The AHA-CA hydrogel significantly
   accelerated wound closure, increased cell proliferation (Ki67 marker)
   and promoted keratinocyte migration (p63 marker). Histological
   examination demonstrated that the gel significantly advanced granulation
   tissue and capillary formation in the gel-treated wounds. mRNA
   expressions of angiogenesis (VEGF-A), chemotactic factors (SDF-1) and
   ECM-remodeling MMPs (MMP1 and MMP9) were also up-regulated in the
   hydrogel-treated wounds.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{872-899}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents experimental investigation of upstream roughness and
   Reynolds number effects on the recirculation region over a smooth
   forward facing step. The upstream rough wall was produced from 1.5 mm
   sand grains and the Reynolds number based on step height, Re-h, was
   varied from 2040 to 9130 for both the upstream smooth and rough walls.
   For the smooth wall, the reattachment length increased monotonically
   with Reh to an asymptotic value of 2.2 step heights for Re-h >= 6380.
   Upstream roughness reduced the reattachment length by 44\% because of
   larger momentum deficit and higher turbulence level in the rough wall
   boundary layer. The mean velocities and Reynolds stresses were also
   reduced by roughness. The Reynolds shear stress and production of
   turbulent kinetic energy showed high negative values at the leading edge
   of the step indicating counter-gradient diffusion. The implications of
   these results for standard eddy viscosity models are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a serious health issue affecting many
   adult women. Complications of POP include pelvic pressure, pelvic pain,
   and problems in emptying their bowels or bladder. Sometimes, POP may
   even cause urinary outflow obstruction and lead to bladder or kidney
   infections. Currently, synthetic and naturally derived materials have
   been chosen for treatment of POP to reduce the high recurrence rates
   after surgical interventions. However, existing materials for POP
   treatment cannot meet the clinical requirements in terms of
   biocompatibility, mechanics, and minimal risk of rejection. Especially,
   erosion in synthetic polymers and rapid degradation in natural polymers
   limit their further applications in clinics. To address these concerns,
   we report a novel POP replacement using core-sheath polystyrene/gelatin
   electrospun nanofiber mesh. The outside gelatin sheath provides a
   hydrophilic surface and implantable integrity between host and guest,
   while the inner PS core offers the necessary mechanical support. The
   composite mesh shows graft accommodation in pelvic submucosa after
   implantation in vivo, as shown in hematoxylin-eosin staining and T
   helper cell phenotype and macrophage phenotype stainings. Qualitative
   analysis of inducible nitric oxide synthase, arginase, interferon-gamma,
   and interleukin-10 gene expressions also indicates that the implanted
   composite mesh switches to accommodation mode 2 weeks postimplantation.
   Thus, these novel core-sheath polystyrene/gelatin nanofibrous membranes
   are promising in pelvic reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{Subsurface drainage is used for removing excess water in poorly drained
   agricultural lands. The performance of subsurface drainage systems
   varies depending on the soil, crop, and climatic factors. Field
   evaluation of drainage systems under different field conditions can be
   costly and time-consuming, necessitating the use of computer models for
   the design and the evaluation of long-term performance. DRAINMOD is a
   widely used model for simulating shallow groundwater hydrology in poorly
   or artificially drained farmlands. The objective of this study was to
   evaluate DRAINMOD for simulating the hydrology and potato (Solanum
   tuberosum) crop yield under cold climatic conditions. Data were obtained
   from a field study that was conducted during 2010 to 2012 in southern
   Manitoba in a fine sandy loam soil. DRAINMOD calibration and validation
   were done using data from subsurface-drained plots with drain spacing of
   15 m and average drain depth of 1.06 m. Daily subsurface drainage flow,
   weather parameters, irrigation rate, and water table depth were measured
   onsite. Subsurface drainage and water table depth were the main
   variables that were evaluated with DRAINMOD simulations. In general,
   DRAINMOD predictions of subsurface drainage flow and water table depth
   were in good agreement with observed values on a daily basis.
   Statistical parameters showed that DRAINMOD predictions of daily water
   table depth were more accurate than model predictions of daily drainage
   flow. The Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency values were in the range of
   0.69 to 0.76 for drainage flow and 0.57 to 0.94 for water table depth.
   The mean absolute error was between 70 and 134 mm for water table depth
   predictions and between 0.42 and 0.44 mm for drainage flow predictions.
   The root mean square error was 0.77 to 1.14 mm for drainage flow and 83
   to 147 mm for water table depth. DRAINMOD overpredicted potato yield by
   up to 1\%. Based on the results, it is concluded that DRAINMOD
   predictions of the shallow groundwater hydrology under cold climate were
   satisfactory.}},

Title = {{Study of hip fracture risk by DXA-based patient-specific finite element
   model}},
Journal = {{BIO-MEDICAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{213-220}},
Abstract = {{A number of factors may have effects on hip fracture, for example, bone
   mineral density (BMD), body weight and height, femur length, femoral
   neck length, etc. It is not clear which factor(s) has the dominant
   effect on hip fracture. Therefore, the factors were investigated by a
   previously developed DXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) based finite
   element model. The finite element model is patient-specific, as all
   information required in constructing the model was extracted from the
   patient's hip DXA image. DXA images of 180 patients were obtained from
   the Manitoba Bone Mineral Density Database. For each patient, a finite
   element model was constructed and fracture risk indices (FRI) were
   calculated at the three critical locations on the hip, i.e. the femoral
   neck, the intertrochanter and the subtrochanter. Possible correlations
   between the fracture risk indices and the factors were then
   investigated. The obtained results indicated that, for hip fractures
   resulted from lateral fall, areal BMD and patient's body weight are two
   dominant factors, but effects from the other factors are not trivial.
   The study suggested that hip fracture is the result of combined effects
   from all the factors. Therefore, use of areal BMD alone in clinical
   assessment of fracture risk is not reliable.}},

Abstract = {{Drying of densified spent grain in superheated steam (SS) may cause
   breakage and disintegration of the product in the initial stage of SS
   drying. The present work investigated the effect of solubles (0, 10, 30,
   50, and 70\% solubles) on the percentage change in length, diameter,
   volume; hardness; and the asymptotic modulus (EA) of the cylindrical
   compacts during SS drying. An increase in dimensions along with a
   decrease in hardness and EA of the compact was observed immediately
   after exposing it to SS. We observed a 47\% increase in length and 12\%
   increase in diameter for compacts having 0\% solubles during the first
   five seconds of SS drying; however, when the soluble content increased
   to 70\%, the percentage increase in length and diameter became 12 and
   2\%, respectively. Also, with an increase in the amount of solubles in
   the compact, a considerable increase in the hardness and EA of the
   compact was observed. The study also aimed to find suitable explanatory
   variables for predicting the hardness and EA of the compact using a
   stepwise forward regression method.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports experimental data on the vaporization and
   combustion of soybean (derived) biodiesel droplet in turbulent
   environment at elevated ambient pressure and temperature conditions.
   Test conditions consisted of varying turbulence intensity and ambient
   pressure while keeping ambient temperature constant at 473 K. Soybean
   biodiesel droplet was formed using an in-house developed injector, and
   suspended onto the tip of a quartz fiber in the center point of a
   spherical vessel. The initial diameter of the formed droplet ranged
   between 1.00 mm and 1.50 mm. The characterization of the turbulent
   field, generated by four pairs of axial fans, revealed that turbulence
   is essentially isotropic and homogeneous with nearly zero-mean flow
   within the 40-mm-diameter volume in the center of the vessel. The
   experimental results showed that the biodiesel droplet vaporization and
   burning followed the d(2)-law. More importantly, the biodiesel droplet
   vaporization rate was shown to depend on both turbulence and ambient
   pressure. The droplet vaporization results showed that the effect of
   turbulence becomes more effective with increasing ambient pressure. In
   addition, turbulence was found to enhance the biodiesel droplet burning
   rate only at elevated ambient pressure. Heat loss from the flame
   predominates at high levels of turbulence, which consequently causes
   droplet flame extinction.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POROUS MEDIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{A major portion of oil in water-wet fractured reservoirs is produced as
   a result of countercurrent spontaneous imbibition. Recently, there has
   been much research in experimental and mathematical analysis of this
   process. However, the actual physics of this process at the micro-scale
   is not completely understood. The governing equation of countercurrent
   spontaneous imbibition is of the diffusion type and is highly nonlinear;
   therefore, an exact closed-form analytical solution for this equation
   seems impossible. In the present paper, a basic solution is developed
   for this process and tested against numerical simulation results. Also,
   new numerical solution methods are presented to solve the governing
   equation of this process in one dimension using a similarity variable.
   Finally, an approximate iteration-based analytical solution is presented
   that is both stable and accurate.}},

Title = {{A QCT-Based Nonsegmentation Finite Element Head Model for Studying
   Traumatic Brain Injury}},
Journal = {{APPLIED BIONICS AND BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Abstract = {{In the existing finite element head models (FEHMs) that are constructed
   from medical images, head tissues are usually segmented into a number of
   components according to the interior anatomical structure of the head.
   Each component is represented by a homogenous material model. There are
   a number of disadvantages in the segmentation-based finite element head
   models. Therefore, we developed a nonsegmentation finite element head
   model with pointwise-heterogeneous material properties and corroborated
   it by available experiment data. Fromthe obtained results, it was found
   that although intracranial pressures predicted by the existing
   (piecewise-homogeneous) and the proposed (pointwise-heterogeneous) FEHM
   are very similar to each other, strain/stress levels in the head tissues
   are very different. The maximum peak strains/stresses predicted by the
   proposed FEHM are much higher than those by the existing FEHM,
   indicating that piecewise-homogeneous FEHM may have underestimated the
   stress/strain level induced by impact and thus may be inaccurate in
   predicting traumatic brain injuries.}},

Abstract = {{We developed an injectable hydrogel composed of amino-diethoxypropane
   modified alginate and chitosan, and also investigated bone marrow
   mesenchy + mal stromal cells (BMSCs) laden hydrogel for cartilage
   reconstruction in vitro and in vivo. Different from the traditional
   oxidizing method, we first introduced an amino-diethoxypropane to the
   alginate and formed hemiacetal group on it. The hydrogel was formed when
   the modified alginate met with chitosan. We characterized the chemical
   and rheological properties of the hydrogel and investigated the growth
   of BMSC in hydrogel. Then, we used real-time qPCR to in vitro quantify
   the relative mRNA expressions of aggrecan, SOX9 and collagen II at 1, 2,
   3 and 4 weeks, and found that these genes significantly presented higher
   expression in Group IV (BMSCs seeded in hydrogel in chondrogenic culture
   medium) than in BMSCs seeded in hydrogel in routine medium group (Group
   II) or BMSCs in chondrogenic culture medium group (Group III). For
   further testing, we implanted BMSCs laden hydrogel to a rabbit knee
   cartilage defect model. After 12 weeks, the BMSCs laden hydrogel group
   presented a better repair than other groups in gross appearance using
   ICRS histological grading system. The level of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)
   was measured, and the result showed 4.9-fold higher level of
   glycosaminoglycans in BMSCs laden hydrogel treated group than in the
   defect group. The result of real-time qPCR showed that the gene
   expression of aggrecan (5.8-fold), type II collagen (9-fold),
   proteoglycans (5.3-fold), and SOX9 (17.9-fold) were significantly higher
   in the BMSCs loaded hydrogel treated group than in defect group, but the
   type I collagen gene expression was lower (4.9-fold) in BMSCs loaded
   hydrogel treated group than in defect group. In the histology analysis
   of HE, Alcian blue, Toluidine blue, and Masson's trichrome staining, the
   results showed that the BMSCs laden hydrogel treated group formed more
   chondrocytes, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) than in the
   hydrogel treated group or defect group. Overall, our study showed that
   the developed injectable hydrogel can be loaded with BMSCs, and it can
   promote cartilage regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Transcription factors are known to play multiple roles in cellular
   function. Investigators report that factors such as early growth
   response (Egr) protein and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) are
   activated in the brain during cancer, brain injury, inflammation, and/or
   memory. To explore NF-kappa B activity further, we investigated the
   transcriptomes of hippocampal slices following electrical stimulation of
   NF-kappa B p50 subunit knockout mice (p50(-/-)) versus their controls
   (p50(+/+)). We found that the early growth response gene Egr-2 was
   upregulated by NF-kappa B activation, but only in p50(+/+) hippocampal
   slices. We then stimulated HeLa cells and primary cortical neurons with
   tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) to activate NF-kappa B and
   increase the expression of Egr-2. The Egr-2 promoter sequence was
   analyzed for NF-kappa B binding sites and chromatin immunoprecipitation
   (ChIP) assays were performed to confirm promoter occupancy in vivo. We
   discovered that NF-kappa B specifically binds to an NF-kappa B consensus
   binding site within the proximal promoter region of Egr-2. Luciferase
   assay demonstrated that p50 was able to transactivate the Egr-2 promoter
   in vitro. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated p50 knockdown
   corroborated other Egr-2 expression studies. We show for the first time
   a novel link between NF-kappa B activation and Egr-2 expression with
   Egr-2 expression directly controlled by the transcriptional activity of
   NF-kappa B. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the problem of designing efficient and low-complexity
   centralized algorithms for joint power and admission control in a
   cellular cognitive radio network (CRN) which coexists with a primary
   radio network (PRN) in a spectrum underlay fashion. We first derive a
   simple one-to-one relation between the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
   ratio (SINR) vector and its corresponding power vector of all users of
   the CRN and PRN, and based on this we propose two new admission metrics.
   Then, in an infeasible system, where the minimum acceptable target-SINRs
   for all primary and secondary users are not simultaneously reachable,
   two centralized algorithms are proposed. These algorithms aim at
   removing the minimal number of secondary users (based on the proposed
   admission metrics), subject to the constraint that all primary users are
   supported with their target-SINRs. In an infeasible system, our proposed
   algorithms outperform other existing algorithms in terms of complexity
   and secondary users' outage ratio. Furthermore, for a feasible system,
   where all secondary users can be admitted along with all primary users,
   by using our derived one-to-one relation between SINR and power vector,
   we solve the problems of maximizing aggregate throughput and max-min
   quality-of-service (QoS) for secondary users, both subject to the
   constraint that all primary and secondary users are supported with their
   minimum target-SINRs.}},

Abstract = {{Lubricant protein concentration is known to affect crosslinked
   polyethylene wear in in vitro testing; however, the biochemical nature
   of these lubricants may also have a significant effect on wear and
   dictate its clinical relevance. A modified approach to pin-on-disc
   testing was implemented to explore the effect of four biochemically
   different lubricants on the wear of two types of crosslinked
   polyethylene materials (XLK and Marathon; DePuy Synthes, Warsaw, IN,
   USA). XLK was associated with higher wear rates than Marathon. In
   comparison to lubricants containing deionized water, lubricants
   containing phosphate buffered saline solution and hyaluronic acid
   increased osmolality by up to 1.2 times and thermal stability by up to
   1.4 times. This biochemical change reduced wear by up to 12.5 times.
   Wear rates for XLK and Marathon differed by a factor of 3.2 using
   lubricants with phosphate buffered saline solution as the dilutive
   media, but only 2.0 for lubricants with deionized water. Interestingly,
   varying the concentration of hyaluronic acid did not have a significant
   effect on wear, and differences between XLK and Marathon wear rates were
   not found to be statistically significant when hyaluronic acid was added
   to the lubricant. The findings of this study showed that increasing the
   osmolality and thermal stability of lubricants to more clinical levels
   decreased wear; however, the effect of hyaluronic acid on wear may not
   be apparent in simplistic pin-on-disc testing. It was suggested that
   phosphate buffered saline solution be used as the dilutive media of
   choice in order to better differentiate the ranking of materials while
   maintaining some clinical relevance.}},

Title = {{Layer-by-layer paper-stacking nanofibrous membranes to deliver
   adipose-derived stem cells for bone regeneration}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Abstract = {{Bone tissue engineering through seeding of stem cells in
   three-dimensional scaffolds has greatly improved bone regeneration
   technology, which historically has been a constant challenge. In this
   study, we researched the use of adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC)-laden
   layer-by-layer paper-stacking polycaprolactone/gelatin electrospinning
   nanofibrous membranes for bone regeneration. Using this novel
   paper-stacking method makes oxygen distribution, nutrition, and waste
   transportation work more efficiently. ADSCs can also secrete multiple
   growth factors required for osteogenesis. After the characterization of
   ADSC surface markers CD29, CD90, and CD49d using flow cytometry, we
   seeded ADSCs on the membranes and found cells differentiated, with
   significant expression of the osteogenic-related proteins osteopontin,
   osteocalcin, and osteoprotegerin. During 4 weeks in vitro, the ADSCs
   cultured on the paper-stacking membranes in the osteogenic medium
   exhibited the highest osteogenic-related gene expressions. In vivo, the
   paper-stacking scaffolds were implanted into the rat calvarial defects
   (5 mm diameter, one defect per parietal bone) for 12 weeks.
   Investigating with microcomputer tomography, the ADSC-laden
   paper-stacking membranes showed the most significant bone
   reconstruction, and from a morphological perspective, this group
   occupied 90\% of the surface area of the defect, produced the highest
   bone regeneration volume, and showed the highest bone mineral density of
   823.06 mg/cm(3). From hematoxylin and eosin and Masson staining, the new
   bone tissue was most evident in the ADSC-laden scaffold group. Using
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis from collected tissues,
   we found that the ADSC-laden paper-stacking membrane group presented the
   highest osteogenic-related gene expressions of osteocalcin, osteopontin,
   osteoprotegerin, bone sialoprotein, runt-related transcription factor 2,
   and osterix (two to three times higher than the control group, and 1.5
   times higher than the paper-stacking membrane group in all the genes).
   It is proposed that ADSC-laden layer-by-layer paper-stacking scaffolds
   could be used as a way of promoting bone defect treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular communication holds the promise to enable communication
   between nanomachines with a view to increasing their functionalities and
   opening up new possible applications. Due to some of the biological
   properties, bacteria have been proposed as a possible information
   carrier for molecular communication, and the corresponding communication
   networks are known as bacterial nanonetworks. The biological properties
   include the ability for bacteria to mobilize between locations and carry
   the information encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid molecules. However,
   similar to most organisms, bacteria have complex social properties that
   govern their colony. These social characteristics enable the bacteria to
   evolve through various fluctuating environmental conditions by utilizing
   cooperative and non-cooperative behaviors. This article provides an
   overview of the different types of cooperative and non-cooperative
   social behavior of bacteria. The challenges (due to non-cooperation) and
   the opportunities (due to cooperation) these behaviors can bring to the
   reliability of communication in bacterial nanonetworks are also
   discussed. Finally, simulation results on the impact of bacterial
   cooperative social behavior on the end-to-end reliability of a
   single-link bacterial nanonetwork are presented. The article concludes
   by highlighting the potential future research opportunities in this
   emerging field.}},

Abstract = {{Entropy measures have been widely used to quantify the complexity of
   theoretical and experimental dynamical systems. In this paper, two novel
   entropy measures are developed based on using coarse quantization to
   classify and compare dynamical features within a time series: quantized
   dynamical entropy and a quantization-based approximation of sample
   entropy. The properties of the developed entropy measures are examined
   alongside sample entropy and permutation entropy by studying the
   logistic map, bifurcations in a nonsmooth predator-prey model and the
   real-world case study of characterizing changes in gait dynamics caused
   by age and cognitive interference. Based on these investigations, it is
   shown that the developed measures have the best overall performance in
   instances where computational efficiency is vital.}},

Abstract = {{Stem cells hold great promise for treating various degenerative diseases
   and conditions. However, the outcomes of preclinical and clinical cell
   therapy studies are still not close to our expectation. We believe that
   the unsatisfactory outcomes of cell therapy are at least partially due
   to insufficient homing of implanted stem cells into target organs and
   the use of heterogeneous cell populations for cell therapy. Therefore,
   there is a need to develop an effective guiding technique for stem cells
   to migrate to the target organs and to isolate effective stem cell
   populations. Toward this direction, we have previously demonstrated
   chemotaxis of rat adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) to a well-defined
   gradient of epidermal growth factor (EGF) using a microfluidic device.
   In the current study, we further developed a microfluidics-based method
   for selecting chemotactic ASCs to EGF. This method integrates cell
   patterning, chemotaxis and cell extraction on a single microfluidic
   gradient-generating device. Post-extraction analysis confirmed the
   higher chemotactic migration of the extracted cells to EGF.
   Consistently, the extracted chemotactic ASCs shows up-regulated surface
   expression of the EGF receptor and its downstream signaling event upon
   EGF stimulation. The results suggest that our method provides a new
   effective approach for the selection of specific stem cell populations.
   It is also expected that the use of the selectively extracted stem cells
   could enhance stem cell homing to target organs and consequently improve
   the outcome of cell therapy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effects of downstream wall roughness on
   characteristics of separated and reattached turbulent flow downstream of
   a backward facing step. Detailed particle image velocimetry (PIV)
   measurements were conducted over rough walls produced from sandpaper 36
   and 24 grits and a reference smooth acrylic wall positioned downstream
   of a backward facing step, one after another. All the experiments were
   performed at the same Reynolds number of 7050 based on the step height,
   h and approach mean velocity, ratio of initial boundary layer thickness
   to step height of 2.2 and expansion ratio of 1.25. The results showed
   that wall roughness increased the mean reattachment length over the
   sandpaper 36 and 24 grits by 5 \% and 7 \%, respectively, in comparison
   with the smooth wall value. However, the other mean flow properties
   within the recirculation region are nearly independent of wall
   roughness. Beyond 5 step heights from the reattachment point, wall
   roughness reduced the streamwise mean velocity in the region adjacent to
   the rough walls. Wall roughness significantly increased the levels of
   the Reynolds stresses in the recirculation and redevelopment regions. In
   spite of the higher Reynolds stresses observed over the rough walls
   compared with the smooth wall, the spatial coherence of turbulence
   structures embodied in the streamwise and wall-normal auto-correlation
   function is significantly reduced over the rough walls.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to compare the predictions of the

   years. Wheat samples of Canada Western Red Spring (CWRS), Canada Western
   Hard White Spring (CWHWS), Canada Western Soft White Spring (CWSWS), and
   Canada Prairie Spring Red (CPSR) classes were obtained from nearby
   agricultural farms in the main wheat growing locations in the Provinces
   of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba from 2007, 2008, and 2009 crop
   years. Wheat samples were conditioned to moisture levels of 13, 16, and
   19 \% (wet basis) and pooled together for developing the regression
   models. A database of the near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral image cubes
   of bulk samples of wheat classes was created in the wavelength region of
   960-1,700 nm with 10 nm intervals. Reference protein contents and
   hardness values were determined using the Dumatherm method and single
   kernel characterization system (SKCS), respectively. A tenfold
   cross-validation was used for the ten-factor partial least squares
   regression (PLSR) and principal components regression (PCR) models for
   prediction purposes. Prediction performances of regression models were
   assessed by calculating the estimated mean square errors of prediction
   (MSEP), standard error of cross-validation (SECV), and correlation
   coefficient (r). Using the full data set in the protein prediction
   study, the ten-component PLSR model gave 1.76, 1.33, and 0.68 for the
   estimated MSEP, SECV, and r, respectively, which were better than the
   results for the ten-component PCR model (2.02, 1.42, and 0.62,
   respectively). For the hardness prediction, the estimated MSEP, SECV,
   and r values were 147.7, 12.15, and 0.82, respectively, for the
   ten-component PLSR model using the full data set. The PLSR models
   prediction performances outperformed the PCR models for predicting

Abstract = {{Four different AISI 304L austenitic stainless steels with chromium
   equivalent-to-nickel equivalent (Cr-eq/Ni-eq) ratios of 1.57, 1.59,

   temperature, strain, and strain rate ranges of 1200 to 1300 A degrees C,
   10 to 70\%, and 0.1 to 10 s(-1), respectively. Increasing the
   temperature, strain, and strain rate led to increased formation of delta
   ferrite. The results show that the formation of delta ferrite during hot
   deformation is also strongly dependent on chemical composition. The
   higher the Cr-eq/Ni-eq ratio, the higher the tendency for the formation
   of delta ferrite. The observed behavior may be attributed to plastic
   deformation-induced formation of crystallographic defects such as

Abstract = {{Label free quantitation by measurement of peptide fragment signal
   intensity (MS2 quantitation) is a technique that has seen limited use
   due to the stochastic nature of data dependent acquisition (DDA).
   However, data independent acquisition has the potential to make large
   scale MS2 quantitation a more viable technique. In this study we used an
   implementation of data independent acquisition-SWATH-to perform label
   free protein quantitation in a model bacterium Clostridium stercorarium.
   Four tryptic digests analyzed by SWATH were probed by an ion library
   containing information on peptide mass and retention time obtained from
   DDA experiments. Application of this ion library to SWATH data
   quantified 1030 proteins with at least two peptides quantified (similar
   to 40\% of predicted proteins in the C. stercorarium genome) in each
   replicate. Quantitative results obtained were very consistent between
   biological replicates (R-2 similar to 0.960). Protein quantitation by
   summation of peptide fragment signal intensities was also highly
   consistent between biological replicates (R-2 similar to 0.930),
   indicating that this approach may have increased viability compared to
   recent applications in label free protein quantitation. SWATH based
   quantitation was able to consistently detect differences in relative
   protein quantity and it provided coverage for a number of proteins that
   were missed in some samples by DDA analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Balance and cognitive impairments which are common with aging often
   coexist, are prognostic of future adverse health events, including fall
   injuries. Consequently, dual-task assessment programs that
   simultaneously address both stability and cognition are important to
   consider in rehabilitation and benefit healthy aging. The objective of
   this study was to establish test-retest reliability and construct
   validity of a dual-task computer game-based platform (TGP) that
   integrates head tracking and cognitive tasks with balance activities.
   Thirty healthy, community-dwelling individuals median age 64 (range
   6067) were recruited from a certified Medical Fitness Facility.
   Participants performed a series of computerized head tracking and
   cognitive game tasks while standing on fixed and sponge surfaces.
   Testing was conducted on two occasions, one week apart. Moderate to high
   test retest reliability (ICC values of 0.55-0.75) was observed for all
   outcome measures representing balance, gaze performance, cognition, and
   dual-task performance. A significant increase in center of foot pressure
   (COP) excursion was observed during both head tracking and cognitive
   dual-task conditions. The results demonstrate the system's ability to
   reliably detect changes related to specific and integrated aspects of
   balance, gaze, and cognitive performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   relies on a non-deterministic source to produce random numbers. In this
   paper, we develop a TRNG using a heuristic evolutionary algorithm
   together with signal processing techniques. Our proposed algorithm
   consists of three phases:(i) Extraction: where a noise source(such as
   race conditions during concurrent memory accesses on a GPU) is sampled
   into random numbers; (ii) Exact Histogram Equalization: takes the output
   from (i) and delivers a specified output distribution; (iii)
   Stationarity Enforcement: using a genetic algorithm, the output of (ii)
   is permuted until the random numbers meet wide sense stationarity within
   a specified quality defined by Gaussian distribution with the expected
   standard deviation on the power spectral density of random numbers. We
   propose guideline parameters for the evolutionary algorithm to ensure
   fast convergence, within the first 100 generations, with a standard
   deviation over the specified quality level of less than 0.02.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop an effective approach
   to decide design details using benchmarking to capture the existing
   practice in sustainable design.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper reports a systematic method for
   sustainable product design. The method uses benchmarks as references
   searching for design details to achieve sustainable solutions. Quality
   function deployment is used to guide the search process for competitive
   products using benchmarking to meet quantitative targets of product and
   to increase knowledge for sustainable design.
   Findings - The proposed method can meet both functional and sustainable
   requirements of product design. 18.55 percent reduction in carbon
   equivalent emissions is achieved compared to benchmarks in wheelchair
   design. The research reveals that when weight, material and number of
   components used in product decrease, environmental footprints and cost
   of the product improve.
   Originality/value - The research improves the existing method of
   sustainable product design. Both sustainable requirements and functional
   demands of product are identified from qualitative criteria to
   quantitative metrics using benchmarking and the life cycle assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Drivers' inadequate mental workload has been reported as one of the
   negative effects of driving assistant systems and in-vehicle automation.
   The increasing trend of automation in agricultural vehicles raises some
   concerns about drivers' mental workload in such vehicles. Thus, a human
   factors perspective is needed to identify the consequences of such
   automated systems. In this simulator study, the effects of vehicle
   steering task automation (VSTA) and implement control and monitoring
   task automation (ICMTA) were investigated using a tractor-air seeder
   system as a case study. Two performance parameters (reaction time and
   accuracy of actions) were measured to assess drivers' perceived mental
   workload. Experiments were conducted using the tractor driving simulator
   (TDS) located in the Agricultural Ergonomics Laboratory at the
   University of Manitoba. Study participants were university students with
   tractor driving experience. According to the results, reaction time and
   number of errors made by drivers both decreased as the automation level
   increased. Correlations were found among performance parameters and
   subjective mental workload reported by the drivers.}},

Title = {{Short and Long-term Effects of rTMS Treatment on Alzheimer's Disease at
   Different Stages: A Pilot Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{43-51}},
Abstract = {{Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) uses a magnetic coil
   to induce an electric field in brain tissue. As a pilot study, we
   investigated the effect of rTMS treatment on 10 volunteers with
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a two-stage study. The first stage consisted
   of a double-blind crossover study with real and sham treatments. Each
   treatment block consisted of 13 sessions over 4 weeks. During each
   session, 2000 TMS pulses at 90\%-100\% of resting motor threshold were
   applied to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally, and the patients
   were kept cognitively active by object/action naming during the
   treatment. The second stage was an open-label study, in which the same
   treatments were performed in 2-week blocks (10 sessions) approximately
   every 3 months as follow-up treatments on six of the volunteers, who
   completed the first stage of the study. Primary outcome measures were
   the Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MOCA) and the Alzheimer's Disease
   Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale. The secondary outcome measures were
   the Revised Memory and Behavior Checklist as well as our team's
   custom-designed cognitive assessments. The results showed a noticeably
   stronger improvement on all assessments during the real treatment as
   compared to the sham treatment. The changes in MOCA scores as well as
   our designed cognitive assessment were found to be statistically
   significant, with particularly strong results in the six volunteers who
   were in the early stages of the disease. The long-term trends observed
   in the second stage of the study also showed generally less decline than
   would be expected for their condition. It appears that rTMS can be an
   effective tool for improving the cognitive abilities of patients with
   early to moderate stages of AD. However, the positive effects of rTMS
   may persist for only up to a few weeks. Specific skills being practiced
   during rTMS treatment may retain their improvement for longer periods.}},

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{652-662}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Thaumasite sulfate attack (TSA) is a special form of sulfate attack
   typically occurring due to the availability of carbonates/bicarbonates
   in the cementitious matrix with abundance of moisture and a prevailing
   low temperature. It transforms concrete into a non-cohesive mass without
   any binding or load carrying capacity. Field and laboratory data show
   that the extent of TSA depends on multiple critical factors including
   exposure conditions (e.g. type and concentration of sulfate, change of
   temperature and relative humidity, location of structure/element
   relative to grade level) and constituents of concrete (e.g. type of
   cement, inclusion of limestone materials, type and dosage of
   supplementary cementitious materials). The current paper compiles and
   analyzes current knowledge/research on the topic from various field and
   laboratory studies. TSA on concrete is discussed in terms of the
   mechanisms of damage, test methods, most influential factors and code
   provisions in North America and Europe. In addition, a mitigation
   strategy for TSA is proposed based on the balance of physical and
   chemical resistances of concrete as controlled by key mixture design
   parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   co-fermentation of glucose, starch, and cellulose using anaerobic
   digester sludge (ADS) on the biohydrogen (H-2) production and the
   associated microbial communities. Yields of H-2 were 1.22, 1.00, and
   0.15 mol H-2/mol hexose-added in fermentation reactions containing
   glucose, starch, and cellulose as mono-substrates. The H-2 yields were
   greater by an average of 27 +/- 4\% than expected in all the different
   co-substrate conditions, which affirmed that co-fermentation of
   different substrates improved the H-2 potential. Glucose addition to
   starch and/or cellulose favored acetate synthesis, while cellulose
   degradation was associated with the propionate synthesis pathway.

Abstract = {{The junction between n-type silicon microwires and p-type conducting
   polymer PEDOT:PSS
   (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate)) was
   investigated using a soft contact method. Dopant levels within the
   microwires were varied during growth to give a highly-doped region for
   improved contact and a low-doped region for light absorption. The
   low-doped region of the microwires had a dopant density of 5 X 10(17)
   cm(-3) while the highly-doped region had an increased dopant density of
   5 X 10(18) cm(-3) over similar to 20 mu m. Uniform, highly-doped
   microwires, with a dopant density of 4 X 10(19) cm(3), were used as a
   comparison. Regions of highly-doped n-type Si microwires (N-D = 5 X
   10(18) cm(-3) and 4 X 10(19) cm(-3)) contacted by PEDOT:PSS showed a
   significantly lower junction resistance compared to the low-doped (3 X
   10(17) cm(-3)) regions of the microwire. Junctions incorporating the
   metal catalyst used during growth were also investigated. Microwires
   with copper at the interface had similar currentvoltage characteristics
   to those observed for the highly-doped microwire/conducting polymer
   junction; however, junctions that incorporated gold exhibited
   significantly lower resistances, decreasing the iR contribution of the
   junction by an order of magnitude with respect to the total voltage drop
   in the entire structure}},

Abstract = {{Fall is a common and a major cause of injuries. It is important to find
   elderlies who are prone to falls. The majority of serious falls occur
   during walking among the older adults. Analyzing the spatio-temporal
   parameters of walking is an easy way of assessment in the clinical
   setting, but is it capable of distinguishing a faller from a non-faller
   elderly? Through a systematic review of the literature, the objective of
   this systematic review was to identify and summarize the differences in
   the, spatio-temporal parameters of walking in elderly,falters and
   non-fallers and to find out if these parameters are capable of
   distinguishing a faller from non-faller. All original research articles
   which compared any special or temporal walking parameters in faller and
   non-faller elderlies were systematically searched within the Scopus and
   Embase databases., Effect size analysis was also done to standardize
   findings and compare the gait parameters of fallers and,non-fillerS
   across the selected studies. The electronic search led to 5381 articles.
   After title and abstract screening 30 articles were chosen; further
   assessment of the full texts led to 17 eligible articles for inclusion
   in the review It seems that temporal measurements are more sensitive to
   the detection of risk of fall in elderly people; The results of the 17
   selected studies, showed that failers have a tendency toward a Slower
   walking speed and cadence, longer stride time, and double support
   duration. Also, fallers showed shorter stride and step length, wider
   step width and more variability in spatio-temporal parameters of gait.
   According to the effect size analysis, step length, gait speed, stride
   length and stance time variability were respectively more capable of
   differentiating faller from non-faller elderlies. However, because of
   the difference of methodology and number of studies which investigated
   each parameter, these results are prone to imprecision. Spatio-temporal
   analysis of level walking is not sufficient and cannot act as a reliable
   predictor of stalls in elderly individuals.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies joining behavior of customers into an M/M/1
   egalitarian processor-sharing (PS) queue, By constructing a
   left-multiplication transformation and using its matrix representation,
   we obtain the expected conditional sojourn time of a tagged customer.
   Then, in the fully observable case, we first consider the joining
   strategy in a decentralized manner, that is, arriving customers observe
   the queue size and then decide whether or not to join the queue based on
   the net benefit they will obtain upon the completion of service.
   Secondly, we derive the threshold strategy that will yield the system's
   maximal expected profit, to reach the so-called social welfare
   optimization. Finally, Nash equilibrium and socially optimal mixed
   strategies are derived in the fully unobservable case. Moreover, some
   numerical examples are provided to explore the impact of system
   parameters on customer's joining behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The microstructure of Allvac 718 Plus (718 Plus; ATI, Pittsburgh, PA,
   USA) superalloy was examined after linear friction welding (LFW) and
   after standard postweld heat treatment (PWHT). The liquid phase reaction
   of second-phase precipitates, which are known to constitutionally
   liquate during conventional fusion welding, was observed in the
   thermomechanically affected zone (TMAZ) of the welded material. These
   phases included MC-type carbides, Ti-rich carbonitrides, and delta phase
   precipitates. This observation is contrary to the general assumption
   that LFW is a completely solid-state joining process. However, unlike
   conventional fusion welding processes that cause heat-affected zone
   liquation cracking in 718 Plus and many other superalloys, the LFW
   process did not cause cracking in 718 Plus superalloy despite the
   liquation of precipitates. This absence of cracking during joining is
   attributed to the applied compressive stress during the forging stage of
   the LFW process. Also, no cracking was observed after PWHT, although
   PWHT resulted in a microstructure that had a nonhomogeneous distribution
   of precipitates in the weld and the TMAZ.}},

Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Entropy measures have been widely used to quantify the complexity of
   theoretical and experimental dynamical systems. In this paper, the value
   of using entropy measures to characterize human locomotion is
   demonstrated based on their construct validity, predictive validity in a
   simple model of human walking and convergent validity in an experimental
   study. Results show that four of the five considered entropy measures
   increase meaningfully with the increased probability of falling in a
   simple passive bipedal walker model. The same four entropy measures also
   experienced statistically significant increases in response to
   increasing age and gait impairment caused by cognitive interference in
   an experimental study. Of the considered entropy measures, the proposed
   quantized dynamical entropy (QDE) and quantization-based approximation
   of sample entropy (QASE) offered the best combination of sensitivity to
   changes in gait dynamics and computational efficiency. Based on these
   results, entropy appears to be a viable candidate for assessing the
   stability of human locomotion.}},

   GFRP-RC Bridge Deck Slabs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES FOR CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Because concrete bridge deck slabs are much longer in the traffic
   direction, they experience transverse early-age cracks due to volumetric
   instability and restraint. In the last decade, the use of the
   noncorrodible fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars in concrete bridges
   has significantly increased. This paper presents the experimental
   results of four full-scale, cast-in-place glass FRP-reinforced concrete
   (GFRP-RC) deck slabs, subjected to early-age shrinkage. The slabs
   measured 2,500mmlongx765mmwidex180mmthick. The longitudinal
   reinforcement ratio (0.30, 0.50, 0.70, and 1.1\%) was the main parameter
   investigated in this study. The test results were presented in terms of
   cracking pattern, width and spacing, strains in both GFRP bars, and
   concrete over a period of 90days after casting. The experimental results
   were compared with provisions and predictions from a published
   analytical model. It was concluded that the published numbers can
   reliably provide a minimum reinforcement ratio for bridge deck slabs
   reinforced with GFRP bars. Also, the measured width of shrinkage cracks
   agreed with the results of the analytical model.}},

   with any specific directions, and such evolutions are driven by the
   dynamics in all directions in the state space. It is desirable to
   explore the asymptotic behaviors of the dynamic systems along certain
   specific directions and the specific dynamics driving such behaviors. In
   this paper, the Lyapunov exponents are modified. The modified Lyapunov
   exponents can indicate the exponential divergent or convergent rates in
   certain directions, which are driven by the dynamics in the same
   directions. The existence and the invariance to the initial conditions
   of the proposed modified exponents are proven mathematically. The
   algorithm for calculating the modified Lyapunov exponents from
   mathematical models is also developed. A wide range of case studies,
   from classical nonlinear dynamic systems to engineering systems, are
   presented to demonstrate the proposed modified Lyapunov exponents, and
   the indications of the modified exponents are also discussed. The
   proposed modified Lyapunov exponents can reveal additional insights into
   the system dynamics to the conventional Lyapunov exponents. Such
   information can be instrumental for stability control design.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a dynamic multiobjective particle swarm optimization
   (DMOPSO) method is presented for the optimal design of hybrid renewable
   energy systems (HRESs). The main goal of the design is to minimize
   simultaneously the total net present cost (NPC) of the system, unmet
   load, and fuel emission. A DMOPSO-simulation based approach has been
   used to approximate a worthy Pareto front (PF) to help decision makers
   in selecting an optimal configuration for an HRES. The proposed method
   is examined for a case study including wind turbines, photovoltaic (PV)
   panels, diesel generators, batteries, fuel cells, electrolyzer, and
   hydrogen tanks. Well-known metrics are used to evaluate the generated
   PF. The average spacing and diversification metrics obtained by the
   proposed approach are 1386 and 4656, respectively. Additionally, the set
   coverage metric value shows that at least 67\% of Pareto solutions
   obtained by DMOPSO dominate the solutions resulted by other reported
   algorithms. By using a sensitivity analysis for the case study, it is
   found that if the PV panel and wind turbine capital cost are decreased
   by 50\%, the total NPC of the system would be decreased by 18.8 and
   3.7\%, respectively. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a tractable mathematical framework to analyze the
   spectral and energy efficiency of an operator initiated deployment of
   the small-cells (e.g., femtocells) where the small-cell base stations
   are deliberately positioned around the edge of the macrocell. The
   considered deployment facilitates the cell-edge mobile users in terms of
   their coverage, spectral, and energy efficiency and is referred to as
   cell-on-edge (COE) configuration. The reduction in energy consumption is
   achieved by considering fast power control where the mobile users
   transmit with adaptive power to compensate the path loss, shadowing and
   fading. In particular, we develop a moment generating function (MGF)
   based approach to derive analytical bounds on the area spectral
   efficiency and exact expressions for the energy efficiency of the mobile
   users in the considered COE configuration over generalized-K fading
   channels. Besides the COE configuration, the derived bounds are also
   shown to be useful in evaluating the performance of random small-cell
   deployments, e.g., uniformly distributed small-cells. Simulation results
   are presented to demonstrate the improvements in spectral and energy
   efficiency of the COE configuration with respect to macro-only networks
   and other unplanned deployment strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We modified a passive capillary sampler (PCS) to collect snowmelt water
   for isotopic analysis. Past applications of PCSs have been to sample
   soil water, but the novel aspect of this study was the placement of the
   PCSs at the ground-snowpack interface to collect snowmelt. We deployed
   arrays of PCSs at 11 sites in ten partner countries on five continents
   representing a range of climate and snow cover worldwide. The PCS
   reliably collected snowmelt at all sites and caused negligible
   evaporative fractionation effects in the samples. PCS is low-cost, easy
   to install, and collects a representative integrated snowmelt sample
   throughout the melt season or at the melt event scale. Unlike snow
   cores, the PCS collects the water that would actually infiltrate the
   soil; thus, its isotopic composition is appropriate to use for tracing
   snowmelt water through the hydrologic cycle. The purpose of this
   Briefing is to show the potential advantages of PCSs and recommend
   guidelines for constructing and installing them based on our preliminary
   results from two snowmelt seasons. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \&

Journal = {{SURFACE \& COATINGS TECHNOLOGY}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{A novel numerical modeling simulation, involving an integration of
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD), a physical energy function and the
   finite element method (FEM) to investigate the thermal history
   experienced by the powder, deposited coating and substrate during the
   laser cladding of a nickel-based superalloy is performed. The laser
   cladding process is simulated in three sub-steps through different
   models. First, a CFD model is developed to track the trajectory of the
   powder during the feeding procedure before the powder particles merge
   into a molten pool of the substrate. Then, a physical energy function is
   used to compute the absorbed energy of the powder under laser
   irradiation. Finally, an FEM model is employed to investigate the
   addition of material and thermal history in the cladding structure. The
   simulation results are used to predict the solidification microstructure
   of the deposited coating and the dependence of the microstructure on the
   processing parameters, such as powder size, laser power and cladding
   speed. It is found that powder that is small in size is favorable for
   obtaining fine solidification microstructure in the laser deposited
   coating. However, the degree of influence of the powder particle size on
   cooling rate and resultant secondary dendrite arm spacing is weakened by
   a combined increase of the laser power and cladding speed at a fixed
   ratio of the laser power to cladding speed. This work contributes to the
   comprehensive understanding of laser cladding, as well as provides a
   fundamental basis for controlling the microstructure in laser deposited
   nickel-based superalloy coatings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Production of biodiesel from edible plant oils is quickly expanding
   worldwide to fill a need for renewable, environmentally-friendly liquid
   transportation fuels. Due to concerns over use of edible commodities for
   fuels, production of biodiesel from non-edible oils including microbial
   oils is being developed. Microalgae biodiesel is approaching commercial
   viability, but has some inherent limitations such as requirements for
   sunlight. While yeast oils have been studied for decades, recent years
   have seen significant developments including discovery of new oleaginous
   yeast species and strains, greater understanding of the metabolic
   pathways that determine oleaginicity, optimization of cultivation
   processes for conversion of various types of waste plant biomass to oil
   using oleaginous yeasts, and development of strains with enhanced oil
   production. This review examines aspects of oleaginous yeasts not
   covered in depth in other recent reviews. Topics include the history of
   oleaginous yeast research, especially advances in the early 20th
   century; the phylogenetic diversity of oleaginous species, beyond the
   few species commonly studied; and physiological characteristics that
   should be considered when choosing yeast species and strains to be
   utilized for conversion of a given type of plant biomass to
   oleochemicals. Standardized terms are proposed for units that describe
   yeast cell mass and lipid production. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study presents new experimental results on the vaporization process
   of hydrocarbon droplet in a turbulent environment at elevated ambient
   pressure and temperature conditions. n-Heptane and n-decane, which
   provide a wide range of hydrocarbons properties, were tested. The
   initial droplet diameter was on the order of 1 mm, and its surrounding
   ambient consisted of varying turbulence intensity up to 3.10 m/s,
   pressure up to 16 bar, and temperature up to 150 degrees C. The results
   revealed that the hydrocarbon droplet followed the d(2)-law throughout
   its entire lifetime under all ambient conditions explored here.
   Increasing the ambient pressure increases the droplet vaporization
   lifetime, whereas increasing the ambient temperature reduces the droplet
   lifetime. More importantly, turbulence becomes more effective as ambient
   pressure increases, whereas it diminishes with increasing the ambient
   temperature. The experimental data were used to develop a more
   comprehensive hydrocarbons droplet mass transfer correlation.}},

Abstract = {{This experimental study reports on the effect of swirl strength on the
   stability of non-premixed biogas flame. The swirl strength was varied by
   changing the vanes angle (25 degrees and 50 degrees) of the swirl
   generator. Zero-angle vanes swirl was also used as a reference. The
   results revealed that the swirl enhances significantly the biogas flame
   stability operating range. In addition, it was found that the biogas
   flame behaves differently depending on the swirl strength. The effect of
   low (25 degrees-angle vanes) swirl on the flame stability was found to
   depend upon the co-airflow exit velocity. At low co-airflow velocity,
   the flame was attached and its blow-off limits are comparable to those
   of the zero (0 degrees-angle vanes) swirl. However, as the co-airflow
   velocity increases, the low swirl attached flame lifts-off the burner
   and stabilizes over a wide range of co-airflow and fuel jet velocity. In
   contrast to low-swirl, high (50 degrees-angle vanes) swirl generates
   only an attached biogas flame regardless of the co-airflow velocity.
   Moreover, the high swirl attached flame was found to stabilize over a
   wider range of flow conditions compared to that of low swirl. Particle
   image velocimetry (PIV) data were used to explain the stability limits
   and empirical correlations were proposed to describe these limits.}},

Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{One of the main uses of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) within mammalian
   cells is powering the Na+/ K+ ATPase pumps used to maintain ion
   concentrations within the cell. Since ion concentrations determine the
   cytoplasm conductivity, ATP concentration is expected to play a key role
   in controlling the cytoplasm conductivity. The two major ATP production
   pathways within cells are via glycolysis within the cytoplasm and via
   the electron transport chain within the mitochondria. In this work, a
   differential detector combined with dielectrophoretic (DEP) translation
   in a microfluidic channel was employed to observe single cell changes in
   the cytoplasm conductivity. The DEP response was made sensitive to
   changes in cytoplasm conductivity by measuring DEP response versus media
   conductivity and using double shell models to choose appropriate
   frequencies and media conductivity. Dielectric response of Chinese
   hamster ovary (CHO) cells was monitored following inhibition of the
   mitochondria ATP production by treatment with oligomycin. We show that
   in CHO cells following exposure to oligomycin (8 mu g/ml) the cytoplasm
   conductivity drops, with the majority of the change occurring within 50
   min. This work demonstrates that dielectric effects due to changes in
   ATP production can be observed at the single cell level. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{In this research, direct numerical simulation has been performed to
   study the turbulent wake behind a wall-mounted square cylinder with
   aspect ratio 4 and Reynolds number 12 000 (based on the free-stream
   velocity and obstacle side length) in a developing boundary layer. Owing
   to the relatively high Reynolds number and high aspect ratio of the
   cylinder tested, the wake is wide spread behind the cylinder and
   exhibits complex and energetic vortex motions. The lateral and tip
   vortex shedding patterns at different frequencies, coherent structures
   downstream of the obstacle, the production rate and distribution of
   turbulent kinetic energy, and the instantaneous pressure distribution in
   the wake region have been thoroughly investigated. In order to validate
   the numerical results, the first-and second-order flow statistics
   obtained from the simulations have been carefully compared against
   available wind-tunnel measurement data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{To provide cellular systems with additional spectral resources, the
   wireless industry is considering the aggregation of frequency carriers
   in licensed, unlicensed, and shared access (SA) bands. In this article,
   we focus on reliable carrier aggregation/channel bonding (CA/CB)
   techniques, in which when CA/CB between the licensed, unlicensed, and SA
   carriers is performed, the licensed carrier is used for the primary and
   secondary carriers, and the unlicensed and SA carriers operate as
   additional secondary carriers. We provide a taxonomy of the use of CA/CB
   in cellular networks and highlight the differences between different
   CA/CB approaches. We make the case that although the licensed primary
   carrier can give reliable transmission of control signaling, due to the
   nature of unlicensed and SA bands, for the efficient aggregation of
   secondary carriers there is a need for new CA/CB methods. To illustrate
   our case for novel CA/CB methods, we provide examples for different
   network environments where intelligent CA/CB decisions can increase
   throughput compared to the traditional CA/CB methods. Finally, we

Abstract = {{The dynamic spectrum access (DSA) among multiple heterogeneous primary
   spectrum owners (POs) and secondary users (SUs) in recall-based
   cognitive radio networks is investigated in this paper. In our
   framework, SUs demand a different amount of spectrum for their
   transmissions. Each PO provides a portion of radio resources for leasing
   and also offers its own primary users (PUs) a certain degree of quality
   of service (QoS). Furthermore, POs are allowed to have different
   spectrum trading areas and as well as heterogeneous activities between
   POs' users. We propose a Two-stage resource allocation scheme with
   combinatorial Auction and Stackelberg Game in spectrum Sharing (TAGS) to
   deal with the allocation problem in such a complicated system. In the
   first stage, a spectrum allocation is decided by running a
   geographically restricted combinatorial auction without the
   consideration of spectrum recall. In the second stage, a Stackelberg
   game is formulated for all users to determine their best strategies with
   respect to the potential spectrum recall. Both theoretical and
   simulation results prove that TAGS provides a feasible solution for the
   problem and ensures the desired economic properties for all individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Hindering early platelet adhesion and enhancing human vascular
   endothelial cell proliferation on surfaces of the foreign materials play
   a key role in the prevention of coagulation. In order to develop
   topographically suitable surface for artificial grafts, topographically
   modified poly(L-lactic
   acid)-b-poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-b-poly(L-lactic acid) tri-block
   copolymer (PLLA-PCL-PLLA) film surfaces were cast using a simple
   solvent-nonsolvent method. PLLA-PCL-PLLA copolymer was synthesized, and
   was confirmed by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. The
   molecular weight of the copolymer was measured using gel permeation
   chromatography (GPC). PLLA-PCL-PLLA films were cast with various ratios
   of non-solvent in the solvent mixture. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and ethyl
   alcohol (EtOH) were used as solvent and nonsolvent respectively. The
   hydrophobic characteristic of the surfaces was confirmed by the water
   contact angle (WCA). The prepared film surfaces were characterized by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and
   X-ray diffraction (XRD). Anti-platelet adhesion characteristic was
   evaluated using Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and SEM images.
   Proliferation behavior of human vascular endothelial cell was
   investigated by water-soluble tatrazolium salt (WST) assay after 3 h, 1
   day, 2 days and 4 days of cell culture on the film surface. Fabricated
   morphologically unique surface, which consists of submicron size width
   and nano size height rough structure, shows anti platelet adhesive
   ability and relatively higher human vascular endothelial cell
   proliferation behavior.}},

Abstract = {{A novel single-source surface-volume-surface integral equation is
   proposed for accurate broadband resistance and inductance extraction in
   3-D interconnects. The new equation originates in the volume integral
   equation (VIE) traditionally used for magneto-quasi-static modeling of
   current flow in 3-D wires. The latter is reduced to a surface integral
   equation by representing the electric field inside each conductor
   segment as a superposition of cylindrical waves emanating from the
   conductor's boundary. As no approximation is utilized and all underlying
   boundary conditions and pertinent equations are satisfied in the
   reduction, the new integral equation is rigorously equivalent to the
   solution of the traditional volume electric field integral equation. The
   rigorous nature of the proposed single-source surface integral equation
   is corroborated numerically. In this paper, a detailed description of
   the method of moments discretization for the proposed surface integral
   equation is also presented. Numerical solution of the proposed surface
   integral equation for a 12-conductor bond-wire package is used to
   demonstrate the accuracy of the method and its computational benefits
   compared to the traditional solution based on the VIE.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-tier cellular networks are considered as an effective solution to
   enhance the coverage and data rate offered by cellular systems. In a
   multi-tier network, high power base stations (BSs) such as macro BSs are
   overlaid by lower power small cells such as femtocells and/or picocells.
   However, co-channel deployment of multiple tiers of BSs gives rise to
   the problem of cross-tier interference that significantly impacts the
   performance of wireless networks. Multicell cooperation techniques, such
   as coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission, have been proposed as a
   promising solution to mitigate the impact of the cross-tier interference
   in multi-tier networks. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for
   Location-Aware Cross-Tier Co-operation (LA-CTC) between BSs in different
   tiers for downlink CoMP transmission in two-tier cellular networks. On
   one hand, the proposed scheme only uses CoMP transmission to enhance the
   performance of the users who suffer from high cross-tier interference
   due to the co-channel deployment of small cells such as picocells. On
   the other hand, users with good signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
   (SINR) conditions are served directly by a single BS from any of the two
   tiers. Thus, the data exchange between the cooperating BSs over the
   backhaul network can be reduced when compared to the traditional CoMP
   transmission scheme. We use tools from stochastic geometry to quantify
   the performance gains obtained by using the proposed scheme in terms of
   outage probability, achievable data rate, and load per BS. We compare
   the performance of the proposed scheme with that of other schemes in the
   literature such as the schemes which use cooperation to serve all users
   and schemes that use range expansion to offload users to the small cell
   tier.}},

Abstract = {{Device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying cellular wireless
   networks is a promising concept to improve user experience and resource
   utilization by allowing direct transmission between two cellular
   devices. In this paper, performance of network-assisted D2D
   communication is investigated where D2D traffic is carried through relay
   nodes. Considering a multi-user and multi-relay network, we propose a
   distributed solution for resource allocation with a view to maximizing
   network sum-rate. An optimization problem is formulated for radio
   resource allocation at the relays. The objective is to maximize
   end-to-end rate as well as satisfy the data rate requirements for
   cellular and D2D user equipments under total power constraint. Due to
   intractability of the resource allocation problem, we propose a solution
   approach using message passing technique where each user equipment sends
   and receives information messages to/from the relay node in an iterative
   manner with the goal of achieving an optimal allocation. Therefore, the
   computational effort is distributed among all the user equipments and
   the corresponding relay node. The convergence and optimality of the
   proposed scheme are proved and a possible distributed implementation of
   the scheme in practical LTE-Advanced networks is outlined. The numerical
   results show that there is a distance threshold beyond which relay-aided
   D2D communication significantly improves network performance with a
   small increase in end-to-end delay when compared to direct communication
   between D2D peers.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a unique application of tolerance near sets (TNS)
   for detecting solar flare events in solar images acquired using radio
   astronomy techniques. In radio astronomy (RA) applications, the
   interferometric array processing of data streams presents algorithmic
   and response time challenges as well as a high volume of data. The radio
   interferometer is an RA instrument composed of an array of antennas.
   Radio signals emitted by a celestial object are captured by the antennas
   and are subsequently processed in such a way that each pair of antennas
   produces correlated data. The overall correlated data is then
   accumulated and, after an integration period, the spectral image of the
   observed object is obtained. The process of deconvolution of the
   spectral image produces the desired spatial image of the celestial
   object. The proposed solar flare detection system is embedded in a
   computational platform framework suitable for dealing with huge volumes
   of data, based on a cluster of CPU-GPU pairs. The experimental results
   presented in the paper include comparison of the TNS-based algorithm
   (implemented as the SOL-FLARE system) with the K-means algorithm using
   significant samples of test images to validate the detection system. The
   performances of both systems are comparatively analyzed using Receiver
   Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. The images used in the
   experiments were selected from a data repository produced by the
   Nobeyama Radioheliograph, in Japan, during the years 2004 up to 2013.
   The main contribution of the article is a novel approach to solar flare
   detection in a GPU-CUDA framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID) is a
   bandwidth-efficient technique for both additive white Gaussian noise and
   fading channels. The asymptotic performance of BICM-ID is strongly
   determined by how the coded bits are mapped to the symbols of the signal
   constellation. In this paper an explicit mapping method is presented for
   32-QAM using two criteria: (i) maximization of the minimum Euclidean
   distance between the symbols with Hamming distance one, and (ii)
   minimizing the number of symbols which have jointly the minimum Hamming
   distance and the minimum Euclidean distance from each other. Our method
   is much simpler than the previously-known methods. Compared to
   previously-known best mapping, the mapping obtained by our method
   performs significantly better in a BICM-ID system implemented with
   hard-decision feedback, while its asymptotic performance is almost the
   same in a BICM-ID system using soft-decision feedback.}},

Title = {{Numerical analysis of mixed-convection laminar film condensation from
   high air mass fraction steam-air mixtures in vertical tubes}},

Abstract = {{A numerical analysis is performed for condensing downward flow from
   steam-air mixtures in vertical tubes with constant wall temperature. The
   focus of this study is on the case of high inlet non-condensing gas
   (air) mass fractions (greater than 0.80). The parabolic governing
   equations are solved for steady, axisymmetric, laminar flow in the
   liquid film and in the vapour-gas mixture. A complete two-phase model,
   based on the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in each phase,
   is presented. Detailed results are presented in both the film and
   mixture regions. Those results include radial-direction profiles of
   axial velocity, temperature, and air mass fraction, as well as axial
   variation of film thickness, Nusselt number, interface and bulk
   temperatures, interface and bulk air mass fraction, and proportion of
   latent heat transfer. In all the cases studied the interface temperature
   is very close to the wall temperature and the condensation rates are
   small due to high interface air mass fractions.
   The inlet relative humidity is varied from 30\% to 100\% and the inlet
   temperature is varied from 25 degrees C to 90 degrees C. These
   conditions cover the range of inlet air mass fraction approximately in
   the range from 0.865 to 0.995 for an inlet pressure of 1 bar. In
   addition, the effects of varying the inlet Reynolds number (500 to
   2000), the wall temperature (5 degrees C and 15 degrees C), and the tube
   radius (2.5 mm to 10.0 mm) are examined. It was found that decreasing
   the inlet relative humidity reduced the heat transfer rate and that the
   condensate film thickness increased with an increase in the inlet
   Reynolds number, inlet-to-wall temperature difference, and inlet
   relative humidity. Due to high air mass fraction, in some cases only
   40\% or less of the total heat transfer to the tube wall was due to
   condensation. For a fixed Reynolds number, decreasing the tube radius
   increased the condensation rate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Impacting hardenable steel such as 4340, results in the formation of
   adiabatic shear bands (ASBs). Previous studies have shown that the
   presence of carbides/second-phase particles in the pre-deformation
   microstructures of 4340 steel increases their susceptibility to the
   formation of ASBs. The current study examines the role of carbides on
   the microstructure and properties within evolved ASBs in 4340 steel
   after impact. Geometric phase analysis was used to map local deformation
   fields within the evolved ASBs. It was observed that carbide
   fragmentation due to plastic deformation of carbides produces both
   residual carbides and residual carbide particles in regions away from
   the shear bands. Extensive carbide fragmentation produces fine residual
   carbide particles which are redistributed within the ASBs. This is
   attributed to strain localization within the ASBs which result in higher
   local strain and strain rates within the shear bands than in regions
   outside the bands. In addition, it is observed that the residual carbide
   particles trap and pin dislocations within the shear bands and
   contribute to an increase in local hardening. A more homogenous
   distribution of narrower and shorter rotational and shear-strain fields
   were revealed by the local deformation maps within the evolved ASBs.
   Lattice deformation mapping revealed that the ferrite matrix, prior to
   impact, had broader and longer rotational and shear-strain fields
   perpendicular to the direction of impact. This is attributed to
   lattice-invariant deformation and shape deformation processes that occur
   on specific crystallographic planes during martensitic transformation.
   It is concluded that strain localization during high strain rate
   deformations does not occur on specific crystallographic planes. This
   results in a more regular distribution of internal lattice rotational
   and strain fields within the evolved ASBs.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{615}},

Abstract = {{While instability may occur homogenously during plastic deformation, the
   formation of adiabatic shear band (ASBs) does not follow a homogenous
   instability during impact. Geometrical stress concentration sites and/or
   microstructural inhomogeneities result in the nucleation and initiation
   of shear strain localization. In this study, initial microstructural
   inhomogeneity was found to produce nucleation sites for the initiation
   of ASBs. It was observed that double misfit interfaces and boundary
   layers with random arrangement of atomic columns are formed around
   precipitated carbides and they increase the volume fraction of
   dislocation sources within the specimens. The AISI 4340 steel specimens
   which were tempered at the lowest temperature had smaller precipitated
   carbides with high aspect ratios densely distributed within the matrix
   and were easily susceptible to the formation of ASBs. As the tempering
   temperature increased, the relative sizes of the carbides increased with
   a corresponding reduction in their aspect ratios and their distribution
   density within the matrix and thus were more resistant to the formation
   of ASBs. In this study, it is demonstrated that the intersection of an
   activated dislocation source with the direction of maximum shear
   (regions of stress concentrations) within the specimens during impact,
   is a necessary condition for the point of intersection to act as a
   possible site for the nucleation of ASBs, depending on the rate of
   dislocation generation, local strain and strain rate. At a constant
   carbide volume fraction, the higher susceptibility of the tempered
   specimens to the initiation of ASBs is attributed to the volume fraction
   of the points of intersection between activated dislocation sources and
   direction of maximum shear during impact. Additionally, the smaller
   carbides, with their higher aspect ratios and distribution densities,
   accentuate the effect of strain gradients and the microstructural
   inhomogeneities associated with the tempered specimens. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Sorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) by canola seeds with 8, 10, 12 and 14\%

   concentration at 10, 20, and 30 degrees C and under normal atmospheric
   pressure. Equilibrium sorption was determined, and it was found sorption
   equilibrium was established in less than 20 h except at 8\% moisture
   content canola at 10 degrees C. At 30 degrees C and higher than 10\%
   moisture content, equilibrium was established in less than 1.5 h. The
   maximum equilibrium sorption was 3.0 g/kg of dry mass of canola under 10
   degrees C with 100\% initial CO2 concentration. Sorption significantly
   increased by high intergranular CO2 concentrations and low temperatures.
   Moisture content of the canola seeds did not significantly influence the
   equilibrium sorption even though wet canola seeds had a faster sorption
   of CO2 than dry canola seeds before equilibrium was reached. Spoiled
   (visible mould) or non-spoiled canola seeds had similar equilibrium

Abstract = {{Early stages of microbial infection in date fruits are difficult to
   detect by the presently used manual sorting technique. The potential of
   hyperspectral imaging technique to detect fungal contamination of edible
   date fruits was investigated in this study. The samples were treated as
   three groups: untreated control (UC), sterile control (SC) (surface
   sterilized, rinsed and dried) and inoculated samples (IS) (surface
   sterilized, rinsed, dried and inoculated). Hyperspectral images of
   control samples and Aspergillus flavus inoculated date fruits were
   acquired using an area scan hyperspectral imaging system from 75 image
   slices at 10 nm intervals between 960 and 1700 nm after every 48 h of
   inoculation for 10 days. The top four most significant wavelengths
   corresponding to the highest factor loadings of the first principal
   components (PC) were selected and used for feature extraction. A total
   of 64 features (16 features from each selected wavelength) were
   extracted and applied in the statistical classifications (linear
   discriminant analysis (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA)).
   The classification accuracies for IS were compared with UC and SC
   separately using six-class model (control, infected day 2, day 4, day 6,
   day 8 and day 10), two-class model (control vs infected (all stages of
   infection together)) and pair-wise model (control vs each stage of
   infection). The mean classification accuracy (LDA and QDA) of IS was
   91.5\%, 91.0\% and 99.0\% for six-class model, two-class model and
   pairwise-model, respectively while,comparing with SC. Similarly, it was
   92.4\%, 100.0\% and 99.6\% for six-class model, two-class model and
   pairwise-model, respectively while comparing with UC. In general
   quadratic discriminant analysis yielded better accuracy than linear
   discriminant analysis in all the classification models tested. Further
   work is required to test this technique for other species of fungal
   infections and its effect on the chemical composition of different date
   fruit varieties. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   fatty acid value (FAV) and visible and invisible mold of the canola
   seeds were determined every 2 or 4 wk. Increase of moisture content and
   temperature increased germination loss and mold infection. Fatty acid
   values of canola seeds at 10, 20 and 30 degrees C increased with
   increase of storage time; but at 40 degrees C, it increased at the
   beginning of storage, and then dramatically decreased. Storage fungi
   (Penicillium spp., Aspergillus glaucus group and Aspergillus candidus

   visible mold and invisible fungi infection and FAV were not suitable for
   predicting safe storage time of canola. Based on the 20\% initial
   germination loss, safe storage guidelines of high oil content canola
   were developed. To safely store high oil content canola, its moisture
   content should be lower than that of low oil content canola. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Novel mathematical models to predict germination of canola (including
   rapeseed) stored under laboratory and field conditions were developed
   with certain assumptions. The models were developed based on the data
   collected under laboratory condition (constant temperatures). The
   hypothesis of the developed models was that germination of stored canola
   was influenced by temperature, moisture content, storage time, and
   airtightness. The effect of these factors on germination of stored
   canola was the product of effective storage time and interactive effect
   of temperature, moisture content, storage time, and airtightness. Data
   collected under both laboratory and filed conditions were used to
   calibrate and verify the developed models. The prediction accuracy of
   the models associated with field conditions (except canola seeds with
   14\% moisture content stored inside silo bags) was higher than that
   under laboratory conditions. The developed models could visually or
   mathematically predict germination of canola or rapeseed stored under
   any condition. The developed models explained more than 96\% variation
   of observed germination of the canola or rapeseed seeds with <= 10\%
   moisture content stored inside a flat bottom bin or commercial silo
   bags. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a framework for power allocation of downlink
   transmissions in orthogonal frequency division multiple access-based
   decode-and-forward cellular relay networks is investigated. We consider
   a system with a single base station communicating with multiple users
   assisted by multiple relays. The relays have limited power which must be
   divided among the users they support in order to maximize the data rate
   of the whole network. Advanced power allocation schemes are crucial for
   such networks. The optimal relay power allocation which maximizes the
   data rate is proposed as an upper bound, by finding the optimal power
   requirement for each user based on knapsack problem formulation. Then by
   considering the fairness, a new relay power allocation scheme, called
   weighted-based scheme, is proposed. Finally, an efficient power
   reallocation scheme is proposed to efficiently utilize the power and
   improve the data rate of the network. Simulation results demonstrate
   that the proposed power allocation schemes can significantly improve the
   data rate of the network compared to the traditional scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Base station (BS) sleeping has emerged as a viable solution to enhance
   the overall network energy efficiency by inactivating the underutilized
   BSs. However, it affects the performance of users in sleeping cells
   depending on their BS association criteria, their channel conditions
   toward the active BSs, and scheduling criteria and traffic loads at the
   active BSs. This paper characterizes the performance of cellular systems
   with BS sleeping by developing a systematic framework to derive the
   spectral efficiency and outage probability of downlink transmission to
   the sleeping cell users taking into account the aforementioned factors.
   In this context, a user association scheme is also developed in which
   sleeping cell users associate to a BS with maximum mean channel access
   probability (MMAP). The MMAP-based user association scheme adapts
   according to traffic load and scheduling criteria at the active BSs. We
   consider greedy and round-robin schemes at active BSs for scheduling
   users in a channel. We also derive the analytical results for the
   conventional maximum received signal power (MRSP)-based user association
   scheme. Finally, we derive the statistics of the received signal and
   interference power to evaluate the downlink spectral efficiency of a
   given sleeping cell user. Numerical results provide a comparison between
   two user association schemes as a function of system parameters and
   demonstrate the efficacy of the MMAP-based association scheme in
   non-uniform traffic load scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the self-adjointness of Eringen's nonlocal elasticity is
   investigated based on simple one-dimensional beam models. It is shown
   that Eringen's model may be nonself-adjoint and that it can result in an
   unexpected stiffening effect for a cantilever's fundamental vibration
   frequency with respect to increasing Eringen's small length scale
   coefficient. This is clearly inconsistent with the softening results of
   all other boundary conditions as well as the higher vibration modes of a
   cantilever beam. By using a (discrete) microstructured beam model, we
   demonstrate that the vibration frequencies obtained decrease with
   respect to an increase in the small length scale parameter. Furthermore,
   the microstructured beam model is consistently approximated by Eringen's
   nonlocal model for an equivalent set of beam equations in conjunction
   with variationally based boundary conditions (conservative elastic
   model). An equivalence principle is shown between the Hamiltonian of the
   microstructured system and the one of the nonlocal continuous beam
   system. We then offer a remedy for the special case of the cantilever
   beam by tweaking the boundary condition for the bending moment of a free
   end based on the microstructured model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the stability of a battery energy storage system

   modeling, this problem is framed into a nonlinear system formulation and
   the region of stability as a function of the internal resistance and the
   internal voltage of the battery is determined. This paper also extends
   its results in determining the configuration of a battery pack in terms
   of the number of battery cells in series and parallel to prevent

Abstract = {{Wind turbine power curve modeling is an important tool in turbine

   wind turbine power curve. Polynomial regression is studied as the
   benchmark parametric model, and issues associated with this technique
   are discussed. We then introduce the locally weighted polynomial
   regression method, and show its advantages over the polynomial
   regression. Also, the spline regression method is examined to achieve
   more flexibility for fitting the power curve. Finally, we develop a
   penalized spline regression model to address the issues of choosing the
   number and location of knots in the spline regression. The performance
   of the presented methods is evaluated using two simulated data sets as

   mechanical micromotion and galvanic corrosion resulting from dissimilar
   alloys. Coordinate measurements revealed up to 4.3 mm(3) of the
   cobalt-chromium alloy taper surface was removed due to corrosion, which
   is comparable to previous reports of corrosion damage on head-neck

   cracking susceptibility of IN738 superalloy when different filler alloys

   in the extent of precipitation hardening produced in the weld metals.

   simulation of the fully detailed large signal model. An interesting
   result from this study is that the maximum power transfer capability of
   the VSC-HVDC converter is affected by the PLL gains, and that the
   theoretical limit (obtained from static voltage stability analysis) is
   approachable as the PLL gains become very small. This paper shows that
   gains of the PLL, particularly at low SCRs, greatly affect the operation
   of the VSC-HVDC converter and that operation at low SCRs approaching 1.3
   is very difficult.}},

Abstract = {{The present work is a first trial to introduce activated carbon fibers
   (ACF) with high adsorption capacity into poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid
   (PLGA), resulting in a novel kind of scaffolds for tissue engineering
   applications. ACF, prepared via high-temperature processing of carbon
   fibers, are considered to possess bioactivity and biocompatibility. The
   ACF/PLGA composite scaffolds are prepared by solvent casting/particulate
   leaching method. Increments in both pore quantity and quality over the
   surface of ACF as well as a robust combination between ACF and PLGA
   matrix are observed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The high
   adsorption capacity of ACF is confirmed by methylene blue solution
   absorbency test. The surfaces of ACF are affiliated with many
   hydrophilic groups and characterized by Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy. Furthermore, the SEM images show that cells possess a
   favorable spreading morphology on the ACF/PLGA scaffolds. Besides, vivo
   experiments are also carried out to evaluate the histocompatibility of
   the composite scaffolds. The results show that ACF have the potential to
   become one of the most promising materials in biological fields. (C)

Title = {{Mechanical properties of carbon nanotube/polymer composites}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{The remarkable mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes, such as high
   elastic modulus and tensile strength, make them the most ideal and
   promising reinforcements in substantially enhancing the mechanical
   properties of resulting polymer/carbon nanotube composites. It is
   acknowledged that the mechanical properties of the composites are
   significantly influenced by interfacial interactions between nanotubes
   and polymer matrices. The current challenge of the application of
   nanotubes in the composites is hence to determine the mechanical
   properties of the interfacial region, which is critical for improving
   and manufacturing the nanocomposites. In this work, a new method for
   evaluating the elastic properties of the interfacial region is developed
   by examining the fracture behavior of carbon nanotube reinforced poly
   (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix composites under tension using
   molecular dynamics simulations. The effects of the aspect ratio of
   carbon nanotube reinforcements on the elastic properties, i.e. Young's
   modulus and yield strength, of the interfacial region and the
   nanotube/polymer composites are investigated. The feasibility of a
   three-phase micromechanical model in predicting the elastic properties
   of the nanocomposites is also developed based on the understanding of
   the interfacial region.}},

Abstract = {{We present a printed circuit board-based wireless inductively coupled
   corrosion potential sensor for monitoring corrosion of steel-reinforced
   concrete civil infrastructure. The sensor is a passive LC coil resonator
   whose resonant frequency varies owing to the corrosion potential
   produced by two electrodes connected across a voltage-controlled
   capacitor. The junction capacitance of the voltage-controlled capacitor
   also varies according to the potential generated by the two electrodes,
   which is in turn responsible for changing resonant frequency of the
   sensor. The two electrodes are a stainless steel reference electrode and
   a steel reinforcement electrode. An external interrogator coil coupled
   with the sensor coil monitors the sensor resonant frequency shift
   remotely by measuring the impedance change from the source end. The
   sensor has a sensitivity of similar to 1.2 kHz/mV both before and after
   it is embedded in the cement-based mortar used for testing the sensor.
   The sensor can be used to sense the corrosion susceptibility of existing
   structures by embedding the corrosion electrodes in new grout within a
   small slot formed in an existing structure. Using this approach, weight
   concentrations of NaCl mixed in cement-based mortars of greater than
   2\%-3\% were detected. Accelerated corrosion tests on embedded sensors
   in simulations of both new and existing structure demonstrated corrosion
   potential resolution of less than 10 mV and an uncertainty of less than
   50 mV. The sensor is simple in design, inexpensive, and passive making
   it a battery-less option for long-term corrosion monitoring, and widely
   deployable for civil structure.}},

Abstract = {{Direct quantification of grain boundary mobility with the presence of
   impurities poses a great challenge for investigating thermal stability
   of nanocrystalline alloys. By applying the interface random-walk method,
   we investigate the dopant segregation and precipitation from direct
   molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that existing atomistic
   simulation methods based on pure grain boundaries can be readily
   extended to extract the mobility of impure grain boundaries.
   Furthermore, it is confirmed that the grain boundary motion is
   controlled by the diffusion of segregated dopants at the interface as
   assumed by many theoretical models, but the grain boundary mobility is
   directly related to the impurity diffusion in the direction
   perpendicular to the boundary plane. By directly quantifying the
   mobility of impure grain boundary under experimental conditions, a
   correction to the well-accepted solute drag model is proposed. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper studies online travelling wave methods for fault location on
   a crossbonded cable system using sheath currents. During the
   construction of the electrical connection to the 400 MW off shore wind
   farm Anholt, it was possible to perform measurements on a 38.4 km
   crossbonded cable system. At 31.4 km, all cables were accessible which
   made it possible to apply a fault using an arc free breaker and measure
   the travelling waves at each end of the cable.
   On a crossbonded cable system, the sheaths are short circuited and
   grounded at both ends. This makes possible the use of low voltage
   Rogowski coils if the sheath currents contain the necessary information
   for accurate fault location. In this paper, this is examined by analysis
   of field measurements and through a study of simulations. The wavelet
   transform and a visual inspection method are used and the accuracy is
   compared. Field measurements and simulations are compared for testing
   the reliability of using simulations for studying fault location

Abstract = {{The mammalian olfactory system is highly complex, with more than 1000
   non-specific binding receptors. The chemical diversity among these
   receptors yields differential responses resulting in a `fingerprint'
   response pattern characteristic of a particular gas phase odorant or
   mixture. It is through these response-patterns that our brain perceives
   its chemical environment. While the concept of an electronic nose has
   been explored over the past several decades, the emergence of integrated
   circuits analogous to charge-coupled device (CCD) devices with this kind
   of chemical sensitivity have yet to emerge. One of the main stumbling
   blocks is the ability to deposit large numbers of chemically diverse
   sensing layers within large-scale integrated circuits. The use of
   electronically conducting polymers (ECP) as sensing layers are
   attractive since they can be electrodeposited on existing fabricated
   structures without the need for additional lithographic steps, however
   they are limited by the number of chemically different monomer units
   available. In this study, we demonstrate the ability to significantly
   increase the level of diversity through the control of the dopant and
   the oxidation level of the deposited polymer layers. By using two
   polymers, several dopants and different oxidation states determined by
   applied electrochemical potential, fifty-five chemically diverse sensing
   elements are produced. These results suggest that by using these
   orthogonal variables, a chemically diverse integrated sensor array chip
   can be generated through a combinatorial approach of deposition
   conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An optimal layered inhomogeneous background which can be used in an
   embedded microwave tomography system is proposed. The method is based on
   a new evaluation method of integral radiation operator with respect to
   an configuration and optimal methods such as simulated annealing method.
   First, the integral radiation operator is calculated using the finite
   element method. Then, a kind of metric which can be used to evaluate the
   operator is proposed. The metric contains information about the whole
   singular value spectrum of a integral radiation operator. A set of
   synthetic researches is performed to show the correlation between the
   metric and inversion error. The method can evaluate an integral
   radiation operator using a number, and it can be used in optimal process
   easily as the cost function. Simulated annealing method is employed to
   obtain the permittivity of each layer in the optimal layered
   inhomogeneous background. Finally, synthetic researches are employed
   both on simple target and complex target to test the optimal layered
   inhomogeneous background. The results show that the optimal layered

Abstract = {{A multi-scale model that combines the finite element method and
   stochastic analysis is developed to simulate the evolution of the
   microstructure of an Nb-bearing nickel-based superalloy during laser
   additive manufacturing solidification. Through the use of this model,
   the nucleation and growth of dendrites, the segregation of niobium (Nb)
   and the formation of Laves phase particles during the solidification are
   investigated to provide the relationship between the solidification
   conditions and the resultant microstructure, especially in the
   morphology of Laves phase particles. The study shows that small equiaxed
   dendrite arm spacing under a high cooling rate and low temperature
   gradient to growth rate (G/R) ratio is beneficial for forming discrete
   Laves phase particles. In contrast, large columnar dendrite arm spacing
   under a low cooling rate and high G/R ratio tends to produce
   continuously distributed coarse Laves phase particles, which are known
   to be detrimental to mechanical properties. In addition, the improvement
   of hot cracking resistance by controlling the morphology of Laves phase
   particles is discussed by analyzing the cracking pattern and
   microstructure in the laser deposited material. This work provides
   valuable understanding of solidification microstructure development in
   Nb-bearing nickel-based superalloys, like IN 718, during laser additive
   manufacturing and constitutes a fundamental basis for controlling the
   microstructure to minimize the formation of deleterious Laves phase
   particles. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Resilient modulus is a measure of the elastic behaviour of subgrade soil
   under traffic loading. The design thickness of a pavement structure and
   its predicted performance are highly dependent on subgrade modulus.
   Characterisation of subgrade resilient modulus involves conducting
   advanced repeated loading triaxial testing that requires special
   equipment and technical experience that are not available in many soil
   laboratories. The objectives of this paper were to characterise the
   resilient modulus of typical fine-grained subgrade soils and develop
   design inputs for the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide. The
   resilient modulus of subgrade soil samples was tested at different
   levels of moisture content. Results of the laboratory testing were used
   to develop prediction models for resilient modulus as function of
   physical properties of the subgrade soil and stress state. The proposed
   models were compared to those developed under the Long-Term Pavement
   Performance programme. The results showed that the proposed models
   provided more reliable predictions with lower root mean square error.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reports on an experimental study of turbulent open-channel
   flow near small-scale and large-scale bar rack models. The experiments
   were conducted for a wide range of bar depth, bar shape, bar spacing and
   bar inclination to the approach flow. The contours of the mean velocity
   near the small-scale models revealed that bar inclination produced
   asymmetric flow, a potential threat for vibration failure. The
   reconstructed fluctuating velocity fields obtained from proper
   orthogonal decomposition revealed strong organization of vortical
   structure downstream of the aligned bars compared to the inclined bars.
   The head loss coefficient generally increased monotonically with
   blockage ratio and bar inclination. Significant reduction in head losses
   was observed when square leading edges of rectangular bars are replaced
   by round leading edges, or if streamlined profile cross-section bars
   were used instead of rectangular bars.}},

Abstract = {{The energy efficiency of a building depends on building envelope
   performance. The results presented in this paper are the first of a
   long-term building envelope research project at the Alternative Village
   at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Five test
   buildings were constructed using the following systems: two wood frames
   with fiberglass batt insulation and dense pack cellulose, one
   polyurethane structural insulated panels (PUR SIP), and two with the
   Stay in place PVC concrete form building system using 102mm and 204mm of
   concrete externally insulated with 102mm of expanded polystyrene foam.
   All of the buildings had a common foundation and roof system with a
   footprint of 23.8 m(2). Blower door tests were conducted to determine
   air tightness. Each structure was heated with an electrical resistance
   heater and maintained at a constant internal temperature. The thermal
   gradient through the wall and power consumption were monitored. The
   study period discussed in this report represents the main heating season
   from October 2011 to April 2012 consisting of 209 days. Based on the
   power consumption, the PUR SIP consumed the least at 2498 kWh, while the
   204 mm Stay in place PVC concrete form building used the most at 2898
   kWh for the same time period. The thermal gradient through the cross
   section of the wood frame structures was compared through the cavity
   insulation and at the stud. It was found that the cellulose building
   provided better thermal resistance along the stud when compared to the
   fiberglass batt insulation.}},

Abstract = {{Migration and localization of NK cells into peripheral tissues are
   tightly regulated under normal and pathological conditions. The
   physiological importance of NK cell-DC crosstalk has been well
   documented. However, the ways in which DCs regulate the migratory
   properties of NK cells (such as chemotaxis, chemokinesis,
   chemo-repulsion) are not fully defined in vitro. Here, we employed a
   microfluidic platform to examine, at the single-cell level, C57BL/6
   NK-cell migrations in a stable chemical gradient. We observed that
   soluble factors released by the immature and LPS-activated mature DCs
   induced a high level of chemotactic movement of IL-2-activated NK cells
   in vitro. We confirmed these findings in a standard trans-well migration
   assay, and identified CXCR3 as a key receptor on the NK cells that
   mediated the migration. More interestingly, we revealed a novel function
   of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor in repulsing NK-cell
   migrations. The future uses of such microfluidic device in the
   systematic evaluations of NK-cell migratory responses in NK cell-DC
   crosstalk will provide new insights into the development of DC-based
   NK-cell therapies against tumor and infections.}},

Abstract = {{Raman and infrared (IR) spectroscopy are complementary spectroscopic
   techniques. However, measurement of Raman and IR spectra are commonly
   carried out on separate instruments. A dispersive system that enables
   both Raman spectroscopy and NIR spectroscopy was designed, built, and
   tested. The prototype system measures spectral ranges of 2600-300 cm(-1)
   and 752-987 nm for Raman and NIR channels, respectively. A wavelength
   accuracy better than 0.6 nm and spectral resolution better than 1 nm
   (14.4 cm(-1) for Raman channel) could be achieved with our
   configuration. The linearity of spectral response was better than
   99.8\%. The intensity stability of the instrument was found to be 0.7\%
   and 0.4\% for Raman and NIR channels, respectively. The performance of
   the instrument was evaluated using binary aqueous solutions of ethanol
   and ovalbumin. It was found that ethanol concentrations (2-10\%) could
   be predicted with a root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) of
   0.45\% using Raman peak height at 882.2 cm(-1). Quantification of
   ovalbumin concentration (8-16 g/L) in aqueous solutions and in denatured
   states yielded RMSEP values of 1.05 g/L and 0.74 g/L, respectively.
   Using concentration as external perturbation in two-dimensional
   correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS), heterospectral correlation analysis
   revealed the relationship between NIR and Raman spectra. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Traditional wound dressings, including cotton gauze, absorbent pads and
   bandages, can cause trauma and pain to wounds during dressing changes,
   leading to a variety of physical and psychosocial sequelae. The aim of
   this study was to adapt an in vitro model of adherence to evaluate the
   effects of various methods to theoretically reduce the adherence of
   wound dressings. Gelatin in liquid form was cast onto poly(ethylene
   terephthalate) (PET) fabric and allowed to solidify and progressively
   dry to simulate wound desiccation in the clinical setting. A 180 peel
   test of PET from the gelatin slab yielded adherence data of peeling
   energy. The peeling energy of PET increased with the drying time. It was
   possible to reduce the force by drying at 75\% relative humidity (RH).
   After drying for 24 h, either 500 mu L of water or surfactant solution
   was added onto the PET surface (16 x 60 mm(2)). The peeling energy
   decreased dramatically with wetting and there was no significant
   difference between water and surfactant. As a long-term strategy for
   decreasing adherence, a thin layer of polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogel was
   deposited onto PET fabric via UV irradiation. This resulted in a much
   lower peeling energy without severely compromising fabric flexibility.
   This hydrogel layer could also serve as a reservoir for bioactive and
   antimicrobial agents which could be sustainably released to create a
   microbe-free microenvironment for optimized wound healing. (C) 2014

   replaced by a new and identical one. The spare system for the
   replacement is available only by sending a purchase order to a supplier,
   and the duration of spare system procurement lead time also follows a PH
   distribution. Based on the number of system failures, a new
   order-replacement policy (also called (K, N) policy) is proposed in this
   paper. Using the closure property of the PH distribution, the long-run
   average cost rate for the system is given by the renewal reward theorem.
   Finally, through numerical calculation, it is determined an optimal
   order-replacement policy such that the long-run expected cost rate is
   minimum. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Balancing control is important for biped standing. In spite of large
   efforts, it is very difficult to design balancing control strategies
   satisfying three requirements simultaneously: maintaining postural
   stability, improving energy efficiency, and satisfying the constraints
   between the biped feet and the ground. To implement such a control,
   inclusion of the actuators' dynamics is necessary, which complicates the
   overall system, obstructs the control design, and makes stability
   analysis more difficult. In this paper, a constrained balancing control
   meeting all three requirements is designed for a standing bipedal robot.
   The dynamics of the selected actuators has been considered for
   developing the motion equations of the overall control system, which has
   usually been neglected in simulations. In addition, stability analysis
   of such a complex biped control system has been provided using the
   concept of Lyapunov exponents (LEs), which shows the significance of
   actuators' dynamics on the stability region. The paper contributes to
   balancing standing biped in both the theoretical and the practical
   sense.}},

Title = {{Reduced catabolic protein expression in Clostridium butyricum DSM 10702
   correlate with reduced 1,3-propanediol synthesis at high glycerol
   loading}},
Journal = {{AMB EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Higher initial glycerol loadings (620 mM) have a negative effect on
   growth and 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) synthesis in Clostridium butyricum
   DSM 10702 relative to lower initial glycerol concentrations (170 mM). To
   help understand metabolic shifts associated with elevated glycerol,
   protein expression levels were quantified by LC/MS/MS analyses. Thirty
   one (31) proteins involved in conversion of glycerol to 1,3-PDO and
   other by-products were analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM).
   The analyses revealed that high glycerol concentrations reduced cell
   growth. The expression levels of most proteins in glycerol catabolism
   pathways were down-regulated, consistent with the slower growth rates
   observed. However, at high initial glycerol concentrations, some of the
   proteins involved in the butyrate synthesis pathways such as a putative
   ethanol dehydrogenase (CBY\_3753) and a 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
   dehydrogenase (CBY\_3045) were up-regulated in both exponential and
   stationary growth phases. Expression levels of proteins (CBY\_0500,
   CBY\_0501 and CBY\_0502) involved in the reductive pathway of glycerol
   to 1,3-PDO were consistent with glycerol consumption and product
   concentrations observed during fermentation at both glycerol
   concentrations, and the molar yields of 1,3-PDO were similar in both
   cultures. This is the first report that correlates expression levels of
   glycerol catabolism enzymes with synthesis of 1,3-PDO in C. butyricum.
   The results revealed that significant differences in the expression of a
   small subset of proteins were observed between exponential and
   stationary growth phases at both low and high glycerol concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{The smart grid is an innovative energy network that will improve the
   conventional electrical grid network to be more reliable, cooperative,
   responsive, and economical. Within the context of the new capabilities,
   advanced data sensing, communication, and networking technology will
   play a significant role in shaping the future of the smart grid. The
   smart grid will require a flexible and efficient framework to ensure the
   collection of timely and accurate information from various locations in
   power grid to provide continuous and reliable operation. This article
   presents a tutorial on the sensor data collection, communications, and
   networking issues for the smart grid. First, the applications of data
   sensing in the smart grid are reviewed. Then, the requirements for data
   sensing and collection, the corresponding sensors and actuators, and the
   communication and networking architecture are discussed. The
   communication technologies and the data communication network
   architecture and protocols for the smart grid are described. Next,
   different emerging techniques for data sensing, communications, and
   sensor data networking are reviewed. The issues related to security of
   data sensing and communications in the smart grid are then discussed. To
   this end, the standardization activities and use cases related to data

Title = {{Mixed reality temporal bone surgical dissector: mechanical design}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD \& NECK SURGERY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{43}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The Development of a Novel Mixed Reality (MR) Simulation. An
   evolving training environment emphasizes the importance of simulation.
   Current haptic temporal bone simulators have difficulty representing
   realistic contact forces and while 3D printed models convincingly
   represent vibrational properties of bone, they cannot reproduce soft
   tissue. This paper introduces a mixed reality model, where the effective
   elements of both simulations are combined; haptic rendering of soft
   tissue directly interacts with a printed bone model. This paper
   addresses one aspect in a series of challenges, specifically the
   mechanical merger of a haptic device with an otic drill. This further
   necessitates gravity cancelation of the work assembly gripper mechanism.
   In this system, the haptic end-effector is replaced by a high-speed
   drill and the virtual contact forces need to be repositioned to the
   drill tip from the mid wand. Previous publications detail generation of
   both the requisite printed and haptic simulations.
   Method: Custom software was developed to reposition the haptic
   interaction point to the drill tip. A custom fitting, to hold the otic
   drill, was developed and its weight was offset using the haptic device.
   The robustness of the system to disturbances and its stable performance
   during drilling were tested. The experiments were performed on a mixed
   reality model consisting of two drillable rapid-prototyped layers
   separated by a free-space. Within the free-space, a linear virtual force
   model is applied to simulate drill contact with soft tissue.
   Results: Testing illustrated the effectiveness of gravity cancellation.
   Additionally, the system exhibited excellent performance given random
   inputs and during the drill's passage between real and virtual
   components of the model. No issues with registration at model boundaries
   were encountered.
   Conclusion: These tests provide a proof of concept for the initial
   stages in the development of a novel mixed-reality temporal bone
   simulator.}},

   from biomass through consolidated bioprocessing. The first step in the
   production of biofuel from biomass by microorganisms is the hydrolysis
   of complex carbohydrates present in biomass. This is achieved through
   the presence of a repertoire of secreted or complexed carbohydrate
   active enzymes (CAZymes), sometimes organized in an extracellular
   organelle called cellulosome. To assess the ability and understand the
   mechanism of polysaccharide hydrolysis in C. termitidis, the recently
   sequenced strain CT1112 of C. termitidis was analyzed for both CAZymes
   and cellulosomal components, and compared to other cellulolytic
   bacteria. A total of 355 CAZyme sequences were identified in C.
   termitidis, significantly higher than other Clostridial species. Of
   these, high numbers of glycoside hydrolases (199) and carbohydrate
   binding modules (95) were identified. The presence of a variety of
   CAZymes involved with polysaccharide utilization/degradation ability
   suggests hydrolysis potential for a wide range of polysaccharides. In
   addition, dockerin-bearing enzymes, cohesion domains and a cellulosomal
   gene cluster were identified, indicating the presence of potential
   cellulosome assembly.}},

Abstract = {{Using stochastic geometry, we develop a tractable uplink modeling
   paradigm for outage probability and spectral efficiency in both single
   and multi-tier cellular wireless networks. The analysis accounts for per
   user equipment (UE) power control as well as the maximum power
   limitations for UEs. More specifically, for interference mitigation and
   robust uplink communication, each UE is required to control its transmit
   power such that the average received signal power at its serving base
   station (BS) is equal to a certain threshold rho(o). Due to the limited
   transmit power, the UEs employ a truncated channel inversion power
   control policy with a cutoff threshold of rho(o). We show that there
   exists a transfer point in the uplink system performance that depends on
   the following tuple: BS intensity lambda, maximum transmit power of UEs
   P-u, and rho(o). That is, when P-u is a tight operational constraint
   with respect to (w.r.t.) lambda and rho(o), the uplink outage
   probability and spectral efficiency highly depend on the values of
   lambda and rho(o). In this case, there exists an optimal cutoff
   threshold rho(o){*}, which depends on the system parameters, that
   minimizes the outage probability. On the other hand, when P-u is not a
   binding operational constraint w.r.t. lambda and rho(o), the uplink
   outage probability and spectral efficiency become independent of lambda
   and rho(o)d. We obtain approximate yet accurate simple expressions for
   outage probability and spectral efficiency, which reduce to closed forms
   in some special cases.}},

Abstract = {{A novel 3-D dual-polarized microwave imaging system based on the
   modulated scattering technique (MST) is presented. The system collects
   the magnitude and phase of the scattered field using 120 MST probes and
   12 transmitter/collector antennas distributed around an
   object-of-interest in the near-field region. The 12 antennas form a
   middle circumferential layer while the printed MST probes are arranged
   on three circumferential layers including the middle layer. The antennas
   are linearly polarized double-layer Vivaldi antennas, each fixed inside
   its own cylindrical conducting cavity and slanted with respect to the
   vertical axis of the imaging chamber. The MST probes are etched on both
   sides of a thin substrate and loaded with five evenly distributed p-i-n
   diodes along their length. These are positioned vertically and
   horizontally so that the z- and phi-components of the electric field is
   measured. Field data are collected using MST, calibrated, and then
   inverted using a multiplicatively regularized finite-element contrast
   source inversion algorithm. The system performance is evaluated by
   collecting and inverting data from different 3-D targets.}},

Abstract = {{Small cells overlaid with macrocells can increase the capacity of
   two-tier cellular wireless networks by offloading traffic from
   macrocells. To motivate the small cell service providers (SSPs) to open
   portion of the access opportunities to macro users (i.e., to operate in
   a hybrid access mode), we design an incentive mechanism in which the
   macrocell service provider (MSP) could pay to the SSPs. According to the
   price offered by the MSP, the SSPs decide on the open access ratio,
   which is the ratio of shared radio resource for macro users and the
   total amount of radio resource in a small cell. The users in this
   two-tier network can make service selection decisions dynamically
   according to the performance satisfaction level and cost, which again
   depend on the pricing and spectrum sharing between the MSP and SSPs. To
   model this dynamic interactive decision problem, we propose a
   hierarchical dynamic game framework. In the lower level, we formulate an
   evolutionary game to model and analyze the adaptive service selection of
   users. An evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) is considered to be the
   solution of this game. In the upper level, the MSP and SSPs sequentially
   determine the pricing strategy and the open access ratio, respectively,
   taking into account the distribution of dynamic service selection at the
   lower-level evolutionary game. A Stackelberg differential game is
   formulated where the MSP and SSPs act as the leader and followers,
   respectively. An open-loop Stackelberg equilibrium is considered to be
   the solution of this game. We also extend the hierarchical dynamic game
   framework and investigate the impact of information delays on the
   equilibrium solutions. Numerical results show the effectiveness and
   advantages of dynamic control of the open access ratio and pricing.}},

Journal = {{BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{8-15}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The effects of in-vehicle automation and driving assistant systems on
   the situation awareness of drivers have been the subject of much
   research with the implications of automation in such man-machine systems
   being identified. With the introduction of advanced automated systems in
   agricultural machinery, farmers are now working with semi-autonomous
   vehicles. A human factors perspective is needed to ensure the safe and
   efficient operation of such systems. This simulator study investigated
   the effects of automating vehicle steering and implement control and
   monitoring task automation on the situation awareness of drivers.
   Experiments were conducted using a tractor driving simulator located in
   the Agricultural Ergonomics Laboratory at the University of Manitoba.
   Thirty young, experienced tractor drivers participated in this study. It
   was found that implement control and monitoring task automation
   significantly affected the situation awareness of operators. Situation
   awareness increased as the level of automation support increased
   although the highest level of automation, where the participants were
   removed from the task loop, resulted in low situation awareness at a
   level similar to the condition with no automation support. The highest
   level of situation awareness was observed when the simulator suggested
   the required action to be taken by the operator. Vehicle steering task
   automation reduced the attentional demand of the task. (c) 2014 IAgrE.

Abstract = {{Date is an important fruit in the regular diets of many peoples in the
   Arab countries and several other parts of the world. Hardness is one of
   the important attributes in determining the quality of dates. Hard dates
   are tough, difficult to chew, unsuitable for several product preparation
   and ultimately fetching low market price. In general, hard dates have
   strong curvy and zigzag textured skin. In this study, the efficiency of
   edge detection features in classifying dates based on hardness using
   monochrome images was determined. Date samples (Fard variety) were
   obtained from three major dates growing regions in Oman, and classified
   into three grades (soft, semi-hard and hard) by a group of trained
   graders followed with a confirmation by an experienced grader in a
   commercial dates company. Individual dates were imaged using a
   monochrome camera (600 dates per grade; total = 1,800 images). A total
   of 36 features were extracted (28 in spatial domain and 8 in frequency
   domain) using edge detection methods. An artificial neural network (ANN)
   was used to classify the dates based on hardness. The overall
   classification accuracies were 75 \% and 87 \% while using single ANN
   (irrespective of regions) for three-class (soft, semi-hard and hard) and
   two-class (soft and hard (semi-hard and hard together)) models,
   respectively. While using separate ANN for each region in the
   three-class model, the mean classification accuracies were 94 \%, 59 \%

Abstract = {{Nitrite and nitrate were compared as electron acceptors to select for
   denitrifying phosphorous accumulating organisms (DPAO) in two integrated
   fixed film activated sludge (IFAS 1 and IFAS 2) systems operated as
   sequencing batch reactors. The bench-scale experiment lasted one year
   and synthetic wastewater was used as feed. During anoxic conditions 20
   mg NO3--N L-1 were dosed into IFAS-1 and 20 mg NO2-N L-1 were dosed into
   IFAS-2. Long term phosphorous and ammonia removal via nitritation were
   achieved in both systems and both attached and suspended biomass
   contributed to phosphorous and ammonia removal. DPAO showed no specific
   adaptation to the electron acceptor as evidenced by short term switch of
   feeding with nitrate or nitrite. Anoxic phosphorus uptake rate was
   significantly higher with nitrite than with nitrate. Results showed that
   DPAO activity with nitrite could be integrated into attached and
   suspended biomass of IFAS systems in long term operation. (C) 2014

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{41-48}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{An ocean wave energy harvester from the transverse wave motion of water
   particles is developed by the piezoelectric effects. The harvester is
   made of two horizontal cantilever plates attached by piezoelectric
   patches and fixed on a vertical rectangular column. To describe the
   energy harvesting process, a mathematical model is developed to
   calculate the output charge and voltage from the piezoelectric patches
   according to the Airy linear wave theory and the elastic beam model. The
   influences on the root mean square (RMS) of the generated power from the
   piezoelectric patches, such as the ocean depth, the harvester location
   under the ocean surface, the length of the cantilevers, the wave height,
   and the ratio of wave length to ocean depth, are discussed. Results show
   that the RMS increases with the increase in the length of cantilevers
   and the wave height, and decrease in the distance of the ocean surface
   to the cantilevers and the ratio of the wave length to ocean depth. As a
   result, an optimum ocean depth is obtained to achieve a maximum RMS at
   different harvester locations under the ocean surface. A value of the
   power up to 30 W can be realized for a practical transverse wave with
   the values of the ocean depth, wave length, wave height and harvester
   location under the ocean surface to be 10.6 m, 21.2 m, 4 m, and -2 m,
   respectively. This research develops a novel technique leading to
   efficient and practical energy harvesting from transverse waves by
   piezoelectric energy harvesters that could be easily fixed on an
   offshore platform. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{67-79}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Recently, the increasing energy demand has caused dramatic consumption
   of fossil fuels and unavoidable raising energy prices. Moreover,
   environmental effect of fossil fuel led to the need of using renewable
   energy (RE) to meet the rising energy demand. Unpredictability and the
   high cost of the renewable energy technologies are the main challenges
   of renewable energy usage. In this context, the integration of renewable
   energy sources to meet the energy demand of a given area is a promising
   scenario to overcome the RE challenges. In this study, a novel approach
   is proposed for optimal design of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES)
   including various generators and storage devices. The epsilon-constraint
   method has been applied to minimize simultaneously the total cost of the
   system, unmet load, and fuel emission. A particle swarm optimization
   (PSO)-simulation based approach has been used to tackle the
   multi-objective optimization problem. The proposed approach has been
   tested on a case study of an HRES system that includes wind turbine,
   photovoltaic (PV) panels, diesel generator, batteries, fuel cell (FC),
   electrolyzer and hydrogen tank. Finally, a sensitivity analysis study is
   performed to study the sensibility of different parameters to the
   developed model. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Organisations willing to succeed in global competition have to integrate
   their internal and external processes. This especially includes planning
   and production control (PPC) processes. Optimised allocation of the
   production resources and quick response to demand changes result in
   lower cost and improvement of production performance. Practitioners and
   researchers have been trying to achieve these goals using production
   planning techniques. Although the results are significant, it seems
   necessary to integrate production operations in order to improve the
   production performance. The goals, information and decisions taken in
   production planning and control and process planning are often very
   different and difficult to integrate in Cellular Manufacturing (CM)
   environments. Designing an efficient PPC system and integrating it with
   process planning in a cellular environment is of the same importance.
   The following paper proposes first a comprehensive framework of
   integrated process planning and production planning and control in CM.
   Then, with respect to this framework and utilising the domain knowledge
   in the area of CM systems, an integrated model based on Integrated
   Definition Modeling Language is developed. The application of the models
   has been considered as a case study for a production system in
   electronics and telecommunication sector in a plant in Iran. The
   validity and completeness of the proposed model is tested by a panel of
   experts in the areas of production planning and control in CM

   high-throughput proteomics}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Background: Growing interest in cellulolytic clostridia with potential
   for consolidated biofuels production is mitigated by low conversion of
   raw substrates to desired end products. Strategies to improve conversion
   are likely to benefit from emerging techniques to define molecular
   systems biology of these organisms. Clostridium stercorarium DSM8532(T)
   is an anaerobic thermophile with demonstrated high ethanol production on
   cellulose and hemicellulose. Although several lignocellulolytic enzymes
   in this organism have been well-characterized, details concerning
   carbohydrate transporters and central metabolism have not been
   described. Therefore, the goal of this study is to define an improved
   whole genome sequence (WGS) for this organism using in-depth molecular
   profiling by RNA-seq transcriptomics and tandem mass spectrometry-based
   proteomics.
   Results: A paired-end Roche/454 WGS assembly was closed through
   application of an in silico algorithm designed to resolve repetitive
   sequence regions, resulting in a circular replicon with one gap and a
   region of 2 kilobases with 10 ambiguous bases. RNA-seq transcriptomics
   resulted in nearly complete coverage of the genome, identifying errors
   in homopolymer length attributable to 454 sequencing. Peptide sequences
   resulting from high-throughput tandem mass spectrometry of
   trypsin-digested protein extracts were mapped to 1,755 annotated
   proteins (68\% of all protein-coding regions). Proteogenomic analysis
   confirmed the quality of annotation and improvement pipelines,
   identifying a missing gene and an alternative reading frame. Peptide
   coverage of genes hypothetically involved in substrate hydrolysis,
   transport and utilization confirmed multiple pathways for glycolysis,
   pyruvate conversion and recycling of intermediates. No sequences
   homologous to transaldolase, a central enzyme in the pentose phosphate
   pathway, were observed by any method, despite demonstrated growth of
   this organism on xylose and xylan hemicellulose.
   Conclusions: Complementary omics techniques confirm the quality of
   genome sequence assembly, annotation and error-reporting. Nearly
   complete genome coverage by RNA-seq likely indicates background DNA in
   RNA extracts, however these preps resulted in WGS enhancement and
   transcriptome profiling in a single Illumina run. No detection of
   transaldolase by any method despite xylose utilization by this organism
   indicates an alternative pathway for sedoheptulose-7-phosphate
   degradation. This report combines next-generation omics techniques to
   elucidate previously undefined features of substrate transport and
   central metabolism for this organism and its potential for consolidated
   biofuels production from lignocellulose.}},

   function was solved with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In
   each control cycle, one control unit was taken as the controlled
   objective. A control unit shift strategy was proposed to shift
   controlled objectives. Both simulations and experiments were carried out
   to validate the control effectiveness. Results showed that the proposed
   DP-MPC method could control the whole grain bulk temperature and
   moisture content and optimize the system energy consumption. The maximum
   grain temperature and moisture content differences between the
   controlled value and the set point were less than 1 degrees C and 1\%,
   respectively. The energy consumed during ventilation with the DP-MPC was
   15.5\% less than that consumed during ventilation without control.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a dynamic forcing scheme incorporating backscatter is
   proposed in order to remove the artificial buffer layer in a hybrid
   Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)/large-eddy simulation (LES)
   approach. In contrast to previous forcing techniques, the proposed
   forcing is determined dynamically from the flow field itself, and does
   not require any extraction of turbulent fields from reference direct
   numerical simulation (DNS) or high-resolution LES databases. Transport
   equations for the resolved turbulent stresses and kinetic energy are
   introduced to investigate the effects of dynamic forcing on reduction of
   the thickness and impact of the artificial buffer layer. The proposed
   forcing model has been tested in the context of turbulent channel flows
   with Reynolds numbers Re-tau = 650 and 1020 (based on the wall friction
   velocity and half channel height). In order to validate the hybrid
   RANS/LES approach, flow statistics obtained from the simulations have
   been thoroughly compared against the available DNS data. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{The instability of geometrically imperfect shape memory alloy (SMA)
   fibers reinforced with hybrid laminated composite (SMAHC) plates and
   subjected to a uniform thermal loading is analytically investigated. The
   material properties of the SMAHC plates are assumed to be functions of
   temperature. Nonlinear equations of the plates' thermal stability are
   derived based on a higher order shear deformation theory incorporating
   von Karman geometrical nonlinearity via stationary potential energy. The
   structural recovery stress, which is generated by martensitic phase
   transformation of the prestrained SMA fibers, is calculated based on the
   one-dimensional thermodynamic constitutive model by Brinson. Adopting
   the Galerkin procedure, the governing nonlinear partial differential
   equations are converted into a set of nonlinear algebraic equations, in
   which systems of equations are solved by introducing an analytical
   approach. Closed-form formulations are presented to determine the
   load-deflection path and critical buckling temperature of the plate.
   Based on the developed closed-form solutions, ample numerical results
   are presented to provide an insight into the effects of the volume
   fraction, prestrain, location and orientation of the SMA fibers,
   composite plate geometry, geometrical imperfection and temperature
   dependence on the stability of the SMAHC plates. It is shown that a
   proper application of SMA fibers results in a considerable delay of the
   thermal bifurcation and controllable thermal post-buckling deflection of
   the SMAHC plate.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel framework to derive the statistics of the
   interference considering dedicated and shared spectrum access for uplink
   transmission in two-tier small cell networks such as the
   macrocell-femtocell networks. The framework exploits the distance
   distributions from geometric probability theory to characterize the
   uplink interference while considering a traditional grid-model set-up
   for macrocells along with the randomly deployed femtocells. The derived
   expressions capture the impact of path-loss, composite shadowing and
   fading, uniform and non-uniform traffic loads, spatial distribution of
   femtocells, and partial and full spectral reuse among femtocells.
   Considering dedicated spectrum access, first, we derive the statistics
   of co-tier interference incurred at both femtocell and macrocell base
   stations (BSs) from a single interferer by approximating generalized-K
   composite fading distribution with the tractable Gamma distribution. We
   then derive the distribution of the number of interferers considering
   partial spectral reuse and moment generating function (MGF) of the
   cumulative interference for both partial and full spectral reuse
   scenarios. Next, we derive the statistics of the cross-tier interference
   at both femtocell and macrocell BSs considering shared spectrum access.
   Finally, we utilize the derived expressions to analyze the capacity in
   both dedicated and shared spectrum access scenarios. The derived
   expressions are validated by the Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical
   results are generated to assess the feasibility of shared and dedicated
   spectrum access in femtocells under varying traffic load and spectral
   reuse scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The strength of carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance
   (CSMA/CA) can be combined with that of time-division multiple access
   (TDMA) to enhance the channel access performance in wireless networks
   such as the IEEE 802.15.4-based wireless personal area networks. In
   particular, the performance of legacy CSMA/CA-based medium access
   control scheme in congested networks can be enhanced through a hybrid
   CSMA/CA-TDMA scheme while preserving the scalability property. In this
   paper, we present distributed and centralized channel access models that
   follow the transmission strategies based on Markov decision process
   (MDP) to access both contention period and contention-free period in an
   intelligent way. The models consider the buffer status as an indication
   of congestion provided that the offered traffic does not exceed the
   channel capacity. We extend the models to consider the hidden node
   collision problem encountered due to the signal attenuation caused by
   channel fading. The simulation results show that the MDP-based
   distributed channel access scheme outperforms the legacy slotted CSMA/CA
   scheme. The centralized model outperforms the distributed model but
   requires the global information of the network.}},

Abstract = {{Medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (mcl-PHA) production by

   acids (WFA). Cell growth, substrate consumption, mcl-PHA accumulation
   within the cells, and the monomer composition of the synthesized
   biopolymers were monitored. The patterns of mcl-PHA synthesis in P.
   putida LS46 cells grown on PG and WG were similar but differed from that
   of cells grown with WFA. Polymer accumulation in glycerol-based cultures
   was stimulated by nitrogen limitation and plateaued after 48 h in both
   PG and WG cultures, with a total accumulation of 17.9\% cell dry mass
   and 16.3\% cell dry mass, respectively. In contrast, mcl-PHA synthesis
   was independent of nitrogen concentration in P. putida LS46 cells
   cultured with WFA, which accumulated to 29\% cell dry mass. In all
   cases, the mcl-PHAs synthesized consisted primarily of
   3-hydroxyoctanoate (C-8) and 3-hydroxydecanoate (C-10). WG and WFA
   supported similar or greater cell growth and mcl-PHA accumulation than
   PG under the experimental conditions used. These results suggest that
   biodiesel by-product streams could be used as low-cost carbon sources
   for sustainable mcl-PHA production.}},

Abstract = {{For networks with random topologies (e. g., wireless ad-hoc and sensor
   networks) and dynamically varying channel gains, choosing the long term
   operating parameters that optimize the network performance metrics is
   very challenging. In this paper, we use stochastic geometry analysis to
   develop a novel framework to design spectrum-efficient multi-channel
   random wireless networks based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The
   proposed framework maximizes both spatial and time domain frequency
   utilization under channel gain uncertainties to minimize the number of
   frequency channels required to accommodate a certain population of
   coexisting IEEE 802.15.4 networks. The performance metrics are the
   outage probability and the self admission failure probability. We relax
   the single channel assumption that has been used traditionally in the
   stochastic geometry analysis. We show that the intensity of the admitted
   networks does not increase linearly with the number of channels and the
   rate of increase of the intensity of the admitted networks decreases
   with the number of channels. By using graph theory, we obtain the
   minimum required number of channels to accommodate a certain intensity
   of coexisting networks under a self admission failure probability
   constraint. To this end, we design a superframe structure for the
   coexisting IEEE 802.15.4 networks and a method for time-domain
   interference alignment.}},

Abstract = {{Large flood events in recent years in the state of Wisconsin, USA raised
   a question of whether high precipitation events are on the rise. The
   objective of the research was to examine temporal and spatial patterns
   of extreme precipitation in Wisconsin during 1950-2006. The daily
   precipitation data used in the study were created by researchers at the
   University of Wisconsin-Madison using spatial interpolation of weather
   stations data across the state to a grid mesh with a spatial resolution
   of 8 km. For extreme precipitation indices, we calculated 99th, 95th,
   90th, 85th, and 80th percentiles of daily total precipitation (>1 mm) in
   a year and the number of days per year with daily precipitation
   exceeding 10 mm, 20 mm, and 50 mm. We also conducted the Mann-Kendall
   test for trend, examined how geographical heterogeneity varied over
   time, and built quantile regression models for annual summer
   precipitation. Main findings include the following: the temporal trend
   of extreme precipitation varied widely across the state; the highest
   percentile index showed an increasing trend over the largest area,
   whereas indices of less extreme precipitation tended to generally
   decrease; extreme precipitation tended to show more dispersed and skewed
   spatial patterns than annual total precipitation. Overall, indices
   related to frequency showed more similar spatial and temporal trends to
   total precipitation than magnitude indices.}},

   for Y. lipolytica cells cultured in nitrogen-limited media containing
   either pure glycerol or glycerol plus dextrose. Significantly greater
   amounts of TAGs were synthesized by Y. lipolytica cultured in minimal
   media compared to rich media (approximately 3-fold on dry weight basis
   when grown on glycerol). Cultures in minimal medium containing glycerol
   yielded 31\% TAGs on a dry cell weight (dcw) basis, while cultures in
   minimal medium containing glycerol plus dextrose produced 38\% TAGs
   (dcw), with glycerol consumption favored over dextrose consumption. Our
   results suggest that Y. lipolytica could serve as a source of TAGs for
   biodiesel production using crude waste glycerol generated by biodiesel

   its complex pathology. In this study, we validated a quantitative
   approach for assessing atherosclerosis progression in a rabbit model
   using a numerical matrix, optical index for plaque burden, derived
   directly from the nonlinear optical microscopic images captured on the
   atherosclerosis-affected blood vessel. A positive correlation between
   this optical index and the severity of atherosclerotic lesions,
   represented by the age of the rabbits, was established based on data
   collected from 21 myocardial infarction-prone Watanabe heritable
   hyperlipidemic rabbits with age ranging between new-born and 27 months
   old. The same optical index also accurately identified high-risk
   locations for atherosclerotic plaque formation along the entire aorta,
   which was validated by immunohistochemical fluorescence imaging.}},

Abstract = {{While annotation of the genome sequence of Clostridium thermocellum has
   allowed predictions of pathways catabolizing cellobiose to end products,
   ambiguities have persisted with respect to the role of various proteins
   involved in electron transfer reactions. A combination of growth studies
   modulating carbon and electron flow and multiple reaction monitoring
   (MRM) mass spectrometry measurements of proteins involved in central
   metabolism and electron transfer was used to determine the key enzymes
   involved in channeling electrons toward fermentation end products.
   Specifically, peptides belonging to subunits of ferredoxin-dependent
   hydrogenase and NADH: ferredoxin oxidoreductase (NFOR) were low or below
   MRM detection limits when compared to most central metabolic proteins
   measured. The significant increase in H-2 versus ethanol synthesis in
   response to either co-metabolism of pyruvate and cellobiose or
   hypophosphite mediated pyruvate: formate lyase inhibition, in
   conjunction with low levels of ferredoxin-dependent hydrogenase and
   NFOR, suggest that highly expressed putative bifurcating hydrogenases
   play a substantial role in reoxidizing both reduced ferredoxin and NADH
   simultaneously. However, product balances also suggest that some of the
   additional reduced ferredoxin generated through increased flux through
   pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase must be ultimately converted into
   NAD(P)H either directly via NADH-dependent reduced ferredoxin: NADP(+)
   oxidoreductase (NfnAB) or indirectly via NADPH-dependent hydrogenase.
   While inhibition of hydrogenases with carbon monoxide decreased H-2
   production 6-fold and redirected flux from pyruvate: ferredoxin
   oxidoreductase to pyruvate: formate lyase, the decrease in CO2 was only
   20 \% of that of the decrease in H-2, further suggesting that an
   alternative redox system coupling ferredoxin and NAD(P)H is active in C.

Abstract = {{Stress-assisted grain boundary motion is among the most studied modes of
   microstructural evolution in crystalline materials. In this study,
   molecular dynamics simulations were used to systematically investigate
   the influences of triple junctions on the stress-assisted motion of
   symmetric tilt grain boundaries in Cu by considering a honeycomb
   nanocrystalline model. It was found that the grain boundary motion in
   nanocrystalline models was highly sensitive to the loading mode, and a
   strong coupling effect which was prevalent in bicrystal models was only
   observed when simple shear was applied. In addition, the coupling factor
   extracted from the honeycomb model was found to be larger and more
   sensitive to temperature change than that from bicrystal models for the
   same type of grain boundary under the same loading conditions.
   Furthermore, the triple junctions seemed to exhibit unusual asymmetric
   pinning effects to the migrating grain boundary and the constraints by
   the triple junctions and neighboring grains led to remarkable non-linear
   grain boundary motion in directions both parallel and normal to the
   applied shear, which was in stark contrast to that observed in bicrystal
   models. In addition, dislocation nucleation and propagation, which were
   absent in the bicrystal model, were found to play an important role on
   shear-induced grain boundary motion when triple junctions were present.
   In the end, a generalized model for shear-assisted grain boundary motion
   was proposed based on the findings from this research.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{``Soil stepping{''} is a problem resulting from the accumulation of soil
   on top of seeds as the result of the excessive soil thrown by adjacent
   openers. The objective of this study was to characterise soil stepping
   associated with three different seed openers (hoe, winged hoe, and
   spoon) when operated at target depths of 25 and 50 mm in an indoor soil
   bin with a sandy loam soil (70 g kg(-1) sand, 16 g kg(-1) silt, and 14 g
   kg(-1) clay). Soil surface roughness, furrow cross-section, soil throw
   width, draft force, and vertical force were measured in a soil condition
   that had an average penetration resistance of 209 kPa, an average bulk
   density of 1184 kg m(-3), and an average soil moisture content of
   25.8\%. Soil disturbance characteristics and force requirements
   increased with the working depth of opener. Averaged for both working
   depths, the spoon opener created the largest furrow width (113 mm) and
   had the greatest soil throw (450 mm). For the controlled soil condition
   in which the evaluations were conducted, the critical spacing was 219,
   255, and 285 mm for the hoe, winged hoe, and spoon opener, respectively.
   These results demonstrated that different openers caused different
   extents of soil stepping, and the hoe opener was least susceptible to
   soil stepping. Considering both soil stepping and draft force
   requirement, the hoe opener showed better performance than the winged
   hoe and spoon openers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) hydrogel was a widely used
   carrier in therapeutic agent delivery. However, its bioactivities for
   encapsulated cells were not satisfactory. In the study, we aimed to
   determine whether modification with single-wall carbon nanotubes
   (SWCNTs) could improve the bioactivitis, especially supportive adhesion
   of PNIPAAm to encapsulated cells and favor their efficacy in myocardial
   repair. A thermosensitive SWCNTs-modified PNIPAAm hydrogel
   (PNIPAAm/SWCNTs) were prepared by incorporating the SWCNTs into base
   PNIPAAm hydrogel. The bioactivities of the resulted hydrogel to brown
   adipose-derived stem cells (BASCs) were evaluated and compared with the
   base PNIPAAm hydrpgel in vitro. Then, the PNIPAAm-containing hydrogel
   was used as carrier for imtromyocardial delivery of BASCs in rats with
   myocardial infarction. The efficacy of PNIPAAm/SWCNTs hydrogel in stem
   cell-based myocardial repair was systematically evaluated. In vitro
   study showed that the PNIPAAm/SWCNTs hydrogel demonstrated significantly
   higher bioactivities to encapsulated BASCs compared with onefold PNIPAAm
   hydrogel, including promoting cell adhesion and proliferation. When used
   as carrier for intramyocardial delivery of BASCs after myocardial
   infarction, the PNIPAAm/SWCNTs hydrogel significantly enhanced the
   engraftment of seeding cells in infarct myocardium and augmented their
   therapeutic efficacies in myocardial infarction (MI). The data provided
   a supportive evidence for the myocardial application of the
   SWCNTs-modified hydrogel and offered a new perspective in development or
   improvement of cardiac tissue engineering scaffold. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The feasibility of molecular separation with carbon nanotubes is studied
   by investigating a separation of water molecules and lead nanoparticles
   with a carbon nanotube-based nanopore system from molecular dynamics
   simulations. The nanopore system is comprised of a single-walled carbon
   nanotube and two graphene sheets placed at two ends of the nanotube. The
   nanotube is subjected to impact loads on a local portion on the wall to
   generate the propagation of impulse waves in the tube for pumping the
   encapsulated water molecules out of the tube, while blocking lead
   nanoparticles by the two graphenes. Studies indicate that the separation
   is a result of van der Waals interactions between the nanotube and the
   encapsulated molecules through the propagation of impulse waves in the
   nanotube. The efficiency of the molecular separation is found to be
   dependent on the amount of impact loads and the size of the impacted
   portion of the tube. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

   in purely conductive media}},
Journal = {{GEOTHERMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{9-30}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the depth dependence of the ground temperature
   response to heating by a deep vertical borehole ground heat exchanger by
   comparing experimental results to various models of ground heat
   exchange. The results of this analysis show that the specific heat
   exchange rate per unit-depth of borehole can vary with depth, including
   within individual strata. This explained the experimental results which
   showed that the ground temperature response varied significantly with
   depth. The analysis also showed that the specific heat exchange rate can
   vary in time, in addition to depth, such that the total heat transfer
   rate (specific heat exchange rate integrated over the entire borehole)
   remains constant in time. This property of the refined model explained
   anomalous results in the lower portions of the depth which we show that
   other models could not explain. We believe this is a new area of
   research because models of transient ground heat exchanger output
   typically consider bulk effects resulting from load variation (e.g.
   Bernier, 2001; Deerman and Kavanaugh, 1991) or the short-term effects of
   thermal storage and transmission within the grout itself (e.g. Claesson
   and Eskilson, 1988). Perhaps future studies will find ways of using the
   stratification of ground heat exchanger output in an advantageous way.
   Alternately, consideration of these effects may improve the modelling of
   ground heat exchanger systems. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, impurity segregation and solute drag effects on grain
   boundary (GB) motion were investigated in a binary Al-Ni model system
   with an inclined Sigma 5 GB by direct molecular dynamics simulations. By
   extending the interface random walk method to impure systems, it was
   found that the GB mobility was significantly influenced by the
   segregated impurities, which generally decreased as the impurity
   concentration increased. Moreover, based on simulations at different
   temperatures and impurity concentrations, we validated that the solute
   drag effects can be well modeled by the theory proposed by Cahn, Lucke,
   and Stuwe (CLS model) more than 50 years ago, provided that proper
   adaptations were made. In particular, we found that in strongly
   segregated GB system, the boundary mobility was deeply correlated to the
   impurity diffusivity in the direction perpendicular to the boundary
   plane in the frame of the moving boundary, instead of the impurity bulk
   diffusivity assumed in the original CLS model and many past studies.}},

Abstract = {{The ubiquitous nature of Bluetooth equipped devices has made it
   opportunistic to scavenge information that can be repurposed for
   applications other than initially intended. One such opportunity is in
   vehicular traffic monitoring, whereby sampling of Bluetooth radios serve
   as proxies for vehicles and consequently for traffic density and flow.
   This paper discusses a complete data collection system developed at the
   University of Manitoba that utilizes a variety of wireless networking
   technologies and devices to collect inferred traffic data at an
   intersection along a major thoroughfare in an urban setting.
   Specifically, a wireless sensor network of slave probes was designed and
   implemented with the objective to collect Bluetooth device information
   for this purpose. To facilitate easy setup and a long battery life, a
   solar-powered probe design was investigated. Data from each slave probe
   is communicated to a master node through XBee communication, where it is
   stored on a secure digital (SD) memory card before being transmitted to
   a central server every five minutes over a global system for mobile
   communications (GSM) cellular network. The server parses the data
   received and stores it in a database. Consumer and corporate websites
   may then access this database to display archived data or current data
   in real-time to various users.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports an experimental study on the effect of the fuel
   nozzle orifice geometry on the stability of turbulent non-premixed
   methane flame. Different internal geometries (orifice equivalent
   diameter, length to diameter ratio and contraction angle) of a circular
   and a rectangular nozzle with an aspect ratio of 2 were examined. The
   strength of the co-airflow was also varied to assess its impact on the
   jet flame stability. The experimental data revealed that the level of
   turbulence in the jet near-field is, in general, higher for the
   rectangular nozzle in comparison with the circular nozzle. This high
   level of turbulence was found to accelerate the liftoff transition of
   the attached flame. The results revealed also that there is a clear
   interplay between the flame liftoff height and the jet flow
   characteristics. That is, a rectangular jet, which spreads faster along
   the minor axis and generates higher near-field turbulence, results in a
   flame base sitting closer to the nozzle exit in comparison with that of
   its circular nozzle counterpart. Finally, the presence of a moderate
   co-airflow resulted in a higher flame liftoff velocity and height. It
   also led to the appearance of a hysteresis phenomenon in the low jet
   velocity range regardless of the exit orifice shape of the fuel nozzle.}},

Abstract = {{The Canadian highway bridge design code provides dimensions and
   reinforcement detailing of concrete bridge barriers reinforced with

   is to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of available techniques to
   repair damaged GFRP-RC bridge barriers. To fulfill this objective, three
   full-scale, 6.0-m-long, PL-2 concrete bridge barriers, totally
   reinforced with GFRP bars, were constructed and tested under an
   equivalent static load, simulating a vehicle crash test. Two different
   repair techniques, planting and near-surface-mounted (NSM)
   fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars, were used to repair the damaged
   barriers. Repaired barriers were retested under similar conditions to
   evaluate the effectiveness of the repair techniques. It is concluded
   that the repaired GFRP-RC bridge barriers achieved similar capacities to

Abstract = {{The wear performance of two types of crosslinked polyethylene (Marathon
   (TM) and XLIC (TM), DePuy Synthes Inc., Warsaw, IN) was evaluated in a
   pin-on-disc wear tester, a hip wear simulator, and a knee wear
   simulator. Sodium azide was used as the microbial inhibitor in the calf
   serum-based lubricant. In the pin-on-disc wear tester, the Marathon wear
   rate of 5.33 +/- 0.54 mm(3)/Mc was significantly lower (p=0.002) than
   the wear rate of 6.43 +/- 0.60 mm(3)/Mc for XLK. Inversely, the Marathon
   wear rate of 15.07 +/- 1.03 mm(3)/Mc from the hip wear simulator was
   2.2-times greater than the XLK wear rate of 6.71 +/- 1.03 mm(3)/Mc from
   the knee wear simulator. Differences in implant design, conformity, GUR
   type, and kinematic test conditions were suggested to account for the
   difference between the wear rates generated in the different types of
   wear testing apparati. In all wear tests, sodium azide was ineffective
   at inhibiting microbial growth in the lubricant. Eight different
   organisms were identified in the lubricant samples from the wear tests,
   which suggested the necessity of using an alternative, more effective
   microbial inhibitor. Careful sample preparation and thorough cleaning
   has shown to improve the consistency of the wear results. The wear rates
   generated in the hip and knee wear simulators closely reflected the wear
   behaviour of Marathon and XLK reported in published data that were
   tested under similar conditions. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by

Abstract = {{Inhomogeneous plastic deformation at high strain rates and large strains
   results in the concentration of deformation and strain localization in
   adiabatic shear bands (ASBs). In the current study, AISI 4340 steel
   specimens were impacted at increasing strain rates/strains (impact
   momentums) to capture the formation of adiabatic shear bands. Advanced
   specimen preparation techniques using Focused Ion Beam (FIB) and
   extensive electron microscopy were used to identify the sequence of
   evolution of the shear bands. It was observed that the structure of the
   shear bands that evolve after strain localization starts out with
   elongation of the grains due to grain reorientation in the shear
   direction with the initiation of random and transverse dislocation
   boundaries along the elongated grains. For higher strain rates/strains
   during impact, the elongated grains break along the initiated
   dislocation boundaries resulting in the creation of smaller elongated
   broken grains and nanograins. Boundary refinement of the broken grains
   occurring through grain rotation and adiabatic heating results in the
   evolution of refined grains, subgrains and nanograins. The presence of
   elongated grains, broken grains, refined grains, subgrains and
   nanograins within the shear band structures demonstrates that the local
   deformation is inhomogeneous and that these mechanisms occur
   concurrently. It is concluded that the evolution of the shear band
   structure can be considered as a simultaneous layering of
   microstructures initially driven by dislocations which produce the final
   structures observed in the shear bands. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Genome features of Pseudomonas putida LS46, a novel polyhydroxyalkanoate
   producer and its comparison with other P-putida strains}},
Journal = {{AMB EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAY 22}},
Abstract = {{A novel strain of Pseudomonas putida LS46 was isolated from wastewater
   on the basis of its ability to synthesize medium chain-length
   polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHAs). P.putida LS46 was differentiated from
   other P.putida strains on the basis of cpn60 (UT). The complete genome
   of P.putida LS46 was sequenced and annotated. Its chromosome is
   5,86,2556 bp in size with GC ratio of 61.69. It is encoding 5316 genes,
   including 7 rRNA genes and 76 tRNA genes. Nucleotide sequence data of
   the complete P.putida LS46 genome was compared with nine other P. putida
   strains (KT2440, F1, BIRD-1, S16, ND6, DOT-T1E, UW4, W619 and GB-1)
   identified either as biocontrol agents or as bioremediation agents and
   isolated from different geographical region and different environment.
   BLASTn analysis of whole genome sequences of the ten P. putida strains
   revealed nucleotide sequence identities of 86.54 to 97.52\%. P. putida
   genome arrangement was LS46 highly similar to P. putida BIRD1 and P.
   putida ND6 but was markedly different than P. putida DOT-T1E, P. putida
   UW4 and P. putida W619. Fatty acid biosynthesis (fab), fatty acid
   degradation (fad) and PHA synthesis genes were highly conserved among
   biocontrol and bioremediation P. putida strains. Six genes in pha operon
   of P.putida LS46 showed >98\% homology at gene and proteins level. It
   appears that polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthesis is an intrinsic
   property of P. putida and was not affected by its geographic origin.
   However, all strains, including P.putida LS46, were different from one
   another on the basis of house keeping genes, and presence of plasmid,
   prophages, insertion sequence elements and genomic islands. While
   P.putida LS46 was not selected for plant growth promotion or
   bioremediation capacity, its genome also encoded genes for root
   colonization, pyoverdine synthesis, oxidative stress (present in other
   soil isolates), degradation of aromatic compounds, heavy metal
   resistance and nicotinic acid degradation, manganese (Mn II) oxidation.
   Genes for toluene or naphthalene degradation found in the genomes of P.
   putida F1, DOT-T1E, and ND6 were absent in the P.putida LS46 genome.
   Heavy metal resistant genes encoded by the P. putida W619 genome were
   also not present in the P.putida LS46 genome. Despite the overall
   similarity among genome of P. putida strains isolated for different
   applications and from different geographical location a number of
   differences were observed in genome arrangement, occurrence of
   transposon, genomic islands and prophage. It appears that P. putida
   strains had a common ancestor and by acquiring some specific genes by
   horizontal gene transfer it differed from other related strains.}},

Abstract = {{Subsurface drainage is used for removing excess water from agricultural
   lands to improve productivity, although it can cause water quality
   problems downstream. Agricultural drainage is identified as one of the
   contributing factors to Lake Winnipeg's nutrient enrichment and
   subsequent water quality deterioration. It has been suggested that
   controlled drainage in the Lake Winnipeg watershed could be a potential
   best management practice (BMP). The objective of the study was to
   evaluate the flow and nutrient export through subsurface drainage by
   comparing free drainage with overhead irrigation (FDIR) and controlled
   drainage with subirrigation (CDSI) under potato crop. The experiment was
   carried out in southern Manitoba in a potato field with sandy loam soil
   using the same irrigation water source. Subsurface drainage was
   installed in 2009 at an average design depth of 0.9 m. Controlled
   drainage was accomplished by using drainage control structures at
   drainage outlets. Subirrigation was carried out by pumping water back
   through the subsurface drainage network. Drainage flow, nutrient export,
   and weather parameters were monitored during the growing seasons of 2010
   and 2011. On average, controlled drainage reduced the flow volume by
   91\% in 2010 and 54\% in 2011 compared to free drainage. The drainage
   volume from FDIR plots ranged from 13\% to 53\% of the rainfall
   received, while for CDSI plots it varied from 0\% to 8\%. In both years,
   average nitrate concentrations were lower in CDSI compared to FDIR
   plots. However, average phosphate concentrations were lower in 2010 and
   higher in 2011 under CDSI compared to FDIR. Compared to FDIR plots,
   average nitrate-N export from CDSI plots was reduced by 98\% in 2010 and
   67\% in 2011. Average phosphate export was reduced by 94\% in 2010;
   however, in 2011, it was 15\% higher than FDIR. The majority of the
   export happened during the period dominated by heavy drainage outflow,
   which coincided with spring snowmelt. The nutrient export reduction by
   CDSI is attributed mainly to the drainage volume reduction by controlled
   drainage.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted on the two-phase pressure drop through a
   horizontal, equal-sided, sharp-edged, combining tee junction of diameter
   37.8 mm with air-water mixtures at a nominal absolute pressure of 150
   kPa. The new experimental data were used to assess the performance of
   existing models and to develop a new empirical model for the
   pressure-drop prediction. The experiments were conducted in a new
   facility with 41 pressure taps distributed over the three legs of the
   tee to provide accurate measurements of the pressure drop. The test
   matrix covered wide ranges of mixture qualities on the three sides of
   the junction and of distributions of liquid and gas flows between the
   two inlets. It is shown that previous modelling methods are not capable
   of consistent prediction of the data and a new empirical model is
   proposed based on the present data and using a new approach in
   formulating the irreversible component of the pressure drop. The new
   model produced excellent agreement with the data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

   HF (10.91 mM), and HH (4.72 mM). End-product yields were dependent on
   the intrinsic cellulosic content as well as the presence of other
   polymers present in substrate biomass. Rates of ethanol and hydrogen
   production were similar in early log phase but varied in mid-log, and
   accessibility to cellulose was shown to determine yield and metabolic
   flux distribution. Our data suggest that improving the accessibility of
   the cellulolytic bacterium, C. thermocellum, to cellulose fibres has a
   greater effect on increasing the yield of fermentation products than
   simply increasing the concentration of cellulose in the substrate. (C)

Abstract = {{The use of a single, non-dispersive ultrasonic guided wave mode is one
   important approach to monitoring a structure's health. It is
   advantageously non-destructive with the ability of propagating over tens
   of metres to detect a hidden defect. The dimensional assessment of a
   defect, on the other hand, requires reflection coefficients for two or
   more such modes. Multiple modes may be excited simultaneously by
   applying a short pulse to a structure's external surface. This situation
   is examined here for a circular, hollow and homogeneous, isotropic pipe
   having negligible damping and an open rectangular notch. A finite
   element model is employed in a region around a notch. It is coupled to a
   wave function expansion in the two adjacent, effectively, semi-infinite
   pipes. Representative longitudinal and flexural modes are investigated
   for different notch dimensions. A nonaxisymmetric notch, unlike an
   axisymmetric notch, introduces a plethora of cross modal couplings that
   lead to more singularities in a reflection coefficient's frequency
   dependence. There is, however, a common pattern to these distinctive
   singularities. It is conjectured that singularities corresponding to
   propagating modes may enable a notch to be detected and its dimensions
   determined.}},

Journal = {{BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{56-66}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{It has long been recognised that soil seed contact is vital to seed
   germination, as good soil-seed contact promotes water transfer from soil
   to seed. However, until today, it has not been possible to quantify
   soil-seed contact, due to the non-homogeneous nature of agricultural
   soil. This study has made a significant step in advancing the field
   through modelling the soil-seed regime using the Discrete Element Method
   (DEM). In the soil-seed model, the seed was simplified as a spherical
   particle, and agricultural soil was represented by an assembly of
   completely random individual spherical particles exhibiting cohesive and
   frictional behaviours. Seed placement was simulated in a fashion similar
   to the field planting process. Model results showed that the number of
   active contacts between a seed and soil particles varied from 0 to 33,
   and the contact area varied from 0 to 41 mm(2), depending on the size
   and properties of the seed and soil particles. The greatest contact area
   was observed when the size ratio of soil to seed is 1.33 or 1.75. Higher
   soil particle stiffness resulted in a reduced number of contacts and
   smaller contact area. Simulations of press wheel effects in the model
   showed that when soil is compacted, both number of contacts and contact
   area are significantly increased. (C) 2014 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The challenges in the development of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV)
   powertrains are efficient energy management and optimum energy storage,
   for which the role of driving cycles that represent driver behaviour is
   instrumental. Discrepancies between standard driving cycles and real
   driving behaviour stem from insufficient data collection, inaccurate
   cycle construction methodology, and variations because of geography. In
   this study, we tackle the first issue by using the collected data from
   real-world driving of a fleet of 76 cars for more than one year in the
   city of Winnipeg (Canada), representing more than 44 million data
   points. The second issue is addressed by a proposed novel stochastic
   driving cycle construction method. The third issue limits the results to
   mainly Winnipeg and cities that have similar features, but the
   methodology can be used anywhere. The methodology develops the driving
   cycle using snippets extracted from recorded time-stamped speed of the
   vehicles from the collected database. The proposed Winnipeg Driving
   Cycle (WPG01) characteristics are compared to eight existing standard
   driving cycles and are more able to represent aggressive driving, which
   is critical in PEV design. An attempt is made to isolate how many
   differences could be attributed to the sample size and the methodology.
   The proposed construction methodology is flexible to be optimized for
   any selection of driving parameters and thus can be a recommended
   approach to develop driving cycles for any drive train topology,
   including internal combustion engine vehicles, hybrid vehicles, plug-in
   hybrid, and battery electric vehicles. Characterization of vehicle
   parking durations and types of parking (home, work, shopping), critical
   for duty cycles for PEV powertrains, are reported elsewhere. Here, the
   focus is on the mathematical approach to develop a drive cycle when a
   large database with high resolution of driving data is available.}},

Abstract = {{The unified fast Fourier transform (UFFT) methodology is proposed for
   fast method of moments analysis of dense integrated circuits embedded in
   layered media inside perfectly electric conducting or perfectly magnetic
   conducting enclosures of rectangular cross section. The pre-corrected
   fast Fourier transform (FFT) method is modified to handle the dyadic
   Green's function (DGF) of shielded layered media through factorization
   of the DGF into four convolution/correlation terms enabling fast matrix
   solve operations (MSOs). Calculation of the impedance matrix elements in
   the form of an infinite series of waveguide modes is cast into the form
   of a 2-D discrete Fourier transform allowing for fast FFT-accelerated
   matrix fill operations (MFOs). Fast FFT-enhanced MSOs and MFOs used in
   conjunction form the UFFT method. The computational complexity and
   memory requirements for the proposed UFFT solver scale as and,
   respectively, where is the number of unknowns in the discrete
   approximation of the governing integral equation. New criteria specific
   to shielded circuits for the projection of the current expansion
   functions on a uniform FFT grid are developed. The accuracy and
   efficiency of the solver is demonstrated through its application to
   multiple examples of full-wave analysis of large planar circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Biogas like other low calorific value fuels has a very narrow stable
   region when operating in diffusion flame mode owing to their low burning
   velocity in conjunction with the unburned flow high velocity. This paper
   presents an experimental study on the effect of the burner geometry on
   the stability limits of a turbulent non-premixed biogas flame. The main
   focus of the study is on the role of the low swirl strength of the
   co-airflow, and the fuel nozzle diameter. The results revealed that the
   swirl plays a dominant role on the flame mode (attached or lifted) as
   well as on its operating/stability limits. However, the results revealed
   that the swirl effect prevails only at relatively moderate to high
   co-airflow velocity. That is, the swirl does not have an apparent effect
   at weak co-airflow when the flame is attached. Whereas, it becomes
   dominant at relatively high co-airflow velocity where the attached flame
   lifts off and stabilizes at a distance above the burner. Correlations
   were proposed to describe the lifted biogas flame blowout limits. (C)

Abstract = {{A passive embeddable coupled coil sensor for remote bioprocess pH
   monitoring is described. The sensor is sterilizable, able to operate in
   a fluid medium, and small enough to fit inside a small bioreactor or
   test tube. It consists of a planar spiral inductor connected parallel to
   a varactor forming an LC resonant circuit. A pH combination electrode
   made of an iridium/iridium oxide sensing electrode and a silver/silver
   chloride reference electrode is connected parallel to the varactor. A
   potential difference change across the electrodes due to pH variation of
   the medium changes the voltage-dependent capacitance and shifts the
   resonant frequency of the sensor. An interrogator coil is inductively
   coupled to the sensor coil and remotely tracks the resonant frequency of
   the sensor. For in-fluid monitoring, the sensor is encapsulated in a
   manner that reduces the influence of the permittivity and conductivity
   of the medium. The sensor, calibrated over 2-12 pH range, exhibits a
   rapid response with 2.477-MHz/pH sensitivity. The sensor was used for
   remote pH monitoring of Yarrowia lipolytica and Saccharomyces cerevisiae
   fermentation in a shake flask over 63 and 25 h, respectively. The
   experiments demonstrate that the medium pH can be monitored repeatedly
   with an accuracy of 0.08 pH.}},

Abstract = {{Swallowing aspiration is known as the most clinically significant
   symptom of swallowing disorders (dysphagia). Noninvasive methods for
   detection of aspiration (the entry of food into airway due to dysphagia)
   are of great interest as they will lead to better management of
   dysphagia; thus, the risk of pneumonia, length of hospital stay and
   overall health care expenses can be reduced. The risk of aspiration is
   much higher in severely dysphagic patients. Normally, aspiration is
   detected by an imaging technique during swallowing, which is time
   consuming, costly and requires the patient's cooperation. In this study,
   we investigated the application of acoustical analysis of breathing and
   swallowing sounds for identifying patients at high risk of aspiration.
   We propose a novel method based on phase-space analysis of breathing
   sounds immediately after the swallow followed by support vector machine
   classification for use as a diagnostic aid for identifying patients with
   high risk of aspiration. We evaluated the method using breath and
   swallowing sounds recorded from 50 dysphagic individuals, 27 of which
   demonstrated silent aspiration (without cough or throat clearance)
   during either fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) or
   videofluoroscopic swallowing (VFS) assessment. The classification result
   of the proposed method was compared with those of the FEES/VFS

Title = {{Settling velocities of multifractal flocs formed in chemical coagulation
   process}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{53}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{A number of different flocculation mechanisms are involved in the
   formation of chemical coagulation flocs. Consequently, two flocs with
   the same size may have been formed by different mechanisms of
   aggregation and therefore have different arrangement of primary
   particles. As a result, two flocs with the same size may have different
   masses or mass distributions and therefore, different settling
   velocities. Although the correct estimation of the floc mass and density
   is critical for the development of the floc settling model, none of the
   suggested floc settling models incorporate the information on mass
   distribution and variable density of flocs. A probability-based method
   is used to determine the floc fractal dimensions on floc images. The
   results demonstrated that flocs formed in lime softening coagulation are
   multifractal. The multifractal spectra indicated the existence of a
   multiple fractal dimensions as opposed to the unique box-counting
   dimension which is a morphology-based fractal dimensions typically
   introduced into the Stokes' Law. These fractal dimensions may provide
   information on the flocs' aggregation mechanism, floc's structure, and
   the distribution of mass inside the floc. More research is required to
   investigate how to utilize the information obtained from the
   multifractal spectra to incorporate the variable floc density and
   nonhomogeneous mass distribution of flocs into the floc settling models.

Abstract = {{Reducing airborne microorganisms may potentially improve the environment
   in layer breeding houses. The effectiveness of slightly acidic
   electrolyzed water (SAEW; pH 5.29-6.30) in reducing airborne
   microorganisms was investigated in a commercial layer house in northern
   China. The building had a tunnel-ventilation system, with an evaporative
   cooling. The experimental area was divided into five zones along the
   length of the house, with zone 1 nearest to an evaporative cooling pad
   and zone 5 nearest to the fans. The air temperature, relative humidity,
   dust concentration, and microbial population were measured at the
   sampling points in the five zones during the study period. The SAEW was
   sprayed by workers in the whole house. A six-stage air microbial sampler
   was used to measure airborne microbial population. Results showed that
   the population of airborne bacteria and fungi were sharply reduced by
   0.71 x 10(5) and 2.82 x 10(3) colony-forming units (CFU) m(-3) after 30
   min exposure to SAEW, respectively. Compared with the benzalkonium
   chloride (BC) solution and povidone-iodine (PVP-I) solution treatments,
   the population reductions of airborne fungi treated by SAEW were
   significantly (P < 0.05) more, even though the three disinfectants can
   decrease both the airborne bacteria and fungi significantly (P < 0.05)
   30 min after spraying.
   Implications:
   There are no effective methods for reducing airborne microbial levels in
   tunnel-ventilated layer breeding houses; additionally, there is limited
   information available on airborne microorganism distribution. This
   research investigated the spatial distribution of microbial population,
   and the effectiveness of spraying slightly acidic electrolyzed water in
   reducing microbial levels. The research revealed that slightly acidic
   electrolyzed water spray was a potential method for reducing microbial
   presence in layer houses. The knowledge gained in this research about
   the microbial population variations in the building may assist producers
   in managing the bird housing environment and engineers in designing
   poultry houses.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a Monte Carlo-based simulator of optical coherence
   tomography (OCT) imaging for turbid media with arbitrary spatial
   distributions. This simulator allows computation of both Class I
   diffusive reflectance due to ballistic and quasiballistic scattered

   photons. It was implemented using a tetrahedron-based mesh and
   importance sampling to significantly reduce computational time. Our
   simulation results were verified by comparing them with results from two
   previously validated OCT simulators for multilayered media. We present
   simulation results for OCT imaging of a sphere inside a background slab,
   which would not have been possible with earlier simulators. We also
   discuss three important aspects of our simulator: (1) resolution, (2)
   accuracy, and (3) computation time. Our simulator could be used to study
   important OCT phenomena and to design OCT systems with improved
   performance. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons

Abstract = {{Current artificial tissue-substitutes have limited clinical applications
   due to unmatched complex combination of cells and extracellular matrix
   (ECM) as seen in native tissues. From a developmental perspective, the
   construction of effective biomimetic tissues is from the bottom
   (one-dimensional nanoparticles or two-dimensional membranes) up
   (three-dimensional scaffolds or more complex composite). In a
   hierarchical architecture, each sub-structure can be assembled in a
   flexible way with specific regulators and cells, which overcomes the
   deficiency of one-for-all scaffold. Here, a cell-compatible cell-lined
   layered nano-membrane is developed. Bioactive molecules are mounted on a
   nano-membrane and later released to its lined cell sheet. The cell-lined
   membrane is in a free-standing form to regulate cellular functions. The
   major advantage of this methodology is to provide a versatile approach

Abstract = {{Device-to-device (D2D) communication in cellular networks allows direct
   transmission between two cellular devices with local communication
   needs. Due to the increasing number of autonomous heterogeneous devices
   in future mobile networks, an efficient resource allocation scheme is
   required to maximize network throughput and achieve higher spectral
   efficiency. In this paper, performance of network-integrated D2D
   communication under channel uncertainties is investigated where D2D
   traffic is carried through relay nodes. Considering a multi-user and
   multi-relay network, we propose a robust distributed solution for
   resource allocation with a view to maximizing network sum-rate when the
   interference from other relay nodes and the link gains are uncertain. An
   optimization problem is formulated for allocating radio resources at the
   relays to maximize end-to-end rate as well as satisfy the
   quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for cellular and D2D user
   equipments under total power constraint. Each of the uncertain
   parameters is modeled by a bounded distance between its estimated and
   bounded values. We show that the robust problem is convex and a
   gradient-aided dual decomposition algorithm is applied to allocate radio
   resources in a distributed manner. Finally, to reduce the cost of
   robustness defined as the reduction of achievable sum-rate, we utilize
   the chance constraint approach to achieve a trade-off between robustness
   and optimality. The numerical results show that there is a distance
   threshold beyond which relay-aided D2D communication significantly
   improves network performance when compared to direct communication
   between D2D peers.}},

Abstract = {{Soybean (Glycine max L.) is a major oilseed crop grown throughout the
   world and, total post-harvest losses of soybean are approximately 10\%,
   and 3\% of produced soybean is lost during storage. Cowpea weevil
   (Callosobruchus maculatus (F.)) is the major storage pest which causes
   extensive storage losses of legumes. Detection of early stages of cowpea
   weevil infestation could assist farmers and storage facility managers in
   implementing suitable control practices for insect disinfestations. Soft
   X-ray and near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging techniques were used
   to acquire images of soybeans infested by egg, larval, and pupal stages
   of C. maculatus along with uninfested and completely damaged
   (hollowed-out after emergence of adults) soybeans. From soft X-ray
   images, totally, 33 features (12 histogram and 21 textural features)
   were extracted and from hyperspectral data 48 features were extracted
   (30 histogram and 18 spectral features) for analysis. Linear and
   quadratic discriminant analysis (LDA and QDA) models were developed
   using these extracted features to classify different stages of
   infestation. The LDA classifier for soft X-ray images correctly
   identified more than 86\% of uninfested soybeans and 83\% of soybeans
   infested with all developmental stages of C. maculatus except the egg
   stage. Pair-wise LDA classification models developed from NIR
   hyperspectral data yielded more than 86 and 87\% classification accuracy
   for uninfested and infested seeds, respectively. The QDA pair-wise
   classifiers positively differentiated more than 79\% uninfested seeds
   from infested seeds. The principal component analysis of NIR
   hyperspectral data identified the wavelengths of 960 nm, 1030 nm and
   1440 nm being responsible for more than 99\% of spectral variability.
   Combining soft X-ray features with hyperspectral features increased the
   classification accuracies for egg and larvae compared to either imaging
   system used alone. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Interstitial concentrations of CO2 and O-2 were measured to determine
   respiratory activities of microflora infecting stored canola, soybean,
   and wheat in different airtight storage times (1, 3 or 5 days) and at
   different moisture contents and temperatures (10, 15, 23, 25, 30, 35 and
   40 C). Canola seeds and ground canola with moisture contents (m.c. wet
   basis) of 8.0\%, 10.0\%, 12.0\%, 13.6\% and 14.0\%, soybean with 23.0\%
   m.c., and wheat with 20.3\% m.c. were used. There were significant
   differences in CO2 concentrations between 1-d airtight storage time and
   other airtight storage times except at 40 degrees C. The same moisture
   content canola at the same environmental condition but in different
   replicates accumulated different CO2 concentrations at 10 degrees C and
   40 degrees C but not at temperatures of 23 and 30 degrees C. Compared
   with the respiration of microflora, respiration by canola itself was
   negligible. There was no significant difference in concentration of CO2
   produced by microflora within different crops at 35 C, while there was
   significant difference at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Values of
   respiration quotients (RQ) were > 1 at almost any testing condition with
   few exceptions. Sum of CO2 and O-2 concentrations were close to
   21\%-22\% at most airtight storage times and within any crop. There was
   a strong positive relationship between the sum and RQ values. The sum
   might be used to identify whether stored grain had high level of spoiled
   spots with high moisture content. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {{The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) has proposed a Polar Communications and
   Weather (PCW) satellite mission, in conjunction with other partners. The
   PCW will provide essential communications and meteorological services to
   the Canadian Arctic, as well as space weather observations of in situ
   ionizing radiation along the orbit. The CSA has identified three
   potential Highly Elliptical Orbits (HEOs) for a PCW satellite
   constellation, Molniya, Modified Tundra and Triple Apogee (TAP), each
   having specific merits, which would directly benefit the
   performance/longevity of a PCW spacecraft. Radiation shielding
   effectiveness of various materials was studied for the three PCW orbit
   options to determine the feasibility of employing materials other than
   conventional aluminium to achieve a specified spacecraft shielding level
   with weight savings over aluminium. It was found that, depending on the
   orbit-specific radiation environment characteristics, the benefits of
   using polyethylene based materials is significant enough (e.g., 22\% in
   Molniya for PE at 50 krad TID) to merit further investigation. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation was conducted on the phase redistribution
   during air-water flow in horizontal impacting tee junctions. The main
   objective of the investigation was to examine the individual effects of
   pipe diameter and system pressure on the phase redistribution. The data
   correspond to a wide range of inlet conditions encompassing inlet flow
   regimes of stratified, wavy, and annular; the whole range of mass split
   ratios at the junction; pipe diameters of 13.5 and 37.8 mm; and two
   system pressures of 150 and 200 kPa (abs). The experiments have shown
   that the pipe diameter has a small effect on phase redistribution for
   the whole tested range. On the other hand, system pressure was found to
   have a significant effect on phase redistribution at small inlet
   velocities and this effect was found to decrease as the inlet velocities
   increased. The experimental data were compared with predictions from
   three analytical models. None of the three models succeeded in
   predicting these trends with consistency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{A ring piezoelectric energy harvester excited by magnetic forces}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{71-78}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A ring piezoelectric harvester excited by magnetic forces with high
   excitation frequencies is developed. The harvester is made of a
   concentric outer ring stator and an inner ring rotator. The stator ring
   is made of a series of discrete piezoelectric patches with a rectangular
   shape surface mounted by magnetic ring slabs with the same size. All the
   piezoelectric patches and the magnetic slabs are placed on an aluminum
   ring. The rotator ring is made of a serious of magnetic rectangular
   slabs mounted on an aluminum ring with the exact size of the
   corresponding piezoelectric patches on the stator. Because of periodic
   magnetic forces between the stator ring and the rotator ring, a
   compression is induced to the piezoelectric patches leading to an
   electric charge for energy harvesting. To describe the energy harvesting
   process, a mathematical model is used to calculate the output charge and
   voltage from the piezoelectric patches. The influences of the size of
   the piezoelectric harvester and the rotating speed of the rotator ring
   on the root mean square of the generated electric power are discussed.
   Our results show that a power up to 5274.8 W can be realized for a
   practical design of the harvester with a radius around 0.5 m. This
   research develops a novel technique for an efficient and practical
   energy harvesting from the developed ring piezoelectric energy
   harvesters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Passive dynamic walking is a gait developed, partially or in whole, by
   the energy provided by gravity. The research on passive dynamic bipedal
   walking helps create an understanding of walking mechanics. Moreover,
   the experimental passive dynamic research provides a base to compare and
   validate computer simulation results. An improved kneed bipedal walking
   mechanism was designed and built to study the passive gait patterns. The
   first aim of this study is to determine the equivalency of testing a
   passive dynamic biped walker on a treadmill to testing on a ramp. Based
   on the small difference between the gait patterns measured on the two
   test platforms, testing on a treadmill was found equivalent to testing
   on a ramp. Gait measurements were then conducted on the treadmill to
   evaluate the effects of the treadmill inclination angle, mass
   distribution of the biped, and the length of flat feet on the gait
   pattern. Results show that most of these parameters had significant
   effects on the step length, step period and hip velocity of the passive
   walker. Our experimental results are also compared with previous
   experimental results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Roles for NF-kappa B and Gene Targets of NF-kappa B in Synaptic

Journal = {{MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Although traditionally associated with immune function, the
   transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) has garnered
   much attention in recent years as an important regulator of memory.
   Specifically, research has found that NF-kappa B, localized in both
   neurons and glia, is activated during the induction of long-term
   potentiation (LTP), a paradigm of synaptic plasticity and correlate of
   memory. Further, experimental manipulation of NF-kappa B activation or
   its blockade results in altered memory and spatial navigation abilities.
   Genetic knockout of specific NF-kappa B subunits in mice results in
   memory alterations. Collectively, such data suggest that NF-kappa B may
   be a requirement for memory, although the direction of the response
   (i.e., memory enhancement or deficit) is inconsistent. A limited number
   of gene targets of NF-kappa B have been recently identified in neurons,
   including neurotrophic factors, calcium-regulating proteins, other
   transcription factors, and molecules associated with neuronal outgrowth
   and remodeling. In turn, several key molecules are activators of
   NF-kappa B, including protein kinase C and {[}Ca++](i). Thus, NF-kappa B
   signaling is complex and under the regulation of numerous proteins
   involved in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. The purpose of this
   review is to highlight the literature detailing a role for NF-kappa B in
   synaptic plasticity, memory, and spatial navigation. Secondly, this
   review will synthesize the research evaluating gene targets of NF-kappa
   B in synaptic plasticity and memory. Although there is ample evidence to
   suggest a critical role for NF-kappa B in memory, our understanding of
   its gene targets in neurons is limited and only beginning to be
   appreciated.}},

Title = {{Struvite precipitation and phosphorus removal using magnesium
   sacrificial anode}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{28-33}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Struvite precipitation using magnesium sacrificial anode as the only
   source of magnesium is presented. High-purity magnesium alloy cast anode
   was found to be very effective in recovery of high-quality struvite from
   water solutions and from supernatant of fermented waste activated sludge
   from a wastewater treatment plant that does not practice enhanced
   biological phosphorus removal. Struvite purity was strongly dependent on
   the pH and the electric current density. Optimum pH of the 24 mM
   phosphorus and 46 mM ammonia solution (1:1.9 P:N ratio) was in the broad
   range between 7.5 and 9.3, with struvite purity exceeding 90\%.
   Increasing the current density resulted in elevated struvite purity. No
   upper limits were observed in the studied current range of 0.05-0.2 A.
   Phosphorus removal rate was proportional to the current density and
   comparable for tests with water solutions and with the supernatant from
   fermented sludge. The highest P-removal rate achieved was 4.0 mg PO4-P
   cm(-2) h(-1) at electric current density of 45 A m(-2). Initial
   substrate concentrations affected the rate of phosphorus removal. The

Abstract = {{An experimental program was conducted at the University of Manitoba to
   test salvaged timber stringers posttensioned with external carbon
   fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) bars or steel guy cables. A total of 22
   creosote-treated Douglas-fir beams with dimensions of 130x330x4,500 mm
   were tested in three-point bending. Six beams out of the 22 were control
   beams without any reinforcement. The remaining 16 beams were
   posttensioned using different reinforcement configurations. Four beams
   were posttensioned with draped CFRP tendons (Group CD), four beams were
   posttensioned with straight CFRP tendons (Group C), four beams were
   posttensioned with draped steel cable (Group SD), and four beams were
   posttensioned with straight steel cable (Group S). The experimental
   results found that the strength and the stiffness for Group CD were
   increased on average by 70\% and 10\%, respectively, while the strength
   for Group C was increased on average by 56\% and showed no significant
   increase in stiffness. In contrast, the strength and the stiffness for
   Group SD were increased on average by 45\% and 4\%, respectively, while
   the strength for Group S was increased on average by 49\% and showed no

Abstract = {{This paper contributes to the scarce research available regarding the
   shear behavior of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) prestressed
   concrete beams. The beams were subjected to four-point bending and
   tested with different shear span to depth (a/d) ratios of 1.5, 2.5, and
   3.5, with and without transverse reinforcement. For each group of four
   beams, two were reinforced with minimum required glass fiber-reinforced
   polymer (GFRP) stirrups according to the Canadian highway bridge design
   code. The results showed that the flexural rigidity and the shear
   capacity of the beams increase significantly as the a/d ratio is reduced
   to 1.5 from 2.5. The data also showed that the minimum required GFRP
   stirrups are ineffective in beams with a/d=1.5 that are governed by arch
   action. The experimental results are compared to theoretical estimates

   simulate the discharge coefficient better than the regression model and
   always works better. Without considering the channel slope, both models

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the problem of scheduling a no-wait flow-shop
   system with sequence-dependent set-up times. As a result of having
   no-wait constraints, each operation of a job should start as soon as the
   previous operation is processed. In addition, sequence-dependent set-up
   times are considered for each operation. This means that the set-up time
   of an operation on a machine is dependent on the previous operation on
   the same machine. The considered performance measure is makespan. This
   problem is proven to be strongly NP-hard. In order to deal with the
   problem, an encoding system called Matrix Coding (MC) is used to code
   job sequences. The developed particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is
   applied on the encoded sequences for further exploration of the solution
   space. In order to evaluate the performance of the developed framework,
   a large number of benchmark problems are selected. Computational results
   confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms competitive methods, by
   improving many of the best-known solutions of the test problems.}},

Abstract = {{The use of structural insulated panels (SIPs) for wall and roof
   assemblies in residential and commercial buildings is a well-known
   construction technique. SIPs typically use a combination of either
   expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) or polyurethane foam (PUR) as the core
   material. The covering or skin is predominantly oriented strand board
   (OSB). The OSB is either bonded to the foam with adhesive in the case of
   EPS, while polyurethane is used to provide adhesion with PUR SIPs. This
   paper presents the results of research that investigated the use of
   industrial hemp mat used as a skin for soy-based polyurethane foam
   panels. A series of tests were conducted to investigate moisture
   resistance and flexural behaviour on hemp mat foam panels. Moisture
   absorption behaviour was evaluated on three specimen types: uncoated,
   earth plaster and tung oil treated hemp mat. The absorption coefficient
   A(w) was determined for all specimens. The tung oil treated specimens
   exhibited a water absorption coefficient that was 5.3\% of that for
   untreated hemp mat panel specimens. Flexural tests were conducted on dry
   specimens with earth-plastered hemp mat, tung oil coated hemp mat, OSB
   and, untreated hemp mat skins. Tung oil provided resistance to tension
   failure and increased capacity to withstand considerable deformation
   without tensile failure in flexural specimens. Compared with pure foam
   specimens, untreated hemp mat improved flexural performance by 16.3\%.}},

Abstract = {{Small cells such as femtocells overlaying the macrocells can enhance the
   coverage and capacity of cellular wireless networks and increase the
   spectrum efficiency by reusing the frequency spectrum assigned to the
   macrocells in a universal frequency reuse fashion. However, management
   of both the cross-tier and co-tier interferences is one of the most
   critical issues for such a two-tier cellular network. Centralized
   solutions for interference management in a two-tier cellular network
   with orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), which yield
   optimal/near-optimal performance, are impractical due to the
   computational complexity. Distributed solutions, on the other hand, lack
   the superiority of centralized schemes. In this paper, we propose a
   semi-distributed (hierarchical) interference management scheme based on
   joint clustering and resource allocation for femtocells. The problem is
   formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP). The solution is
   obtained by dividing the problem into two sub-problems, where the
   related tasks are shared between the femto gateway (FGW) and femtocells.
   The FGW is responsible for clustering, where correlation clustering is
   used as a method for femtocell grouping. In this context, a
   low-complexity approach for solving the clustering problem is used based
   on semi-definite programming (SDP). In addition, an algorithm is
   proposed to reduce the search range for the best cluster configuration.
   For a given cluster configuration, within each cluster, one femto access
   point (FAP) is elected as a cluster head (CH) that is responsible for
   resource allocation among the femtocells in that cluster. The CH
   performs subchannel and power allocation in two steps iteratively, where
   a low-complexity heuristic is proposed for the sub-channel allocation
   phase. Numerical results show the performance gains due to clustering in
   comparison to other related schemes. Also, the proposed correlation
   clustering scheme offers performance, which is close to that of the
   optimal clustering, with a lower complexity.}},

Abstract = {{A prototype islanding detection relay, which uses decision tree
   classifier to categorize the transient generating events as `islanding'
   or `non-islanding' was implemented and tested. It consisted of two basic
   stages of signal processing to extract the required feature vectors for
   the classification. The first stage involved signal filtering and in the
   second stage signals were processed by rectifying, summing, and lowpass
   filtering to get the energy content in the three phases during a
   selected time-frame. A simple radial medium voltage distribution system
   having a single distributed generator was simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC to
   obtain the transient waveforms, and the performance of the relay was
   tested with signals generated using an RTP real-time waveform playback
   instrument. The experimental results showed high accuracy in detecting
   islanding events within a response time of less than two cycles. The
   proposed relay can be implemented with a very low cost and is simple in
   construction. Therefore, this could be an acceptable low cost substitute
   for the expensive and complex transfer trip schemes, which are commonly
   in use with the distributed generation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers random access protocols with multipacket reception
   (MPR), which include both slotted-Aloha and slotted tau-persistent CSMA
   protocols. For both protocols, each node makes a transmission attempt in
   a slot with a given probability. The goals of this paper are to derive
   the optimal transmission probability maximizing a system throughput for
   both protocols and to develop a simple random access protocol with MPR,
   which achieves a system throughput close to the maximum value. To this
   end, we first obtain the optimal transmission probability of a node in
   the slotted-Aloha protocol. The result provides a useful guideline to
   help us develop a simple distributed algorithm for estimating the number
   of active nodes. We then obtain the optimal transmission probability in
   the tau-persistent CSMA protocol. An in-depth study on the relation
   between the optimal transmission probabilities in both protocols shows
   that under certain conditions the optimal transmission probability in
   the slotted-Aloha protocol is a good approximation for the
   tau-persistent CSMA protocol. Based on this result, we propose a simple
   tau-persistent CSMA protocol with MPR which dynamically adjusts the
   transmission probability tau depending on the estimated number of active
   nodes, and thus can achieve a system throughput close to the maximum
   value.}},

Abstract = {{In a two-tier heterogeneous network (HetNet) where femto access points
   (FAPs) with lower transmission power coexist with macro base stations
   (BSs) with higher transmission power, the FAPs may suffer significant
   performance degradation due to inter-tier interference. Introducing
   cognition into the FAPs through the spectrum sensing (or carrier
   sensing) capability helps them avoiding severe interference from the
   macro BSs and enhance their performance. In this paper, we use
   stochastic geometry to model and analyze performance of HetNets composed
   of macro BSs and cognitive FAPs in a multichannel environment. The
   proposed model explicitly accounts for the spatial distribution of the
   macro BSs, FAPs, and users in a Rayleigh fading environment. We quantify
   the performance gain in outage probability obtained by introducing
   cognition into the femto-tier, provide design guidelines, and show the
   existence of an optimal spectrum sensing threshold for the cognitive
   FAPs, which depends on the HetNet parameters. We also show that looking
   into the overall performance of the HetNets is quite misleading in the
   scenarios where the majority of users are served by the macro BSs.
   Therefore, the performance of femto-tier needs to be explicitly
   accounted for and optimized.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Fractional frequency reuse (FFR) has emerged as a viable solution to
   coordinate and mitigate cochannel interference (CCI) in orthogonal
   frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA)-based wireless cellular
   networks. The incurred CCI in cellular networks with FFR is highly
   uncertain and varies as a function of various design parameters that
   include the user scheduling schemes, the transmit power distribution
   among multiple allocated subcarriers, the partitioning of the cellular
   region into cell-edge and cell-center zones, the allocation of spectrum
   within each zone, and the channel reuse factors. To this end, this paper
   derives a generic analytical model for uplink CCI in multicarrier OFDMA
   networks with FFR. The derived expressions capture several network
   design parameters and are applicable to any composite fading-channel
   models. The accuracy of the derivations is verified via Monte Carlo
   simulations. Moreover, their usefulness is demonstrated by obtaining
   closed-form expressions for the Rayleigh fading-channel model and by
   evaluating important network performance metrics such as ergodic
   capacity. Numerical results provide useful system design guidelines and
   highlight the trade-offs associated with the deployment of FFR schemes
   in OFDMA-based networks.}},

Abstract = {{Growth, end-product synthesis, enzyme activities, and transcription of
   select genes associated with the ``malate shunt,{''} pyruvate
   catabolism, H-2 synthesis, and ethanol production were studied in the
   cellulolytic anaerobe, Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405, during
   open-batch fermentation of cellobiose to determine the effect of
   elevated N-2 and H-2 gas sparging on metabolism using a 14-L fermenter
   with a 7-L working volume. The metabolic shift from acetate, H-2, and
   CO2 to ethanol and formate in response to high H-2 versus high N-2
   sparging (20 mL s(-1)) was accompanied by (a) a 2-fold increase in
   nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase
   (Adh) activity, (b) a 10-fold increase in adhE transcription, and (c) a
   3-fold decrease in adhZ transcription. A similar, but less pronounced,
   metabolic shift was also observed when the rate of N-2 sparging was
   decreased from 20 to 2 mL s(-1), during which (a) NADH-dependent ADH and
   pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) activities increased by
   similar to 1.5-fold, (b) adhY transcription increased 6-fold, and (c)
   transcription of selected pfor genes increased 2-fold. Here we
   demonstrate that transcription of genes involved in ethanol metabolism
   is tightly regulated in response to gas sparging. We discuss the
   potential impacts of dissolved H-2 on electron carrier (NADH, NADPH,
   ferredoxin) oxidation and how these electron carriers can redirect
   carbon and electron flux and regulate adhE transcription.}},

Abstract = {{A novel capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer is designed and
   fabricated. This transducer employs a stack of two deflectable membranes
   suspended over a fixed bottom electrode. In this configuration, the two
   moving membranes deflect simultaneously in response to a bias voltage,
   which results in a smaller effective cavity height compared with the
   conventional capacitive transducers. Electromechanical and acoustic
   analyses are conducted to investigate the transducer properties. A set
   of seven transducers with radii ranging from 30 to 55 mu m were
   fabricated utilizing a sacrificial microelectromechanical system
   fabrication technology. Electrical measurements were performed and were
   compared with results from physical deflection measurements utilizing an
   optical vibrometer system. The results have been compared with
   analytical models as well as characterization of a set of five
   conventional, single membrane, transducers fabricated with the same
   technology. These experiments indicate a good agreement between the
   model and measured data. A larger membrane deflection and smaller cavity
   height are achieved from the double membrane devices. Therefore, this
   type of device may enhance the transducer acoustic power generation
   capability as well as increasing its sensitivity both of which result
   from the reduction in the transducer effective cavity height.}},

Abstract = {{Thermoanaerobacter spp. have long been considered suitable Clostridium
   thermocellum coculture partners for improving lignocellulosic biofuel
   production through consolidated bioprocessing. However, studies using
   ``omic{''}-based profiling to better understand carbon utilization and
   biofuel producing pathways have been limited to only a few strains thus
   far. To better characterize carbon and electron flux pathways in the
   recently isolated, xylanolytic strain, Thermoanaerobacter
   thermohydrosulfuricus WC1, label-free quantitative proteomic analyses
   were combined with metabolic profiling. SWATH-MS proteomic analysis
   quantified 832 proteins in each of six proteomes isolated from
   mid-exponential-phase cells grown on xylose, cellobiose, or a mixture of
   both. Despite encoding genes consistent with a carbon catabolite
   repression network observed in other Gram-positive organisms,
   simultaneous consumption of both substrates was observed. Lactate was
   the major end product of fermentation under all conditions despite the
   high expression of gene products involved with ethanol and/or acetate
   synthesis, suggesting that carbon flux in this strain may be controlled
   via metabolite-based (allosteric) regulation or is constrained by
   metabolic bottlenecks. Cross-species ``omic{''} comparative analyses
   confirmed similar expression patterns for end-product-forming gene
   products across diverse Thermoanaerobacter spp. It also identified
   differences in cofactor metabolism, which potentially contribute to
   differences in end-product distribution patterns between the strains
   analyzed. The analyses presented here improve our understanding of T.
   thermohydrosulfuricus WC1 metabolism and identify important
   physiological limitations to be addressed in its development as a
   biotechnologically relevant strain in ethanologenic designer cocultures
   through consolidated bioprocessing.}},

Abstract = {{Entropy generation during laminar fully-developed flow in parallel-plate
   micro-channels with an imposed pressure gradient and a uniform wall heat
   flux has been investigated taking into consideration the effects of an
   EDL at the solid fluid interfaces and viscous dissipation due to
   internal fluid friction. The rates of local volumetric and total entropy
   generation per unit channel volume due to heat transfer and viscous
   dissipation were calculated using analytical expressions for the
   velocity and temperature profiles. Comparing results from expressions
   using the local-temperature formulation to others using a
   reference-temperature formulation have shown that the latter is not
   accurate for low Brinkman number or small channel sizes. Effects of
   Brinkman number, Peclet number, channel size, and zeta-potential on the
   rate of entropy production are presented and discussed. Entropy
   production due to heat transfer reaches a maximum, while entropy
   production due to viscous dissipation and the ratio of pumping power to
   heat transfer reach a minimum within a specific range of zeta-potential.
   These trends were attributed to the effects of EDL on the velocity and
   temperature profiles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A focused study on the C-band polarimetric scattering and physical
   characteristics of frost-flower-covered sea ice was conducted at the
   Sea-Ice Environmental Research Facility over a three day period. Sea ice
   was grown in an outdoor pool outfitted with automated sensors to monitor
   environmental conditions. C-band polarimetric scattering measurements
   were conducted continuously at a range of incidence angles, and surface
   roughness statistics were obtained at discrete times using a laser
   scanner system LiDAR. Four stages of development were identified that
   exhibited notably different physical and scattering characteristics: 1)
   initial formation; 2) surface brine expulsion; 3) frost flower growth;
   and 4) decimation. An optimal polarization and incidence angle is not
   readily apparent for the purposes of identifying the frost flower
   development Stages I-III; however, the lower incidence angles (25
   degrees and 35 degrees) appear to be most sensitive to the surface brine
   expulsion. Only the dual-polarization measurements at low incidence
   angles (e. g., 25 degrees) could be used to identify the onset of the
   decimation stage. Backscatter increased rapidly during the initial
   formation, with a local maximum corresponding to similar to 80\% areal
   coverage of frost flowers, followed by a local minimum when the surface
   was covered by a brine-rich surface layer, connoting that surface brine
   expulsion may be identified using polarimetric scatterometry.}},

Abstract = {{A sea wave energy harvester from the longitudinal wave motion of water
   particles is developed. The harvester consisting of a cantilever
   substrate attached by piezoelectric patches and a proof mass is used to
   collect electrical energy owing to the electromechanical coupling effect
   of the piezoelectric patches from the longitudinal wave motion. To
   describe the energy harvesting process, a mathematical model is
   developed to calculate the output charge and voltage from the
   piezoelectric patches according to the Airy linear wave theory and
   classical elastic beam model. Results show that the mean value of the
   generated power increases with the increase in the ratio of the width to
   the thickness of the cantilever, the wave height, the sea depth (which
   equals to the cantilever height in this study), the ratio of the proof
   mass to the cantilever mass, and the ratio of the sea depth to the wave
   length. A value of the power up to 55 W can be realized for a practical
   sea wave with the values of the sea depth, wave height and wave length
   to be 3 m, 2 m, and 15 m, respectively. The collected power harvesting
   with respect to different categories of the sea waves are provided. Our
   simulations also show the generated electric power can be further
   increased by an increase in dimensions of the harvester considering the
   scale effect. This research develops a new technique for energy
   harvesting from sea waves by piezoelectric energy harvesters. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Microwave tomography is enhanced by using an inhomogeneous background.
   In this paper, the measurement region is located in a circular perfect
   electrical conductor (PEC) chamber where a known object is placed inside
   the imaging domain as an inhomogeneous background. This can not only
   make use of the prior information about the background, but also
   increase the equivalent radiation source for the target detection. The
   Green function of a circular PEC chamber with inhomogeneous background
   is obtained using the method of moments. Based on the Green functions
   for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous background in circular PEC
   chamber, the properties of the radiation operators are analyzed by
   comparing the condition numbers and the singular value spectra.
   Simulations are carried out in homogeneous, lossless inhomogeneous and
   lossy inhomogeneous backgrounds respectively, and the relative errors
   are discussed. The results show that using inhomogeneous background can
   improve the convergence rate and accuracy, and the lossy inhomogeneous
   background produces better results than the lossless one. In addition,
   it can enhance the inversion results without changing the microwave
   tomography system, which can be used in the medical imaging and
   industrial nondestructive detection.}},

Title = {{On the Power Allocation Problem in the Gaussian Interference Channel

Abstract = {{This paper takes an analytical approach to solving the optimization
   problem of finding the power allocation that maximizes the sum-rate of
   the Gaussian interference channel with any linear power (interference)
   constraint and proportional rate constraints. It is proved that the
   sum-rate of the Gaussian interference channel restricted to proportional
   rate constraints does not have a critical point and the maximum sum-rate
   subject to said constraints occurs at the boundary of the domain formed
   by the plane representing the linear power constraint. This is
   accomplished by using analytic geometry in higher dimensions to show
   that the curve of intersection of the sum-rate and the proportional rate
   constraints is always increasing, and intersects the boundary plane
   representing the linear power constraint at a unique point. A polynomial
   time (in the number of users) centralized algorithm that finds this
   point of optimal power allocation is proposed. This is a significant
   improvement over existing algorithms for related power allocation
   problems which have exponential time complexity in the number of users.
   Two distributed algorithms with linear and constant complexities are
   also presented. Simulation results supporting the analysis and
   demonstrating the performances of the algorithms are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Submerged membrane electro-bioreactor (SMEBR) is a new hybrid technology
   for wastewater treatment employing electrical field and microfiltration
   in a nutrient-removing activated sludge process. A pilot SMEBR system
   was located at the wastewater treatment plant in the City of
   l'Assomption (Quebec, Canada) with the objective of investigating the
   start-up period performance under variable organic loadings and
   environmental conditions with respect to effluent quality, membrane
   fouling, and sludge properties. The pilot SMEBR facility was fed with
   the raw de-gritted municipal wastewater. At steady state operation, the
   removal efficiencies of ammonia (as NH3+-N), phosphorus (as PO43--P),
   and COD were 99\%, 99\%, and 92\%, respectively. No substantial increase
   in the monitored transmembrane pressure as 0.02 kPa d(-1) was reported.
   The time necessary to filter 100 mL of the sludge sample has decreased
   by 78\% after treatment whilst the sludge volume index averaged 119 mL
   g(-1). Energy requirements were in the range of 1.1-1.6 kW h m(-3) of
   wastewater. It was concluded that the SMEBR is a very competitive
   technology when compared to conventional membrane systems as it can
   enhance treatment performance to an appreciable extent, remove
   phosphorus and reduce fouling. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {{A direct and unambiguous approach to determine the focal point of a

   the vectorial form of far-field radiation patterns, both amplitude and

   laterally and axially. First, mathematical expressions of the offset
   reflector with a small lateral and axial defocused feed are reviewed.
   Then, the numerical results are presented. It is shown how the
   corresponding far-field phase pattern information can be utilized to
   optimally locate the focal point of an offset parabolic reflector. The
   method can also be used to place the phase center of an unknown feed on
   the reflector focal point, and align the reflector on a test tower.}},

Abstract = {{Biochemical analyses were performed on osteoarthritic and periprosthetic

   currently outlined in orthopaedic wear testing standards. Osteoarthritic
   and periprosthetic synovial fluid samples were obtained from the hip and

   compared in order to identify differences between the protein
   concentration, constituent fractions, osmolality, thermal stability and
   the hyaluronic acid concentration and molecular weight distribution of
   osteoarthritic and periprosthetic synovial fluid. The average total
   protein concentration was approximately 30 g/L, which was much higher
   than the 20 g/L currently specified in the knee wear testing standard;
   however, the 30 g/L protein concentration matched the recently revised
   standard for hip simulator wear testing. No significant difference was
   found between the protein concentration, osmolality, thermal stability,
   and hyaluronic acid concentration of osteoarthritic and periprosthetic

   A total of six beams, with 200 x 300 mm rectangular cross section and

   Three main variables, namely, concrete strength, longitudinal
   reinforcement ratio, and transverse shear-reinforcement ratio, were
   investigated. Two beams were without transverse reinforcement to
   evaluate the concrete contribution to the shear strength and four beams
   had GFRP stirrups to examine the minimum shear-reinforcement
   contribution to the shear strength. All test specimens were designed to
   satisfy an assumed 20\% moment redistribution. It was observed that all
   test specimens failed in shear near the interior support after
   significant moment redistribution from hogging moment to sagging moment
   regions. In addition, the test results were compared with the

Abstract = {{Two new models for wind speed retrieval from C-band synthetic aperture
   radar (SAR) data have been developed, based on a large body of
   statistics on buoy observations collocated and coinciding with
   RADARSAT-1 and -2 ScanSAR images. The first model's independent
   variables are co-polarization (HH) normalized radar cross-section
   (NRCS), and antenna beam incidence angle. The second model's predictors
   are HH NRCS, cross-polarization (HV) NRCS, instrument noise floor, and
   incidence angle. The latter model has better accuracy than the first
   because of using an additional HV variable. Furthermore, we found that
   the proposed models without wind direction input demonstrated a better
   accuracy than CMOD\_IFR2 and CMOD5.N models in combination with the SAD
   HH co-polarization ratio (VV/HH), which require wind direction input.
   These results were confirmed on a large independent subset of collected
   data. The developed wind speed retrieval models, in conjunction with our
   previously developed ice motion tracking algorithm, can be a useful tool
   for studying sea ice dynamics processes in the marginal ice zone. The
   developed models have been integrated into a quasi-operational system at
   the Meteorological Service of Canada.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of nano-resonator sensors made of carbon nanotubes and
   graphene sheets for detection of atoms/molecules based on vibration and
   wave propagation analyses from experimental studies, atomic simulations,
   and continuum mechanics are introduced and reviewed. The principle of
   nano-resonator sensors is to detect shifts in resonant frequencies or
   the wave velocities in the nano-sensors caused by surrounding foreign
   atoms or molecules. The sensitivity of the sensors and their
   applicability in differentiation of distinct types of atoms/molecules
   from atomic simulations are particularly discussed in details.
   Limitations of applications of continuum models are also discussed.
   Summary and recommendations for future research are then provided. The
   review aims to provide a state-of-the-art introduction of the potential

Abstract = {{Knowing the crop water uptake pattern and soil water movement within the
   root zone is important for the optimum design of irrigation and drainage
   systems. The objective of this study was to monitor the soil water
   redistribution within the potato root zone after irrigation and to
   quantify shallow groundwater contribution to water use by potatoes. The
   water uptake pattern in a vertical plane was monitored by TDR miniprobes
   installed at five different depths and at three different radial
   distances from the base of the potato plants. Three such planes of TDR
   miniprobes were used as replicates. The soil within the root zone was
   brought to field capacity by surface application of water. The water
   content measurements were carried out prior to this irrigation event and
   at periodic intervals thereafter over a four-day period, three
   times/day. The groundwater level was measured at 3 h intervals. Soil
   core samples were taken at each TDR probe location to determine the root
   density. The soil water content and upward flux from the groundwater was
   simulated using HYDRUS-1D model and the results were compared with the
   upward flux estimated from the change in groundwater levels. The maximum
   root density was found to be 14.5 and 252 g/m(-3) at two and three
   months after planting. Soil layers at shallower depths showed signs of
   drying while the deeper layers remained wet. Model simulations closely
   matched the measured soil water contents and upward flux. In a fine
   sandy loam, up to 92\% of the crop water demand was met by capillary
   rise from the shallow groundwater table. Knowing the shallow water table
   contribution can decrease the net depth of irrigation water applied and
   save water and energy needed for pumping. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Sea ice dynamic and thermodynamic processes are important and highly
   variable elements of the marginal ice zone (MIZ). This study examines
   the detection and classification of statistically separable sea ice
   classes in the MIZ through a range of temporal and spatial scales. A
   helicopter-based laser system was used to obtain large-scale and a
   ship-based laser profiler to identify small-scale roughness types,
   respectively. The analysis of variance of surface height data from
   helicopter- and ship-based laser systems, active microwave (AMW) C-band
   backscattering data and passive microwave (PMW) (37 and 89GHz)
   brightness temperature data reveal different classes that statistically
   differ from one another. We found significant statistical difference in
   variances in AMW data with six classes that differ in VV polarization,
   three classes in VH polarization, and five classes in HH polarization in
   the MIZ (e.g. snow-covered first-year ice, ice rubble, pancake ice,
   frost flowers, melt pond, flooded ice, and ice edge) of southeastern
   Beaufort Sea. The PMW emission was not as effective at discrimination,
   yielding only one statistically separable class. The results can
   potentially be extended to satellite-based investigations of the MIZ at
   regional scales. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Development of an ultra low noise, miniature signal conditioning device
   for vestibular evoked response recordings}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Inner ear evoked potentials are small amplitude (<1 mu V-pk)
   signals that require a low noise signal acquisition protocol for
   successful extraction; an existing such technique is
   Electrocochleography (ECOG). A novel variant of ECOG called
   Electrovestibulography (EVestG) is currently investigated by our group,
   which captures vestibular responses to a whole body tilt. The objective
   is to design and implement a bio-signal amplifier optimized for ECOG and
   EVestG, which will be superior in noise performance compared to low
   noise, general purpose devices available commercially.
   Method: A high gain configuration is required (>85 dB) for such small
   signal recordings; thus, background power line interference (PLI) can
   have adverse effects. Active electrode shielding and driven-right-leg
   circuitry optimized for EVestG/ECOG recordings were investigated for PLI
   suppression. A parallel pre-amplifier design approach was investigated
   to realize low voltage, and current noise figures for the bio-signal
   amplifier.
   Results: In comparison to the currently used device, PLI is
   significantly suppressed by the designed prototype (by >20 dB in
   specific test scenarios), and the prototype amplifier generated noise
   was measured to be 4.8 nV/root Hz@1kHz (0.45 rho V-RMS with bandwidth 10
   Hz-10 kHz), which is lower than the currently used device generated
   noise of 7.8 nV/root Hz @ 1kHz (0.76 mu V-RMS). A low noise (<1 nV/root
   Hz) radio frequency interference filter was realized to minimize noise
   contribution from the pre-amplifier, while maintaining the required
   bandwidth in high impedance measurements. Validation of the prototype
   device was conducted for actual ECOG recordings on humans that showed an
   increase (p < 0.05) of similar to 5 dB in Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR),
   and for EVestG recordings using a synthetic ear model that showed a
   similar to 4\% improvement (p < 0.01) over the currently used amplifier.
   Conclusion: This paper presents the design and evaluation of an
   ultra-low noise and miniaturized bio-signal amplifier tailored for
   EVestG and ECOG. The increase in SNR for the implemented amplifier will
   reduce variability associated with bio-features extracted from such
   recordings; hence sensitivity and specificity measures associated with
   disease classification are expected to increase. Furthermore, immunity
   to PLI has enabled EVestG and ECOG recordings to be carried out in a
   non-shielded clinical environment.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, carbon nanotubes together with other types of conductive
   materials have been used to enhance the viability and function of
   cardiomyocytes in vitro. Here we demonstrated a paradigm to construct
   ECTs for cardiac repair using conductive nanomaterials. Single walled
   carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were incorporated into gelatin hydrogel
   scaffolds to construct three-dimensional ECTs. We found that SWNTs could
   provide cellular microenvironment in vitro favorable for cardiac
   contraction and the expression of electrochemical associated proteins.
   Upon implantation into the infarct hearts in rats, ECTs structurally
   integrated with the host myocardium, with different types of cells
   observed to mutually invade into implants and host tissues. The
   functional measurements showed that SWNTs were essential to improve the
   performance of ECTs in inhibiting pathological deterioration of
   myocardium. This work suggested that conductive nanomaterials hold
   therapeutic potential in engineering cardiac tissues to repair

   LDPC codes}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{Separate source and channel coding is known to be sub-optimal for
   communicating correlated sources over a Gaussian multiple access channel
   (GMAC). This paper presents an approach to designing distributed joint
   source-channel (DJSC) codes for encoding correlated binary sources over
   a two-user GMAC, using systematic irregular low-density parity check
   (LDPC) codes. The degree profile defining the LDPC code is optimized for
   the joint source probabilities using extrinsic information transfer
   (EXIT) analysis and linear programming. A key issue addressed is the
   Gaussian modeling of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) generated by nodes
   representing the joint source probabilities in the combined factor graph
   of the two LDPC codes, referred to as source-channel factor (SCF) nodes.
   It is shown that the analytical expressions based on additive combining
   of incoming LLRs, as done in variable nodes and parity check nodes of
   the graph of a single LDPC code, cannot be used with SCF nodes. To this
   end, we propose a numerical approach based on Monte-Carlo simulations to
   fit a Gaussian density to outgoing LLRs from the SCF nodes, which makes
   the EXIT analysis of the joint decoder tractable. Experimental results
   are presented which show that LDPC codes designed with the proposed
   approach outperforms previously reported DJSC codes for GMAC.
   Furthermore, they demonstrate that when the sources are strongly
   dependent, the proposed DJSC codes can achieve code rates higher than
   the theoretical upper-bound for separate source and channel coding.}},

Abstract = {{Fractional calculus (FC) represents the generalization of the integer
   calculus, in which the order of the exponent, as well as the
   differential and integral operators are restricted to integer values.
   This paper focuses on the existing fractional derivatives commonly used,
   while highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each one of them.
   Furthermore, a mathematical interpretation of the fractional derivative
   is presented. The superiority of FC and its relative merits are also
   addressed through a specific example related to control engineering.
   This example deals with the implementation of a proportional integral
   derivative (PID) controller, where the objective is to evaluate a
   fractional- and integer-order PID controllers for the purpose of
   correcting the error in a dynamic process based on specific performance
   measures (e.g, overshoots, undershoots, transient response, and
   steady-state error). The simulation results indicates that the
   fractional-order PID provides a significant improvements compared to the
   integer-order PID, as well as a more flexible structure to adapt
   optimally to the process at hand.}},

Abstract = {{Today's evolving cyber security threats demand new, modern, and
   cognitive computing approaches to network security systems. In the early
   years of the Internet, a simple packet inspection firewall was adequate
   to stop the then-contemporary attacks, such as Denial of Service (DoS),
   ports scans, and phishing. Since then, DoS has evolved to include
   Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, especially against the
   Domain Name Service (DNS). DNS based DDoS amplification attacks cannot
   be stopped easily by traditional signature based detection mechanisms
   because the attack packets contain authentic data, and signature based
   detection systems look for specific attack-byte patterns. This paper
   proposes a chaos based complexity measure and a cognitive machine
   classification algorithm to detect DNS DDoS amplification attacks. In
   particular, this paper computes the Lyapunov exponent to measure the
   complexity of a flow of packets, and classifies the traffic as either
   normal or anomalous, based on the magnitude of the computed exponent.
   Preliminary results show the proposed chaotic measure achieved a
   detection (classification) accuracy of about 66\%, which is greater than
   that reported in the literature. This approach is capable of not only
   detecting offline threats, but has the potential of being applied over
   live traffic flows using DNS filters.}},

   wall in a compacted and complex environment with limited acquired data.
   Furthermore, visual sensor measurements may contain errors in a number
   of situations. In order to improve uncertainty reasoning results, it is
   necessary to perceive the encountered environment and filter the
   measured data. Therefore, a rough set theory is integrated to extract
   essential features of data to regulate inputs before applying fuzzy
   inference rules. The proposed control algorithm demonstrates excellent
   results through simulation and implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Polyaniline tends to degrade in aqueous electrolytes and it can be
   alleviated using gel electrolytes. Here a low-cost solid-state
   supercapacitor of high energy density is fabricated with a facile
   method. The electrodes of the supercapacitor are made of a phytic
   acid-crosslinked freestanding film of polyaniline and ground carbon
   fibers and the electrolyte gel is composed of sulfuric acid and
   polyvinyl alcohol. Our results show that a maximum capacitance of 273.6
   F/g (1.6 F/cm(2)) at a current density of 0.08 A/g can be achieved by
   the supercapacitor, which is significantly higher than most solid-state
   ones reported in the literature. The ability to achieve a
   high-capacitance supercapacitor with good cyclic stability is mainly
   attributed to excellent infiltration of the electrolyte gel into the
   electrodes. The developed lightweight, thin, flexible, and environmental
   friendly supercapacitor would have potential applications in various

Abstract = {{Recently, interests have been orientated toward the development of
   nano-electromechanical systems such as nanoresonators. The
   ultra-high-frequency of nanoresonators facilitates a wide range of new
   applications such as ultra-high sensitive sensors, molecular
   transportation, high-frequency signal processing, biological imaging,
   quantum measurement and radio frequency communications. In this study,
   applications of nanoresonators in sensors and molecular transportation
   are introduced and reviewed. Studies on nanoresonator sensors made of
   carbon nanotubes and graphene sheets for detection of atoms/molecules
   based on vibration and wave propagation analyses are outlined. The
   principle of the nano-sensors is to detect shifts in resonant
   frequencies or the wave velocities in the sensors caused by surrounding
   foreign atoms or molecules. Furthermore, the feasibility of molecular
   transportation using propagation of torsional and impulse waves in
   nano-resonator devices is presented. An extended application of the
   transportation methods for building nanofiltering systems with
   ultra-high selectivity is survived. The article aims to provide a
   state-of-the-art introduction of the potential of resonators made of
   carbon nanotubes and graphene sheets, and inspire further applications

Abstract = {{Consumer requirements for products vary dynamically based on the change
   of technologies, social influence, individual taste, etc. A sustainable
   product should meet customer requirements in its lifecycle. Different
   methods and techniques have been proposed to find possible changes of
   product needs or customers' preferences. This paper introduces an
   agent-based technique to address the change of product requirements.
   Major contribution of the proposed method is to embed customers'
   preference in the analysis of product performance using agent
   interactions. Using the combination of Quality Function Deployment
   (QFD), agent-based modeling and data mining methods, customers'
   preference trends related to elements and functions of product are
   simulated. The prediction period is flexible based on estimated product
   lifecycle. The proposed method is compared with other techniques in a
   case study.}},

Abstract = {{Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), as the name suggests, is
   technology that makes use of radio frequency electromagnetic wave to
   automatically identify objects. In spite of its broad applications, a
   RFID system might inherently produce some false and duplicate readings.
   Such reading data would affect the accuracy of the RFID system and might
   result in an unreliable performance or even complete unavailability of
   the system. In this paper, a reading rate-based algorithm is proposed to
   efficiently clean RFID data for a local business in product tracking.
   The method takes advantage of the proportional relationship between
   reading rate of a RFID tag and its distance to the reader to filter
   among raw data sets. Using the proposed reading rate-based algorithm,
   the reading accuracy of the RFID system in the local business is greatly
   improved.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy duty machines consume a tremendous amount of energy during their
   life cycle. Therefore, designing an energy efficient machine is of great
   importance. This paper presents a method for the comparative life cycle
   assessment (LCA) of two different types of press machines: servo press
   and flywheel press to understand quantitatively the environmental
   emissions during their life cycles. To make a fair comparison of the two
   machines, the same amount of production is used as the basis for
   comparison. Assessment scopes and boundaries are defined first, then
   detailed product structures and manufacturing processes are
   investigated. After data collection from visiting enterprises, related
   project reports, academic papers, and commercial software databases,
   analysis of the life cycle inventory is performed. Comparative inventory
   tables for each life cycle stages and whole life cycle are presented.
   The results of the study can be used for decision making during the
   product purchase, planning and design process.}},

Abstract = {{Breast Microwave Radar is a novel imaging modality for breast cancer
   detection. This technology uses low power microwaves to illuminate the
   breast region and it generates a reflectivity map of the breast
   structures in which tumors can be detected. Although this imaging
   modality has been successful in limited clinical trials, additional work
   is needed to optimize several parameters of this technology to increase
   its use in routine clinical imaging procedures. One of the aspects that
   is crucial for the performance of a BMR system are the antennas used to
   record the datasets. In this study, the use of a novel horn antenna for
   BMR data collection is proposed. This antenna was used to record BMR
   datasets from synthetic phantoms that mimic the dielectric properties of
   breast tissues. Datasets from these phantoms were also collected using a
   Vivaldi antenna, which is a common design for current BMR systems. The
   results of this study show that images formed from datasets recorded
   using the horn antenna had a lower noise level and higher contrast
   compared to their counterparts corresponding to the Vivaldi antenna
   datasets.}},

   Researches show that whatever the biomechanical behavior of artificial
   ankle is similar to that of natural ankle, it can be used by consuming
   less energy. Considering biomechanical behavior of normal ankle in a
   walking gait, required parameters for designing of an artificial ankle

Abstract = {{The paper presents a multiobjective memetic optimization algorithm for a
   joint spectrum sensing and power allocation problem in a multichannel,
   multiple-user cognitive wireless networks. In particular, we apply a
   multiobjective memetic algorithm to design efficient spectrum sensing
   and power allocation techniques to maximize the throughputs and minimize
   the interferences of the network. To maximize the throughputs of
   secondary users and minimize the interferences to primary users, it
   requires for a joint determination of the sensing and transmission
   parameters of the secondary users, such as sensing times, decision
   threshold vectors, and power allocation vectors. There is a conflict
   between these two objectives, thus a multiobjective optimization problem
   is introduced. The proposed algorithm evolutionarily learns to find
   optimal spectrum sensing times, decision threshold vectors, and power
   allocation vectors to maximize the averaged opportunistic throughput and
   minimize the averaged interference (or maximize the averaged
   transmission gain) of the cognitive network.}},

   (FPID, IPID) controllers for the purpose of small satellites attitude
   control. This paper introduces the background knowledge related to the
   three different controllers. The second one evaluates their performance
   based on their ability to provide an optimal attitude control scheme for
   small satellites. The controllers are evaluated in the time-domain based
   on different performance measures (e.g., overshoot, transient response,
   and steady-state error). Simulation results illustrate the superiority
   of FPID over IPID and fuzzy controllers for this specific application

   a set of experimental results showing the effect of the distance between
   the antenna and the breast region. Preliminary results show that when

Abstract = {{The development of intelligent computational tools provides new
   opportunities to exploit various potentialities of computers. At
   present, automated computing is the main means for the application of
   engineering knowledge. The growth and development in the application of
   computing tools and technologies, and the development of new paradigms
   has been incremental and linear. Many fields have taken significant
   advantage of the recent advancements in computing technology to adapt,
   apply and enhance the way people learn these fields.
   In this paper, a framework for developing efficient knowledge-based
   computational applications is presented with an actual case study of
   concrete mixture proportioning. Recommendations are also developed
   targeting the possible employment and application of latest computing
   technologies in concrete engineering. The presented case study comprises
   of developing a computer application for a recently developed novel mix
   design method for Pakistan based on empirical results established as a
   result of a detailed testing program. The experimental testing details
   and results for development and validation are presented in a separate
   study. Regression analysis results, design flowcharts and necessary
   calculations are implemented in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in
   MATLAB R2009a environment which is designed as a self-explanatory
   program providing an easier and friendly platform to compute constituent
   quantities, adjust various trials and understand the art of mix design.
   The interface is developed in a simple and interactive manner for
   convenient visualization of complete step-by-step process of mixture
   proportioning, aiming not only to provide an easy tool for what-if
   analysis, but also to generate a learning attitude among the end users.
   The interface is also equipped with necessary help notes, attractive and
   self-explanatory interactive graphics and description for each dialog
   box. A parametric study attempting to comment on the effect of changing
   various desired characteristics on recommended constituent quantities is
   also carried out using this program and is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Human body functions as a network of mechanically coupled parts
   (components) that work together to form a complete system; these body
   components can experience failure when in service. Specifically, failure
   such as arthritis may be caused by articulations at the hip and knee
   joints. One of such solutions to this failure is the total hip
   replacement. Materials used in this prosthesis, therefore play an
   important role in the success of the implant. One of the most commonly
   used implant material in modern day arthroplasty is the Ti6Al4V alloy,
   because of its excellent resistance to wear and corrosion in the human
   body environment. In reality, such implant in service may be subjected
   to impact loading (at a velocity of about 250-1000m/s), leading to
   deformation. Typical, examples include an implanted patient involved in
   an automobile crash and a golf ball hitting an implanted patient at the
   point of implantation. In this study, the wear and tear resistance
   property of Ti6Al4V alloy is determined by performing simulation on the
   high strain rate deformation behavior of IN718 super alloy material and
   Ti6Al4V plated Inconel material. The maximum stress localized within the
   plated Inconel material is lesser than that in the unplated material.
   This shows that Ti6Al4V alloy prevents the localization of stress in the
   parent Inconel material and is therefore a good wear prevention
   material, under impact conditions. Also, the impact characterization
   behavior of Ti6Al4V material is performed in this research in order to
   determine the maximum stress allowable in the titanium alloy before
   ultimate failure. Simulation of the high strain rate behavior of the
   Ti6Al4V alloy is performed at velocities in the range 9-20m/s. It is
   observed that the localized stress within the Ti6Al4V alloy increases
   with increased impact velocity. A maximum localized stress is observed
   in the material beyond which the Ti6Al4V alloy experiences failure. The
   result of the simulation process helps in determining the maximum impact
   which an implanted patient can therefore be exposed to and the
   preventive measures that can be taken in order to guarantee safety of
   the implanted patient.}},

Abstract = {{The issue of channel selection in a decentralized cognitive radio
   network having a spectrum broker is discussed in this paper. In the
   proposed method we take into account both the Primary user (PU) channel
   usage statistics and, Secondary user (SU) channel usage statistics as
   perceived by an SU of interest. In the marked Markov process based
   method proposed, each SU calculates the reward of using each channel and
   selects the channel set with the highest reward, which will in turn be
   used for proactive spectrum access and hand-off. We compare our scheme
   with two other schemes, where the channel set is randomly selected in
   one and selected based only on PU statistics in the other. By comparison
   of the simulation results, we show that our scheme causes less
   interference to the PUs and has comparable throughput performance which
   compensates for the increased computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Mobility on a traditionally static percolation theory model was
   investigated. The modification of the percolation theory model to
   incorporate mobility on the model grid enabled the creation of a simple
   agent-based model (ABM). This resulted in statistically significant
   findings that the impact of agent density is inversely related to agent
   mobility. An interactive graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to
   provide a visual illustration to convey an intuitive comprehension of
   the ABM simulation dynamics and processes. The association between
   mobility and density is visually illustrated by the interactive GUI,
   which emphasizes patterns that can provide guidance for research into
   connectedness or connectivity involving percolation models. One
   application is epizootic modeling. Visualization is an increasingly
   desired method used by industry and academia. Visualization is employed
   in many percolation model studies as it quickly narrows down regions of
   interest that can be further explored using conventional analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, radio resource allocation for multicasting in OFDMA based
   High Altitude Platforms is considered. An optimization problem for the
   model described in the paper is formulated which turns out to be a Mixed
   Integer Non-Linear Program. Due to its high complexity, we use
   Lagrangian relaxation to dualize some constraint sets. The Lagrangian
   relaxed problem is then decomposed into two Lagrangian subproblems, one
   is a binary knapsack Lagrangian subproblem (BKLSP) and the other is
   continuous knapsack Lagrangian subproblem (CKLSP). The BKLSP is
   responsible for the assignment of the OFDMA subchannels and time slots
   to multicast sessions as well as user assignment to the multicast groups
   in a particular frame. The CKLSP is responsible for HAP power allocation
   to multicast sessions in the HAP service area. The two subproblems can
   be solved iteratively in search for a better solution, if there is any,
   for the Lagrangian problem. For the BKLSP we use two different solution
   algorithms, one based on dynamic programming and the other is a greedy
   algorithm. A greedy algorithm is also used for the CKLSP. The entire
   approach can be used to obtain bounds in a branch and bound algorithm
   for each of its nodes.}},

Abstract = {{The authors have proposed a fair solution to optimal rate adaptation.
   The problem has been described in terms of the objective function,
   decision variables and constraints. Furthermore, using this problem
   definition, a rate adaptation heuristic was developed and divided into
   two sub-problems; part one requires finding the optimal rate allocation
   within the network, part two continues by finding a fair solution whilst
   still keeping an optimal rate allocation. The heuristic relies on
   cooperation in the network, and information regarding selected rates and
   loss due to interference, is distributed between neighbouring nodes.
   Furthermore, the heuristic is modelled as a repeated game with infinite
   horizon and it is shown how cooperation can be enforced. A Stack
   topology has been used for analysing and comparing performance and
   OMNeT++ 4.2.2 has been selected as simulation platform. The authors have
   shown that the heuristic effectively reduces the packet loss ratio
   (PLR). Thereafter, it was shown that the solution is both fair and
   optimal in terms of data rate.}},

Abstract = {{Breathing sounds analysis conveys valuable information in relation to
   obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during both sleep and wakefulness. In this
   study, we investigated whether the breathings sounds spectral and higher
   order statistics characteristics (HOS) change from wakefulness to sleep,
   and more importantly whether this change is associated with severity of
   OSA. Tracheal breathing sounds of 6 individuals with severe OSA and 6
   non-OSA individuals during wakefulness and stage 2 of sleep, both in
   supine position, were used in this study. The sounds were recorded
   simultaneously with full overnight polysomnography (PSG) assessment.
   First, the sounds of 5 noise-free breathing cycles were extracted and
   sequestered into inspiratory and expiratory phase segments manually for
   each study subject. After normalizing each sound segment to its energy,
   spectral and HOS features were calculated. Several features including
   the median bispectral frequency (MBF), spectral bandwidth (BW) and
   bispectrum Harmonic Mean (HM) were found to change statistically
   significantly from wakefulness to sleep mostly in severe OSA group but
   not as much in non-OSA group. The most prominent and consistent change
   between the two groups of OSA and non-OSA was observed in MBF; it
   changed from wakefulness to sleep in the two groups in an opposite
   manner; this observation is congruent with the hypothesis that the upper
   airway in OSA population has an increased non-homogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a widespread disorder that is
   cumbersome to diagnose using the gold-standard, overnight
   polysomnography (PSG). This paper highlights further development of our
   Awake-OSA method for predicting whether someone has severe sleep apnea
   using breath sounds recorded during wakefulness. We propose the use of
   an expert classification approach that consists of individual
   majority-voting classifiers. Each classifier is trained to distinguish
   one class of subject from all other classes. The outcomes of these
   classifiers are, in turn, combined using a truth matrix to determine the
   final outcome. Using the breath sound features of 249 subjects, the
   classifiers attempted to classify 180 subjects as either non-OSA (AHI
   less than 5) or severe-OSA (AHI greater than 30). 79\% and 75\% of OSA
   and non-OSA subjects, respectively, could be classified. Of those
   classified, the resultant testing sensitivity and specificity were found
   to be 78\% and 86\%, respectively. The consistency of the testing to
   training accuracies indicates the robustness and generalizability of
   using multiple expert classifiers on the dataset. This technique has the
   potential to be used in a doctor's office to rapidly and cheaply
   pre-screen for OSA, so that physicians may be better able to determine
   which patients are in need of overnight PSG.}},

Abstract = {{Masonry systems are vulnerable to cold climates during construction and
   service. In North America, this issue is a major concern for masonry
   contractors as they either have to implement thorough heating practices
   for laying and curing masonry systems or postpone the construction to
   warmer seasons. This might lead to loss of productivity, delays in
   construction schedules, and, inevitably, extra costs. To minimize the
   adverse effects of cold weather on masonry construction, a new approach
   based on the use of nanoparticles in the mixture design of mortar joints
   is proposed. Previous research on the use of nanoparticles in
   cement-based materials has shown that nanoparticles can significantly
   accelerate the kinetics of hydration of cementitious binders under
   normal temperatures (22 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C). In this study, an
   effort is made to assess the effect of nano-alumina (NA) and nano-silica
   (NS) with dosages of 0 \%, 2 \%, and 4 \% by mass of masonry cement on
   the performance of mortar mixtures prepared and cured at 5 degrees C.
   The key assessment criteria were based on fresh properties, compressive
   strength, and microstructural features. The results indicated that
   mortar mixtures containing NS had better performance than that of the
   other mixtures with or without NA, which suggests the promising use of
   NS in cold weather masonry construction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates haptic-enabled teleoperation of a base-excited
   hydraulic manipulator working under a wireless communication channel.
   The intended application is live power line maintenance. With respect to
   this application, three main challenges are recognized in the field:
   need for the force feedback, wireless communication between master and
   slave sites, and base excitation of the slave manipulator. In this
   paper, a test rig is developed to examine how an operator's hand speed
   regulating scheme enhances the lineman's performance while the entire
   system works under a wireless communication channel and the slave base
   is under excitation. Two sets of experiments are performed when the
   haptic device produces no force and when the regulating haptic force is
   added to the master device. Performance of the system is evaluated by
   measuring four indices: operator's failure in completing a task,
   end-effector displacement, slave manipulator controller effort, and task
   completion time. Results indicate that adding the haptic force to the
   system helps linemen function more effectively when the system is
   subject to base-excitation and communicates through a wireless network.}},

   actuators. The adverse effect of friction encountered in the pneumatic
   actuators which play a major role in pneumatic servo system is
   highlighted and a solution to rectify this is proposed using an adaptive
   LuGre-based friction observer for friction compensation. The B-SMC is
   experimentally applied, for the first time, on a double-acting
   single-rod industrial pneumatic cylinder. Comprehensive derivation as
   well as stability proof of the controller is presented. The performance
   of B-SMC with and without the friction observer is experimentally
   investigated. From the results, it is clearly observed that the B-SMC
   with the adaptive friction observer performs better (i.e. reduces the
   tracking as well steady-state errors of up to 30\%) than the one without
   friction observer. Thus, the adaptive friction observer of B-SMC is
   identified as the key element that improved the control performance by
   compensating the adverse effect of friction during the position tracking
   tasks.}},

   of a QFT controller using stability theorem of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy
   systems. To do this, first the hydraulic closed-loop system is
   represented by a T-S fuzzy model that is formed through a nonlinear
   combination of some local linear models. Next, the stability of the
   resulting T-S fuzzy system is analyzed simply by stability analysis of
   its local linear models. This approach is used to study the stability of
   a QFT position controller previously developed for hydraulic actuators.
   Results show guaranteed stability of the QFT controller over a wide
   range of operation and in the presence of parametric uncertainties.}},

   designed to construct performance charts that guide us to select
   appropriate parameters of wireless network setup by which a particular
   value of position error appears at the slave hydraulic manipulator
   end-effector. The network parameters are: configuration of environment
   obstruction, transmission power of the router, and distance between the
   master and slave sites. The first set of experiments is conducted to
   define three regions of tracking quality and to construct the
   performance charts. The second set of experiments confirms satisfactory
   performance, when the teleoperated system is located within the
   recommended regions in the established charts. One application of this
   study is live-line maintenance using remotely-operated hydraulic
   manipulators.}},

Abstract = {{Sliding Mode Control (SMC) technique is a well-established method in
   positioning pneumatic actuators due to its consistent performance in the
   presence of model uncertainties. Brain Emotional Learning Based
   Intelligent Controller (BELBIC) is a new model free controller with
   flexible structure and low computational load. It has been successfully
   applied to many control problems. In this work we study, for the first
   time, how well a BELBIC performs in comparison with SMC approach in
   positioning a pneumatic actuator. Different position tracking tasks are
   evaluated on a low-cost pneumatic actuator and in presence of
   significant friction. Comparison is done based on positioning accuracy,
   non-oscillatory motion and robustness to external load. The results show
   that while both controllers successfully track different trajectories,
   SMC is generally more accurate. BELBIC maintains its performance in the
   presence of large static friction. Furthermore, it produces less
   oscillatory control action. This work concludes that BELBIC can be a
   good choice for positioning of pneumatic actuators.}},

Abstract = {{As a hydraulic actuator is used over time, the piston seal that closes
   the gap between the moveable piston and the cylinder wall wears. This
   results in the fluid to eventually being able to flow across the piston
   and between the cylinder chambers. Although no fluid is lost from the
   circuit, the dynamic performance of the system is affected since only a
   portion of the flow delivered to the actuator is available to move the
   piston against the load. Leakage across the piston introduces a flow
   deadband, which can lead to servoing errors. This paper presents an
   approach based on the cross-correlation time-series analysis to
   determine the health of hydraulic actuator internal seals. Pressure
   signals obtained directly from routine operations are analyzed using the
   cross-correlation function. The method presented in this paper is shown
   to be capable of detecting leakages as small as 0.069 1/min.}},

Abstract = {{In 2009, the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) called for
   the assessment of 12 graduate attributes in all Canadian accredited
   engineering programs. As part of this process, data are required from a
   variety of stakeholders, including the faculties responsible for
   teaching the host of courses offered in Canada's diverse engineering
   programs. This paper describes the second year of a three-year study in
   the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Manitoba that explores
   how the CEAB graduate attributes are manifested and measured in its
   curricula. The four attributes targeted were Problem Analysis, Use of
   Engineering Tools, Communication Skills, and Ethics and Equity. Fifteen
   instructors from each of the Departments of Biosystems, Civil,
   Electrical and Computer, and Mechanical Engineering considered the
   presence of these attributes in one of their engineering courses taught
   in the academic year 2012-13, using a self-administered checklist.
   Findings indicated that the traditional attributes in engineering were
   assessed more frequently than the professional attributes, and that
   specifically, there was little assessment evidence of Ethics and Equity
   and the Oral focus of Communication Skills. There was some evidence of
   formative assessment, but generally assessments were limited to
   traditional quantitative, summative assessments. Competency levels were
   expressed in a variety of ways, highlighting the need for the
   development of a common language for assessment. The study underscores
   the different roles assessment can take and the complexity of sustaining
   a faculty-wide, outcomes-based assessment protocol.}},

   simple enough to be computationally efficient so that fast processing is

   GLCM and variance, metrics such as variance would be selected for
   comparison purposes as they require less computational time. Thinking
   outside the box, we would like to introduce the use of income inequality
   metrics used in the field of economy to measure the distribution of

Abstract = {{Ultrasound technology is a very well-known effective technique used in
   Non-Destructive Testing (NDT). Of the advantages, one can name its
   relatively low cost and that it is safe. At high frequencies it offers
   the capability of generating high resolution imagery. Unfortunately at
   high frequencies ultrasound waves are highly attenuated in air and
   within materials attenuation also worsens as the frequency increases.
   Additionally, transmission in air results on a considerable impedance
   mismatch between the propagating medium and the materials under
   inspection. Thus a coupling medium is used that limits its applications
   to materials that can be either immersed in water or be in touch with
   coupling gel. In this paper we explore the use of 25 KHz frequency
   transducers used in air with no coupling material. We trade the benefits
   of high resolution imaging for effective fault detection with a system
   that offers its own benefits. By choosing such a low frequency we
   alleviate in part the attenuation of high frequency sound waves within
   the material and air but by not using a coupling medium the transmitted
   power to the sample is highly attenuated. Our main application,
   detection of faults within the insulation material of power cables
   requires such a system. We report that detection is possible.}},

Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1839-1844}},
Abstract = {{Arching is a common phenomenon in bulk solids storage structures during
   discharge. It is hypothesized that dynamic pressures during discharge
   result from the formation of intermittent arches in grain bins. For
   free-flowing materials such as agricultural grains, these arches are not
   strong enough to stop the material flow, but they may slow down the
   moving material in some locations in the bin. When the moving material
   is slowed down, an inertia force caused by deceleration will be induced.
   The arch will also carry some of the material weight above it. Since the
   arch is supported by the bin wall, both the inertia force and the
   additional material weight carried by the arch will be transferred
   through the arch to the bin wall, causing the pressure to increase on
   the bin wall. Based on this force transfer mechanism, a predictive model
   was developed for predicting dynamic pressures on the walls of grain
   bins during discharge. A mass-spring system was proposed to represent
   the grain bulk in calculating the inertia force caused by deceleration.
   The predicted dynamic pressure is in good agreement with the
   experimental data reported in the literature for wheat, and the
   predicted overpressure factor is in close agreement with that
   recommended in ASABE Standards for bin design.}},
