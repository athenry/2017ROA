Abstract = {{A simulation based method is proposed to estimate the effective
   permittivity of artificially engineered materials with controlled
   electromagnetic properties, that can increase the effective permittivity
   of low permittivity dielectrics. Details of the proposed method and the
   results for a sample with window-shaped inclusions are discussed. The
   method provides a systematic approach to study the influence of
   different parameters on the effective permittivity, which is necessary
   for using these materials in antenna design.}},

Abstract = {{The first n-1 equations of a general n-by-n linear algebraic system are
   first made homogeneous. Then, the first unknown is eliminated from the
   equations 2,3, .. ,n-1, with the n-th equation kept in its original
   form. A first solution of the equations 2 to n-1 and of the n-th
   equation is obvious. If a second, independent solution of these
   equations is found, the solution of the original system will be
   determined from a linear combination of the two solutions by imposing
   the condition that its 1-st equation is also satisfied. This second
   solution is obtained in the same way, as the solution of an
   (n-1)-by-(n-1) system whose last equation only contains coefficients in
   the original n-th equation. After the elimination process is completed,
   the solution of the original system is derived by a backward
   substitution. The computational complexity in n(3) is the same as in the
   classical Gaussian elimination, but the new method presents an improved
   stability and accuracy as shown in numerical experiments with infinite
   systems encountered in the analysis of electric fields in
   multiple-sphere configurations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new method is presented to excite an open-ended
   circular waveguide feed. A circular microstrip patch element is embedded
   near the bottom end of the waveguide, which excites the dominant TE11
   mode at the aperture of the antenna. The technique is simple and capable
   of generating a relatively pure mode over a respectable frequency band.
   The technique eliminates the need of using a waveguide transition for
   the feeding network. In terms of volume, the proposed technique leads to
   a less bulky structure as opposed to the conventional probe excitation
   method in waveguides, which laterally occupies more space since it is
   perpendicular to the waveguide wall.}},

Abstract = {{General translational addition theorems are presented for spherical
   scalar Laplacian functions, and their application to boundary value
   problems is illustrated. By these theorems, the eigenfunction solutions
   in a system of spherical coordinates are expressed in terms of the
   spherical coordinates in another system, translated with respect to the
   first one. This allows for a rigorous analytic solution to be obtained
   for Laplacian and Poissonian fields in the presence of arbitrary
   configurations of spheres by imposing the exact boundary conditions.
   Complete formulations and solutions are presented for systems of
   electrically charged spheres and for arrays of perfect conductor spheres
   in external electric and magnetic fields. Illustrative computation
   examples are given for three-sphere systems. Numerical results of
   specified accuracy are generated, which are useful for validating
   various approximate numerical methods.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave tomography (MWT) and a radar-based region estimation technique
   are combined to create a novel algorithm for biomedical imaging with a
   focus on breast cancer detection and monitoring. The region estimation
   approach is used to generate a patient-specific spatial map of the
   breast anatomy that includes skin, adipose and fibroglandular regions,
   as well as their average dielectric properties. This map is incorporated
   as a numerical inhomogeneous background into an MWT algorithm based on
   the finite element contrast source inversion (FEM-CSI) method. The
   combined approach reconstructs finer structural details of the breast
   and better estimates the dielectric properties than either technique
   used separately. Numerical results obtained with the novel combined
   algorithmic approach, based on synthetically generated breast phantoms,
   show significant improvement in image quality.}},

   great impact on the production time, the productivity and the

   algorithms is evaluated using Design of Experiments (DOE) to study the
   robustness of the proposed metaheuristics based on the Relative
   Percentage Deviation (RPD) from the lower bounds. The results of the DOE
   evaluation of the proposed algorithms show that PSO-based metaheuristic

Abstract = {{In this paper, a stochastic mixed integer linear programming (SMILP)
   model is proposed to optimize the location and size of facilities and
   service centres in integrated forward and reverse streams under

   maximize customer satisfaction with sustainable perspective. The model
   incorporates different elements and features of distribution networks
   including inventory management, transportation and establishment of new
   facilities as well as existing centres. The presented model is the
   streamlined approach for multi-objective, multi-period, multi-commodity
   distribution system, and it is supported by a real case study in
   automobile after sales network. Genetic algorithm is implemented to
   solve the model in reasonable time. The performance of the model and the
   effects of uncertainty on provided solution are studied under different
   cases. Competitive result of the stochastic model compared to
   deterministic model ensures that the proposed approach is valid to be
   applied for decision making under uncertainty. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Decisions to locate facilities within product-service network should
   satisfy all stakeholders' objective in supply chains. To provide
   solutions for such strategic decisions, many method and approaches have
   been applied including operations research, fuzzy decision making, etc.
   Reviewing the efficient and effective methods, agent-based models (ABM)
   are proved to provide competitive solutions to distributed problems. In
   this paper an agent-based model for the facility location problems is
   presented. Agents are defined as regional warehouses and cities;
   optimization rules are applied to the behavior of agents in
   distribution-service network environment. Agents make decision on the
   location of facilities based on autonomy factors and Optimization rules
   which are derived from similar optimization problems in facility
   location. Proposed model is implemented to a case in automobile after
   sales services network. The efficiency of proposed model is evaluated by
   defined performance measures under demand uncertainty. It is concluded
   that embedding optimization behavior into autonomous agents can provide
   productive solutions for complex decision in uncertain environment. (C)

Abstract = {{To improve the biocompatibility and antibacterial capability of
   thermally oxidized Ti-6Al-4V, an ultrathin alginate/chitosan film that
   contains nano-silver was constructed through mussel-inspired
   poly(dopamine). The hybrid structure was successfully fabricated on the
   Ti-6Al-4V surface without deterioration of the rough surface induced by
   thermal oxidation (TO). The hybrid surface was characterized by the use
   of contact angle goniometry (CAG), atomic force microscopy (AFM),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectrometry
   (XPS), and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). Bone marrow stem cell
   (BMSC) viability, morphology and proliferation tests showed a
   significant increase due to the biomimetic chitosan/alginate film on
   Ti-6Al-4V. Furthermore, nano-silver particles incorporated into the
   chitosan/alginate film inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli (E.
   coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) without jeopardizing the
   improved BMSC viability, morphology and proliferation. More importantly,
   the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was significantly
   up-regulated after BMSCs were cultured on the Ti-6Al-4V-based hybrid
   structure. Overall, this study presents a promising strategy to improve
   biocompatibility and antibacterial capability of thermally oxidized

   approximately 360 hours to simulate OCT imaging of a single B-scan. We
   implemented this new simulator on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) using
   the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform and programming

   important and practical tool to study different OCT phenomena and to
   design novel OCT systems with superior imaging performance.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal lensing in diode pumped solid state lasers can seriously affect
   laser performance and cause beam distortions resulting in degradation of
   beam quality. Estimating thermal lens is important in designing stable
   laser cavities with minimum laser mode size fluctuations and high output
   power. The common techniques used to estimate the thermal lens under
   lasing condition deploy a probe beam or a wave front sensor. Both these
   techniques need precise alignment and the laser beam quality factor has
   to be measured separately for thermal lens calculations. It is
   well-known that beam quality varies considerably at different pump
   intensities. We demonstrate a simple technique based on ABCD law for
   Gaussian beams that is capable of estimating the thermal lens accurately
   by taking into account the fluctuation of beam quality factor at various
   pump intensities. The technique is experimentally tested using a
   diode-pumped Yb: KYW laser at different pump intensities.}},

Abstract = {{In the fabrication of 3-D complex tissues for implantation,
   layer-by-layer (LBL) electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds have recently
   received intensive interest. However, poor cell adhesion and cell
   expansion between the layers in an LBL stack remain important issues. In
   this study, we report a mussel-inspired, biomimetic approach to
   functionalize the surface of PCL/gelatin nanofibrous membranes coated
   with poly (dopamine) (PDA). Our study demonstrates that a PDA coating on
   electrospun PCL/gelatin nanofibers leads to a significant change in
   their surface properties and a higher adhesion force. Furthermore, we
   found that PDA coating promotes the adhesion and growth of adipose stem
   cells (ADSCs). In 3-D LBL stacked scaffolds, more cells survived in a
   PAD-coated scaffold than in a non-coated one. The PDA coating was
   further demonstrated to promote the osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs
   in LBL paper-stacking membranes. Our study suggests that PDA-coated
   paper-stacking nanofiber membranes present a facile and economic method
   for the development of 3D tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Image-based finite element (FE) modeling of human bones has been
   increasingly applied as a useful tool in biomedical engineering.
   However, most existing image-based FE models assume isotropic mechanical
   properties for bones, although bones are typically anisotropic material.
   In this study, we attempted to construct anisotropic FE models from
   medical computed tomography (CT) scans by modifying the existing
   empirical relations of bone elasticity-density. The hypothesis adopted
   in the study is that bone anisotropy is generated by the variations of
   bone density and the proposed anisotropic relations should degenerate to
   the isotropic ones if bone density variation is taken zero. The effect
   of considering bone anisotropy in FE models was investigated by
   numerical studies. The obtained numerical results showed that the
   relative error in the finite element solutions produced respectively by
   the isotropic and anisotropic FE models can be as large as 50\%. We
   concluded from this preliminary study that the consideration of
   anisotropy in bone FE models has a significant effect on the accuracy of
   bone behavior predicted by the FE models. However, well-designed bone
   tests have to be conducted to validate the anisotropic bone
   elasticity-density relation proposed in this study.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we report a facile approach to develop an injectable

   cancer treatment. The hydrogel was based on modified chitosan and
   alginate. We conjugated doxorubicin (DOX) to succinated chitosan (S-chi)
   via a Schiff base between a ketone group in the DOX and an amine group
   in the S-chi, which led to a pH sensitive release of DOX upon the
   stimulus of an acidic tumor microenvironment. Hydrogel formed in minutes
   while DOX conjugated S-chi was mixed with oxidized alginate. The
   hydrogel structure was characterized by cryo-imaging, FTIR and a
   rheology test. The DOX release profiles were tested in response to
   different pH values. The MTT assay showed a low toxicity of the
   hydrogel. The gel in turn inhibited the growth of tumor cells MCF-7
   effectively when loaded with DOX. Finally, the DOX laden hydrogel was
   injected into the xenograft breast tumor model and significantly
   inhibited tumor growth.}},

Title = {{On the development of a new pre-weld thermal treatment procedure for
   preventing heat-affected zone (HAZ) liquation cracking in nickel-base IN
   738 superalloy}},
Journal = {{PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{94}},

Pages = {{3295-3316}},
Abstract = {{Hot cracking in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of precipitation
   strengthened nickel-base superalloys, such as IN 738, during fusion
   welding remains a major factor limiting reparability of nickel-base gas
   turbine components. The problem of HAZ intergranular cracking can be
   addressed by modifying the microstructure of the pre-weld material
   through thermal treatment, which requires significant understanding of
   the critical factors controlling cracking behaviour. The decomposition
   of Mo-Cr-W- and Cr-rich borides in the alloy, among other factors, has
   been observed to contribute significantly to non-equilibrium
   intergranular liquation and, hence, intergranular liquation cracking
   during welding. Gleeble physical simulation of HAZ microstructure has
   also shown that non-equilibrium liquation is more severe in the vicinity
   of decomposed borides in the alloy and can occur at temperatures as low
   as 1,150 degrees C. Although currently existing pre-weld heat treatments
   for IN 738 superalloy minimize the contributions of dissolution of
   second phases, including borides, to HAZ intergranular liquation, these
   heat treatments are not industrially feasible due to process-related
   difficulties. Therefore, a new industrially feasible and effective
   pre-weld thermal treatment process, designated as FUMT, was developed
   during the present research by controlling both the formation of borides
   and the segregation of boron at the grain boundaries in the pre-weld
   heat-treated material. This thermal treatment was observed to very
   significantly reduce intergranular HAZ cracking in welded IN 738
   superalloy. The details of the development process and developed
   procedure are presented in this paper.}},

Title = {{Framework for Characterizing Truck Traffic Related to Petroleum Well
   Development and Production in Unconventional Shale Plays}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2410}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Abstract = {{Technological developments have stimulated rapid change and growth in
   North America's petroleum industry. This growth has placed significant
   demand on local and regional transportation infrastructure. This paper
   develops and applies an integrated framework for characterizing
   petroleum-related truck traffic to support the engineering and planning
   efforts needed to accommodate the growth. The framework draws from
   standard methodologies used for monitoring truck traffic and modeling
   freight transport demand and illustrates how these methodologies
   interrelate through their reliance on common data sources and their
   mutual goal of characterizing current and future truck traffic. Specific
   data sources relevant to the petroleum industry are identified within
   the context of the framework, although the framework is generic and
   transferable to other jurisdictions and industries with unique truck
   travel demands. An illustrative application of the framework for the
   petroleum industry reveals new insights about the industry that enable a
   better engineering and planning response to its transportation needs.
   The application examples also demonstrate how data describing exogenous
   industry factors, activity system variables, and transportation supply
   variables integrate with data collected by truck traffic monitoring
   programs to (a) clarify the interpretation of traditional truck traffic
   monitoring data, (b) provide direction in the design of a monitoring
   program, and (c) justify adjustments to standard monitoring procedures.
   However, successful data integration is limited by the difficulty in
   appropriately fusing quantitative and qualitative data sources, the
   increased reliance on industry intelligence, and the challenge of
   representatively observing a dynamic industry.}},

Abstract = {{Heat production by 14.0\% moisture content (MC) canola seeds was
   determined at 30 degrees C and 20 degrees C under airtight and
   non-airtight storage conditions by using a transient method. The 14.0\%
   MC canola seeds were placed inside copper balls (15 cm diameter with 1.5
   mm wall thickness). The balls were located at the center of cubic
   plywood boxes (50 cm long in each inner dimension) which were filled
   with 8.0\% MC canola seeds. The plywood boxes were insulated with
   Styrofoam (14.5 cm thickness). Thermocouples were installed inside and
   outside the boxes and balls at 27 locations. The heat production rate
   was calculated by using finite element, analytical, and Fourier law
   methods. The heat production rate calculated by the finite element
   method was the heat production rate of the 14.0\% MC canola, while the
   analytical and Fourier law methods overestimated and underestimated the
   heat production rate, respectively. The mean heat production rates at 30
   degrees C non-airtight, 30 degrees C airtight, and 20 degrees C
   non-airtight conditions were 0.102 +/- 0.001, 0.084 +/- 0.003, and 0.036
   +/- 0.001 W kg(-1), respectively. Accumulated heat increased with
   increase of temperature and decrease of airtightness. The dry mass loss
   of canola seeds due to respiration of microflora was in accordance with
   heat production, moisture content increment under airtight condition,
   and microorganism infestation. The measured heat production ratios were
   higher than or equal to the theoretical value when only glucose was used
   as substrate for decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{We present a passive tag capable of detecting basic volatiles in the
   surrounding environment. The tag is based on a voltage dependant
   frequency shift approach using a LC resonator comprised of a spiral
   inductor in parallel with a varactor. The volatile detector, comprised
   of a pair of pH-sensitive electrodes coated with a very thin layer of
   hydrogel, is connected in parallel with the varactor. The hydrogel is
   utilized as an absorptive medium for the basic volatiles and acts to
   contain the electrolyte. Due to the absorption of the basic volatile,
   the hydrogel pH changes which in turn changes the voltage across the
   pH-sensitive electrode pair shifting the resonant frequency of the tag.
   An interrogator coil is inductively coupled to the tag inductor to
   remotely track the resonant frequency of tag at distances ranging from 5
   to 11 cm. Tests with ammonia show that the tag has a detection limit of
   1.5 ppm. With less than a 20 min response time, the tag has potential
   for application in food freshness monitoring where detecting basic
   volatiles is important.}},

Abstract = {{The article refers to the problem of regression functions estimation in
   the points situated near the edges but outside of function domain. We
   investigate the model y(i) = R(x(i)) + epsilon(i), i = 1, 2, ... n,
   where xi is assumed to be the set of deterministic inputs, x(i) is an
   element of D, y(i) is the set of probabilistic outputs, and epsilon(i) i
   is a measurement noise with zero mean and bounded variance. R(.) is a
   completely unknown function. In the literature the possible ways of
   finding unknown function are based on the algorithms derived from the
   Parzen kernel. These algorithms were also applied to estimation of the
   derivatives of unknown functions. The commonly known disadvantage of the
   kernel algorithms is that the error of estimation dramatically increases
   if the point of estimation x is approaching to the left or right bound
   of interval D. Algorithms on predicting values in the boundary region
   outside the function domain D are unknown for the author, so far.
   The main result of this paper is a new algorithm based on integral
   version of Parzen methods for local prediction of values of the function
   R near boundaries in the region outside domain. The results of numerical
   experiments are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The article refers to the problem of regression functions estimation in
   the presence of nonstationary noise. We investigate the model y(i) =
   R(x(i)) + epsilon(i), i = 1, 2, ... n, where xi is assumed to be the
   d-dimensional vector, set of deterministic inputs, x(i) is an element of
   S-d, y(i) is the scalar, set of probabilistic outputs, and epsilon(i) is
   a measurement noise with zero mean and variance depending on n. R(.) is
   a completely unknown function. One of the possible solutions of finding
   function R(.) is to apply non-parametric methodology - algorithms based
   on the Parzen kernel or algorithms derived from orthogonal series. The
   novel result of this article is the analysis of convergence for some
   class of nonstationarity. We present the conditions when the algorithm
   of estimation is convergent even when the variance of noise is divergent
   with number of observations tending to infinity. The results of
   numerical experiments are presented.}},

Title = {{Analysis of Imposed Bridge Load Stresses for Development of a European
   Bridge Formula}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2406}},
Pages = {{3-11}},
Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the characteristics of international bridge
   formulas developed and implemented by different countries and analyzes
   the imposed bridge load effects resulting from trucks complying with
   international bridge formula allowable loads and truck size and weight
   regulations in Europe. This evaluation was done to identify issues that
   may need to be considered in the development of a European bridge
   formula for the regulation of truck size and weight limits associated
   with international travel between European Union member states.
   Differences in national weight limits in European Union countries and
   the increasing demand for larger and heavier vehicles bring about the
   need to ensure the structural integrity and service life of bridges.
   Bridge formulas provide a method for regulating truck weights while
   ensuring the sustainability of infrastructure by allowing vehicle
   configurations that have an acceptable load effect on structures. This
   method allows for long-term truck size and weight evolutions for
   productivity gains while preserving the existing stock of bridges. The
   level of efficiency of a bridge formula varies depending on the design
   criteria used in the development of the formula, the compatibility of
   the jurisdiction's infrastructure and truck fleet characteristics, and
   the method of implementation as part of the regulation and by operators
   in the trucking industry. This research can help guide the development
   of a European bridge formula and contributes new knowledge for countries
   that currently apply a bridge formula to regulate truck weights.}},

Abstract = {{In the reported research, a subject-specific multibody dynamics model
   was proposed to predict impact force induced in lateral fall of the
   elderly. Parameters such as anthropometric dimensions, segment masses,
   mass center, and mass moment of inertia that are required for
   constructing the dynamics model were extracted or calculated from a
   whole body DXA image of the subject. Governing equations of the fall
   process were established and computer codes were developed for solving
   the equations. The dynamics model was then validated by a controlled
   fall test using young volunteer. Good agreements between predicted and
   experimental results were observed, indicating that the proposed
   dynamics model has the capability to predict subject-specific impact
   force induced in fall.}},

Abstract = {{The recently developed nearest-nodes finite element method (NN-FEM) has
   a number of advantages over the conventional finite element method
   (FEM). The most attractive one is that its performance is nearly not
   affected by element distortion. However, low computational efficiency of
   NN-FEM is a major concern, as in the original NN-FEM a local problem has
   to be solved at each quadrature point to construct shape functions
   there. In this paper, a new strategy is introduced in NN-FEM for
   constructing shape functions aiming at improving its computational
   efficiency. The strategy is, for regular-shape elements, shape functions
   are constructed at the element center and the obtained shape functions
   are used at all quadrature points in the element; only for severely
   distorted elements, shape functions are constructed separately at each
   quadrature point. Numerical results show that computational efficiency
   of the NN-FEM can be significantly improved with the above strategy,
   while other performance of the method is not affected.}},

Title = {{Impact of modellers' decisions on hydrological a priori predictions}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2065-2085}},
Abstract = {{In practice, the catchment hydrologist is often confronted with the task
   of predicting discharge without having the needed records for
   calibration. Here, we report the discharge predictions of 10 modellers -
   using the model of their choice - for the man-made Chicken Creek
   catchment (6 ha, northeast Germany, Gerwin et al., 2009b) and we analyse
   how well they improved their prediction in three steps based on adding
   information prior to each following step. The modellers predicted the
   catchment's hydrological response in its initial phase without having
   access to the observed records. They used conceptually different
   physically based models and their modelling experience differed largely.
   Hence, they encountered two problems: (i) to simulate discharge for an
   ungauged catchment and (ii) using models that were developed for
   catchments, which are not in a state of landscape transformation. The
   prediction exercise was organized in three steps: (1) for the first
   prediction the modellers received a basic data set describing the
   catchment to a degree somewhat more complete than usually available for
   a priori predictions of ungauged catchments; they did not obtain
   information on stream flow, soil moisture, nor groundwater response and
   had therefore to guess the initial conditions; (2) before the second
   prediction they inspected the catchment on-site and discussed their
   first prediction attempt; (3) for their third prediction they were
   offered additional data by charging them pro forma with the costs for
   obtaining this additional information.
   Hollander et al. (2009) discussed the range of predictions obtained in
   step (1). Here, we detail the modeller's assumptions and decisions in
   accounting for the various processes. We document the prediction
   progress as well as the learning process resulting from the availability
   of added information. For the second and third steps, the progress in
   prediction quality is evaluated in relation to individual modelling
   experience and costs of added information.
   In this qualitative analysis of a statistically small number of
   predictions we learned (i) that soft information such as the modeller's
   system understanding is as important as the model itself (hard
   information), (ii) that the sequence of modelling steps matters (field
   visit, interactions between differently experienced experts, choice of
   model, selection of available data, and methods for parameter guessing),
   and (iii) that added process understanding can be as efficient as adding
   data for improving parameters needed to satisfy model requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Breaking and disintegrating of biomass compacts while they are being
   dried in superheated steam (SS) is a common problem observed during the
   initial stage of SS drying. The present work investigated the moisture
   and temperature changes, volume and density variation, crushing
   resistance, and tensile strength of single cylindrical compacts produced
   from wet distiller's spent grain (WDG) under SS drying conditions. The
   wet compacts were dried in SS at 110, 130, and 150 degrees C with SS
   velocities of 0.9, 1.1, and 1.4 m/s. For a specific temperature and
   velocity, the compacts were exposed to SS for time periods of 5, 120,
   300, and 600 s and the changes in physical properties were analyzed. An
   increase in a percentage increase in volume by 78-130\% and a decrease
   in density by 51-61\% were observed as a result of drying the compact in
   SS. The results obtained from the study were compared with hot-air dried
   compacts for 600 s, indicating that SS drying had a substantial role in
   stimulating the relaxation of stresses stored in the compacts as
   compared with a convection hot-air drying process.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructure evolution during in situ electron irradiation at room
   temperature within the transmission electron microscope has been studied
   on commercial purity magnesium. Magnesium foils of purity 99.8\% were
   examined for comparative studies of defect structure formed by 200 keV
   electrons and 1 MeV krypton ions. Transmission electron microscopy has
   been used to quantify the type and nature of the microstructural changes
   taking place during irradiation. Hexagonal- shaped faulted c-component
   dislocation loops with Burgers vector of 1/6/< 20 (2) over bar(3) over
   bar > are formed by electron irradiation. Formation of inner un- faulted
   loops also takes place inside the faulted loops. Analysis shows that all
   the faulted c- component dislocation loops are interstitial in nature
   and growth rate of these loops is proportional to the irradiation time.
   Dislocation loops with Burgers vector 1/3 < 11 (2) over bar0 > also form
   but most of these loops shrink and disappear during subsequent electron
   irradiation. In some of the foils, only the pre- existing dislocations
   in the microstructure were observed to transform into vacancy type 1/3 <
   11 (2) over bar0 > loops and helical configurations and no other
   irradiation damage appeared. Ion irradiation for a dose up to 0.1 dpa
   produced dislocation loops with Burgers vector of 1/3 < 11 (2) over bar0

Abstract = {{A basal ganglia central pattern generator (CPG) is developed and its
   role in voluntary movements on the ground and postural reactions on a
   disturbed platform are studied and analysed by simulation. Biped
   dynamics and platform kinematics are utilised. The effects of
   agonist-antagonist muscular co-activation and joint stiffness are
   formulated. The implementation of the necessary counter-manoeuvres for
   maintaining balance and postural stability is studied. A control
   strategy, applicable to large systems, is formulated. The biped
   manoeuvres and transitions terminate in pre-specified intervals of time.
   Gravity is included and compensated for. Certain voluntary and postural
   adjustment strategies are the same but are initiated differently.
   Further experimental/computational research may identify the central
   nervous system and sensory paths that lead to the CPG. All actuator
   forces linearly evolve in time from their original values to their
   terminal values. There are no central continuous feedback loops present.
   Monitoring and sensing, however, are ongoing. The counter-manoeuvres are
   based on learned human-like voluntary movements that are triggered by
   the disturbance. The required central inputs to the musculoskeletal
   system are designed in the CPG. A functional structure for the CPG is
   proposed. The effect of certain disorders and malfunctions of the CPG
   are studied by simulation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a review of the up-to-date research on the treatment
   of micropollutants by UV-based processes. More than 140 scientific
   publications in the past 10 years were reviewed and analyzed, with
   emphasis on the peer-reviewed papers in the last three years
   (2009-2011). Previous studies showed that UV-based advanced oxidation
   processes (AOPs) could be efficient for the removal of a number of
   micropollutants in drinking water and wastewater although direct UV
   photolysis at disinfection dosages was proven not effective in removing
   most micropollutants. Among those UV-based AOPs, UV-oxidation with
   hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has attracted great attention and shown
   numerous advantages as an advanced technology for micropollutants
   control. The public concern about the impact of micropollutants on the
   safety of drinking water and the increasing needs of safe water reuse
   will likely facilitate the application of UV-based processes for
   micropollutants control in drinking water treatment and water reuse.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we present a novel image analysis methodology to quantify
   and to classify morphological details in tissue collagen fibril
   organization and lipid deposition. Co-localized collagen (second
   harmonic, SHG) and lipid (coherent Raman, CARS) images of
   atherosclerotic artery walls were acquired by a supercontinuum-powered
   multi-modal nonlinear microscope. Textural features based on the
   first-order statistics (FOS) and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)
   parameters were extracted from the SHG and CARS images. Multi-group
   classifications based on support vector machine of SHG and CARS images
   were subsequently performed to investigate the potential of texture
   analysis in providing quantitative descriptors of structural and
   compositional changes during disease progression. Using a rabbit model,
   different collagen remodeling and lipid accumulation patterns in disease
   tissues can be successfully tracked using these image statistics, thus
   providing a robust foundation for classification. When the variation of
   the CARS image features were tracked against the age of the rabbit, it
   was noticed that older animals (advanced plaques) present a more complex
   necrotic core containing high-lipid extracellular structures with
   various shapes and distribution. With combined FOS and GLCM texture
   statistics, we achieved reliable classification of SHG and CARS images
   acquired from atherosclerotic arteries with >90\% accuracy, sensitivity
   and specificity. The proposed image analysis methodology can also be
   applied in a wide range of applications to evaluate conditions involving
   collagen re-modeling and prominent lipid accumulation.}},

Abstract = {{A robust capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer has been
   developed. In this novel configuration, a stack of two deflectable
   membranes are suspended over a fixed bottom electrode. Similar to
   conventional capacitive ultrasonic transducers, a generated
   electrostatic force between the electrodes causes the membranes to
   deflect and vibrate. However, in this new configuration the transducer
   effective cavity height is reduced due to the deflection of two
   membranes. Therefore, the transducer spring constant is more susceptible
   to bias voltage, which in return reduces the required bias voltage. The
   transducers have been produced employing a MEMS sacrificial technique
   where two different membrane anchoring (curved-and flat-anchors)
   structures, with similar membrane radii were fabricated. Highly doped
   polysilicon was used as the membrane material. The resonant frequencies
   of the two transducers have been investigated. It was found that the
   transducers with curved membrane anchors exhibits a larger resonant
   frequency shift compared to the transducers with flat membranes for a
   given bias voltage. Comparison has been made between the spring constant
   of the flat membrane transducer and that of a conventional single
   membrane transducer. It is shown that the multiple moving membrane
   transducer exhibits a larger reduction in the spring constant compared
   to the conventional transducer, when driven with the same bias voltage.
   This results in a transducer with a higher power generation capability
   and sensitivity.}},

   and 6 W, respectively, using a 10 \% output coupler. The slope and
   optical-to-optical efficiencies in both cases were around 47\% and 40\%,

Abstract = {{Seed major and minor axes of three canola varieties with high oil
   content (45H29 at 8\%, 10\%, and 12\% moisture content wet basis, and
   Invigor 5440 and Nex4 105 at 10\% moisture content) and one low-oil
   canola variety (5525 Clearfield at 10\% moisture content) were measured
   at room temperature. Bulk density, angles of repose, and coefficients of
   friction against four structural surfaces were determined for two
   varieties of high-oil canola (Invigor 5440 and Nex4 105) and for
   mixtures of them (at ratios of 1: 1, 1: 2, and 2: 1) at four moisture
   contents (8\%, 10\%, 12\%, and 14\%). The same physical properties were
   determined for the third high-oil canola (45H29) and for the low-oil
   canola (5525 Clearfield) at three moisture contents (8\%, 10\%, and
   12\%). The four structural surfaces were galvanized steel, plywood,
   wood-floated concrete, and steel-troweled concrete. Major and minor axes
   of 45H29 increased with increasing moisture content. Oil content did not
   affect the axes of canola seeds. Bulk densities were significantly
   different between Invigor 5440 and Nex4 105. Mixtures of the high-oil
   canola varieties had bulk density values between those of the canola
   varieties that were used in the mixtures. Bulk density decreased with
   increasing oil content. Angles of repose depended more on canola variety
   and surface properties than on oil content. The coefficient of friction
   against structural surfaces was not significantly affected by moisture
   content but was affected by oil content. Bins used to store low-oil

Abstract = {{This letter addresses the cross-polarization properties of

   antennas. As for the offset reflectors, the primary multimode feed
   required to displace the phase-center location may produce a significant
   crosstalk in the orthogonal polarization. It is shown how one can
   improve the cross-polarization performances of aforementioned adaptive
   antennas, which are capable of providing axial beams while their
   phase-center locations are displaced. The conventional array technique
   with a simple signal processing is used for the symmetric case, whereas
   a trimode primary feed is employed for the offset case.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{We present an experimental evaluation of three schemes that enable a
   hydraulic manipulator to be controlled by two commercially available
   hand-controllers. The tested hydraulic telemanipulator is employed to
   partially substitute for, and work cooperatively with, linemen for live
   transmission line maintenance. The two hand-controllers are a
   seven-function joystick, which is provided by the manipulator
   manufacturer, and a PHANToM haptic device. The effectiveness of each
   scheme is validated by conducting several live power line maintenance
   tasks in a laboratory setting. First, the performance of the hydraulic
   telemanipulator is evaluated under joint-mode (JM) control scheme,
   whereby the hydraulic manipulator is guided through direct mapping of
   the angular displacements of joystick joints to the angular
   displacements of manipulator joints. The performance of the entire
   system is evaluated using three indices: task completion time, control
   effort, and amount of the manipulator end-effector movement to
   accomplish a task. The same tests are repeated when the operator runs
   the system under coordinated-mode (CM) control scheme, in which the
   position of the PHANToM haptic device end-effector is mapped onto the
   position of the hydraulic manipulator implement. In the CM scheme, the
   force capability of the haptic device is not utilized. The tasks under
   the JM scheme are shown to require more time to complete than under the
   CM scheme. Besides, the control effort and the distance travelled by
   manipulator end-effector, under the CM scheme, are smaller, as compared
   to the JM scheme. To further enhance the performance, an impedance-type
   forbidden-region virtual fixture is added to the CM scheme using the
   haptic capability of the PHANToM device. The virtual fixture generates a
   force helping the operator avoid unwanted movements in performing
   repetitive maintenance tasks. Examination of the performance of the
   proposed augmented coordinated-mode (ACM) control scheme demonstrates
   the best performance. Qualitative studies indicate the participants
   acknowledge that the proposed system is helpful for novice linemen to
   get familiarized with maintenance activities and for experts to perform
   tasks easier using robotics technology.}},

Abstract = {{High fertilizer inputs and uncontrolled subsurface drainage can result
   in the export of nutrients from farmland, leading to negative
   environmental impacts. Controlled drainage can be an effective best
   management practice to minimize the export of nutrients. However,
   information about controlled drainage in the Canadian Prairies is
   scarce. The objective of this study was to compare free drainage with
   overhead irrigation (FDIR) to controlled drainage with subirrigation
   (CDSI) in terms of nitrogen, phosphorus, and salt exports from corn
   fields in the Canadian Prairies. The irrigation water had low
   concentrations of nitrate (<= 0.2 mg L-1) and orthophosphate (<0.1 mg
   L-1) and low electrical conductivity (0.55 dS m(-1)), which were assumed
   to have low influence on the export of nutrients and salts. In 2010, the
   exports of NO3-N (138 kg ha(-1)), PO4-P (0.6 kg ha(-1)), and salts (2.34
   Mg ha(-1)) from the FDIR treatment during the growing season were
   significantly larger (p < 0.05) than exports from the CDSI treatment,
   which were 0.07 kg ha(-1), 0.08 kg ha(-1), and 0.41 Mg ha(-1),
   respectively. This comparison did not include the drainage outflow
   arising from spring snowmelt due to delays in the installation of
   monitoring equipment. In 2011, which included the drainage outflow due
   to spring snowmelt events, the exports of NO3-N (36 kg ha(-1)), PO4-P
   (0.27 kg ha(-1)), and salts (1.1 Mg ha(-1)) from FDIR were significantly
   larger (p < 0.05) than the exports from CDSI, which were 10 kg ha(-1),
   0.08 kg ha(-1), and 0.39 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Therefore, controlled
   drainage with subirrigation (CDSI) showed significant reductions in
   export of NO3-N (71\%), PO4-P (69\%), and salts (64\%) compared to free
   drainage with overhead irrigation (FDIR). This study shows the advantage
   of controlled drainage over free drainage in reducing the export of
   nutrients and salts.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of wheat classes and seed moisture contents not only
   determines the end use of wheat flour but also helps in developing
   effective storage systems for wheat. Samples of four classes of wheat,
   including Canada Western Red Spring (CWRS), Canada Western Hard White
   Spring (CWHWS), Canada Western Soft White Spring (CWSWS), and Canada
   Prairie Spring Red (CPSR), were obtained from at least five different
   locations for each class in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta for the
   2007, 2008, and 2009 crop years and conditioned to moisture contents of
   13\%, 16\%, and 19\%. Near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral images were
   acquired from bulk samples in the 960-1700 nm wavelength region at 10 nm
   intervals. The first and second principal component score images were
   compared for the segmented images of all wheat classes. Pairwise wheat
   class identification was done using a non-parametric statistical model
   and a four-layer back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model. The NIR
   wavelengths of 1260 to 1380 nm had the highest factor loadings for the
   first principal component using principal component analysis (PCA). The
   four-layer BPNN model was used for two-class identification of wheat
   classes. Overall average pairwise classification accuracies of 83.7\%
   were obtained for discriminating wheat samples based on their moisture
   contents. Average classification accuracies of 83.2\%, 75.4\%, and
   73.1\%, were obtained for identifying wheat classes for samples with
   13\%, 16\%, and 19\% moisture content (m.c.), respectively. In this
   study, discriminant models yielded better classification accuracies than
   BPNN models. Overall average classification accuracies of wheat classes
   using statistical models were 80.6\% for the linear discriminant
   analysis (LDA) and 76.3\% for the quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA).
   This work showed that NIR hyperspectral imaging can be used as a
   potential nondestructive tool for classifying moisture-specific wheat
   classes.}},

Title = {{Scalar Potential Formulations for Magnetic Fields Produced by Arbitrary
   Electric Current Distributions in the Presence of Ferromagnetic Bodies}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1, 2}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper it is shown how to analyze stationary or quasistationary
   magnetic fields due to arbitrary distributions of electric current in
   terms of single-valued scalar potentials. The total scalar potential in
   a specified region outside the magnetic material bodies, not containing
   electric currents, is obtained by superposing two single-valued
   Laplacian scalar potentials. One is produced by the given current
   distribution in an unbounded space and is determined from the free-space
   values of the normal component of the magnetic field intensity over the
   region boundary. The other one is defined in the entire region outside
   the magnetic bodies and is employed in order to satisfy the boundary
   conditions. When the magnetic bodies can be considered to be linear and
   homogeneous or piecewise homogeneous, with no electric current within
   them, the field inside the bodies can also be expressed in terms of
   Laplacian scalar potentials. If the material of the bodies can be
   approximated to be ideal ferromagnetic, then the exterior field problem
   is a Dirichlet problem and is solved independently of the field inside
   the bodies. The Neumann boundary condition for the interior field
   problem is provided from the solution of the exterior problem.
   Differential equation and integral equation formulations, as well as an
   illustrative application example, are presented. Since the resultant
   field is computed in terms of only single-valued scalar potentials, the
   solution techniques based on the formulations presented in this paper
   are considerably more efficient than those in usual solution methods.}},

   Inhomogeneous Media and Application to Snow-Covered Sea Ice}},
Journal = {{PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{144}},
Pages = {{201-219}},
Abstract = {{In this study a new analytical formulation for electromagnetic wave
   scattering from rough boundaries interfacing inhomogeneous media is
   presented based on the first-order approximation of the small
   perturbation method. First, we considered a scattering problem for a
   single rough boundary embedded in a piecewise continuously layered
   medium. As a key step, we introduced auxiliary wave propagation problems
   that are aimed to link reflection and transmission coefficients in the
   layered media with particular solutions of one-dimensional wave
   equations at the mean level of the rough interface. This approach
   enabled us to express the final solution in a closed form avoiding a
   prior discretization of the inhomogeneous medium. Second, we naturally
   extended the obtained solution to an arbitrary number of rough
   interfaces separating continuously layered media. As a validation step,
   we demonstrated that available solutions in the literature represent
   special cases of our general solution. Furthermore, we showed that our
   numerical results agree well with published data. Finally, as a
   particular special case, we presented a formulation for scattering from
   inhomogeneous snow-covered sea ice when the dominant scattering occurs
   at the snow-ice and air-snow interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{We report a reducible copolymer self-assembled with superparamagnetic
   iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) to deliver doxorubicin (DOX) for
   cancer therapy. The copolymer of reducible polyamidoamine (rPAA) with
   poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG)/dodecyl amine graft was synthesized by
   Michael addition. rPAA@SPIONs were formed by the alkyl grafts of
   reducible copolymers intercalated with the oleic acid layer capped on
   the surface of magnetite nanocrystals. The intercalating area formed a
   reservoir for hydrophobic anti-cancer drug (DOX), whilst the PEG moiety
   in the copolymers helped the nanoparticle well-dispersible in aqueous
   solution. We employed two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and
   coherent anti-Stokes Raman (CARS) to investigate drug delivery in
   intra-cellular structures of live cells, and used Vivaview (R) technique
   to show real-time inhibition efficacy of nanoparticles in live cells.
   rPAA@SPIONs present efficiently drug loading with reducible
   responsibility in vitro tests. Finally, rPAA@SPIONs were tested in mice
   with xenograft MDA-MB-231 breast tumor though i.v. injection and
   inhibited tumor growth efficiently. MRI was used to monitor
   nanoparticles aggregation in tumor site. Histology and Prussian blue on
   kidney, liver, and heart in mice indicated that DOX/rPAA@SPIONs showed
   no significant toxicity for mice organs after 24 days treatment. (C)

Abstract = {{Sampling and trapping are important methods to detect insect infestation
   and estimate the abundance of species (species richness) within stored
   grain. Sampling and trapping were conducted inside a hopper-bottom bin
   holding 50-t wheat with 10.5\% moisture content at 25 +/- 5 degrees C.
   Adult rusty grain beetles, Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens), were
   introduced into the bin to create overall insect densities of 0.1, 1.0,
   or 5.0 adults per kilogram of wheat (A/kg). Twenty Insector (R) traps
   (OPI Systems Inc., Calgary, AB, Canada) were installed at four layers
   within the grain mass. Every week, 0.5- and 15-kg grain samples were
   manually extracted near five Insector (R) locations within the top layer
   of the grain mass. The success of insect detection, accuracy of insect
   density estimation, and characterized insect distribution pattern were
   evaluated using data collected by the Insector (R) system and the manual
   samples. It was found the Insector (R) system could detect adults within
   6 h after adults were introduced. The 0.5-kg samples could not detect
   the existence of insects or estimate insect densities when insect
   density was 0.1 A/kg. Depending on the insect density, up to ten 15-kg
   samples (sampled at the top layer) were required to detect the existence
   of adults. The estimated insect densities by the Insector (R) system
   were closer to the introduced insect densities than the manual sampling
   methods when the introduced insect densities were 0.1 or 1.0 A/kg. There
   was no significant difference in estimated insect densities between the
   Insector (R) system and the 15-kg sampling method when introduced insect
   density was 0.1 or 1.0 A/kg. The characterized adult distribution
   pattern was the same using either the data collected by the Insector (R)
   system or 15-kg samples, while 0.5-kg samples characterized different
   insect distribution patterns. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by

Title = {{How many kilograms of grain per sample unit is big enough? Part II -
   Simulation of sampling from grain mass with different insect densities
   and distribution patterns}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STORED PRODUCTS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{67-80}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{To find representative sampling sizes and units, adult numbers and
   distributions inside 2700 kg wheat were generated by a computer program.
   The generated densities of insects with uniform or clumped distributions
   inside the grain mass were: 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 adults/kg
   of grain (A/kg). The grain mass was artificially sampled by the computer
   program using different combinations of sampling sizes and units. The
   simulated sampling sizes (number of samples in one sampling set) were:
   5, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 100. The simulated sampling units were: 0.5, 1.0,
   2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, and 13.5 kg. When 100 sampling size and a 13.5 kg
   sampling unit were applied, 50\% of the total grain was sampled.
   Simulation results revealed that more samples were required to detect
   clumped distributed insects than uniformly distributed insects. Both
   sample size and unit should be increased with the decrease of insect
   densities. When insect density was 0.1 A/kg, using 2.5-7.5 kg sampling
   units would sample less grain mass than that using other sample units to
   detect insects. To estimate insect density with certain accuracy,
   sampling size and unit should be properly selected. Using sampling
   method to estimate insect densities with less than 60\% of percent
   relative variance might not be practical when insect densities were less
   than 1.0 A/kg. Insect distribution could be incorrectly characterized
   when sampling size and unit were not chosen correctly. When insect
   densities were <= 0.5 A/kg, >= 100 sampling sizes with >= 10.0 kg
   sampling unit were required to accurately characterize insect
   distribution. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effect of different rotor asymmetry rotation faults
   on the power loss variations in Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) is
   studied deeply. To fulfill this objective, SRM's core losses including
   hysteresis and eddy current losses accompanied with its copper losses
   are firstly introduced theoretically in detail. Then a 6 by 4 SRM is
   simulated and motor profiles as well as power losses factors are
   measured in presence of three common eccentricity faults namely as;
   static eccentricity (SE), dynamic eccentricity (DE), and mixed
   eccentricity (ME) faults. The numerical analysis and simulations are
   done by the three-dimensional Time-Step Finite Element Method
   (3D-TSFEM). In next step, a similar test rig is designed and built for
   experimental measurements and confirmations. It was realized that, these
   types of eccentricity faults directly affect the power loss value and
   can enhance it abundantly. In other word, the more severity in fault
   levels conclude the more reduction in output power and the more
   increment in power losses that can be used as diagnosis index. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A new sea ice motion tracking algorithm that operates with two
   sequential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR images is
   presented. The feature tracking approach is based on the combination of
   the phase-correlation and cross-correlation methods. An algorithm for
   selecting control points, a matching technique, an approach for
   filtering out error vectors, and a confidence levels setting for output
   drift vectors were specifically developed in order to increase the
   system's robustness and accuracy. We evaluated ice motion tracking
   results derived from HH and HV channels of RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR imagery
   and formulated a condition where the HV channel is more reliable than
   the HH channel for ice tracking. Furthermore, we found that the ice
   motion tracking from the HV channel is not affected by noise floor
   stripes, which are prominent in the cross-polarization RADARSAT-2
   ScanSAR images. The developed sea ice tracking technology was
   implemented at the Canadian Ice Service, Environment Canada for
   operational use. The system was successfully run to provide operational
   support of field work in the Arctic Ocean in compliance with the United
   Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in the spring of 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Energy efficiency in cognitive radio networks (CRN) is of paramount
   importance since secondary users (SU) are often likely to be energy
   constrained. While spectrum sensing (SS) is a critical CRN function,
   repetitive SS events can significantly reduce the battery life of
   sensing devices. However, energy efficiency can be improved by employing
   spectrum opportunity forecasting (SOF) and optimal scheduling for sensor
   node activation to reduce the required number of SS events. In this
   paper, a combination of SOF and optimal scheduling is thus explored. The
   application of SOF to cooperative SS is one of the unique contributions
   of this paper. Results indicated that this combination could
   significantly reduce sensor node energy consumption and in so doing
   increase CRN lifetime. A positive linear relationship was found between
   forecast length and CRN lifetime. A very large improvement in the
   collective lifetime of the sensor network was observed when SOF was
   employed (roughly 21.2 time samples longer than when only optimal
   scheduling was employed) for a forecast length of ten SS events, using
   implicit enumeration under the uniform sensor node distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Stability analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems involves identifying
   the basins of attraction (BoA) of attractors which is a challenging
   task. The research on this topic can be categorized into three groups:
   Non-Lyapunov-based, Lyapunov-function-based, and
   Lyapunov-exponents-based methods. Non-Lyapunov-based methods have low
   computational load, but their predictability is low.
   Lyapunov-function-based methods have strong mathematical background, but
   not only are not exclusive about the BoA, but also are not feasible for
   most of the real world applications. Lyapunov-exponents-based methods
   are capable of performing the task for highly complex systems. However,
   their computational load is high. In this paper a novel approach is
   introduced which employs Lyapunov exponents, to benefit from its
   advantages, and Monte Carlo techniques to reduce the load of
   computations. The method is demonstrated by two illustrative examples.}},

Abstract = {{The Engineering Access Program at the University of Manitoba has been in
   existence since 1985. It started with the mandate to improve the
   recruitment and retention of Manitoba First Nation/Metis/Inuit people in
   the Faculty of Engineering by introducing a selection of supports to
   them.
   In order to improve the recruitment of First Nation/Metis/Inuit people
   into the Faculty of Engineering the prerequisite courses necessary for
   them to enter engineering have been waived while keeping the
   requirements to obtain a degree the same.
   First Nation/Metis/Inuit students that do not have the prerequisites to
   enter the engineering faculty are required to successfully complete
   upgrading (or preparatory) courses in mathematics, physics, computer
   programming and chemistry.
   In addition to the upgrading courses First Nation/Metis/Inuit student
   supports are comprised primarily of academic support, social support,
   financial aid, and personal support.
   First Nation/Metis/Inuit students entering the Engineering Access
   Program must also attend a mandatory summer orientation aimed at
   preparing them for University studies.
   The Engineering Access Program boasts 95 graduates of First
   Nation/Metis/Inuit descent that work throughout the western provinces in
   various areas.}},

Abstract = {{This work explores the utility of an agent based model (ABM) for
   studying malaria prevalence and transmission. Malaria is a
   life-threatening disease caused by Plasmodium parasites that are
   transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes of
   the genus Anopheles. According to the WHO, malaria caused an estimated
   627,000 deaths in 2012 (with an uncertainty range of 473,000 to
   789,000), mostly among African children {[}1]{[}2]. Increased malaria
   prevention and control measures are the focus of much research and have
   already dramatically reduced the malaria burden in many places. Through
   the use of technology and high-resolution modeling and simulation, an
   even better understanding of prevention and control measures may be
   obtained.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an enhanced crowdsourcing that may be the only

   requires radio operators that can work not only together with other

   they can also work on their own, if the other media either fail or do
   not exist in the area. In order to increase the number of such radio
   operators, a scheme for accelerated radio education and training is
   required. This paper describes the structure of such a course, its

Abstract = {{We model and analyze a K-tier uplink cellular network with flexible cell
   association where all transmissions are powered by energy harvesting
   from ambient interference. Each cellular user transmits data to the
   corresponding base station (BS) only when the amount of energy harvested
   is sufficient to perform channel inversion towards the serving BS.
   Furthermore, the data transmitted can be successfully decoded only when
   the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiver is
   above a predefined threshold. With flexible cell association, users are
   not necessarily associated with their nearest BS where a different bias
   factor is added to each network tier. We use tools from stochastic
   geometry to evaluate the performance of the proposed system model in
   terms of the coverage probability of a generic user associated with the
   k-th tier. We show that energy harvesting can be a reliable source to
   power cellular users with short-range communication, e.g., small cell
   users. In addition, we show that energy harvesting can achieve high
   coverage performance by optimizing different network parameters such as
   the BS receiver sensitivity as well as the bias factors.}},

Abstract = {{Spectrum auction has been considered as an economically incentive way to
   motivate both primary spectrum owners (POs) and secondary users (SUs) to
   participate in dynamic spectrum access (DSA). In this paper, we propose
   a new combinatorial spectrum auction framework for the scenarios that
   each PO has multiple channels to sell and each SU demands multiple
   channels. Moreover, the heterogeneity in terms of POs' channel
   bandwidths and SUs' demands is also considered. The winner determination
   problem (WDP) in the proposed auction framework can be formulated as a
   multiple multidimensional knapsack problem (MMKP) and both upper bound
   and an approximation algorithm with polynomial time are developed. A
   tailored pricing mechanism is adopted in the payment design to ensure
   truthfulness and individual rationality. Numerical results show that our
   proposed auction algorithm can improve the spectrum allocation
   efficiency compared to counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{We consider joint subchannel and power allocation for an orthogonal
   frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based cognitive radio
   network. We formulate the downlink resource allocation problem as a
   spectral-footprint (bandwidth-power product) minimization problem under
   interference threshold at primary users, total power and quality of
   service constraints. The cognitive base station solves this non-convex
   mixed-integer programming problem iteratively by dividing it into a
   subchannel allocation master problem and power allocation subproblems.
   The subchannel assignment problem is solved by applying a modified
   Hungarian algorithm while the power allocation subproblems are solved by
   using Lagrangian techniques. Specifically, we propose a low-complexity
   modified Hungarian algorithm for subchannel allocation which exploits
   the local information in the cost matrix. The performance of our
   spectral-footprint minimization technique is compared with the
   waterfilling power allocation.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an energy-efficient resource allocation scheme for downlink
   transmission in two-tier Network MIMO OFDMA-based macrocell-femtocell
   networks where the femtocells form clusters of equal size. The proposed
   scheme uses a joint zero-forcing beamforming with semi-orthogonal user
   selection (ZFBF-SUS) transmission at each network tier to perform
   allocation of subcarrier and precoding coefficients. Then, power
   allocation is optimized in order to maximize the total system energy
   efficiency (i.e., average number of successfully transmitted bits per
   energy unit {[}bit/Joule], or equivalently, the average data rate per
   unit power {[}bps/Watt]). The macro base stations (MBSs) and the femto
   base stations (FBSs) in a cluster maximize their energy efficiency in a
   distributed manner while considering the cross-tier interference and the
   capacity limitations of backhaul links. The problem of maximizing energy
   efficiency is formulated as a fractional program and solved by using the
   Dinkelbach iterative algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed
   scheme outperforms the scheme that maximizes the system average
   capacity, in terms of energy efficiency, and also improves the total
   system performance in terms of energy efficiency and average system
   capacity when compared to a single-tier system.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a simple topology for electronic differential in an
   electric vehicle with four independent In-wheel motors is proposed.
   Based on inputs of the steering wheel angle and the acceleration pedal
   position, this method uses real-time power management and produces
   different torque references for the four wheels and, consequently the
   angular velocity of each wheel will be adjusted. Using slip-ratio
   calculations the proposed algorithm extracts maximum output torque by
   optimizing the operating-point slip ratio. The paper also highlights an
   application of deployed in-wheel motors in yaw stability and suggests a
   simple yaw control strategy. The proposed electronic differential method
   is first investigated using MATLAB and is then implemented on a
   real-time digital simulator, which is then connected to a small motor to
   verify its performance in a hardware-in-loop scheme.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed an MR compatible PET insert prototype to enable
   simultaneous PET-MR imaging of small animals inside a 7T animal MR
   imaging system. The 16 detectors in this system are based on the SensL
   SPMArray4B silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) and dual layer offset LYSO
   crystal blocks with crystal size of 1.2 x 1.2 x 4 mm(3) in the top layer
   and 1.2 x 1.2 x 6 mm3 in the bottom layer, with 409 total crystals per
   detector. Each detector was evaluated by generating flood histogram
   images and measuring per-crystal photopeak amplitude and energy
   resolution. The system was tested for MR compatibility and no visible
   artefacts were seen in the MR images or in the PET detector flood
   images. The temperature of the detector modules was monitored and found
   to stabilize after approximately two hours of operation between 32
   degrees C and 34 degrees C. Photopeak amplitude, energy resolution and
   count rates recorded per crystal were studied at a baseline temperature
   of 30 degrees C and at temperatures ranging from 20 degrees C to 40
   degrees C in increments of 2 degrees C. When bias voltage to the
   detectors was fixed at the value corresponding to an overvoltage of 2.5V
   at 30 degrees C, the photopeak amplitude changed by as much as 19\% and
   28\% at 20 degrees C and 40 degrees C respectively. Energy resolution
   and count rates demonstrated similar degrees of change. Maintaining a
   fixed overvoltage at each temperature point reduced but did not
   completely eliminate the change in these output characteristics. A
   lookup table based on empirical measurements was employed for the
   adjustment of bias voltage at different temperatures to maximize the
   stability of detector modules. Measurements obtained by using this
   lookup table method demonstrate better stability when compared to
   results obtained by using a fixed overvoltage.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in microwave imaging algorithms have led to contrast
   source inversion algorithms based on finite-element method forward
   solvers. The resulting algorithms are flexible in their ability to
   support a variety of microwave imaging environments, including metallic
   boundaries of practically arbitrary shape. One limitation of low-order
   finite-element based imaging algorithms is that, unless an explicit dual
   mesh scheme is imposed, the discretization of the contrast and contrast
   sources is implied by the mesh that describes the underlying field
   discretization. High-order expansions for the fields, contrasts and
   contrast sources overcoming this deficiency. In this work we present a
   high-order contrast source inversion method for dielectric targets that
   supports distinct expansion orders for the fields, contrasts and
   contrast sources. High-order expansions for the contrasts essentially
   decouples the image reconstruction from the underlying mesh
   discretization. The field solver is based on a high-order
   frequency-domain discontinuous Galerkin formulation of Maxwell's curl
   equations. Results presented for both numerical and experimentally
   collected transverse magnetic data-sets illustrate the potential of the
   proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{The cross polarization performance of an electrically large aperture
   antenna, capable of providing adaptive multi-phase center locations
   within its aperture, is addressed in this paper. Such adaptive operation
   is realized using an offset parabolic reflector antenna, illuminated by
   a dual-mode circular waveguide feed at the TE11 and TE21 modes. The
   amount of the phase center displacement is then dependent on the
   strength of the mode content factors of the primary feed. It is shown
   that when the phase center is electronically displaced over the
   reflector aperture with such a dual-mode feed, the cross polarization
   performance deteriorates. This can be alleviated by introducing an extra
   TM11 mode to the waveguide feed, without affecting the phase center
   locations of the compound reflector and the feed.}},

Abstract = {{An ultra-wideband (UWB) pattern diversity antenna design is proposed for
   high-gain applications and simulation and measurement results are
   presented. The proposed antenna is compact in size (50x41x21 mm(3)) and
   easy to fabricate. Its structure consists of two parallel disk radiating
   elements, each fed at two points by two microstrip lines. Ground plane
   is shaped like a cavity with two edges at an angle 70 degrees. The disks
   are also slightly modified in geometry to suppress unwanted radiation
   and increase port isolation. The radiation pattern of the antenna is
   either directional or squinted for out-of-phase and in-phase
   excitations, respectively, which resembles the sum and difference
   patterns in monopulse feeds. Simulation results show -10 dB impedance
   bandwidths extending from 5 to more than 15 GHz. The radiation patterns
   maintain less than -15 dB sidelobe, backlobe and cross-polarization
   levels from 5 GHz up to 9 GHz. The pattern measurements are carried out
   on a prototype antenna for 6.5-8.5 GHz and show good agreement with the
   simulation data. The measured gain of the sum pattern in this band,
   varies from 8.6 dBi to 11.2 dBi, with less than -15 dB sidelobe, and
   cross-polarization levels. The peak gain of difference mode varies
   between 3 dBi to 5.5 dBi. This antenna can be used as a standalone
   directive wideband antenna, as a reflector feed, or for monopulse
   tracking applications.}},

   Reynolds shear stresses, uv, uw, and vw. Turbulent kinetic energy, k,
   was calculated with all three values of turbulence intensities. Flow
   measurements were performed at Reynolds numbers of 34,000, 53,000 and
   86,000.
   Results of this experimental study indicate the wall-normal location of
   maximum mean velocity and jet spread to be independent of Reynolds
   number. The effects on maximum mean velocity decay are reduced with
   increasing Reynolds number. Profiles of mean velocities, U, V and W,
   turbulence intensities, U-rms, V-rms, and W-rms and turbulent kinetic
   energy, k, show independence of Reynolds number. Reynolds shear stress
   uv was independent of Reynolds number while the magnitude of uw was
   reduced at higher Reynolds number.}},

   Applications}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Pages = {{831-840}},
Abstract = {{Smartphones and tablets are finding their way into healthcare delivery
   to the extent that mobile health (mHealth) has become an identifiable
   field within eHealth. In prior work, a mobile app to document chronic
   wounds and wound care, specifically pressure ulcers (bedsores) was
   developed for Android smartphones and tablets. One feature of the mobile
   app allowed users to take images of the wound using the smartphone or
   tablet's integrated camera. In a user trial with nurses at a personal
   care home, this feature emerged as a key benefit of the mobile app. This
   paper developed image analysis algorithms that facilitate noncontact
   measurements of irregularly shaped images (e.g., wounds), where the
   image is taken with a sole smartphone or tablet camera. The image
   analysis relies on the sensors integrated in the smartphone or tablet
   with no auxiliary or add-on instrumentation on the device. Three
   approaches to image analysis were developed and evaluated: 1) computing
   depth using autofocus data; 2) a custom sensor fusion of inertial
   sensors and feature tracking in a video stream; and 3) a custom
   pinch/zoom approach. The pinch/zoom approach demonstrated the strongest
   potential and thus developed into a fully functional prototype complete
   with a measurement mechanism. While image analysis is a very well
   developed field, this paper contributes to image analysis applications
   and implementation in mHealth, specifically for wound care.}},

   such as antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory
   activity, are discussed in detail. Further, some recent applications of

Abstract = {{Pedestrian movement, although ubiquitous and well-studied, is still not
   that well understood due to the complicating nature of the embedded
   social dynamics. Interest among researchers in simulating pedestrian
   movement and interactions has grown significantly in part due to
   increased computational and visualization capabilities afforded by high
   power computing. Different approaches have been adopted to simulate
   pedestrian movement under various circumstances and interactions. In the
   present work, bi-directional crowd movement is simulated where an equal
   numbers of individuals try to reach the opposite sides of an
   environment. Two movement methods are considered. First a Least Effort
   Model (LEM) is investigated where agents try to take an optimal path
   with as minimal changes from their intended path as possible. Following
   this, a modified form of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is proposed,
   where individuals are guided by a goal of reaching the other side in a
   least effort mode as well as a pheromone trail left by predecessors. The
   basic idea is to increase agent interaction, thereby more closely
   reflecting a real world scenario. The methodology utilizes Graphics
   Processing Units (GPUs) for general purpose computing using the CUDA
   platform. Because of the inherent parallel properties associated with
   pedestrian movement such as proximate interactions of individuals on a
   2D grid, GPUs are well suited. The main feature of the implementation
   undertaken here is that the parallelism is data driven. The data driven
   implementation leads to a speedup up to 18x compared to its sequential
   counterpart running on a single threaded CPU. The numbers of pedestrians
   considered in the model ranged from 2K to 100K representing numbers
   typical of mass gathering events. A detailed discussion addresses
   implementation challenges faced and averted. Detailed analysis is also
   provided on the throughput of pedestrians across the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Although a large number of research activities have been conducted for
   sustainable product development, it is not easy to find a practical
   method applied in sustainable product design as there are many uncertain
   factors existed in particular problems faced in different phases of
   product development. Based on reviewed literature, it is found that it
   is necessary to have an optimization metric accompanied with uncertainty
   effects in product development. A model is proposed in this research to
   evaluate the effects of uncertainty in product life cycle. The goal is
   to quantify various types of uncertainty from internal and external
   sources to assess the design efficiency for mitigating undesirable
   effects of uncertainty. The design phase is aimed in the research to
   look at product parameters that are subject to change in the design
   process. Inaccuracy, indecision and imprecision are selected as
   information uncertainty levels to quanty the evolution of uncertainty.
   Using the proposed concept, the discrete-event simulation (DES) is used
   to model and evaluate scenarios to minimize design phase duration of a
   sustainable wheelchair. Suggested improvements are compared to search
   the optimal solution. The analysis and comparison of scenarios show ways
   to reduce design time by (1) revision of the design process, (2)
   breaking down the product into design details, and (3) providing a clear
   and technical definition of uncertainty to be mitigated. The model is
   also used to locate areas for sustainability improvement in the studied
   case.}},

Abstract = {{Free-form surfaces can be machined continuously with minimum tool
   retractions and at the high speed by following a spiral tool path. This
   paper presents an improved planning method of the spiral tool path using
   eccentric parameters for machining free-form surfaces. The relationship
   between a 3D machined surface and the 2D circular region is established
   through the conformal mapping. In order to generate an even path,
   eccentric parameters are used in 2D parametric circular regions to
   optimize the path interval. The proposed method produces planar spiral
   segments as a diagonal curve between every two adjacent parametric tool
   paths. A 2D spiral tool path is gained by linking spiral segments in
   sequence. Inverse mapping of the 2D spiral tool path onto the machined
   surface generates the 3D spiral tool path. The main processes of the
   proposed method include reducing dimensions of free-form surfaces,
   calculating the eccentric parametric tool path, and generating the
   planar diagonal spiral tool path. Some applications are used to verb the
   proposed methods. The proposed method allows the start point to be
   arbitrary and generates more even tool paths than the existing methods
   by introducing the mapping distortion.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering (TE) integrates methods of cells, engineering and
   materials to improve or replace biological functions of native tissues
   or organs. 3D printing technologies have been used in TE to produce
   different kinds of tissues. Human tissues have intricate structures with
   the distribution of a variety of cells. For this reason, existing
   methods in the construction of artificial tissues use universal 3D
   printing equipment or some simple devices, which is hard to meet
   requirements of the tissue structure in accuracy and diversity.
   Especially for soft tissue organs, a professional bio-3D printer is
   required for theoretical research and preliminary trial. Based on review
   of the exiting 3D printing technologies used in TE, special requirements
   of fabricating soft tissues are identified in this research. The need of
   a proposed bio-3D printer for producing artificial soft tissues is
   discussed. The bio-3D printer suggested consists of a pneumatic
   dispenser, a temperature controller and a multi-nozzle changing system.}},

Abstract = {{Partition of noble atoms is studied using a pre-twisted single-walled
   carbon nanotube with semi-capped end via molecular dynamic simulations.
   A small portion on one end of the carbon nanotube is initially twisted
   to form a torsion buckling state. Upon releasing the pre-twisted
   portion, the collapse propagates along the tube wall. The van der Waals
   force between the encapsulated atoms and the collapsed wall of the
   nanotube thus initiates a motion and a consequent separation of the
   atoms. A successful separation of different atoms is found to be owing
   to the difference in the inertia of the atoms and the barrier effect of
   the semi-capped tip of the nanotube. Motions of one neon atom and one
   xenon atom are simulated to illustrate the separation process and
   various effects, such as twist angle and semi-capped tip, on the
   effectiveness of the process are discussed. Separation of eight atoms,
   four neon and four xenon, is demonstrated to further show the practical
   potential of the proposed partition method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This article proposes a reconfigurable microstrip antenna that changes
   its polarization with only a single switch at a single frequency band.
   The antenna consists primarily of a square ring and a square patch, with
   a foam layer. When the connection status between the square ring and the
   ground is changed between shorted and open status, the linear
   polarizations are switched. The resonant frequency of the antenna using
   a single switch reported previously has been shifted, but the proposed
   antenna in this article exhibits a fixed resonant frequency. The design
   principle is as follows: The square-ring printed on the dielectric
   substrate has inherent narrow bandwidth, but we found that its
   polarization-switching characteristics existed over the broad band. The
   square patch is placed above the square ring, and it provides a broad
   bandwidth while maintaining polarization diversity. The performance of
   the antenna is successfully demonstrated via simulation and measurement.

Abstract = {{Calibration and validation of hydrological models is a challenge,
   particularly in remote regions that are minimally gauged. This paper
   develops a novel methodology for large-scale (>1000 km(2)) hydrological
   model calibration and validation using stable water isotopes founded on
   the rigorous constraints imposed by the need to conserve both water mass
   and stable isotopes simultaneously. The isoWATFLOOD model is applied to
   five basins within the Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories region of
   northern Canada to simulate stream discharge and oxygen-18 signals over
   a 3-year period. The isotopic variation of river discharge, runoff
   components, and evaporative fractionation are successfully simulated on
   both a seasonal and continual basis over the watershed domain to
   demonstrate the application of isotope tracers to regional hydrologic
   calibration. The intended application of this research is to remote,
   large-scale basins, showing promise for improving predictions in
   minimally gauged basins and climate change research where traditional,
   rigorous approaches to constraining parameter uncertainty may be
   impractical. This coupled isotope-hydrological (i.e. iso-hydrological)
   approach to modelling reduces the number of possible parameterizations,
   resulting in potentially more physically-based hydrological predictions.
   isoWATFLOOD provides a tool for water resource managers and utilities to
   use operationally for water use, allocation, and runoff generation

Abstract = {{From the 1940s through the 1980s, the work of such researchers as
   Purcell, Leverett, Swanson, and Thomeer provided methods for predicting
   flow properties, particularly permeability, based on capillary pressure
   curves measured on rock-mercury-vacuum systems. Although these methods
   met with considerable success, they have been largely overshadowed,
   particularly in recent years, by the rapid development of network and
   direct models. This paper reports on a study of 24 samples from an
   Offshore Ghana formation of Turonian age. The paper demonstrates that
   the work of Purcell, in particular, can be used to provide primary
   predictions of permeability (that is, predictions without any flexible
   fitting parameters) provided that mercury porosimetry and formation
   factor measurements are available, either on identical or companion
   samples. The predictions are good to within a range of factors between
   0.5 and 2, with a mean error of less than 35\%. This accuracy is
   remarkable considering that the range of permeability is seven decades
   and that the data were not collected for the specific purpose of the
   study. An experimental protocol is suggested that should improve further
   the already excellent results. The applicability of the method to drill
   cuttings is discussed. Also, a suggestion for a method of applying the
   proposed technique to digital rock results is presented. Finally, the
   paper explores reasons behind the success of the predictions and
   suggests what types of reservoirs are expected to provide similar
   successes.}},

   one is immediately struck by the recent rise and focus in two new areas:
   digital rock physics and the petrophysical characterization of
   unconventional source-rock reservoirs, i.e., `shale'. This review, which
   consists of contributions from nine specialists in their respective
   fields, covers (a) wellsite coring and coring handling, (b) conventional
   and unconventional core analysis, (c) rock mechanics in support of
   reservoir engineering, and (d) digital core analysis.
   The goals of core analysis today remain the same as those identified 21
   years ago: to ``reduce uncertainty in reservoir evaluation{''} and
   finding ways to obtain this information faster. In the past, the focus
   was on developing experimental protocols that could shorten the
   experimental time, such as the continuous-injection-resistivity
   protocol. Today, the focus has changed to simulating rock properties
   from micro- and nano-CT images. In the past, we had to be concerned
   about how to scale up results on a 4x7 cm core plug to reservoir scale.
   With today's use of micro-CT imaging, which uses millimeter-size
   samples, the upscaling to reservoir scale has increased by an additional
   three orders of magnitude.
   With the huge success and rapid development of `shale' resources, the
   United States is fast becoming the world's leading producer of
   hydrocarbons. Underpinning and supporting this effort has been the
   enormous interest and increase in studying the petrophysics of these
   reservoirs. In particular, developing shale core-analysis experimental
   protocols for these challenging ultralow-permeability resesrvoirs and
   developing characterization methods and techniques that often involve
   digital rock physics.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, large-eddy simulation has been performed to investigate
   the impacts of the centrifugal and Coriolis forces on a heated plane
   channel flow subjected to streamwise system rotations. In order to study
   the rotation effects, a variety of rotation numbers Rot ranging from 0
   to 15 have been tested in conjunction with a fixed low Reynolds number
   Re-tau = 300. The subgrid-scale effects on the budget balance of
   turbulent stresses and heat fluxes have been investigated, and the
   physical mechanisms underlying the transport of resolved turbulent
   stresses under the influence of streamwise system rotations have been
   thoroughly analyzed. Numerical simulations were performed using two
   dynamic subgrid-scale stress models and two dynamic subgrid-scale heat
   flux models; namely, the conventional dynamic model (DM) and an advanced
   dynamic nonlinear model (DNM) for closure of the filtered momentum
   equation, and the conventional dynamic eddy thermal diffusivity model
   (DEDM) and an advanced dynamic full linear tensor thermal diffusivity
   model (DFLTDM) for closure of the filtered thermal energy equation. The
   predictive performances of the DM and DNM have been carefully compared
   in conjunction with the same subgrid-scale heat flux model DFLTDM. In
   order to validate the numerical approach, turbulent statistics obtained
   from the simulations have been compared with the available direct
   numerical simulation data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{239-257}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The manuscript presents an experimental study of turbulent flows over
   smooth and rough walls in a channel that consists of an upstream
   parallel section to produce a fully developed channel flow and a
   diverging section to produce an adverse pressure gradient (APG) flow.
   The roughness element consists of two-dimensional transverse square ribs
   of nominal height, k = 3 mm that were spaced to produce pitch-to-height
   ratio of p/k = 2 and 8, corresponding to d-type and k-type rough walls.
   A particle image velocimetry system was used to conduct detailed
   velocity measurements over the smooth and rough walls in both the
   parallel and diverging sections. The mean defect velocity and Reynolds
   stresses as well as Galilean decomposition, quadrant decomposition,
   two-point velocity correlation and linear stochastic estimation were
   used to document the salient effects of APG and wall roughness on the
   flows. The results indicated that APG significantly augments turbulence
   level compared to the flows in the parallel section. The flow fields
   were populated with vortex cores that formed hairpin vortex packets. The
   packets were inclined at shallow angles relative to the wall as revealed
   by the two-point velocity correlation. The quadrant analysis revealed
   that the ejections, sweeps, and inward and outward interaction motions
   associated with the structures were influenced by roughness and APG. The
   existence of structures was further supported by linear stochastic
   estimates conditioned on the prograde vortices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of the standard post-weld heat treatment
   (PWHT) behaviour of autogenous laser welded gamma' age-hardenable
   precipitation strengthened nickel based superalloy Haynes 282 (HY 282).
   The study involves a careful and detailed microstructural
   characterisation as well as an analysis of the weld cracking
   susceptibility during welding and Gleeble thermo-mechanical physical
   simulation. Various factors that could influence post-weld cracking in
   superalloys weld were experimentally examined. Our microstructural
   examination of the as-solution heat treated (SHTed) material and the
   thermo-mechanically refined grain material shows that intergranular heat
   affected zone (HAZ) cracking is observable in only the as-welded SHTed
   material. There was no indication of post-weld heat treatment cracking
   in all welded materials. Our conclusion, in this study, is that the
   chemistry of superalloy HY 282 which aids the preclusion/ formation of
   deleterious solidification microconstituents during welding as well as
   its relatively slow aging kinetics enhances its resistance to PWHT
   cracking.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile cloud computing is an emerging technology to improve the quality
   of mobile services. In this paper, we consider the resource (i.e., radio
   and computing resources) sharing problem to support mobile applications
   in a mobile cloud computing environment. In such an environment, mobile
   cloud service providers can cooperate (i.e., form a coalition) to create
   a resource pool to share their own resources with each other. As a
   result, the resources can be better utilized and the revenue of the
   mobile cloud service providers can be increased. To maximize the benefit
   of the mobile cloud service providers, we propose a framework for
   resource allocation to the mobile applications, and revenue management
   and cooperation formation among service providers. For resource
   allocation to the mobile applications, we formulate and solve
   optimization models to obtain the optimal number of application
   instances that can be supported to maximize the revenue of the service
   providers while meeting the resource requirements of the mobile
   applications. For sharing the revenue generated from the resource pool
   (i.e., revenue management) among the cooperative mobile cloud service
   providers in a coalition, we apply the concepts of core and Shapley
   value from cooperative game theory as a solution. Based on the revenue
   shares, the mobile cloud service providers can decide whether to
   cooperate and share the resources in the resource pool or not. Also, the
   provider can optimize the decision on the amount of resources to
   contribute to the resource pool.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy,
   transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and electron probe
   microanalyser were used to analyse the changes in microstructure of AISI
   4340 steel specimens caused by impact at high strain rates and large
   strains. The structures of the steel prior to dynamic deformation and
   after dynamic deformation were examined to understand on a microscale
   level, the mechanism of formation of adiabatic shear bands (ASBs). The
   study also includes the structural changes that occur during
   post-deformation annealing processes which may relate to understanding
   of the mechanism of formation of ASBs. Prior to deformation, the
   tempered steel specimens consisted of lenticular laths of -ferrite with
   precipitated platelet and spherical M3C carbides. After impact, the
   structure inside the shear band was characterized by refined and
   recrystallized grains immersed in dense dislocation structures. In
   addition, residual carbide particles were observed inside the shear
   bands due to deformation induced carbide dissolution. Regions away from
   the shear bands developed knitted' dislocation walls, evolving gradually
   into sub-boundaries and highly misoriented grain boundaries at
   increasing strains, leading to grain refinement of the ferrite. After
   impact, annealing the shear bands at 350 degrees C resulted in an
   increase in hardness regardless of the heat treatment before impact,
   amount of deformation and the time of annealing. This is because of the
   occurrence of extensive reprecipitation of dissolved carbides that
   existed in the steel structure prior to deformation. It is concluded
   that dynamic recovery/recrystallization, development of dislocation
   structures and carbide dissolution all contribute simultaneously to the
   formation of ASBs in quench-hardened steels.}},

Abstract = {{Migration of cancer cells leads to invasion of primary tumors to distant
   organs (i.e., metastasis). Growing number of studies have demonstrated
   the migration of various cancer cell types directed by applied direct
   current electric fields (dcEF), i.e., electrotaxis, and suggested its
   potential implications in metastasis. MDA-MB-231 cell, a human
   metastatic breast cancer cell line, has been shown to migrate toward the
   anode of dcEF. Further characterizations of MDA-MB-231 cell electrotaxis
   and investigation of its underlying signaling mechanisms will lead to a
   better understanding of electrically guided cancer cell migration and
   metastasis. Therefore, we quantitatively characterized MDA-MB-231 cell
   electrotaxis and a few associated signaling events. Using a microfluidic
   device that can create well-controlled dcEF, we showed the
   anode-directing migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, surface
   staining of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and confocal
   microscopy showed the dcEF-induced anodal EGFR polarization in
   MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, we showed an increase of intracellular
   calcium ions in MDA-MB-231 cells upon dcEF stimulation. Altogether, our
   study provided quantitative measurements of electrotactic migration of
   MDA-MB-231 cells, and demonstrated the electric field-mediated EGFR and
   calcium signaling events, suggesting their involvement in breast cancer
   cell electrotaxis.}},

Abstract = {{A multiple moving membrane capacitive micromachined ultrasonic

   of the device pull-down voltage, while showing a much higher capacitance
   change, 100 fF for the M-3-CMUT compared with only 20 fF for CMUT, at a
   dc bias of 25 V. The device performance, sensitivity, and acoustic power
   generation capability are primarily associated with the magnitude of the
   displacement of the membrane, and therefore, are enhanced through

Abstract = {{Disparity in hot ductility of a gamma' precipitation strengthened
   nickel-base superalloy, IN 738 LC, subjected to non-equilibrium heating
   and compressive and tensile stresses, was investigated. The alloy, which
   shows considerable hot ductility at temperatures ranging from 1160
   degrees C to 1250 degrees C under compressive loading, exhibits zero
   ductility under tensile loading within this temperature range. The
   difference is attributed to the fact that while compressive loading
   permits plastic deformation in spite of non-equilibrium liquid phase
   dissolution of gamma' precipitates in the alloy, the occurrence of the
   liquation reaction results in inhibition of plastic deformation under
   tensile loading. Accordingly, while grain refinement through
   strain-induced dynamic recrystallization occurred under compressive
   loading, within the same temperature range, the formation of new grains
   was prevented under tensile loading. This behavior is crucial during
   high temperature processing of gamma precipitation strengthened
   nickel-base superalloys. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A microwave tomography imaging system, which uses a hybrid binary-real
   genetic algorithm (GA) is described in this work. This method utilizes
   global optimization for solving the inverse scattering problem based on
   hybrid version of GA, which is the combination of both real and
   binary-coded GA. This method is principally aimed at breast imaging for
   the detection of malignant tumors. The proposed technique is based on a
   time-domain inverse solver, which uses the multi-illumination technique
   and includes the dispersive and heterogeneous characteristic of the
   breast tissues. In this algorithm, real-coded GA acts as a regularizer
   for binary-coded GA and rejects the non-true solutions. The proposed
   technique is validated using a numerical breast phantom created based on
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of actual patients. The results are
   compared with non-hybrid binary and real GAs and the superior efficiency
   of the proposed method over the methods that solely employ real or
   binary GA is illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{To ensure maximum productivity of recombinant proteins it is desirable
   to prolong cell viability during a mammalian cell bioprocess, and
   therefore important to carefully monitor cell density and viability. In
   this study, five different and independent methods of monitoring were
   applied to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells grown in a batch culture in
   a controlled bioreactor to determine cell density and/or cell viability.
   They included: a particle counter, trypan blue exclusion (Cedex), an in
   situ bulk capacitance probe, an off-line fluorescent flow cytometer, and
   a prototype dielectrophoretic (DEP) cytometer. These various techniques
   gave similar values during the exponential growth phase. However, beyond
   the exponential growth phase the viability measurements diverged.
   Fluorescent flow cytometry with a range of fluorescent markers was used
   to investigate this divergence and to establish the progress of cell
   apoptosis: the cell density estimates by the intermediate stage
   apoptosis assay agreed with those obtained by the bulk capacitance probe
   and the early stage apoptosis assay viability measurements correlated
   well with the DEP cytometer. The trypan blue assay showed higher
   estimates of viable cell density and viability compared to the
   capacitance probe or the DEP cytometer. The DEP cytometer measures the
   dielectric properties of individual cells and identified at least two
   populations of cells, each with a distinct polarizability. As verified
   by comparison with the Nexin assay, one population was associated with
   viable (non-apoptotic) cells and the other with apoptotic cells. From
   the end of the exponential through the stationary and decline stages
   there was a gradual shift of cell count from the viable into the
   apoptotic population. However, the two populations maintained their
   individual dielectric properties throughout this shift. This leads to
   the conclusion that changes in bulk dielectric properties of cultures
   might be better modeled as shifts in cells between different dielectric
   sub-populations, rather than assuming a homogeneous dielectric
   population. This shows that bulk dielectric probes are sensitive to the
   early apoptotic changes in cells. DEP cytometry offers a novel and
   unique technology for analyzing and characterizing mammalian cells based
   on their dielectric properties, and suggests a potential application of
   the device as a low-cost, label-free, electronic monitor of
   physiological changes in cells. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013;110: 2902-2914.

Abstract = {{Rainfall-runoff modeling is important in flood forecasting systems.
   Although, a wide variety rainfall-runoff models has been developed and
   applied, but it cannot be claimed that there is one model which can
   perform satisfactorily at all times or under all conditions. Instead of
   switching models from one to another, this study proposes combining the
   simple linear rainfall-runoff model results. This study presents the
   development of five combination methods, simple average method (SAM),
   the weighted average method (WAM), the fuzzy system method (FSM), the
   neural network method (NNM) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference
   system method (ANFISM) to combine the simulated results of three
   different rainfall-runoff models called single linear model (SLM),
   Linear Perturbation Model (LPM) and Linearly Varying Gain Factor Model
   (LVGFM) on four catchments. Comparison of the estimated runoff results
   reveals that the ANFIS combination method performs better than the other
   combination methods and is the best individual rainfall-runoff model.
   Furthermore, the ANFIS combination method provides improved flood
   estimates and is recommended for use as the combination system for flood
   forecasting that can also be used by engineers and hydrologists.}},

Abstract = {{A linear array of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT)
   has been designed as an alternative to conventional piezoelectric
   transducers. The proposed array is favorable for imaging applications
   where there is a need for high resolution detection in directions with
   an angle other than that perpendicular to the axis of the transducer
   array. The transducer array cells include a thin silicon nitride
   membrane that is suspended over a bottom electrode, fabricated on a
   silicon wafer. In immersion mode, the transducer cell shape and
   dimensions are optimized for an operating frequency of 10 MHz. The
   proposed imager array is shown to be able to generate a pencil shape
   beam with a similar to 1.5 degrees half beam width for enhancing the
   detector resolution. A phased array technique is employed to excite
   multiple cells using time-delayed signals to steer the acoustic beam
   toward the object. Therefore, the need for mechanically moving the
   transducer array or the cell membrane is eliminated, which results in
   simplifying the transducer driving system. Moreover, unlike conventional
   transducers, the pencil beam can be effectively steered over a wide
   range of angles without producing grating lobes or degrading the power
   difference between the main lobe and side lobes. Consequently, in
   transmitting mode the power loss in any undesired directions is
   minimized and in receiving mode the noise level from other angles
   interfering with the data collection is suppressed, which improves the
   signal to noise ratio of the imager CMUT array. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The tradeoff between energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE)
   in amplify-and-forward relay networks is studied. Three kinds of
   transmission strategies are considered: 1) noncooperative transmission;
   2) relay transmission without a direct link; and 3) relay transmission
   with a direct link. The tradeoff between EE and SE is formulated as an
   optimization problem in which the objective is to maximize EE while
   satisfying the SE requirement. In the noncooperative transmission
   strategy, the optimization problem is solved by seeking the optimal
   source transmission power P-s. It is proven that EE is a strictly
   quasiconcave function of P-s. In the relay transmission with/without a
   direct link, the optimization problem is solved by jointly seeking the
   optimal source transmission power P-s and the optimal relay
   amplification gain beta. It is proven that EE is a strictly
   quasi-concave function of either P-s or beta. An optimal but highly
   complex 1-D searching (ODS) method and a near-optimal but lower
   complexity alternate optimization (AOP) method are proposed. Simulation
   results show that the ODS results are consistent with the 2-D exhaustive
   searching results. The AOP method can achieve an EE close to that
   obtained by 2-D exhaustive searching. Moreover, the transmission
   strategies are compared in terms of EE under the same SE constraint.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous concrete beams are common elements in structures such as
   parking garages and overpasses, which might be exposed to extreme
   weather. Using the non-corrodible fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) bars is
   a viable alternative to avoid steel corrosion problems. Due to the
   linear-elastic behaviour of FRP materials, the possibility of moment
   redistribution in FRP-reinforced beams is questionable. In this paper,
   the experimental results of ten full-scale continuous concrete beams are
   summarized followed by a finite element parametric study using ANSYS
   software. Steel, glass fibre reinforced polymer, and carbon fibre
   reinforced polymer bars were used in different combinations as
   longitudinal and transverse reinforcement. The main investigated
   parameters were the ratio and type of longitudinal and transverse
   reinforcement. Results showed that moment redistribution in such beams
   is possible if the reinforcement configuration is chosen properly. The
   developed finite element model predicted the response of tested beams
   with a reasonable degree of accuracy and was used to expand the range of
   investigated parameters.}},

Abstract = {{An optimal design of a piezoelectric coupled cantilever structure
   attached by a proof mass subjected to harmonic motions is developed to
   achieve efficient energy harvesting for applications in high-rise
   buildings. Energy harvesting is realized from the electromechanical
   coupling effect by the piezoelectric patch mounted on the cantilever. To
   describe the energy harvesting process, a mathematical model is
   developed to calculate the output electrical charge and the voltage from
   the piezoelectric patch. The corresponding efficiency of the energy
   harvesting by the piezoelectric coupled vibrating cantilever can then be
   obtained. The influence of the thickness ratio of the piezoelectric
   patch to the host beam, the length and location of the piezoelectric
   patch, the radius of the attached mass, and the excitation frequency of
   the harmonic motion on the energy harvesting efficiency is investigated
   for the optimal design. This research provides a new method for
   absorbing vibration energy of high-rise buildings subjected to harmonic
   motions such as wind loadings through a design of energy harvesting
   devices made of piezoelectric coupled cantilever structures. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We propose novel cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) algorithms for
   cognitive radio (CR) networks based on machine learning techniques which
   are used for pattern classification. In this regard, unsupervised (e.
   g., K-means clustering and Gaussian mixture model (GMM)) and supervised
   (e. g., support vector machine (SVM) and weighted K-nearest-neighbor
   (KNN)) learning-based classification techniques are implemented for CSS.
   For a radio channel, the vector of the energy levels estimated at CR
   devices is treated as a feature vector and fed into a classifier to
   decide whether the channel is available or not. The classifier
   categorizes each feature vector into either of the two classes, namely,
   the ``channel available class{''} and the ``channel unavailable
   class{''}. Prior to the online classification, the classifier needs to
   go through a training phase. For classification, the K-means clustering
   algorithm partitions the training feature vectors into K clusters, where
   each cluster corresponds to a combined state of primary users (PUs) and
   then the classifier determines the class the test energy vector belongs
   to. The GMM obtains a mixture of Gaussian density functions that well
   describes the training feature vectors. In the case of the SVM, the
   support vectors (i.e., a subset of training vectors which fully specify
   the decision function) are obtained by maximizing the margin between the
   separating hyperplane and the training feature vectors. Furthermore, the
   weighted KNN classification technique is proposed for CSS for which the
   weight of each feature vector is calculated by evaluating the area under
   the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of that feature
   vector. The performance of each classification technique is quantified
   in terms of the average training time, the sample classification delay,
   and the ROC curve. Our comparative results clearly reveal that the
   proposed algorithms outperform the existing state-of-the-art CSS
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate the influences of
   pre-existing microstructural defects on the strength and deformation
   mechanisms in Ag nanowires under both uniaxial deformation and
   nanoindentation. In particular, the synergistic effects from both
   internal and external structural defects, including twin boundaries,
   surface facets, and a special surface groove, are studied. It is found
   that the yielding modes vary among Ag nanowires when different
   microstructures are present. Furthermore, while fivefold twin boundaries
   are found to cause significant strain hardening under nanoindentation,
   they can either decrease or increase the initial yield stress of Ag
   nanowires under uniaxial deformation. The surface groove, in addition,
   will result in damping behavior of the Ag nanowire that leads to
   peculiar oscillating load-displacement responses under nanoindentation.

Title = {{Power system transient stability analysis via the concept of Lyapunov
   Exponents}},
Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{183-192}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Transient stability of an electrical power system refers to the ability
   of the system to settle at the stable equilibrium point in the
   post-fault system subsequent to a specific fault scenario. This
   stability problem can be studied either as a system stability or a
   structural stability problem. In this paper, the concept of Lyapunov
   Exponents (LEs) is used to analyze the transient stability of IEEE
   3-generator 9-bus and IEEE 16 generator 69 bus benchmark systems. A
   spectrum of LEs is calculated from the mathematical models and the
   Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE) being negative implies the exponential
   stability of the post-fault power system. The system stability regions
   for specific fault scenarios are determined using the invariance
   property of the LEs from the initial conditions. Furthermore, the
   structural stability regions in terms of parameters of the pre-fault
   system dynamic equations are also determined. This study demonstrates
   that the concept of LEs can be used as a novel method to determine if
   the post-fault power system is within the stability region of attraction
   of the new stable equilibrium point, and hence to determine the
   stability region. It is also proposed that the largest average
   exponential rate calculated over a short time window is a sound approach
   for early prediction of the stability. Crown Copyright (c) 2013

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{6358-6366}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{An innovative submerged membrane electro-bioreactor (SMEBR) was built to
   reduce membrane fouling through a combination of various electrokinetic
   processes. The objective of this research was to assess the capability
   of SMEBR to reduce fouling under different process conditions. At the
   bench scale level, using synthetic wastewater, membrane fouling of the
   SMEBR was compared to the fouling of a membrane bioreactor (MBR) in five
   runs. Different protein concentrations in the influent synthetic
   wastewater were selected to develop different membrane fouling
   potentials: high (240 mg/l), low (80 mg/l) and zero protein addition.
   The MBR and SMEBR were operated at a flux equal to the membrane critical
   flux in order to create high fouling rate conditions. Membrane fouling
   rate, expressed as the change in the trans-membrane pressure per day
   (kPa/d), decreased in the SMEBR 5.8 times (standard deviation (SD) =
   2.4) for high protein wastewater, 5.1 times (SD = 2.4) for low protein
   content, and 1.3 times (SD = 0.7) for zero protein, when compared to the
   MBR. The supernatant concentrations of the soluble microbial products
   (SMP) were 195-210, 65-135 and less than 65 mg/l in respective
   experimental series. Following the bench scale study, membrane fouling
   was assessed in a pilot scale SMEBR, fed with raw un-clarified municipal
   wastewater, and operated under real-sewage variable quality conditions.
   The pilot SMEBR exhibited three times smaller membrane fouling rate than
   the MBR. It was concluded that electrokinetic processes generated by
   SMEBR led to a reduction of membrane fouling through: i) removal of
   soluble microbial products (mainly protein and polysaccharides) and
   colloidal organic materials; ii) change of the structure and morphology
   of the suspended solids due their conditioning by DC field. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel spectrum-sensing scheme, called adaptive
   dual-radio spectrum-sensing scheme (ADRSS), is proposed for cognitive
   radio networks. In ADRSS, each secondary user (SU) is equipped with a
   dual radio. During the data transmission, with the received
   signal-to-noise ratio of primary user (PU) signal, the SU transmitter
   (SUT) and the SU receiver (SUR) are selected adaptively to sense one
   channel by one radio while communicating with each other by the other
   one. The sensing results of the SUR are sent to the SUT through feedback
   channels (e.g., ACK). After that, with the sensing results from the SUT
   or the SUR, the SUT can decide whether the channel switching should be
   carried out. The theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate
   that the normalized channel efficiency, defined as the expected ratio of
   time duration without interference to PUs in data transmission to the
   whole frame length, can be improved while satisfying the interference
   constraint to PUs. After that, an enhanced ADRSS is designed by
   integrating ADRSS with cooperative spectrum sensing, and the performance
   of ADRSS under imperfect feedback channel is also discussed. Copyright

Abstract = {{This article reports an experimental study on the effect of the internal
   geometry of a circular nozzle on the stability of a turbulent methane
   diffusion flame with and without co-flow. The nozzle exit orifice is
   circular; however, the orifice diameter, length-to-diameter ratio, and
   contraction angle were varied. These geometrical parameters were aimed
   to create a wide range of conditions for the ensuing jet flow. The
   strength of the co-airflow was also varied to assess its impact on the
   jet flame stability parameters. The experimental results showed that the
   level of turbulence in the jet near field has a definite impact on the
   liftoff (i.e., local quenching) of an attached jet methane flame. This
   is obtained by systematically varying the nozzle geometry, where these
   variations led to the same conclusion that higher levels of jet
   near-field turbulence results in a lower flame liftoff velocity
   regardless of the nozzle geometry. The present results revealed also
   that there is a clear interplay between the flame liftoff height and the
   jet flow characteristics. That is, a jet flow that spreads faster and
   generates greater near-field turbulence would result in a flame base
   sitting closer to the nozzle exit. Finally, the presence of a moderate
   co-airflow results in the appearance of a hysteresis phenomenon at low
   jet velocity range but, in general, did not alter the relationship
   between the flame stability parameters and jet's characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes an investigation into the free vibration of
   double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) using a nonlocal elastic shell
   model. Eringen's nonlocal elasticity is implemented to incorporate the
   scale effect into the Donnell shell model. Also, the van der Waals
   interaction between the inner and outer nanotubes is taken into account.
   A new numerical solution method from incorporating the radial point
   interpolation approximation within the framework of the generalized
   differential quadrature (GDQ) method is developed to solve the problem.
   DWCNTs with arbitrary layerwise boundary conditions are considered in
   this paper. It is shown that applying the local Donnell shell model
   leads to overestimated results and one must recourse to the nonlocal
   version to reduce the relative error. Also, this work reveals that in
   contrast to the beam model, the present nonlocal elastic shell model is
   capable of predicting some new non-coaxial inter-tube resonances in
   studying the vibrational response of DWCNTs.}},

Abstract = {{Lots of microorganisms exist in layer houses can cause bird diseases and
   worker health concerns. Spraying chemical disinfectants is an effective
   way to decontaminate pathogenic microorganisms in the air and on
   surfaces in poultry houses. Slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW, pH
   5.0-6.5) is an ideal, environmentally friendly broad-spectrum
   disinfectant to prevent and control bacterial or viral infection in
   layer farms. The purpose of this work was to investigate the cleaning
   effectiveness of SAEW for inactivating the microbes in layer houses. The
   effect of SAEW was evaluated by solid materials and surface disinfection
   in a hen house. Results indicate that SAEW with an available chlorine
   concentration of 250 mg/L, pH value of 6.19, and oxygen reduction
   potential of 974 mV inactivated 100\% of bacteria and fungi in solid
   materials (dusts, feces, feather, and feed), which is more efficient
   than common chemical disinfectant such as benzalkonium chloride solution
   (1: 1,000 vol/vol) and povidone-iodine solution (1: 1,000 vol/vol).
   Also, it significantly reduced the microbes on the equipment or facility
   surfaces (P < 0.05), including floor, wall, feed trough, and water pipe
   surfaces. Moreover, SAEW effectively decreased the survival rates of
   Salmonella and Escherichia coli by 21 and 16 percentage points. In
   addition, spraying the target with tap water before disinfection plays
   an important role in spray disinfection.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to determine the mortality of two common insect
   species in stored dates using a microwave oven operating at 2450 MHz.
   Adults of Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) and Oryzaephilus surinamensis
   (L.), and larvae of T castaneum (15 days) were used to internally infest
   stored un-pitted dates and then subjected to microwave treatment at 180,
   300, 600 or 800 W power for 20, 30 or 40 s. Complete mortality was
   achieved for adults of both insects and larvae of T castaneum when the
   power was 800 W and the exposure time was 30 or 40 s. Mortality of T.
   castaneum larvae was also 100\% when the power and exposure time were
   600 W and 40 s, respectively. The quality attributes of the
   microwave-treated dates (in which 100\% mortality was achieved) were
   compared with untreated dates. Instrumental evaluation of texture
   profiles revealed that microwave disinfestation did not affect hardness,
   adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness and chewiness. Microwave
   disinfestation did not affect the sensory attributes or the surface
   color of date fruits. The moisture loss during microwave treatment was
   between 1.0 and 1.5 percentage points. Further investigations are
   required to determine the capability of microwave disinfestation for
   packed dates and other stored product insects and life stages. (C) 2013

Title = {{Feasibility of protein fingerprinting technology for detecting Tribolium
   castaneum (Herbst) insect fragments in wheat flour}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STORED PRODUCTS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{36-40}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), is one of the
   predominant insects that cause serious decrease in quality of wheat
   flour. Protein mass fingerprinting has the potential to accurately
   detect insect parts in wheat flour, based on special peptides of T.
   castaneum. For determining the capability of protein fingerprinting for
   detecting insect parts in wheat flour, T. castaneum, wheat flour, and
   mixtures of T. castaneum and wheat flour were tested in this study.
   Three protein extraction buffers: 50\% acetonitrile; sterilized water;
   and the buffer of 10 mM imidazole pH 7.0, 1 mM phenylthiourea, 1\%
   Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail (PTU buffer), were compared
   for insect protein detection. An Agilent 1100 reversed phase high
   performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) instrument was used for
   peptide purification and fractionation. Matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionization (MALDI) was used to read the RP-HPLC fractions,
   and the results were analyzed using sMART Engine, details given later.
   Fifty percent acetonitrile was adopted as protein extract buffer. Since
   very limited information about T. castaneum protein can be found in the
   database of sMART and National Center for Biotechnology Information
   (NCBI), peptide mapping method was used for identifying insect from the
   wheat flour. Peptide mapping method, which could set up biomarkers for
   each type of insect, was proven to be a more effective and practical way
   to detect insect contamination. This peptide mapping technique could
   obtain 78 biomarkers of T. castaneum, when T. castaneum was 0.1\% in
   wheat flour by mass. This sensitivity needs to be increased further
   during future research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a needle-free
   injection device (NF) with a needle and syringe (NS) when used to
   vaccinate calves against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and
   infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV). The study was conducted
   in two independent phases. Ninety-six crossbred beef calves were
   vaccinated in the spring and 98 beef calves in the autumn. The calves
   were vaccinated using a NF or NS at 2 months of age (day 0) and again on
   day 119, with a modified-live virus vaccine containing IBRV, BVDV (types
   1 and 2), parainfluenza-3 virus, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus.
   In each herd 10 calves were left unvaccinated to determine whether
   exposure to either BVDV or IBRV occurred.
   Visible vaccine residue at the surface of the skin/hair was apparent
   immediately following vaccination with NF in 30\% of the spring-born
   calves following both the primary and booster vaccination. In the
   autumn, visible vaccine residues occurred in 19\% and 8\% of
   NF-vaccinated calves following the primary and booster vaccination.
   Post-vaccination skin reactions recorded on days 21, 42, 119 and 140
   occurred with greater frequency in NF-vaccinated calves than
   NS-vaccinated ones.
   Blood samples were collected on days 0, 21, 42, 119, and 140 and tested
   for antibodies to BVDV and IBRV. Vaccination technique had no
   significant effect on BVDV or IBRV antibody concentrations at any time
   point. NF was as effective as NS vaccination in eliciting BVDV and IBRV
   antibody responses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   determined via a combination of weight gain data and microstructural
   examination. It was found that the addition of 0.5w/o Si to the
   quaternary Ni-Cr-Fe-Al powder metallurgy system provided a measureable
   improvement in oxidation resistance both in terms of thickness of oxide
   layer and in overall weight gain. Conversely, 0.1w/o Y provided little
   benefit when added with the Si and was shown to be detrimental in the
   absence of Si. Interestingly, little difference was noted in final
   microstructures. Specifically, variation in \%gamma' between samples was
   minimal (58.3-61.7 v/o) and a distinct precipitate free zone was always
   present between the oxide and the gamma+gamma' matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Gardasil, a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, began among
   grade 6 girls in Manitoba, Canada in 2008. In Manitoba, there is
   evidence that First Nations, Metis, and Inuit women (FNMI) have higher
   HPV prevalence, lower invasive cervical cancer (ICC) screening, and
   higher ICC incidence than all other Manitoban (ADM) women. We developed
   a mathematical model to assess the plausible impact of unequal
   vaccination coverage among school girls on future cervical cancer
   incidence.
   Methods: We fit model estimated HPV prevalence and ICC incidence to
   corresponding empirical estimates. We used the fitted model to evaluate
   the impact of varying levels of vaccination uptake by FNMI status on
   future ICC incidence, assuming cervical screening uptake among FNMI and
   AOM women remained unchanged.
   Results: Depending on vaccination coverage, estimated ICC incidence by
   2059 ranged from 15\% to 68\% lower than if there were no vaccination.
   The level of cross-ethnic sexual mixing influenced the impact that
   vaccination rates among FNMI has on ICC incidence among AOM, and vice
   versa. The same level of AOM vaccination could result in ICC incidence
   that differs by up to 10\%, depending on the level of FNMI vaccination.
   Similarly, the same level of FNMI vaccination could result in ICC
   incidence that differs by almost 40\%, depending on the level of AOM
   vaccination.
   Conclusions: If we are unable to equalize vaccination uptake among all
   school girls, policy makers should prepare for higher levels of cervical
   cancer than would occur under equal vaccination uptake. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{As the permittivity of dielectric resonators decreases, it becomes
   difficult to feed the dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs) using direct
   microstrip lines. The variation of the resonant input resistance with
   the feed location becomes smaller, while the maximum achievable peak
   resistance dramatically drops to lower than 50 Omega in most cases. To
   satisfy the impedance matching, field matching, improve coupling to
   low-permittivity dielectric resonators, and further increase the antenna
   bandwidth associated with the dominant mode, without disturbing
   far-field properties, tapered microstrip line-fed DRAs are proposed,
   designed, fabricated and evaluated in this communication. Both
   measurements and simulation investigations are presented and the results
   are compared with other forms of microstrip feed lines. The impedance
   bandwidth can be 75\% larger than the bandwidth achieved by the
   step-shape microstrip-fed DRA. Symmetrical radiation patterns with low
   cross-polarization levels (lower than -22 dB) and a gain ranging from
   4.9 to 6.8 dBi, within the impedance bandwidth of the antenna, are
   observed in the measurements. It is also shown that the proximity
   coupled tapered microstrip line is an ideal feeding for
   high-permittivity DRAs in situations where the microstrip line cannot be
   positioned underneath the dielectric resonator. To verify, one such
   antenna is designed, simulated and experimentally investigated,
   obtaining satisfactory results.}},

Abstract = {{Passive dynamic walking is a manner of walking developed, partially or

   walking provides insight into human walking and is an invaluable tool
   for designing energy-efficient biped robots. The objective of this
   research was to develop a continuous mathematical model of passive
   dynamic walking, in which the Hunt-Crossley contact model, and the LuGre
   friction model were used to represent the normal and tangential ground
   reactions continuously. A physical passive walker was built to validate
   the proposed mathematical model. A traditional impact-based passive
   walking model was also used as a reference to demonstrate the
   advancement of the proposed passive dynamic walking model. The simulated
   gait of the proposed model matched the gait of the physical passive
   walker exceptionally well, both in trend and magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{Passive dynamic walking is an excellent tool for evaluating biped
   stability measures, due to its simplicity, but an understanding of the
   stability, in the classical definition, is required. The focus of this
   paper is on analyzing the stability of the passive dynamic gait. The

   analyzed with Lyapunov exponents, and the geometry of the basin of
   attraction was determined. A novel method was created to determine the
   2D projection of the basin of attraction of the model. Using the
   insights gained from the stability analysis, the relation between the
   angular momentum and the stability of gait was examined. The angular
   momentum of the passive walker was not found to correlate to the

Abstract = {{Ethanol production from direct cellulose fermentation has mainly been
   described as a strictly anaerobic process. The use of air-tolerant
   organisms or consortia for this process would reduce the need for
   prereduction of the medium and also permit continuous feed of aerobic
   feedstock. To this end, moderately thermophilic (60 degrees C) consortia
   of fermentative, cellulolytic bacteria were enriched from 3 distinct
   environments (manure, marsh, and rotten wood) from a farm in southeast
   Saskatchewan, Canada. Community phenotypic and metabolic profiles were
   characterized. Selection methods included direct plating under an
   aerobic atmosphere and repeated passaging; the methods were designed to
   select for robust, stable aerotolerant cellulose-degrading communities.
   Several of the isolated communities exhibited an increase in total
   cellulose degradation and total ethanol yield when compared with a
   monoculture of Clostridium thermocellum DSMZ 1237. Owing to stringent
   selection conditions, low diversity enrichments were found, and many
   appeared to be binary cultures via density gradient gel electrophoresis
   analysis. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, aerobic conditions
   selected for a mix of organisms highly related to C. thermocellum and
   Geobacillus species, while anaerobic conditions led to the development
   of consortia containing strains related to C. thermocellum with strains
   from either the genus Geobacillus or the genus Thermoanaerobacter. The
   presence of a Geobacillus-like species appeared to be a prerequisite for
   aerotolerance of the cellulolytic enrichments, a highly desired
   phenotype in lignocellulosic consolidated bioprocessing.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerated durability tests are designed to quantify the life
   characteristics of ground vehicle components under normal use conditions
   by testing at a higher stress level to accelerate the occurrence of

   factor has become increasingly demanding for the reduction of the time

   work, to accelerate the field test, the standard `test tailoring
   approach' has been modified due to the limitations of testing
   implementation and required high acceleration factors. In this modified
   approach, a full period durability loading profile has to be shortened
   to an equivalent partial period test loading profile, which is repeated
   in the tests keeping the same amount of damage contents. To apply this
   new modified approach to industrial durability tests, it needs to be
   validated. In this work, a computer-aided testing method is developed
   for the validation of this modified `test tailoring approach'. Hence, a
   new test-piece has been designed by a conjugative approach involving the
   finite element technique and fatigue analysis for a specific durability
   life. Afterwards, the loading profiles with various acceleration factors
   synthesized via the modified approach have been applied on the designed
   test-piece and the fatigue lives have been simulated to verify the
   effectiveness of those loading profiles. Simulation results show that,
   loading profiles with high acceleration factors can be successfully
   generated with the accuracy above 95\%. In addition, synthesized
   accelerated loading profiles result failure from the identical locations
   determined using the proposed conjugative approach. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The hybrid carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA)/time-division multiple
   access (TDMA) medium access control (MAC) protocol combines the
   strengths of CSMA and TDMA protocols. In this letter, we propose a
   dynamic queue-length-based time slot allocation scheme for the hybrid
   CSMA/TDMA MAC protocol to improve channel utilization considering the
   uncertainty in queue length information. Due to the lack of a dedicated
   control channel from a device to the coordinator, the queue length in a
   device can be reported to the coordinator only in an intermittent
   manner. To overcome this difficulty, the proposed scheme calculates the
   probability mass function (pmf) of the distribution of the queue length
   and allocates slots during the TDMA period based on this pmf. The
   simulation results show that the proposed slot allocation scheme
   outperforms the time slot allocation scheme which does not take into
   account the distribution of the queue length.}},

Abstract = {{Injection has been recognized as an effective method for land
   application of liquid slurry. Optimization design is essential for
   developing higher-performance injection tools and identifying potential
   improvement of existing tools. In this study, design parameters of an
   injection tool were determined through minimizing the tool draft force
   with constraints which ensured that the desired amount of slurry can be
   injected into the soil without slurry being exposed on the soil surface.
   Four sweeps with different working widths (50, 110, 180, and 250 mm) and
   a constant rake angle of 15 degrees were selected through applying the
   optimization approach. The four sweeps were tested at different working
   depths (75, 100, and 125 mm below soil surface) in afield with loamy
   sandy soil. The results showed that draft force and soil cross-sectional
   area tilled had similar trends as predicted in the optimization in terms
   of the effects of sweep width and working depth. Among all the
   combinations of sweep width and working depth, the 180 mm sweep working
   at 100 mm depth had the best performance, as indicated by its lowest
   draft force and most favorable soil surface profile for covering
   injected slurry.}},

Abstract = {{Large quantities of bulk grain are moved using railway grain cars in
   Canada and other parts of the world. Automation has not progressed
   significantly in the grain industry, most probably because the market is
   limited for automated systems. A prototype of a robot
   ({''}Grain-o-bot{''}) using machine vision to automatically open and
   close the grain car hopper gates and detect the contents of the grain
   car was built and studied. The ``Grain-o-bot{''} was a Cartesian robot
   equipped with two cameras and an opening tool as the end-effector. One
   camera acted as the eye to determine the hopper gate sprocket location
   and guide the end-effector to the sprocket opening. Most reported
   applications have used machine vision solutions based on pattern
   recognition, and these were developed using images acquired in a
   laboratory setting. Major constraints with these solutions occurred when
   implementing them in real-world applications, as ambient light is a
   hindrance. So the first step for this automation was to correctly
   identify the hopper gate sprocket on the grain car. Algorithms were
   developed to detect and identify, the sprocket under proper lighting
   conditions with 100\% accuracy. The performance of the algorithms was
   also evaluated for identification of the sprocket in different lighting
   conditions, which are expected to occur in typical grain unloading
   facilities. Monochrome images of the sprocket from a model system were
   acquired using different lights. Correlation and pattern recognition
   techniques using a template image combined with shape detection were
   used for sprocket identification. Prior to template matching, the images
   were preprocessed using image processing techniques. The template image
   developed from the light source that was similar to the light source
   used to acquire images was more successful in identifying the sprocket
   than the template image developed using different light sources. A
   sample of the grain car contents was taken by slightly opening and
   immediately closing the hopper gate. The sample was identified by taking
   an image using the second camera and performing feature matching. An
   accuracy of 99.9\% was achieved in identifying Canada Western Red Spring
   (CWRS) and canola, and 100\% accuracy was achieved in identifying
   barley.}},

   nickel-based superalloys were studied in both conduction and keyhole

   liquation cracks associated with the constitutional liquation of grain
   boundary terminal solidification products, such as gamma-gamma'

   for the conduction and keyhole modes are different. The susceptibility
   to liquation cracking decreased with increasing heat input and peak
   power in both conduction and keyhole welding modes. However, for the
   same weld heat input, the conduction mode welding is more susceptible to
   HAZ cracking than is the keyhole welding. Additionally, the weld pool
   shape plays an important role in the alloy's susceptibility to liquation
   cracking. The HAZ cracking was not significantly affected by variations

Abstract = {{A distributed priority-based power and admission control algorithm is
   presented to address the priority-based gradual removal problem in
   cellular wireless networks. We assume that there exist two classes of
   priority for users (high-priority users versus low-priority users) and
   minimal number of low-priority users should be gradually removed,
   subject to the constraint that all high-priority users are supported
   with their target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) which
   is assumed feasible. In our proposed algorithm, each high-priority user
   rigidly tracks its target-SINR by employing the conventional target-SINR
   tracking power control algorithm, and each transmitting low-priority
   user tracks its target-SINR as long as its required transmit power is
   below a threshold, otherwise it temporarily removes itself. Each removed
   low-priority user resumes its transmission if the required transmit
   power to reach its target-SINR goes below a given threshold which is
   different from the former. Of these two thresholds, whose values are
   analytically obtained, the former is provided by the base station and
   the latter is obtained in a distributed manner as a function of the
   former. We show that the distributed power-update function corresponding
   to our proposed algorithm has at least one fixed-point which is not
   unique in general. The convergence point, where our proposed algorithm
   potentially converges to, depends on initial transmit power levels of
   users. We also show that our proposed algorithm, at each of its
   fixed-points, not only provides all high-priority users with their
   (feasible) target-SINRs but also guarantees that no low-priority user is
   erroneously removed (i.e., no additional low priority user can be
   supported along with currently supported users). Furthermore, for the
   special case of tracking a common target-SINR by all low-priority users,
   we show that our proposed algorithm minimizes the outage-ratio of
   low-priority users subject to zero-outage-ratio of high-priority users.
   Simulation results confirm our analytical developments and show that our
   proposed priority-based power and admission control algorithm solves the
   priority-based gradual removal problem efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{Uplink power control is in essence an interference mitigation technique
   that aims at minimizing the inter-cell interference (ICI) in cellular
   networks by reducing the transmit power levels of the mobile users while
   maintaining their target received signal quality levels at base
   stations. Power control mechanisms directly impact the interference
   dynamics and, thus, affect the overall achievable capacity and consumed
   power in cellular networks. Due to the stochastic nature of wireless
   channels and mobile users' locations, it is important to derive
   theoretical models for ICI that can capture the impact of design
   alternatives related to power control mechanisms. To this end, we derive
   and verify a novel statistical model for uplink ICI in Generalized-K
   composite fading environments as a function of various slow and fast
   power control mechanisms. The derived expressions are then utilized to
   quantify numerically key network performance metrics that include
   average resource fairness, average reduction in power consumption, and
   ergodic capacity. The accuracy of the derived expressions is validated
   via Monte-Carlo simulations. Results are generated for multiple network

Abstract = {{Oleaginous yeasts have been studied for oleochemical production for over
   80 years. Only a few species have been studied intensely. To expand the
   diversity of oleaginous yeasts available for lipid research, we surveyed
   a broad diversity of yeasts with indicators of oleaginicity including
   known oleaginous clades, and buoyancy. Sixty-nine strains representing
   17 genera and 50 species were screened for lipid production. Yeasts
   belonged to Ascomycota families, Basidiomycota orders, and the
   yeast-like algal genus Prototheca. Total intracellular lipids and fatty
   acid composition were determined under different incubation times and
   nitrogen availability. Thirteen new oleaginous yeast species were
   discovered, representing multiple ascomycete and basidiomycete clades.
   Nitrogen starvation generally increased intracellular lipid content. The
   fatty acid profiles varied with the growth conditions regardless of
   taxonomic affiliation. The dominant fatty acids were oleic acid,
   palmitic acid, linoleic acid, and stearic acid. Yeasts and culture
   conditions that produced fatty acids appropriate for biodiesel were
   identified. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Diet manipulation is a promising way for reducing phosphorus (P) content
   in manure and subsequently in surface water. The objective of this study
   is to clarify the effects of dietary fiber content on P distribution in
   fresh and stored liquid hog manure. Ten, 25 L liquid manure storage
   tanks were constructed and operated to simulate farm-based manure
   storage lagoons. Fifteen pigs were randomly grouped into three pens and
   the pigs in each pen were fed with a diet of different fiber contents
   (12\%, 16\%, and 21\%). For 20 weeks, one litre of liquid manure from
   each pen was fed to each storage tank once a week with 3 replicate
   storage tanks per diet treatment. The samples of fresh and stored
   manure, each representing a diet treatment, were analyzed for P
   distribution along the fractions of dissolved organic, dissolved
   inorganic, particulate organic, and particulate inorganic. The results
   showed that fresh manure derived from the high fiber diet contained
   lower total P concentrations. Of the four fractions of total P,
   particulate organic P and particulate inorganic P composed 95.3\% to
   97.5\% of total P in the fresh manure. After storage, the dissolved P
   concentration increased from around 25 ppm to 30-60 ppm. Inorganic P was
   the main fraction in dissolved P and composed 80\% of the dissolved P in
   stored manure. The dissolved inorganic P, and therefore the total
   dissolved P were speculated to increase with manure storage time,
   indicating microbial activity through digestion. It was concluded that a
   higher fiber diet yielding manure with higher fiber content resulted in
   enhanced anaerobic degradation during manure storage. This, in return
   might promote the destruction of organic materials, resulting in the
   release of P and subsequent formation of inorganic dissolved P.}},

Abstract = {{An energy harvester comprising a cantilever attached to piezoelectric
   patches and a proof mass is developed for wind energy harvesting, from a
   cross wind-induced vibration of the cantilever, by the electromechanical
   coupling effect of piezoelectric materials. The vibration of the
   cantilever under the cross wind is induced by the air pressure owing to
   a vortex shedding phenomenon that occurs on the leeward side of the
   cantilever. To describe the energy harvesting process, a theoretical
   model considering the cross wind-induced vibration on the piezoelectric
   coupled cantilever energy harvester is developed, to calculate the
   charge and the voltage from the harvester. The influences of the length
   and location of the piezoelectric patches as well as the proof mass on
   the generated electric power are investigated. Results show that the
   total generated electric power can be as high as 2 W when the resonant
   frequency of the cantilever harvester is close to the vortex shedding
   frequency. Moreover, a value of total generated electric power up to
   1.02 W can be practically realized for a cross wind with a variable wind
   velocity of 9-10 m s(-1) by a harvester with a length of 1.2 m. This
   research facilitates an effective and compact wind energy harvesting

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{145-154}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A study of supercritical flow stability in vertical channels has been
   undertaken to develop and assess relevant non-dimensional parameters
   governing the static instability mode. As in two-phase flow, two types
   of flow instabilities have previously been identified: static and
   dynamic. However, in supercritical flow, it was found that static
   instability and dynamic instability occurs in different temperature
   ranges. For a given fluid and system pressure, below a certain
   temperature only a static instability is possible, while above that
   temperature only a dynamic instability is possible. In down-flow, the
   static mode is more prevalent, while the dynamic mode was found to be
   more prevalent in up-flow. The examined fluids were H2O and CO2. This
   paper proposes and assesses new non-dimensional parameters for static
   instability in supercritical fluid flow, as well as assesses the
   non-dimensional parameters of Ambrosini. Different inlet temperatures,
   inlet and outlet K factors and systems pressures were examined. Insights
   into how the instability can be delayed or circumvented were obtained
   and are discussed. This study was undertaken using an in-house linear
   instability program. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To evaluate the disinfection effectiveness of slightly acidic
   electrolysed water (SAEW, pH 6.25-6.53), a new environmental friendly
   agent for inactivating micro-organisms adhered to the facility and
   aerosolized in the air of the swine barns and to explore the application
   of SAEW in livestock industries.
   Methods and Results: Bacteria and fungi were isolated from the swine
   house air and treated by SAEW. The SAEW solution was flushed onto
   surfaces and sprayed within the whole swine barn. SAEW with an available
   chlorine concentration (ACC) of 300mgl(-1) can inhibit isolated microbes
   completely. The usage of SAEW (300mgl(-1)) resulted in a significant
   (P<0.05) reduction in microbes on the wall, rail and floor after
   flushing disinfection. Additionally, spraying SAEW at an ACC of
   300mgl(-1) reduced 59\% of the airborne organisms in 30min and kept the
   population of microbes at a reduced level for at least 8h. SAEW
   treatment also reduced pathogens on surfaces (P<0.03) after spraying
   disinfection except on the surface of the wall.
   Conclusions: SAEW may be a potential alternative disinfectant to reduce
   infections in swine barns.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: The results of this study provide
   information on the antimicrobial efficiency of SAEW on the airborne
   bacteria and fungi in swine barns.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the effectiveness and costs of strategies to improve
   roadbed stability in permafrost regions, based on a synthesis of
   literature findings. Roadbeds in permafrost regions experience
   instability when the embankment loading and its heat absorption
   properties degrade the permafrost foundation. A variety of engineering
   strategies are used to mitigate this effect. The review summarizes the
   rationale, effectiveness, and costs of four types of strategies, namely
   those that control roadbed thawing, cool the roadbed, insulate the
   roadbed, and reduce roadbed fill weight. The literature reveals that
   strategies to control roadbed thawing, insulate the roadbed, or reduce
   roadbed fill weight do not reverse the long-term degradation of
   permafrost foundations. Strategies that cool the roadbed by implementing
   air convection embankments, ventilation ducts, thermosiphons, heat
   drains, or combinations of these are effective in reducing embankment
   temperatures and stabilizing the roadbed. Costs vary by geographic and
   climatic conditions and the proximity of materials to the construction
   site. Reported data suggest that conducting normal maintenance is less
   expensive than implementing roadbed cooling strategies, but maintaining
   serviceability may not be feasible.}},

Title = {{Power measurement of hydrokinetic turbines with free-surface and

Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{9-17}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Vertical hydrokinetic turbines in an array that extends from one side of
   a channel or river to the other side of it experience a fixed blockage
   effect as a result of the adjacent turbines and a variable free-surface
   effect due to water level changes above turbines. For tidal
   applications, the water level above turbine blades changes continuously
   throughout the day; for river applications, the water level changes on a
   seasonal basis. In this study, a vertical turbine operating in an array
   of turbines with one diameter lateral distance between two adjacent
   turbines is modeled. The model turbine is tested in a water tunnel at
   various water levels. Results show that the water level reduction
   improves the power coefficient of the turbine when the turbine is fully
   submerged the power coefficient increases due to the free-surface
   effect, with trends in agreement with the one-dimensional actuator-disc
   flow theory. However, the power coefficient decreases significantly when
   the turbine is only partially submerged. In this particular condition,
   the entrained air into the water by turbine blades separates the water
   from the blade surface. A high-speed camera visualizes the flow
   separation while a transducer measures the instantaneous torque of the
   turbine. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the main properties of digital television broadcasting
   signals based on the Digital Video BroadcastingTerrestrial (DVB-T)
   standard are analyzed, and these properties are utilized to design a new
   pilot-aided detector for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks.
   The proposed detector consists of a processing unit and a combination
   and decision unit. In the processing unit, multiple statistics that
   correspond to different enhanced pilot components are computed. In the
   combination and decision unit, three newly proposed combination schemes
   are adopted to combine these statistics, and then, a final decision on
   the presence or absence of the DVB-T signals is made on the basis of the
   Neyman-Pearson criterion. The proposed pilot-aided detector exploits
   both the periodic continual and scattered pilots that are intrinsic in
   the DVB-T signals, processes the observed data timely, experiences short
   sensing duration, and requires no time synchronization information.
   Furthermore, the proposed pilot-aided detector is able to distinguish
   DVB-T signals from interference. Theoretical analysis and simulation
   results show that spectrum bands that are not currently occupied by the
   DVB-T systems can be detected accurately by using the proposed
   pilot-aided detector. Simulation results also demonstrate the
   significant performance gain of the proposed detector compared with the
   counterparts.Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Odometry errors, which occur during wheeled mobile robot movement, are
   inevitable as they originate from hard-to-avoid imperfections such as
   unequal wheels diameters, joints misalignment, backlash, slippage in
   encoder pulses, and much more. This paper extends the method, developed
   previously by the authors for calibration of differential mobile robots,
   to reduce positioning errors for the class of mobile robots having
   omnidirectional wheels. The method is built upon the easy to construct
   kinematic formulation of omnidirectional wheels, and is capable of
   compensating both systematic and non-systematic errors. The
   effectiveness of the method is experimentally investigated on a
   prototype three-wheeled omnidirectional mobile robot. The validations
   include tracking unseen trajectories, self-rotation, as well as
   travelling over surface irregularities. Results show that the method is
   very effective in improving position errors by at least 68\%. Since the
   method is simple to implement and has no assumption on the sources of
   errors, it should be considered seriously as a tool for calibrating
   omnidirectional mobile having any number of wheels.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL THERMAL AND FLUID SCIENCE}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{An experimental investigation was undertaken to study the
   characteristics of curved turbulent water jets produced from a vertical
   slot diffuser with sharp protrusions at the exit plane. The experiments
   were performed at two different flow rates for which the Reynolds number
   based on slot width and average velocity were 2050 and 4100. A high
   resolution particle image velocimetry system was used to perform
   detailed velocity measurements which were post-processed to obtain the
   mean velocities, Reynolds stresses and turbulence kinetic energy. The
   decay of the centerline mean velocity and jet half-width were also
   obtained to evaluate the mixing characteristics of the present slot
   configuration vis-a-vis results reported in previous studies. It was
   observed that the mixing characteristics of the slot configuration
   investigated in this study are superior to most of the sharp-edged
   nozzle configurations and curved jets studied in the past. The effects
   of streamline curvature on the Reynolds stresses in the convex and
   concave regions were also examined. The results clearly demonstrated
   that streamline curvature significantly enhanced the level of the
   streamwise turbulence intensity in the convex region more than in the
   concave region. On the contrary, the Reynolds shear stress and
   transverse turbulence intensity are much larger in the concave region
   than in the convex region. These results, together with the
   distributions of the Reynolds stress ratios across the jet, provide
   clear indications that turbulence models that assume local equilibrium
   and isotropy will not be able to accurately reproduce the flow
   characteristics of curved turbulent jets. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW, pH 5.0-6.5) is a novel
   disinfectant with environmentally friendly broad spectrum microbial
   decontamination properties which could have significant utility on farm.
   Two of the most important pathogenic viruses in pigs are porcine
   reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and pseudorabies
   virus (PRV). The aim of this study was to evaluate the viricidal
   effectiveness of SAEW against PRRSV and PRV in vitro under different
   available chlorine concentrations (ACCs, 30, 50 and 70 mg/L), treatment
   times (5, 10 and 15 min) and temperatures (4, 20,40 and 60 degrees C),
   respectively.
   SAEW had a strong viricidal activity against both PRRSV and PRV. This
   activity increased with increasing ACC, treatment time and temperature.
   PRRSV and PRV titres of 7.0 log(10) TCID50/mL and 5.9 log(10) -
   TCID50/mL, respectively, were completely inactivated by SAEW at an ACC
   of >= 50 mg/L for 10 min even though SAEW had no negative effect on the
   host cells. SAEW thus shows promise as a disinfectant for use on pig
   farms to reduce the spread of both PRRSV and PRV, and to limit the
   morbidity associated with those viruses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to integrate field data and modeling tools
   in producing temporally and spatially varying groundwater recharge in a
   pilot watershed in North Okanagan, Canada. The recharge modeling is
   undertaken by using the Richards equation based finite element code
   (HYDRUS-1D), ArcGIS, ROSETTA, in situ observations of soil temperature
   and soil moisture, and a long-term gridded climate data. The public
   version of HYDUS-1D and another version with detailed freezing and
   thawing module are first used to simulate soil temperature, snow pack,
   and soil moisture over a one year experimental period. Statistical
   analysis of the results show both versions of HYDRUS-1D reproduce
   observed variables to the same degree. After evaluating model
   performance using field data and ROSETTA derived soil hydraulic
   parameters, the HYDRUS-1D code is coupled with ArcGIS to produce
   spatially and temporally varying recharge maps throughout the Deep Creek
   watershed. Temporal and spatial analysis of 25 years daily recharge
   results at various representative points across the study watershed
   reveal significant temporal and spatial variations; average recharge
   estimated at 77.850.8 mm/year. Previous studies in the Okanagan Basin
   used Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill Performance without any attempt
   of model performance evaluation, notwithstanding its inherent
   limitations. Thus, climate change impact results from this previous
   study and similar others, such as Jyrkama and Sykes (2007), need to be
   interpreted with caution.}},

Abstract = {{The Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-Advanced) networks are being
   developed to provide mobile broadband services for the fourth generation
   (4G) cellular wireless systems. Device-to-device (D2D) communications is
   a promising technique to provide wireless peer-to-peer services and
   enhance spectrum utilization in the LTE-Advanced networks. In D2D
   communications, the user equipments (UEs) are allowed to directly
   communicate between each other by reusing the cellular resources rather
   than using uplink and downlink resources in the cellular mode when
   communicating via the base station. However, enabling D2D communications
   in a cellular network poses two major challenges. First, the
   interference caused to the cellular users by D2D devices could
   critically affect the performances of the cellular devices. Second, the
   minimum quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of D2D communications need
   to be guaranteed. In this article, we introduce a novel resource
   allocation scheme (i.e. joint resource block scheduling and power
   control) for D2D communications in LTE-Advanced networks to maximize the
   spectrum utilization while addressing the above challenges. First, an
   overview of LTE-Advanced networks, and architecture and signaling
   support for provisioning of D2D communications in these networks are
   described. Furthermore, research issues and the current state-of-the-art
   of D2D communications are discussed. Then, a resource allocation scheme
   based on a column generation method is proposed for D2D communications.
   The objective is to maximize the spectrum utilization by finding the
   minimum transmission length in terms of time slots for D2D links while
   protecting the cellular users from harmful interference and guaranteeing
   the QoS of D2D links. The performance of this scheme is evaluated
   through simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the no-wait job shop (NWJS) problem with makespan
   minimisation criteria. It is well known that this problem is strongly
   NP-hard. Most of the previous studies decompose the problem into a
   timetabling sub-problem and a sequencing sub-problem. Each study
   proposes a different sequencing and timetabling algorithm to solve the
   problem. In this research, this important question is aimed to be
   answered: is the timetabling or the sequencing algorithm more important
   to the effectiveness of the developed algorithm? In order to find the
   answer, three different sequencing algorithms are developed; a tabu
   search (TS), a hybrid of tabu search with variable neighbourhood search
   (TSVNS), and a hybrid of tabu search with particle swarm optimisation
   (TSPSO). Afterwards, the sequencing algorithms are combined with four
   different timetabling methods. All the approaches are applied to a large
   number of test problems available in the literature. Statistical
   analysis reveals that although some of the sequencing and timetabling
   algorithms are more complicated than the others, they are not
   necessarily superior to simpler algorithms. In fact, some of the simpler
   algorithms prove to be more effective than complicated and
   time-consuming methods.}},

Volume = {{61}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a general approach to designing distributed joint
   source channel (DJSC) codes with arbitrary rates for communication of a
   pair of correlated binary sources over noisy channels. In this approach,
   both distributed compression and channel error correction are
   simultaneously achieved by transmitting, for each source, a fraction of
   the information bits together with the parity bits of a systematic
   channel code. This approach is shown to be asymptotically optimal, i.e.,
   any rate-pair in the achievable rate-region can be approached as the
   codeword length is increased. The practical realization of such a code
   requi res the design of a pair of channel codes with unequal error
   protection (UEP) properties determined by the inter-source correlation
   and the channel capacity available to each source. Towards this end, a
   linear programming based procedure for jointly optimizing the degree
   profiles of a pair of irregular LDPC codes to achieve the required UEP
   properties is presented. Experimental results obtained with both binary
   symmetric channels and binary-input Gaussian channels are presented,
   which demonstrate that the proposed UEP-DJSC codes can significantly
   outperform separate source-channel codes, as well as previously reported
   joint source-channel coding schemes, particularly for short codeword
   lengths.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of optimal switching adaptive modulation for multiuser
   amplify-and-forward (AF) relay networks over Nakagami-m fading channel
   is studied. Moreover, we consider two types of communication: i)
   relay-assisted communication (RAC): the source transmits its message to
   best user via relay path, ii) selective communication (SC): the source
   decides whether to forward the source message to the best user via relay
   path or direct path by comparing the end-to-end instantaneous
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the best user, which is independent of
   modulation scheme. Specifically, multiuser diversity and adaptive
   discrete-rate five-mode M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM)
   with constant transmit power is employed with fixed and optimal
   switching thresholds. The optimization criterion for switching
   thresholds is the maximization of spectral efficiency subject to target
   bit-error-rate. In particular, the detrimental effect of feedback delays
   in multiuser opportunistic scheduling (which exploits multiuser
   diversity) and adaptive modulation is quantified. To this end, an exact
   and an upper bound of the end-to-end SNRs are obtained and used to
   derive the cumulative distribution function and probability density
   function for each case. Moreover, exact outage probabilities, and lower
   bounds for the outage probabilities and average bit error rates, and the
   average spectral efficiencies are derived in closed-form. Further, we
   also present the high SNR approximations for outage probabilities and
   BERs. We observe that, for a particular spectral efficiency, adaptive
   five-mode M-QAM with optimal switching outperforms fixed switching and
   provides approximately 2 dB and 2.5 dB gain in average SNR for RAC and
   SC, respectively. Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to validate the
   analytical results.}},

Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{229-236}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Dispersion of a bundle of carbon nanotubes by applying torsional energy
   is realized by molecular dynamics simulations. The torsional energy
   applied on the two ends of the bundle leads to a local buckling of the
   tube structures. The impulse between carbon nano-tubes owing to the
   local buckling of the tubes forms the driving force through a process of
   releasing the energy for a successful dispersion. The critical
   dispersion energy between two carbon nanotubes in a bundle in different
   solutions and the critical torsional energy for a successful dispersion
   are calculated by molecular dynamics simulations, and thus the
   dispersion efficiency is obtained. Effects of different parameters, such
   as the length and the diameter of the carbon nano-tubes and the
   temperature of the solution, on the dispersion efficiency are discussed.
   The dispersion of a bundle of five carbon nano-tubes in an aqueous
   solution is realized to further prove the feasibility of the proposed
   dispersion method by torsional energy. This paper provides an effective
   mechanical approach for dispersion of carbon nano-tubes from their

Title = {{A decoding-based fusion rule for cooperative spectrum sensing with
   nonorthogonal transmission of local decisions}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Month = {{JUL 8}},
Abstract = {{Cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio (CR) networks is studied
   in which each CR performs energy detection to obtain a binary decision
   on the absence/presence of the primary user. The problem of interest is
   how to efficiently report and combine the local decisions to/at the
   fusion center under fading channels. In order to reduce the required
   transmission bandwidth in the reporting phase, the paper examines
   nonorthogonal transmission of local decisions by means of on-off keying.
   Proposed and analyzed is a novel decoding-based fusion rule that
   essentially performs in three steps: (1) estimating minimum mean-square
   error of the transmitted information from cognitive radios, (2) making
   hard decisions of the transmitted bits based on the estimated
   information, and (3) combining the hard decisions in a linear manner.
   Simulation results support the theoretical analysis and show that the
   added complexity of the decoding-based fusion rule leads to a
   considerable performance gain over the simpler energy-based fusion rule
   when the reporting links are reasonably strong.}},

Abstract = {{The time domain reflectomeny (TDR) method measures soil water content by
   measuring the dielectric permittivity of the soil using the travel time
   of an electromagnetic step pulse through a waveguide embedded in the
   soil. When installing TDR probes at deeper depths, retrieval and re-use
   is not easy. This study investigated the performance of a multilevel TDR
   probe created by embedding the waveguide on the outside wall of a PVC
   pipe and running the coaxial cable through the interior of the pipe as a
   way to protect the cable. The length of the stainless steel rod at the
   center of the probe was 0.06 m, and the stainless steel rod forming the
   outer loop was 0.063 m long. The rods were embedded in a groove made on
   one end of the wall of a 0.2 m section of PVC pipe. The ends of the
   stainless steel rods were directed through the wall to protrude inside
   the pipe and soldered to the coaxial cable. Fifteen sets of probes were
   built and tested Several such sections of PVC pipe can be connected in
   series to create a multilevel probe, which will protect the cables from
   damage during installation and removal. The reusable multilevel TDR
   probes were tested in the laboratory and compared with the weighing
   method. The fitted straight line from the regression analysis between
   TDR theta(v) and weighing method theta(v) resulted in good correlation,
   with R-2 of 0.89 and 0.97, respectively, for the first and second
   laboratory experiments. The field experiment gave an R-2 of 0.51 where
   it was difficult to maintain good soil contact. This multilevel probe is
   cost-effective, reusable, and can measure soil water content at many
   different depths.}},

Abstract = {{Sea ice is exchanged between the Arctic Ocean and Canadian Arctic
   Archipelago (CAA) but has not been quantified over long time periods.
   The corresponding mechanisms responsible for recent variability and
   change also remain unidentified. To address this, we estimated the sea
   ice area flux between the Arctic Ocean and the M'Clure Strait and Queen
   Elizabeth Islands (QEI) from 1997 to 2012 for the months of May to
   November. Over the period, there was a mean flux of -1 x 10(3) km(2) (21
   x 10(3) km(2)) at the M'Clure Strait and mean flux of +8 x 10(3) km(2)
   (8 x 10(3) km(2)) at the QEI (positive and negative flux signs
   correspond to Arctic Ocean ice inflow and outflow, respectively). The
   M'Clure Strait had a mean flux of +5 x 10(3) km(2) from May to September
   and a mean flux of -7 x 10(3) km(2) from October to November. The QEI
   gates had a mean flux of +4 x 10(3) km(2) from August to September with
   negligible ice exchange from May to July and October to November. More
   frequent high sea level pressure anomalies over the Beaufort Sea and
   Canadian Basin since 2007 have reduced Arctic Ocean multiyear ice (MYI)
   inflow into the M'Clure Strait. The presence of MYI in the CAA
   originating from the Arctic Ocean has been maintained by inflow at the
   QEI, which has increased since 2005. These recent increases in Arctic
   Ocean MYI inflow into the QEI can be attributed to increased open water
   area within the CAA that have provided more leeway for inflow to occur.}},

Abstract = {{Hemp fiber provides industries with numerous possibilities for
   bio-product market development. An experiment was conducted to
   decorticate green and retted hemps using a hammermill. Treatments
   included three screening scenarios (19.3 and 25.7 mm round-holed screens
   and no screen), three feeding masses (75, 125, and 200 g), and two
   precutting scenarios (hemp cut into 40 mm segments and non-cut hemp).
   Fiber yield, core (or hurd) yield, effectiveness of decortication, and
   power and energy requirements were experimentally determined. Results
   showed that effects of precutting and feeding mass significantly
   interacted with screen scenarios. With screens, precutting green hemp
   resulted in reduced energy requirement for decortication, while without
   screens, non-cut and cut green hemp required comparable energy. A higher
   energy requirement was observed only for the 25.7 mm screen for the
   retted hemp. For both the green and retted hemps, mixed results were
   obtained for the effects of feeding mass on the power requirement.
   However, clear trends were observed for the effects of feeding mass on
   the energy with larger feeding mass requiring greater energy. Fiber
   yield varied from 1.0\% to 34.6\%, and core yield varied from 11.8\% to
   73.7\%, depending on the treatments. In most cases, better fiber and
   core yields, and greater decortication effectiveness were observed for
   the cut hemp with smaller feeding mass and the presence of a screen when
   compared to the non-cut hemp with higher feeding mass without screens.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a combinatorial approach for improving spatial
   predictions. First, copulas are used to interpolate a spatially
   distributed point rainfall field to a uniform spatial grid. It is
   observed that results vary substantially depending on the parameters
   chosen for interpolation leading to the hypothesis that it may be
   advantageous to estimate copula parameters locally or to combine local
   and global copula predictions. It is found that by modifying the method
   of forecast combinations, prediction errors in the spatial interpolation
   of rainfall can be reduced. Although this method of combining
   predictions is applied in the context of rainfall interpolation using
   local and global copula predictions, it can be used on other spatial
   variables and interpolation methods.}},

Title = {{A wireless embedded passive sensor for monitoring the corrosion
   potential of reinforcing steel}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Corrosion of reinforcing steel, which results in premature deterioration
   of reinforced concrete structures, is a worldwide problem. Most
   corrosion sensing techniques require some type of wired connection
   between the sensor and monitoring electronics. This causes significant
   problems in their installation and long-term use. In this paper we
   describe a new type of passive embeddable wireless sensor that is based
   on an LC coil resonator where the resonant frequency is changed by the
   corrosion potential of the reinforcing steel. The resonant frequency can
   be monitored remotely by an interrogator coil inductively coupled to the
   sensor coil. The sensor unit comprises an inductive coil connected in
   parallel with a voltage dependent capacitor (varactor) and a pair of
   corrosion electrodes consisting of a reinforcing steel sensing electrode
   and a stainless steel reference electrode. Change of potential
   difference between the electrodes due to variation of the corrosion
   potential of the reinforcing steel changes the capacitance of the
   varactor and shifts the resonant frequency of the sensor. A time-domain
   gating method was used for the interrogation of the inductively coupled
   corrosion sensor. Results of an accelerated corrosion test using the
   sensor indicate that the corrosion potential can be monitored with a
   resolution of less than 10 mV. The sensor is simple in design and
   requires no power source, making it an inexpensive option for long-term
   remote monitoring of the corrosion state of reinforcing steel.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of maximizing power transfer through overhead
   transmission lines necessitates the use of dynamic power control to keep
   transmission line temperatures within acceptable limits. Excessive
   conductor operating temperatures lead to an increased sag of the
   transmission line conductor and may reduce their expected life. In this
   paper, a passive wireless sensor based on a resonant radio frequency
   (RF) cavity is presented which can be used to measure overhead
   transmission line temperature. The temperature sensor does not require a
   power supply and can be easily clamped to the power line with an antenna
   attached. Changing temperature causes a change of cavity dimensions and
   a shift in resonant frequency. The resonant frequency of the cavity can
   be interrogated wirelessly. This temperature sensor has a resolution of
   0.07 degrees C and can be interrogated from distances greater than 4.5
   m. The sensor has a deviation from linearity of less than 2 degrees C.}},

   the proposed method can provide faster and more reliable protection for

Abstract = {{Consumption of mycotoxin-contaminated agricultural and food products has
   caused adverse human health effects for many centuries. Although
   mycotoxin contamination of agricultural products still occurs,
   application of innovative agricultural practices, food processing, and
   handling techniques has greatly reduced consumer exposure to mycotoxins.
   This paper reviews recent developments and potential applications of
   machine vision systems in replacing current labor-intensive,
   time-consuming methods by providing a quick, accurate, and low-cost
   alternative for detecting microbial and fecal contaminants in fresh and
   processed foods. The basic principles and components of the machine
   vision system are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Wool fabrics were graft copolymerized with methacrylamide (MAAm) and
   2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) in aqueous media, using a chemical
   redox system as an initiator. After grafting, the mechanical properties
   related to the hand evaluation, such as tensile, shearing, bending,
   compression and surface properties of wool fabrics, were evaluated by
   means of the Kawabata Evaluation System for Fabric. The surface
   morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy. The results
   revealed that the surface morphology and low-stress mechanical
   properties of wool fabrics were remarkably changed after grafting with
   HEMA. The weight gain of the wool fabrics grafted with HEMA increased
   rapidly in the initial grafting stage and reached saturation level at
   17wt\% after 20 minutes. Small deposits of oligomers were visible on
   wool surfaces and typical scale patterns were changed after grafting
   wool fabric with HEMA. The slope of the shearing hysteresis curves in
   the weft and warp directions for wool fabrics grafted with HEMA was
   increased compared with the control and wool fabrics grafted with MAAm.
   These results imply that the changes in tensile, shearing, bending and
   compression behavior of grafted wool fabrics are due to the reduction of
   the free internal volumes of the fabrics, leading to a tightening of its
   texture.}},

Abstract = {{This work provides an overview of a parallel, high-order,
   error-controllable framework for solving large-scale scattering problems
   in electromagnetics, as well as open problems pertinent to such
   solutions. The method is based on the higher-order locally corrected
   Nystrom (LCN) discretization of the combined-field integral equation
   (CFIE), accelerated with the error-controlled Multi-Level Fast Multipole
   Algorithm (MLFMA). Mechanisms for controlling the accuracy of
   calculations are discussed, including geometric representation, stages
   of the locally corrected Nystrom method, and the MLFMA. Also presented
   are the key attributes of parallelization for the developed numerical
   framework. Numerical results validate the proposed numerical scheme by
   demonstrating higher-order error convergence for smooth scatterers. For
   the problem of scattering from a sphere, the developed numerical
   solution is shown to have the ability to produce a solution with a
   maximum relative error of the order 10(-9). Open-ended problems, such as
   treatment of general scatterers with geometric singularities,
   construction of well-conditioned operators, and current challenges in
   development of fast iterative and direct algorithms, are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous networks, consisting of macrocells overlaid with small
   cells (e. g., femtocells, picocells, microcells) provide a fast,
   flexible, cost-efficient, and fine-tuned design and expansion for
   existing cellular wireless networks to satisfy the ever increasing
   demand for network capacity. In HetNets, small cells serve as offloading
   spots in the radio access network to offload users and their associated
   traffic from congested macrocells. However, due to their large-scale
   deployment in random locations, limited transmit power, and the lack of
   complete coordination, the coexistence and efficient operation of small
   cells is very challenging. In this article, we discuss the coexistence
   challenges posed to small cells and show that, with cognition
   capabilities (e. g., achieved through spectrum sensing), small cells can
   overcome the posed challenges and efficiently coexist in a multitier
   cellular wireless network. Then we discuss a statistical tool,
   stochastic geometry, to model and analyze heterogeneous cellular
   networks. We give two examples where the stochastic geometry tools can
   be exploited to obtain insightful design guidelines. First, we exploit
   stochastic geometry to evaluate the load of each network tier and study
   different offloading techniques used to control this load. Second, we
   exploit stochastic geometry to maximize frequency reuse efficiency
   through spectrum sensing design for channel access and compare two
   channel access techniques based on spectrum sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Machine-to-machine communication, a promising technology for the smart
   city concept, enables ubiquitous connectivity between one or more
   autonomous devices without or with minimal human interaction. M2M
   communication is the key technology to support data transfer among
   sensors and actuators to facilitate various smart city applications (e.
   g., smart metering, surveillance and security, infrastructure
   management, city automation, and eHealth). To support massive numbers of
   machine type communication (MTC) devices, one of the challenging issues
   is to provide an efficient way for multiple access in the network and to
   minimize network overload. In this article, we review the M2M
   communication techniques in Long Term Evolution-Advanced cellular
   networks and outline the major research issues. Also, we review the
   different random access overload control mechanisms to avoid congestion
   caused by random channel access of MTC devices. To this end, we propose
   a reinforcement learning-based eNB selection algorithm that allows the
   MTC devices to choose the eNBs (or base stations) to transmit packets in

Abstract = {{A nonparametric version of the sequential signal detection problem is
   studied. Our signal model includes a class of time-limited signals for
   which we collect data in the sequential fashion at discrete points in
   the presence of correlated noise. For such a setup we introduce a novel
   signal detection algorithm relying on the postfiltering smooth
   correction of the classical Whittaker-Shannon interpolation series.
   Given a finite frame of noisy samples of the signal, we design a
   detection algorithm being able to detect a departure from a reference
   signal as quickly as possible. Our detector is represented as a
   normalized partial-sum continuous time stochastic process, for which we
   obtain a functional central limit theorem under weak assumptions on the
   correlation structure of the noise. Particularly, our results allow for
   noise processes such as ARMA and general linear processes as well as
   alpha-mixing processes. The established limit theorems allow us to
   design monitoring algorithms with the desirable level of the probability
   of false alarm and able to detect a change with probability approaching
   one.}},

   articulation. The bore of the heads and the neck of the stems were
   divided into eight regions each and graded by three observers for
   corrosion and fretting damage separately using modified criteria as
   reported in the literature. The 36 mm head size featured a significant
   difference in the corrosion head scores (p=0.022) in comparison to the
   28 mm heads. This may be attributed to a greater torque acting along the
   taper interface due to activities of daily living. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Contribution of Arousal from Sleep to Postevent Tachycardia in Patients
   with Obstructive Sleep Apnea}},
Journal = {{SLEEP}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{881-889}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Study Objectives: Heart rate increases after obstructive events in
   patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This response is generally
   attributed to arousal from sleep. Opening of the obstructed airway,
   however, is associated with ventilatory and hemodynamic changes that
   could result in physiologic responses unrelated to arousal. Our
   objective was to determine the contribution of these physiologic
   responses to postevent tachycardia.
   Design: Analysis of data obtained during previous research protocols.
   Setting: Academic sleep laboratory.
   Participants: Twenty patients with severe OSA.
   Interventions: Patients were placed on a continuous positive airway
   pressure (CPAP) device. CPAP was reduced during sleep to different
   levels (dial-downs), producing obstructive events of varying severity.
   Some dial-downs with severe obstruction were maintained until
   spontaneous airway opening. In others, CPAP was increased after three
   obstructed breaths, terminating the events approximately 10 sec before
   spontaneous termination in long dial-downs.
   Measurement and Results: Beat-by-beat heart rate (HR) was measured for
   20 sec following airway opening. Spontaneous opening during sustained
   dial-downs occurred 21.9 +/- 8.4 sec after dial-down, was associated
   with arousal, and resulted in the greatest postevent tachycardia (7.8
   +/- 4.0 min(-1)). However, deliberate termination of events (12.2 +/-
   2.6 sec after dial-down) was also followed by tachycardia that, in the
   absence of cortical arousal, showed a dose-response behavior, increasing
   with severity of obstruction and without apparent threshold. Delta HR
   following deliberately brief, severe obstruction (3.8 +/- 3.0 min(-1))
   was approximately half the Delta HR that followed spontaneous opening of
   equally severe obstructions despite the shorter duration and absence of
   cortical arousal.
   Conclusions: Postevent tachycardia is due in large part to physiologic
   (arousal-unrelated) responses that occur upon relief of obstruction.}},

Journal = {{MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In the present study, grain boundary (GB) mobility was determined by
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using two different techniques: the
   applied strain method and the adapted interface random walk method. The
   first method involves a driving force while the second method does not.
   Nevertheless, both methods led to essentially the same values of the GB
   mobility. This shows that the GB mobility is independent of the nature
   of the driving force, provided that it is low enough that the linear
   velocity-driving force relationship is properly sampled. The case
   studied here can be viewed as a validated reference case that can be
   used in future studies to test new techniques to determine the GB
   mobility. For this purpose we provide the full information about the
   interatomic potential we employed and the initial atomic configurations.
   Finally, we use the obtained results to discuss whether any existing MD
   simulation data agree with experimental data on pure metals.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature must be accounted for in order to provide accurate
   measurements in electrode-based pH sensors. We present an integrated
   wireless passive sensor for remote pH monitoring employing temperature
   compensation. The sensor is a resonant circuit consisting of a planar
   spiral inductor connected in parallel to a temperature-dependent
   resistor (thermistor) and a voltage-dependent capacitor (varactor). A pH
   combination electrode consisting of an iridium/iridium oxide sensing
   electrode and a silver/silver chloride reference electrode, is connected
   in parallel with the varactor. A potential difference change across the
   electrodes due to pH variation of the solution changes the
   voltage-dependent capacitance and shifts the resonant frequency, while
   temperature of the solution affects the resistance and changes the
   quality factor of the sensor. An interrogator coil is inductively
   coupled to the sensor inductor and remotely tracks the resonant
   frequency and quality factor of the sensor. The sensor is calibrated for
   temperature over a range of 25 degrees C-55 degrees C and pH over a
   1.5-12 dynamic range. By employing temperature compensation, a
   measurement accuracy of less than 0.1 pH is achieved and the response
   time of the sensor is demonstrated to be less than 1 s. The sensor
   overcomes the pH measurement error due to the temperature dependence of
   electrode-based passive pH sensors and has applications in remote pH
   monitoring where temperature varies over a wide range.}},

Abstract = {{For the first time, this paper investigates the application of the
   concept of Lyapunov exponents to the stability analysis of the nonlinear
   vehicle model in plane motion with two degrees of freedom. The
   nonlinearity of the model comes from the third-order polynomial
   expression between the lateral forces on the tyres and the tyre slip
   angles. Comprehensive studies on both system and structural stability
   analyses of the vehicle model are presented. The system stability
   analysis includes the stability, lateral stability region, and effects
   of driving conditions on the lateral stability region of the vehicle
   model in the state space. In the structural stability analysis, the
   ranges of driving conditions in which the stability of the vehicle model
   is guaranteed are given. Moreover, through examples, the largest
   Lyapunov exponent is suggested as an indicator of the convergence rate
   in which the disturbed vehicle model returns to its stable fixed point.}},

Abstract = {{Owning to their unparalleled sensitivity resolution, nanomechanical
   resonators have excellent capabilities in design of nano-sensors for gas
   detection. The current challenge is to develop new designs of the

   high sensitivity. In this work, the characteristics of impulse wave
   propagation in carbon nanotube-based sensors are investigated using
   molecular dynamics simulations to provide a new method for detection of
   noble gases. A sensitivity index based on wave velocity shifts in a
   single-walled carbon nanotube, induced by surrounding gas atoms, is
   defined to explore the efficiency of the nano-sensor. The simulation
   results indicate that the nano-sensor is able to differentiate distinct
   noble gases at the same environmental temperature and pressure. The
   inertia and the strengthening effects by the gases on wave
   characteristics of carbon nanotubes are particularly discussed, and a
   continuum mechanics shell model is developed to interpret the effects.}},

Abstract = {{Soil aerators have recently been adapted for land application of liquid

   soil. An AerWay aerator with two types of rolling tines (shatter and
   leaf tines) was used in the field study. Each type of rolling tine was
   operated at two different swing angles (0 degrees and 5 degrees) and two
   penetration depths (125 and 150 mm). The characteristics of the
   resultant soil pockets including pocket opening dimensions and pocket
   volume were measured. Pocket opening varied between 91 and 212 mm in
   length, 9 and 44 mm in width, and 1,088 and 5,555 mm(2) in area. The
   volume of pocket also varied with the soil type, tine type, penetration
   depth, and swing angle, and ranged between 69 and 327 mL. Larger pocket
   openings and volumes were observed in the clay loam soil than in the
   loamy sand soil. The shatter tines created larger soil pocket volumes
   than the leaf tines. The larger swing angle and greater penetration
   depth resulted in larger soil pockets.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of cooperative packet delivery to mobile nodes
   in a hybrid wireless mobile network, where both infrastructure-based and
   infrastructure-less (i.e., ad hoc mode or peer-to-peer mode)
   communications are used. We propose a solution based on a coalition
   formation among mobile nodes to cooperatively deliver packets among
   these mobile nodes in the same coalition. A coalitional game is
   developed to analyze the behavior of the rational mobile nodes for
   cooperative packet delivery. A group of mobile nodes makes a decision to
   join or to leave a coalition based on their individual payoffs. The
   individual payoff of each mobile node is a function of the average
   delivery delay for packets transmitted to the mobile node from a base
   station and the cost incurred by this mobile node for relaying packets
   to other mobile nodes. To find the payoff of each mobile node, a Markov
   chain model is formulated and the expected cost and packet delivery
   delay are obtained when the mobile node is in a coalition. Since both
   the expected cost and packet delivery delay depend on the probability
   that each mobile node will help other mobile nodes in the same coalition
   to forward packets to the destination mobile node in the same coalition,
   a bargaining game is used to find the optimal helping probabilities.
   After the payoff of each mobile node is obtained, we find the solutions
   of the coalitional game which are the stable coalitions. A distributed
   algorithm is presented to obtain the stable coalitions and a
   Markov-chain-based analysis is used to evaluate the stable coalitional
   structures obtained from the distributed algorithm. Performance
   evaluation results show that when the stable coalitions are formed, the
   mobile nodes achieve a nonzero payoff (i.e., utility is higher than the
   cost). With a coalition formation, the mobile nodes achieve higher
   payoff than that when each mobile node acts alone.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial products such as toxins can interfere with a variety of
   cellular processes, leading to severe human diseases. Clostridium
   difficile toxins, TcdA and TcdB are the primary contributing factors to
   the pathogenesis of C. difficile-associated diseases (CDAD). While the
   mechanisms for TcdA and TcdB mediated cellular responses are complex, it
   has been shown that these toxins can alter chemotactic responses of
   neutrophils and intestinal epithelial cells leading to innate immune
   responses and tissue damages. The effects of C. difficile toxins on the
   migration and trafficking of other leukocyte subsets, such as T
   lymphocytes, are not clear and may have potential implications for
   adaptive immunity. We investigated here the direct and indirect effects
   of TcdA and TcdB on the migration of human blood T cells using
   conventional cell migration assays and microfluidic devices. It has been
   found that, although both toxins decrease T cell motility, only TcdA but
   not TcdB decreases T cell chemotaxis. Similar effects are observed in T
   cell migration toward the TcdA- or TcdB-treated human epithelial cells.
   Our study demonstrated the primary role of TcdA (compared to TcdB) in
   altering T cell migration and chemotaxis, suggesting possible
   implications for C. difficile toxin mediated adaptive immune responses
   in CDAD.}},

Abstract = {{Finite element (FE) modeling based on a patient's hip dual energy X-ray
   absorptiometry (DXA) image is a promising tool for more accurately
   assessing hip fracture risk, as it is able to comprehensively consider
   effects from all the mechanical parameters affecting hip fracture.
   However, a number of factors influence the precision (also known as
   repeatability or reproducibility) of a DXA-based FE procedure, for
   example, subject positioning in DXA scanning. As a procedure is required
   to have adequately high precision in clinical application, we
   investigated the effects of the involved factors on the precision of a
   DXA-based patient-specific FE procedure developed by the authors, to
   provide insight into how the precision of the procedure can be improved
   so that it can meet the clinical standards. Fracture risk indices
   corresponding to initial and repeat DXA scans acquired in 30 typical
   clinical subjects were computed and compared to assess short term
   repeatability of the procedure. It was found that inconsistent
   positioning followed by manual segmentation of the projected femur
   contour induced significant variability in the predicted fracture risk
   indices. This research suggests that, to apply the DXA-based FE
   procedure in clinical assessment, it will be necessary to pay more
   strict attention to subject positioning in DXA scanning. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Compaction and relaxation characteristics of densified distiller's spent

   (60.3-135.7 MPa), initial moisture content (15\%, 20\% and 25\% wb) and
   soluble content (15\% and 30\%) were analyzed during the study. The
   compaction levels used in this study caused up to a 4\% wb reduction in
   the moisture of compacts in comparison to their initial moisture. The
   density of compacts was analyzed to determine the compaction
   characteristics of distiller's spent grain using Jones model. Analysis
   of the Jones model showed that there was a significant (P = 0.004)
   decrease in compressibility with an increase in soluble content from 0\%
   to 30\%. The distiller's spent grain compacts were subjected to
   relaxation tests and the relaxation data obtained were normalized and
   analyzed to determine the asymptotic modulus (EA) of the compacts. The
   asymptotic modulus was used as a measure of rigidity of the compacts.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a fast and efficient algorithm for the calculation
   of electromagnetic fields radiated from lightning return-stroke channel
   as well as lightning-induced voltages in frequency-dependent
   transmission lines. The algorithm developed in this paper employs a
   mixed time-frequency macro-model that is based on tracing the poles and
   residues of the transfer function of the lightning-transmission-line
   system. Accurate and fast calculation of electromagnetic field data
   along the excited transmission line is critical to obtain the source
   terms (or forcing functions) in field-to-transmission-line coupling
   equations. Using the proposed method, we are able to obtain a closed
   form solution for the lumped sources required for the analysis of a
   two-conductor transmission line exposed to nonuniform electromagnetic
   fields. The algorithm provides high accuracy as well as significant
   speed gain for multiconductor transmission lines (MTL) as well. To
   demonstrate the application of the proposed method, we will compare our
   results with those obtained using other methods or measurements. (C)

Abstract = {{The present contribution reports the fabrication and characterization of
   silk sericin (SS) nanofibers via electrospinning. The function of
   solution concentration on morphological appearance and average diameter
   of the electrospun SS membranes was investigated by scanning electron
   microscopy. The structure and physical properties were observed by
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TG). All beads were
   acquired in lower concentration of SS solution, 1.3-8.5 wt\% of SS
   solutions, and beaded fibers were produced from 9.6, 11.7, 14.2, and
   16.5 wt\% of SS solution. The perfect nanofibers acquiring average
   diameters of 145 and 184 nm were fabricated from 20.9 to 22.9 wt\% of SS
   solution, respectively. Results from FT-IR showed that in the as-spun
   fibers, SS was present in a random coil conformation, while after heat
   treatment, the molecular structure of SS was transformed into a
   beta-sheet containing structure. DSC and TG analysis illustrated that
   trifluoroacetic acid can be eliminated by heating. The availability of
   SS nanofibers introduces a new set of possible uses of these amazing
   fibers at a scale not explored before. New uses include small diameter
   fibers for cell proliferation purposes, nanocomposite reinforcing fibers
   for nanotechnology, wound dressing, scaffolds for tissue engineering,
   and other biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-linked polymeric micelles have gained increasing research interest
   in the past decade due to the instability of existing polymeric micelles
   when used in vivo. In this study, we reported a series of covalently
   cross-linked pH-sensitive biodegradable micelles based on the
   poly(ethylene glycol)-hyperbranched poly(beta-aminoester)s with acrylate
   group terminals (PEG-HBPAE-A) copolymers for intracellular delivery of
   doxorubicin (DOX). PEG-HBPAE-A can be self-assembled to form micellar
   nanoparticles in aqueous solution with diameters of approximately 160
   nm. The non-cross-linked micelles (NCLMs) were cross-linked upon UV
   irradiation to form cross-linked micelles (CLMs). H-1 NMR, FT-IR and
   dynamic light scattering (DLS) were utilized to investigate the process
   of the UV cross-linking and the. stability of CLMs. The results showed
   the significantly enhanced stability for CLMs in comparison to NCLMs. pH
   sensitivity of CLMs and NCLMs were also estimated by DLS. In vitro drug
   release studies confirmed that DOX release from DOX-loaded CLMs was
   greatly inhibited upon the neutral pH environment, whereas DOX underwent
   faster release in acidic conditions. MTT assays showed that DOX-loaded
   micelles had a similar inhibition rate for HepG-2 and MCF-7 cell lines
   compared with free DOX, whereas the blank CLMs and NCLMs showed very low
   c-ytotoxicity. Laser scanning confocal microscopy and real-time in situ
   fluorescence microscopy were exploited to investigate drug uptake in
   cells and drug distribution in the interior of cells. These results
   showed a promising nanocarrier for intracellular DOX delivery with great
   potential for cancer therapy.}},

Title = {{Statistical downscaling of precipitation using quantile regression}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{487}},
Pages = {{122-135}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{Statistical downscaling of precipitation is required as part of many
   climate change studies. Statistical downscaling based on regression
   models requires one to sample from the conditional distribution to
   preserve the variance of observed precipitation. In this paper, we
   present a new technique for downscaling precipitation. The proposed
   method employs quantile regression rather than traditional linear
   regression models to determine the conditional distribution for a given
   day. This eliminates the need for some of the assumptions required in
   standard linear regression, including the assumption of
   normally-distributed errors with constant variance. The quantile
   regression model also allows considerable flexibility in selecting
   predictor variables in that different subsets of predictors can be used
   for different parts of the conditional distribution. A Bayesian method
   adapted to quantile regression is used to select predictor variables.
   The method is illustrated through an application to five weather
   stations in Canada. It is found that the proposed method has distinct
   advantages over the conventional regression model for predicting summer
   precipitation, while for winter precipitation there is not much
   difference between the two methods. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Steady, two-dimensional, developing laminar forced convection is

   wall corrugations: sinusoidal-wavy-shaped (SWS), rounded-ellipse-shaped
   (RES), and rounded-vee-shaped (RVS). Different geometric configurations
   of the three shapes are studied. Fluid flow and heat transfer are
   examined in a typical module in the fully-developed region for Reynolds
   numbers in the range of 25 to 300 for a Prandtl number of 2.29. Over the
   ranges of the geometric parameters studied, the SWS corrugation has, in
   general, the lowest friction factor and highest average Nusselt number
   values. The RES corrugation has the highest heat transfer per unit
   pumping power at an inlet Reynolds number of 300.}},

Title = {{An Engineered Conductor for Gain and Efficiency Improvement of
   Miniaturized Microstrip Antennas}},
Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION MAGAZINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{77-90}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper reviews the concept of an engineered conductor, introduced by
   the authors in order to reduce ohmic losses of miniaturized microstrip
   antennas {[}1-4]. Because of the miniaturization, the ohmic losses of
   microstrip antennas increase, which essentially significantly reduces
   their gain and efficiency. By the use of the engineered conductor
   concept, these two important parameters of such antennas can be improved
   without altering the antenna's geometry. The concept is based on using
   multiple laminated thin conductors, rather than one thick conducting
   layer, to form the microstrip antenna. The technique is applied to
   several miniaturized microstrip antennas in order to reduce their ohmic
   losses. The concept is explained using a microstrip line to demonstrate
   that the conductor loss can be reduced by increasing the number of
   layers in the lamination, while keeping the total thickness constant.
   Using conventional metallized substrates, the lamination reduces the
   thickness of each conductor layer to approximately or less than the skin
   depth in that conductor. Studies of two miniaturized antennas - namely,
   the square-ring antenna and the modified open-ring antenna - have
   respectively provided about 4.6 dB and 1.5 dB improvements in the gain,
   and from 30\% to 40.7\% improvement in the efficiency. Experimental
   investigations are also presented that confirmed the simulated results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a computationally efficient surrogate model-based

   heuristic, simple representations of complex systems that are obtained

   significantly faster than full-detail simulation models to obtain
   accurate statistical tolerance information about complex power networks.
   Usefulness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by two application
   examples. In the first example, surrogate models are used for
   determining the statistical distribution of undesired remnant harmonics
   produced by a voltage-source converter, given the uncertainty in the
   firing angles. In the second example, the impact of variations in the
   system parameters around the nominal values on the transient behavior of

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of downlink power allocation in an
   orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) cellular network
   with macrocells underlaid with femtocells. The femto-access points
   (FAPs) and the macro-base stations (MBSs) in the network are assumed to
   compete with each other to maximize their capacity under power
   constraints. This competition is captured in the framework of a
   Stackelberg game with the MBSs as the leaders and the FAPs as the
   followers. The leaders are assumed to have foresight enough to consider
   the responses of the followers while formulating their own strategies.
   The Stackelberg equilibrium is introduced as the solution of the
   Stackelberg game, and it is shown to exist under some mild assumptions.
   The game is expressed as a mathematical program with equilibrium
   constraints (MPEC), and the best response for a one leader-multiple
   follower game is derived. The best response is also obtained when a
   quality-of-service constraint is placed on the leader. Orthogonal power
   allocation between leader and followers is obtained as a special case of
   this solution under high interference. These results are used to build
   algorithms to iteratively calculate the Stackelberg equilibrium, and a
   sufficient condition is given for its convergence. The performance of
   the system at a Stackelberg equilibrium is found to be much better than
   that at a Nash equilibrium.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental conditions during storage can affect dehulling

   Quality parameters of red lentils stored at different initial moisture
   contents (10\%, 12.5\%, 15.0\% and 17.5\%, wet basis) at 10 degrees C,
   20 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 40 degrees C for 16 weeks (wk) were
   determined. Initial moisture content was maintained constant for all
   temperatures throughout the study. Germination decreased with increase
   in temperature and moisture content during storage. Free fatty acid
   values remained the same for lower temperatures (10 degrees C and 20
   degrees C) throughout the study. Visible mould appeared only on the
   samples stored at 40 degrees C with 17.5\% initial moisture content

Abstract = {{We propose a novel scheme for delay-optimal scheduling in multi-user
   multi-relay cellular wireless networks. The cell area is divided into
   several sectors, each serviced by an individual relay station (RS). In
   order to have simultaneous transmissions by the users in neighbouring
   sectors, we assume that users of each individual sector use separate set
   of orthogonal channels to communicate with the RS and the base station
   (BS). Moreover, a separate orthogonal channel is shared among relays for
   transmission to the BS. For uplink communication, users are allowed to
   choose between two modes of transmission, namely, direct transmission
   mode and relayed transmission mode through a simple transmission mode
   selection algorithm. Users are allocated fractions of the time-slot for
   the first phase of transmission (from the users to the BS and the RSs)
   in a time-division multiple access (TDMA) fashion. For the second phase
   of transmission (from the RSs to the BS), each RS is allocated a
   fraction of the time-slot. We model the problem of end-to-end (e2e)
   delay-optimal scheduling as an infinite-horizon average reward Markov
   decision process (MDP) for users and relays in two separate stages. An
   online learning approach is then employed to solve the problem in a
   distributed manner for both users and relays in each phase of
   transmission. The proposed online stochastic learning solution converges
   to the optimal solution almost surely (with probability 1) under some
   realistic conditions(1). Simulation results show that the proposed
   approach outperforms the conventional scheduling schemes.}},

Abstract = {{For spectrum sharing and avoidance of mutual interference, carrier-sense
   multiple access (CSMA) protocols are very popular in distributed
   wireless networks. CSMA protocols aim to maximize the spatial frequency
   reuse while limiting the mutual interference and outage. The hard core
   point process (HCPP) is a very popular tool for modeling and analysis of
   random CSMA networks. However, the traditional HCPP suffers from the
   node intensity (and hence the interference) underestimation flaw.
   Therefore, we propose a modified hard core point process to mitigate
   this flaw. The proposed modified HCPP is generalized for any fading
   environment. To this end, we derive a closed-form expression for the
   intensity of simultaneously active transmitters in a random wireless
   CSMA network. Then, we derive a closed-form expression for approximating
   the outage probability experienced by a generic receiver in the network,
   and subsequently, use it to obtain the transmission capacity of the
   network. Finally, we show the existence of an optimal carrier-sensing
   threshold for the CSMA protocol that maximizes the transmission capacity
   of the network. Simulation results validate the analysis and also
   provide interesting insights into the design of practical CSMA networks.}},

Abstract = {{Improvement of cell coverage and network capacity are two major
   challenges for the evolving 4G cellular wireless communication networks
   such as LTE-Advanced networks. In this context, hierarchical layering of
   cells with macro base stations coexisting with low-power and short-range
   base stations (corresponding to picocells or femtocells) in a service
   area is considered to be an efficient solution to enhance the
   spectral-efficiency of the network per unit area. Also, such a
   hierarchical cell deployment, which is referred to as a heterogeneous
   network, or HetNet, provides significant improvement in the coverage of
   indoor and cell edge users and ensures better QoS to the users.
   Interference mitigation between different layers is one of the key
   issues that needs to be resolved for successful deployment of HetNets.
   To this end, fast frequency response, FFR, is considered to be an
   efficient intercell interference coordination technique for OFDMA-based
   HetNets. This article focuses on evaluating three state-of-the-art FFR
   deployment schemes: strict FFR, soft FFR, and FFR-3 schemes for
   OFDMA-based two-tier HetNets comprising macrocells overlaid with
   femtocells. Also, a variation of the FFR-3 scheme, which is referred to
   as the optimal static FFR (OSFFR) scheme, is proposed. A broad
   comparison among all these FFR schemes is performed by using Monte Carlo
   simulations considering performance metrics such as outage probability,
   average network sum rate, and spectral efficiency. Simulation results
   show that, the average gains in spectral efficiency (b/s/Hz) of the
   network are significantly higher for the proposed scheme when compared
   to the strict FFR, soft FFR, and FFR-3 schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Snoring sounds vary significantly within and between snorers. In this
   study, the variation of snoring sounds and its association with
   obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are quantified. Snoring sounds of 42
   snorers with different degrees of obstructive sleep apnea and 15 non-OSA
   snorers were analyzed. The sounds were recorded by a microphone placed
   over the suprasternal notch of trachea, simultaneously with
   polysomnography (PSG) data over the entire night. We hypothesize that
   snoring sounds vary significantly within a subject depending on the
   level of obstruction, and thus the level of airflow. We also hypothesize
   that this variability is associated with the severity of OSA. For each
   individual, we extracted snoring sound segments from the respiratory
   recordings, and divided them into three classes: non-apneic, hypopneic,
   and post-apneic using their PSG information. Several features were
   extracted from the snoring sound segments, and compared using a
   nonparametric statistical test. The results show significant shift in
   the median of features among the snoring sound classes (p < 0.00001) of
   an individual. In contrast to hypopneic and post-apneic classes, the
   characteristics of snoring sounds did not vary significantly over time
   in non-apneic class. Therefore, we used the total variation norm of each
   subject to classify the participants as OSA and non-OSA snorers. The
   results showed 92.9\% sensitivity, 100\% specificity and 96.4\%
   accuracy. (C) 2012 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   significant decreasing trend in mean Arctic sea ice extent of 4.5\% per
   decade from 1979 through 2010, the Antarctic results show a small
   positive trend of 2.3\% per decade. In some cases such as the Antarctic
   minimum ice cover, selected quantile regressions yield slope estimates

Title = {{Methodology to Estimate the Distance Traveled by Trucks on Rural Highway

Volume = {{139}},

Abstract = {{Truck travel, normally expressed in terms of truck vehicle-distance
   travel (VDT), is a critical data requirement for the design,
   construction, operation, and management of rural highway systems. The
   need to estimate and characterize truck travel on a system-wide basis,
   yet retain a compatible, site-specific mining capability, challenges the
   traditional approach of traffic monitoring programs. This paper develops
   and applies a two-phase methodology to estimate truck VDT on rural
   highway systems. The first phase, which leverages the approach
   recommended for developing truck traffic data inputs for
   mechanistic-empirical pavement design, processes vehicle classification
   data obtained from continuous, sample, and manual counts into annual
   average daily truck traffic (AADTT) estimates by vehicle class. The
   second phase attributes these site-specific AADTT estimates to highway
   segments comprising a rural highway network. The methodology, which is
   transferrable across jurisdictions, integrates standard statistical
   procedures with engineering judgment and trucking industry intelligence
   by establishing transparent decision algorithms and criteria.
   Application of the methodology using real data reveals relevant
   limitations and illustrative results that have application to a wide
   range of transportation engineering decisions. DOI:

Abstract = {{In a multidimensional feature space, the snoring sounds can extend from
   a very compact cluster to highly distinct clusters. In this study, we
   investigated the cause of snoring sound's variation within the snorers.
   It is known that a change in body position and sleep stage can affect
   snoring during sleep but it is unclear whether positional, sleep state,
   and blood oxygen level variations cause the snoring sounds to have
   different characteristics, and if it does how significant that effect
   would be. We extracted 12 characteristic features from snoring sound
   segments of 57 snorers and transformed them into a 4-D feature space
   using principal component analysis (PCA). Then, they were grouped based
   on the body position (side, supine, and prone), sleep stage (NREM, REM,
   and Arousal), and blood oxygen level (Normal and Desaturation). The
   probability density function of the transformed features was calculated
   for each class of categorical variables. The distance between the
   class-densities were calculated to determine which of these parameters
   affects the snoring sounds significantly. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
   was run for each categorical variable. The results show that the
   positional change has the highest effect on the snoring sounds; it
   results in forming distinct clusters of snoring sounds. Also, sleep
   state and blood oxygen level variation have been found to moderately
   affect the snoring sounds.}},

Abstract = {{A study of the microstructural characteristics of laser arc hybrid
   welded nickel based IN738 superalloy was performed. Laser arc hybrid
   welding produced a desirable weld profile in the alloy, similar to what
   is usually obtained during laser beam welding, and no cracking occurred
   exclusively in the fusion zone. Elemental partitioning pattern in the
   fusion zone was studied by electron probe microanalysis and calculating
   the volume fraction of the weld metal that resulted from the consumption
   of the filler wire. The result showed that Ti, Ta, Nb, Mo, Al and Zr
   partitioned into the interdendritic regions of the fusion zone. SEM and
   TEM examination of the fusion zone showed the presence of secondary
   solidification reaction constituents, which consists of MC type
   carbides. The study further revealed that non-equilibrium liquation of
   various second phases that were present in the alloy prior to welding
   contributed to intergranular liquation in the heat affected zone (HAZ),
   which consequently resulted in extensive HAZ intergranular cracking
   during welding. Although laser arc hybrid welding appears promising for
   improving the weldability of nickel based IN738 superalloy, a suitable
   weldability improvement procedure is required in order to minimise HAZ
   intergranular cracking and thereby enhance the applicability of this
   technology to the joining of the superalloy.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the vibrational behavior of double-walled carbon
   nanotubes (DWCNTs) is studied by a nonlocal elastic shell model. The
   nonlocal continuum model accounting for the small scale effects
   encompasses its classical continuum counterpart as a particular case.
   Based upon the constitutive equations of nonlocal elasticity, the
   displacement field equations coupled by van der Waals forces are
   derived. The set of governing equations of motion are then numerically
   solved by a novel method emerged from incorporating the radial point
   interpolation approximation within the framework of the generalized
   differential quadrature method. The present analysis provides the
   possibility of considering different combinations of layerwise boundary
   conditions. The influences of small scale factor, layerwise boundary
   conditions and geometrical parameters on the mechanical behavior of
   DWCNTs are fully investigated. Explicit expressions for the nonlocal
   frequencies of DWCNTs with all edges simply supported are also
   analytically obtained by a nonlocal elastic beam model. Some new
   intertube resonant frequencies and the corresponding noncoaxial
   vibrational modes are identified due to incorporating circumferential
   modes into the shell model. A shift in noncoaxial mode numbers, not
   predictable by the beam model, is also observed when the radius of
   DWCNTs is varied. The results generated also provide valuable
   information concerning the applicability of the beam model and new
   noncoaxial modes affecting the physical properties of nested nanotubes.}},

Abstract = {{Data communications infrastructure will play an important role to

   the reliability of the smart grid data communications infrastructure and
   its impact on the power consumption and supply optimizations. For
   optimizing the power consumption, we consider a deferrable load
   scheduling method which is modeled by using a constrained Markov
   decision process (CMDP) model, taking into account the unavailability of
   the home area network (HAN) and neighborhood area network (NAN)
   gateways. For optimizing the power supply, we consider an economic
   dispatch method which is modeled by using stochastic programming (SP),
   taking into account the unavailability of the exact power demand and
   supply information. The power consumption and supply costs are analyzed.
   In addition, we show how these costs can be reduced through the
   deployment of component redundancy in the smart grid data communications

Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{The instrument described here is an all-electronic dielectrophoresis
   (DEP) cytometer sensitive to changes in polarizability of single cells.
   The important novel feature of this work is the differential electrode
   array that allows independent detection and actuation of single cells
   within a short section (similar to 300 mu m) of the microfluidic
   channel. DEP actuation modifies the altitude of the cells flowing
   between two altitude detection sites in proportion to cell
   polarizability; changes in altitude smaller than 0.25 mu m can be
   detected electronically. Analysis of individual experimental signatures
   allows us to make a simple connection between the Clausius-Mossotti
   factor (CMF) and the amount of vertical cell deflection during
   actuation. This results in an all-electronic, label-free differential
   detector that monitors changes in physiological properties of the living
   cells and can be fully automated and miniaturized in order to be used in
   various online and offline probes and point-of-care medical
   applications. High sensitivity of the DEP cytometer facilitates
   observations of delicate changes in cell polarization that occur at the
   onset of apoptosis. We illustrate the application of this concept on a
   population of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that were followed in
   their rapid transition from a healthy viable to an early apoptotic
   state. DEP cytometer viability estimates closely match an Annexin V
   assay (an early apoptosis marker) on the same population of cells. (C)

   dams constructed to study the internal hydraulic conditions and required
   a flow environment to initiate particle movements in rockfill
   structures. The results from the testing of small-dimension dams

Abstract = {{Tracheal respiratory sound analysis is a simple and non-invasive way to
   study the pathophysiology of the upper airway and has recently been used
   for acoustic estimation of respiratory flow and sleep apnea diagnosis.
   However in none of the previous studies was the respiratory flow-sound
   relationship studied in people with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), nor
   during sleep. In this study, we recorded tracheal sound, respiratory
   flow, and head position from eight non-OSA and 10 OSA individuals during
   sleep and wakefulness. We compared the flow-sound relationship and
   variations in model parameters from wakefulness to sleep within and
   between the two groups. The results show that during both wakefulness
   and sleep, flow-sound relationship follows a power law but with
   different parameters. Furthermore, the variations in model parameters
   may be representative of the OSA pathology. The other objective of this
   study was to examine the accuracy of respiratory flow estimation
   algorithms during sleep: we investigated two approaches for calibrating
   the model parameters using the known data recorded during either
   wakefulness or sleep. The results show that the acoustical respiratory
   flow estimation parameters change from wakefulness to sleep. Therefore,
   if the model is calibrated using wakefulness data, although the
   estimated respiratory flow follows the relative variations of the real
   flow, the quantitative flow estimation error would be high during sleep.
   On the other hand, when the calibration parameters are extracted from
   tracheal sound and respiratory flow recordings during sleep, the
   respiratory flow estimation error is less than 10\%.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a novel dual polarized microwave imaging
   system. The system is comprised of a circular array of multiplexed
   antennas, distributed evenly around an object-of-interest (OI), along
   with a novel plurality of probes located at the antennas' apertures.
   Each probe consists of several p-i-n diodes biased in two different
   states (open and short). The probes are used to measure field scattered
   by an OI based on the modulated scatterer technique. Half of the probes
   are oriented vertically with the second half oriented horizontally. The
   presence of the two probe-orientations enables the imaging system to
   collect two orthogonal field polarizations, transverse electric (TE) and
   transverse magnetic (TM), without the need for mechanical rotation. In
   order to illuminate the object with all possible polarizations of the
   electromagnetic field, the transmitting antennas are placed at a slant
   angle with respect to the longitudinal plane of the imaging chamber.
   Near-field data are collected using each probe set, then calibrated. We
   show that the calibrated data for each polarization can be used to
   reconstruct the dielectric profile of various objects using either
   two-dimensional TE or TM inversion algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{No-wait job shop scheduling problems refer to the set of problems in
   which a number of jobs are available for processing on a number of
   machines in a job shop context with the added constraint that there
   should be no waiting time between consecutive operations of the jobs. In
   this paper, a two-machine, no-wait job shop problem with separable setup
   times and a single-server constraint is considered. The considered
   performance measure is the makespan. This problem is strongly NP-hard. A
   mathematical model of the problem is developed and a number of
   propositions are proven for the special cases. Moreover, a genetic
   algorithm is proposed in this paper to find the optimal (or
   near-optimal) solutions. In order to evaluate the developed algorithm, a
   number of small instances are solved to optimality using the developed
   mathematical model. The proposed algorithm is able to find the optimal
   solution of all of these cases. For larger instances, the developed
   algorithm has been compared with the 2-opt algorithm as well as a
   proposed lower bound. Computational results show the efficiency of the
   proposed algorithm in generating good quality solutions compared to the
   developed lower bounds and 2-opt algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{A computational model to predict polyethylene wear in modular total knee

   2.43 +/- 0.52 x 10(-10) mm(3)/Nm, respectively. The difference in wear
   factors was attributed to differences in wear mode and wear mechanisms

   abrasive/adhesive wear mechanism) and the backside surfaces (mainly

Abstract = {{In this paper, the temperature dependency of conventional polymer-based
   gas sensors is addressed and a novel polymer-based chemicapacitor sensor
   is presented for application in early detection of deterioration of
   grain in storage facilities. 3-D heat transfer simulations are used to
   investigate several heated platforms with the sensing area in millimeter
   range dimensions to enhance spoilage-induced analyte detection. A
   resistive heater is employed to heat and maintain the sensor at the
   desired operating temperature. The platform is optimized to achieve a
   uniform heat distribution throughout the sensing area with a temperature
   variation of Delta T <= 1 degrees C. Capacitive measurements are
   performed as a more sophisticated technique for analyte detection, where
   mechanisms other than swelling are involved. In this method, the need
   for conductive filler is eliminated, resulting in an improvement in
   sensor reproducibility and repeatability. 1-octanol and relative
   humidity measurements are performed, as they are the two key volatiles
   due to grain deterioration. The results verify functionality of the
   fabricated sensors at different temperatures, in ppm range for
   1-octanol, and up to 75\% RH. Responses at the elevated temperature of
   40 degrees C, above the grain bins ambient temperature, are insensitive
   to ambient temperature fluctuations. Sensitivity measurements
   demonstrate that an array of detectors, each held at different
   temperatures and operating at different frequencies, can be utilized to
   further enhance the sensor sensitivity and selectivity to a desired
   analyte.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the development of a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)

   Mathematical battery models suitable for real-time and transient
   simulation are often inaccurate due to internal electrochemical
   reactions in the battery and external factors such as loading
   conditions. To model these phenomena precisely while maintaining low
   computational intensity as required for real-time simulation is a
   prohibitively difficult task. In lieu of a mathematical model, this
   paper presents a simulation setup where actual batteries are interfaced
   with a real-time simulator. It provides a platform to test the emerging

Abstract = {{Decline in fish species populations due to river regulation by dams and
   weirs promoted the development of fishways, which are becoming one of
   the most common measures for the restoration of connectivity in rivers.
   Fishways efficiency can be species specific and thus monitoring and
   evaluation, and subsequent adjustments to design and hydraulic features,
   are required to inform potential users prior to installation. In this
   study we tested the applicability of electromyogram telemetry to study
   the swimming behavior of a cyprinid potamodromous species, the Iberian
   barbel Luciobarbus bocagei Steindachner, 1864, in an experimental
   pool-type fishway. In total, 24 barbels were used in the experiment, 12
   of which were tagged with EMG radio transmitters equipped with
   electrodes that register muscle activity, while the other 12 untagged
   fish were used as control. For tagged fish, a relationship between
   swimming speed and EMG telemetry signals was developed in a swimming
   tunnel, which was later used to assess barbels swimming behavior within
   the experimental fishway. Tagged fish exhibited high passage success and
   anaerobic burst swimming was only required to move through the submerged
   orifices of the fishway. Barbels spent successively less time when
   transversing the pools in the upstream direction. Measured hydraulic
   variables that were related with barbels' swimming speed within the
   fishways were the water velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, turbulence
   intensity and, especially, the horizontal component of Reynolds shear
   stress, highlighting the importance of these parameters when designing
   pool-type fishways. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{127-145}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{An experimental study of a fully developed turbulent channel flow and an
   adverse pressure gradient (APG) turbulent channel flow over smooth and
   rough walls has been performed using a particle image velocimetry (PIV)
   technique. The rough walls comprised two-dimensional square ribs of
   nominal height, k= 3 mm and pitch, p = 2k, 4k and 8k. It was observed
   that rib roughness enhanced the drag characteristics, and the degree of
   enhancement increased with increasing pitch. Similarly, rib roughness
   significantly increased the level of turbulence production, Reynolds
   stresses and wall-normal transport of turbulence kinetic energy and
   Reynolds shear stress well beyond the roughness sublayer. On the
   contrary, the distributions of the eddy viscosity, mixing length and
   streamwise transport of turbulence kinetic energy and Reynolds shear
   stress were reduced by wall roughness, especially in the outer layer.
   Adverse pressure gradient produced a further reduction in the mean
   velocity (in comparison to the results obtained in the parallel section)
   but increased the wall-normal extent across which the mean flow above
   the ribs is spatially inhomogeneous in the streamwise direction. APG
   also reinforced wall roughness in augmenting the equivalent sand grain
   roughness height. The combination of wall roughness and APG
   significantly increased turbulence production and Reynolds stresses
   except in the immediate vicinity of the rough walls. The transport
   velocities of the turbulence kinetic energy and Reynolds shear stress
   were also augmented by APG across most part of the rough-wall boundary
   layer. Further, APG enhanced the distributions of the eddy viscosity
   across most of the boundary layer but reduced the mixing length outside
   the roughness sublayer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses the appointment scheduling of outpatient
   surgeries in a multistage operating room (OR) department with stochastic
   service times serving multiple patient types. We discuss many
   challenges, such as the limited availability of multiple resources
   (e.g., staff, operating rooms, surgeons, and recovery beds), and the
   compatibility of patient and surgeon types. In addition, availability of
   surgeons is restricted by time window constraints. Three
   simulation-based optimization methods have been proposed to minimize the
   patients' wait time, patients' completion time, and number of surgery
   cancellations. The first method is simulation-based tabu search (STS).
   It combines discrete-event simulation and tabu search to schedule
   surgery cases. The second and third methods are integer programming
   enhanced tabu search (IPETS) and binary programming enhanced tabu search
   (BPETS). IPETS and BPETS improve on STS by incorporating integer
   programming and binary programming models, respectively. This article
   includes a case study of an OR department in a major Canadian hospital.
   We further expand the actual data obtained in the case study to cover a
   wide range of parameters in sets of test problems, and provide analysis
   on the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods in
   comparison with several scheduling rules. Finally, comments on the
   applications of the proposed methods are provided. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impact of direct current (DC) field on the
   activated sludge properties for potential improvement of the biological
   as well as membrane treatment processes. Three mixed-liquor suspended
   solids (MLSS) concentrations (5,000, 10,000 and 15,000 mg/l) were
   subjected to current densities (CD) ranging from 5 to 50 A/m(2) at five
   electrical exposure modes (time-ON/time-OFF). The results showed that CD
   between 15 and 35 A/m(2) increased the filterability of the sludge more
   than 200 times when compared with the untreated reference sludge. The
   average removals of protein, polysaccharides and organic colloids from
   the sludge supernatant at this range of CD were 43\%, 73\% and 91\%,
   respectively, while the average reduction of the specific resistance to
   filtration (SRF) was 4.8 times higher. The changes of sludge properties
   depended on the current density, electrical exposure mode and the MLSS
   concentration. At CD of 25 A/m(2) and MLSS below 10,000 mg/l, shorter
   time-OFF was needed in each electrical cycle, while more time-OFF was
   needed at higher MLSS concentrations. It was concluded that proper
   application of the DC field could improve biomass in terms of its
   dewaterability and the removal of SMP, which are highly correlated to
   membrane fouling in the submerged membrane electro-bioreactor (SMEBR).

Title = {{A study of matching fluid loss in a biomedical microwave tomography
   system}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Effective imaging of human tissue with microwave tomography
   systems requires a matching fluid to reduce the wave reflections at the
   tissue boundary. Further, in order to match the idealized mathematical
   model used for imaging with the complicated physical measurement
   environment, loss must be added to the matching fluid. Both too little
   and too much loss result in low-quality images, but due to the nonlinear
   nature of the imaging problem, the exact nature of loss-to-image quality
   cannot be predicted a priori. Possible optimal loss levels include a
   single, highly sensitive value, or a broad range of acceptable losses.
   Herein, the authors outline a process of determining an appropriate
   level of loss inside the matching fluid and attempt to determine the
   bounds for which the images are the highest quality.
   Methods: Our biomedical microwave tomography system is designed for 2D
   limb imaging, operating from 0.8 to 1.2 GHz. Our matching fluid consists
   of deionized water with various levels of loss introduced by the
   addition of table salt. Using two homogeneous tissue-mimicking phantoms,
   and eight different matching fluids of varying salt concentrations, the
   authors introduce quantitative image quality metrics based on L-norms,
   mean values, and standard deviations to test the tomography system and
   assess image quality. Images are generated with a balanced
   multiplicative regularized contrast source inversion algorithm. The
   authors further generate images of a human forearm which may be analyzed
   qualitatively.
   Results: The image metrics for the phantoms support the claim that the
   worst images occur at the extremes of high and low salt concentrations.
   Importantly, the image metrics show that there exists a broad range of
   salt concentrations that result in high-quality images, not a single
   optimal value. In particular, 2.5-4.5 g of table salt per liter of
   deionized water provide the best reconstruction quality for simple
   phantoms. The authors argue that qualitatively, the human forearm data
   provide the best images at approximately the same salt concentrations.
   Conclusions: There exists a relatively large-range of matching fluid
   losses (i.e., salt concentrations) that provide similar image quality.
   In particular, it is not necessary to spend time highly optimizing the
   level of loss in the matching fluid. (C) 2013 American Association of

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{A novel multi-phase center parabolic reflector antenna is investigated
   that utilizes a single hardware system to displace the antenna phase
   center location electronically in any direction, while generating
   identical broadside secondary radiation patterns at the far-field region
   to convert the reflector antenna into a virtual array. The primary feed
   is a dual-mode circular waveguide operating at the TE11 and TE21 type
   modes. The combination of these modes with different polarizations,
   amplitude ratios, and phase differences are considered. It is shown that
   the phase center location of the antenna can be displaced from the
   physical center of its geometry by changing the excitation amplitude and
   phase of each mode, and more importantly by employing different mode
   orientations. This results in a virtual array antenna with element
   locations that can be displaced in any direction, depending on the
   polarization of each mode, by a simple signal processing procedure
   without mechanically moving the antenna itself. The antenna developed
   using this technique has potential applications as a transceiver antenna
   in precise positioning systems, radars with moving platforms, and
   virtual smart antennas. The operating frequency is 10 GHz. The proposed
   multi-phase center virtual antenna concept is verified experimentally
   exhibiting excellent agreement with the numerical results.}},

Abstract = {{For a cognitive radio (CR) system, we investigate the estimation problem
   in which a secondary user (SU) estimates the channel parameters such as
   the sojourn times on the active and the inactive states of the primary
   user (PU) as well as the PU signal strength on the basis of the sequence
   of the sensing results. By modeling the CR system as a hidden Markov
   model (HMM), the channel parameters are estimated by the standard
   expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. We focus on mathematically
   analyzing the condition under which the EM algorithm can find the true
   channel parameters. For this, we apply the theory of the equivalence and
   the identifiability to the proposed HMM model for a CR system. Based on
   the identifiability analysis, we propose a parameter estimation
   algorithm for our problem by extending the EM algorithm. The numerical
   results show that the proposed algorithm successfully estimates the true
   channel parameters as long as the condition for finding the channel
   parameters is satisfied.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the use of hybrid simulation combining
   electromagnetic transients (EMT) simulation and transient stability
   (TSA) simulation to model large networks. By comparing with a full
   detailed EMT simulation, the paper shows that the hybrid approach gives
   more accurate results than TSA simulation alone, when power electronic
   equipment is included in the EMT part of the model. The paper also
   considers line switching and faults in the TSA part of the model which
   were ignored in earlier approaches, and shows that the accuracy is a
   function of the electrical distance of the fault to the interface bus
   bars. A new method to improve this accuracy with the use of switchable
   frequency dependent network equivalents (FDNE) is also introduced.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of sub-synchronous
   interactions in a wind integrated power system to understand and
   mitigate them. The proposed procedure has two steps. In the first step,
   a frequency scan is performed to determine the presence of resonant
   frequencies in the sub-synchronous range. In the second step, a detailed
   small signal analysis is performed. Participation factors are used to
   identify the state variables that are involved in the interaction, and
   the controllability indices are used to determine the mitigation method.
   It is shown that the sub-synchronous interaction present in Type 3 wind
   turbine-generators connected to the grid through series compensated
   lines is an electrical resonance between the generator and the series
   compensated line which is highly sensitive to the rotor side converter
   current controller gains.}},

   interface-enriched eXtended Finite Element-Level Set (XFE-LS) method to
   study the solute-induced melting of additive powder particles (APPs)
   during transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding. The robust model captures
   rapidly occurring concurrent interfacial events at multiple propagating
   liquid-solid interfaces to simulate the melting behavior. In contrast to
   the critical assumption in analytical models, numerical calculations
   show that solute-transport into the APPs during the equilibration of the
   liquid composition is a significant factor that affects the APPs melting
   behavior. Also, the study shows that the solute-transport dependence of
   extent of APPs melting is influenced by the kinetics of solid-state
   solute diffusion within the particles. The understanding generated by
   the numerical analysis has resulted in the use of interlayer powder
   mixture that contains base-alloy APPs to produce single crystal TLP
   joint that has matching crystallographic orientations with single
   crystal substrate material, at a substantially reduced processing time,

Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},

Volume = {{50}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate a concept potentially suitable for detecting in-cloud ice
   and indication of ice accretion rate within a laboratory setting. The
   concept measures the change in capacitance and resistance due to ice
   accretion between two charged cylindrical probes. An ice sensor using
   this concept could be located on meteorological towers or nacelle of
   wind turbines for icing measurements. During the controlled icing
   experiments, ice builds up on the cylindrical probes: capacitance
   increases and resistance decreases. Capacitance correlates with the
   mass, thickness and the location of ice deposits: the type of icing
   glaze versus rime correlates well with resistance measurements. A 2-D
   electric field simulation around cylindrical probes demonstrates the
   sensitivity of this ice sensor as a function of the distance between the
   probes and the location of ice deposition around the probes. Capacitance
   measurements using different acrylic annuli machined to high tolerances
   and placed over each probe to simulate ice validates the electric field
   simulation. Experimental tests of the cylindrical probes in an icing
   wind tunnel facility under controlled rime and glaze ice conditions
   validate the concept. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{371-385}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Cooperative packet delivery can improve the data delivery performance in
   wireless networks by exploiting the mobility of the nodes, especially in
   networks with intermittent connectivity, high delay and error rates such
   as wireless mobile delay-tolerant networks (DTNs). For such a network,
   we study the problem of rational coalition formation among mobile nodes
   to cooperatively deliver packets to other mobile nodes in a coalition.
   Such coalitions are formed by mobile nodes which can be either well
   behaved or misbehaving in the sense that the well-behaved nodes always
   help each other for packet delivery, while the misbehaving nodes act
   selfishly and may not help the other nodes. A Bayesian coalitional game
   model is developed to analyze the behavior of mobile nodes in coalition
   formation in presence of this uncertainty of node behavior (i.e., type).
   Given the beliefs about the other mobile nodes' types, each mobile node
   makes a decision to form a coalition, and thus the coalitions in the
   network vary dynamically. A solution concept called Nash-stability is
   considered to find a stable coalitional structure in this coalitional
   game with incomplete information. We present a distributed algorithm and
   a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) model to find the Nash-stable
   coalitional structures. We also consider another solution concept,
   namely, the Bayesian core, which guarantees that no mobile node has an
   incentive to leave the grand coalition. The Bayesian game model is
   extended to a dynamic game model for which we propose a method for each
   mobile node to update its beliefs about other mobile nodes' types when
   the coalitional game is played repeatedly. The performance evaluation
   results show that, for this dynamic Bayesian coalitional game, a
   Nash-stable coalitional structure is obtained in each subgame. Also, the
   actual payoff of each mobile node is close to that when all the
   information is completely known. In addition, the payoffs of the mobile
   nodes will be at least as high as those when they act alone (i.e., the
   mobile nodes do not form coalitions).}},

Abstract = {{A time-dependent subcooled-void model, developed from low-pressure
   generation-condensation data, is applied to flow instability experiments
   conducted with an electrically-heated bundle. The void model,
   implemented in a numerical 1-D transient code, was used to perform a
   stability analysis of the bundle sub-channels. This paper summarizes the
   features of the subcooled-void model and details the application of the
   void model to the bundle experiments. The flow bulk outlet temperature
   at the bundle exit was always subcooled. However, incipient flow
   oscillations were observed at certain power levels and these flow
   oscillations resulted solely from the subcooled void present. Thus,
   realistic modeling of the subcooled void was critical to predicting the
   onset of flow oscillations. Though developed for, and applied to, a low
   pressure situation, the approach may be applicable to higher pressure
   applications. Insights into the sub-channel dynamics are also presented

Abstract = {{This paper describes the application of extended and unscented Kalman
   filters for the identification of uncertainties in a process. The
   extended Kalman filter (EKF) is an optimal linear recursive algorithm
   that offers a solution to the filtering problem. The EKF is based on a
   first-order Taylor expansion to approximate the measurement and process
   models. This approach may cause the estimation process to diverge.
   Consequently, alternatives (e. g., the unscented Kalman filter, UKF)
   based on a fixed number of points to represent a Gaussian distribution
   have been introduced. The EKF and UKF have been applied for the
   identification of uncertainty in the attitude determination process for
   small satellites based on noisy measurements collected from Sun sensors
   and three-axis magnetometers. Simulation results indicate that the EKF
   and UKF perform equally well when small initial errors are present.
   However, when large errors are introduced, the UKF leads to a faster
   convergence and achieves a higher more accurate estimate of the state of
   the system.}},

Abstract = {{DXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) based finite element model is
   able to integrate all mechanical factors affecting hip fracture in
   osteoporosis patients and it is thus, in principle, more reliable than
   areal bone mineral density (BMD) for assessing fracture risk. However,
   short-term repeatability of DXA-based finite element model in predicting
   fracture risk has not yet been investigated and satisfactory
   repeatability is a prerequisite for the procedure to be applied in
   clinic. Therefore, in the reported research, the repeatability of a
   previously developed DXA-based patient-specific finite element procedure
   was investigated. It was found that inconsistence in positioning the
   patient during DXA scanning and manual segmentation of DXA image in
   constructing the finite element model are the two dominant factors
   affecting short-term repeatability of the finite element procedure. The
   study outcome indicated that to apply the finite element procedure in
   clinic, a set of more strict guidelines for positioning the patient in
   DXA scanning must be established and followed.}},

   noise by a proprietary software algorithm. The ear model is constructed
   of gelatin as an alternative to human tissue where independently driven
   electrical sources are placed in gelatin to mimic various biological
   signals (muscle, cerebral, and vestibular). Components of system noise
   (recording apparatus generated noise, electrodes, etc) will be naturally
   superimposed on the recording, hence enables various recording
   conditions to be simulated. Muscle activity present in the recordings
   and noise generated from the recording apparatus were found to be the
   most dominating sources that degrade performance of FP extraction. The
   model can be used to provide insights towards enhancing the FP detection
   algorithm under various signal-to-noise ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent disorder. The accepted
   method of diagnosis in widespread clinical practice, polysomnography
   (PSG), is costly and very time consuming; therefore, quick screening
   methods, especially when there is a need for quick diagnosis, is of
   great interest. Diagnostic methods which exploit subtle differences in
   breath sounds recorded during wakefulness, such as our group's Awake-OSA
   technology, have shown their capability to diagnose OSA at the research
   stage. Simplifying the breath sound recording procedure employed in the
   Awake-OSA diagnostic method would increase its efficiency when used in a
   clinical setting. In this study, we adopted breath sound data collected
   during wakefulness in two positions (sitting upright and supine) and two
   breathing maneuvers (nose and mouth breathing) from our previous study
   {[}10], and ran hypothesis tests on a wide variety of sound features to
   select the most significant features correlated with OSA. The goal was
   to investigate which combinations of patient position and breathing
   maneuver contribute the least to the significant features amongst groups
   of people with differing OSA severity, thus permitting simplification of
   the recording protocol. The results show that all signals recorded by a
   combination of the two breathing maneuvers and two positions result in
   features significantly correlated with OSA severity; this makes it
   impossible to confidently recommend that a combination be omitted from
   the recording protocol. Nevertheless, the results show that the majority
   of significant features originated from recordings made in the supine
   position. Therefore, as a step toward simplification of the Awake-OSA
   diagnostic algorithm, we may use breath sound signals recorded only in
   the supine position and further investigate the accuracy of the
   algorithm in distinguishing amongst groups with differing OSA severity.}},

Abstract = {{Head injury has been a major concern in various sports, especially in
   contact sports such as football and ice hockey. Helmet has been adopted
   as a protective device in such sports, aiming at preventing or at least
   alleviating head injuries. However, there exist two challenges in
   current helmet design and test. One is that the helmet does not fit the
   subject's head well; the other is that current helmet testing methods
   are not able to provide accurate information about intracranial pressure
   and stress/strain level in brain tissues during impact. To meet the
   challenges, an image-based finite element modeling procedure was
   proposed to design subject-specific helmet and to conduct virtual impact
   test. In the procedure, a set of medical images such as computed
   tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the subject's head
   was used to construct geometric shape of the helmet and to develop a
   helmet-head finite element model that can be used in the virtual impact
   test.}},

Abstract = {{Lyapunov Exponents (LEs) measure the exponential rates of divergence or

   presented in this paper investigates the applicability of this concept

   Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE) of the post-fault system subsequent to a
   given fault scenario is independent of the fault clearing time up to the
   Critical Clearing Time (CCT). Furthermore, the set of exponentially
   stable equilibrium points of the post-fault system corresponding to
   different load-generation combinations of the pre-fault system can also
   be characterized by this LLE. The study compares the LEs with the
   conventional Time Domain Simulation (TDS), Extended Equal Area Criterion
   (EEAC) and Potential Energy Boundary Surface (PEBS) methods. It is shown
   that LEs give reliable results. Further, the power system stability
   regions can be determined using the invariance of LEs within the same

   reactions. A physical passive walker was built to validate the proposed
   mathematical model. A traditional impact-based passive walking model was
   also used as a reference to demonstrate the advancement of the proposed
   passive dynamic walking model. The simulated gait of the proposed model
   matched the gait of the physical passive walker exceptionally well, both

Abstract = {{Permutation entropy (PE) is a natural measure of the complexity of a
   dynamic system which boasts robustness to noise and computational
   efficiency. Since its introduction in 2002, PE has served as a valuable
   tool for assessing nonlinear systems such as speech signals and EEG
   signals. In this paper, the suitability of utilizing PE as a new method
   for characterizing walking gait dynamics is explored. Results obtained
   by analyzing the medial-lateral center of pressure migration of
   participants during treadmill walking demonstrate that PE shows good
   preliminary repeatability. PE shows sensitivity to a change in walking
   conditions; walk alone vs. addition of a concurrent cognitive task. A
   highly significant age effect in PE (p<0.001) during dual task walking
   was observed. Analysis revealed no significant age effect on PE for the
   walk alone condition.}},

Abstract = {{Renewable energy is the alternative to commonly used environment
   polluting and declining fossil fuels. Kinetic energy of water currents
   is a highly demanded source of renewable energy and horizontal axis
   hydrokinetic turbines are one amongst the various devices used to
   extract this energy. However, the low power density of the technique is
   an important barrier to its commercialization. While the analytical Betz
   limit for extracting available kinetic power of water streams is 0.59, a
   practical power coefficient of 0.45 looks ideal. Although the Betz limit
   cannot be overcome, a shroud placed around the rotor could increases the
   C-P. This paper presents results of an experimental work done on two
   different shrouds to study how much a horizontal axis hydrokinetic
   turbine gains using shrouds.}},

   Arbitrary Distributions of Electric Current}},
Journal = {{IEEE MAGNETICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{A single-valued magnetic scalar potential is introduced for arbitrary
   distributions of electric current in free space. It is defined as a
   Laplacian potential within a specified region outside the current
   distribution and is determined from the free-space values of the normal
   component of the field intensity over the region boundary. Once this
   scalar potential is obtained, the resultant magnetic field in the
   presence of magnetic material bodies located in the region considered
   can be expressed in terms of only a scalar potential. This yields a
   field analysis method substantially more efficient than existing
   methods, where the field due to the given current distributions is
   usually computed by employing the Biot-Savart formulas and, thus, the
   resultant field outside the magnetic bodies remains expressed in terms
   of vector quantities.}},

   construct antennas. 2 mm tall structures with fine features down to 50
   mu m are achieved. The preliminary results show the existence of new
   modes in modified shapes which can be utilized for future antenna
   applications. Over 90\% optically transparency makes these SU-8 based
   structures highly attractive for transparent antenna applications.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) composition of
   two surface waters in Manitoba, Canada, the Red and Assiniboine Rivers,
   to identify DOC fractions with the greatest potential to form
   trihalomethanes (THMs). The DOC was fractionated into six fractions
   based on hydrophobicity and acid base functionality: hydrophobic acid
   (HPOA), hydrophobic base (HPOB), hydrophobic neutral (HPON), hydrophilic
   acid (HPIA), hydrophilic base (HPIB), and hydrophilic neutral (HPIN).
   The trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) of the isolated fractions
   was measured. Fractions collected from the Red River showed significant
   variation in the specific THMFP, normalized to DOC concentration,
   ranging from 23 to 1,372 mu g THM/mg DOC, while the Assiniboine River
   THMFP ranged from 11 to 575 mu g THM/mg DOC. Although the DOC
   composition of the two rivers was similar, the THMFP for the fractions
   differed significantly. The Red River HPOB and HPIB fractions had the
   highest normalized THMFP of 1,002 mu g THM/mg DOC and 1,372 mu g THM/mg
   DOC, respectively, while the HPOA fraction showed the lowest with 23 mu
   g THM/mg DOC. Comparatively, the HPOA fraction from the Assiniboine
   River was found to have a higher specific THMFP of 478 mu g THM/mg DOC.
   These findings suggest that THM formation is dependent on unique organic
   composition of the local water and that caution should be taken when
   estimating THMFP from DOC fractions isolated from different water
   sources.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its
   fractions by chemical coagulation was studied. Raw water was collected
   from the Red River (Manitoba, Canada). This source water has a DOC
   concentration ranging from 8 to 12 mg L-1 and total hardness of about
   400 mg L-1 CaCO3, which represents a typical surface water quality of
   the Canadian Prairie. Four coagulants were tested at different pH
   levels: alum, ferric sulfate, ferric chloride and titanium sulfate.
   Coagulation effectiveness was evaluated by removal of DOC, DOC
   fractions, specific UV absorbance (SUVA), and trihalomethane formation
   potential (THMFP) of the coagulated water. The water DOC was separated
   into six fractions based on hydrophobicity and acid base functionality:
   hydrophobic acid (HPOA), hydrophobic base (HPOB), hydrophobic neutral
   (HPON), hydrophilic acid (HPIA), hydrophilic base (HPIB), and
   hydrophilic neutral (HPIN). Results showed that ferric sulfate had the
   highest total DOC removal of 66\% while ferric chloride had the lowest
   DOC reduction of 54\%. Although the THMFP was found to be lowered
   significantly with all four coagulants the ferric chloride showed the
   greatest THMFP reduction. Fractionation results found a significant
   reduction in the HPOA fraction for all coagulants with 91\% for ferric
   chloride as the highest removal value. Poor removal of hydrophilic
   fractions was found for all coagulants. The result of this study showed
   that total DOC reduction cannot guarantee THMFP reduction and
   coagulation should be optimized to remove DOC fractions which form most
   THMs.}},

Pages = {{50-58}},
Abstract = {{In 2010 the Transportation Association of Canada began the 2-year
   process of updating the 1998 pedestrian crossing control manual. The
   resulting document, the Pedestrian Crossing Control Guide, is expected
   to promote uniformity across the country with respect to the approach
   used in the provision of pedestrian crossing control. This
   standardization is done through the development of a decision support
   tool to assist in the decision-making process when the need for
   pedestrian crossing control is established and in identification of the
   type of crossing control to use for the location's characteristics. The
   development of the new Pedestrian Crossing Control Guide for Canada is
   discussed, and findings of the research that led to its development are
   presented. The findings fall into two areas: existing Canadian and
   international pedestrian crossing control practices and safety
   performance of different pedestrian crossing control devices. Principal
   conclusions from this research are (a) international practice is
   changing toward providing guidance rather than formal, numerical
   warranting procedures in the decision-making process for the provision
   of pedestrian crossing control; (b) there are pedestrian crossing
   control treatments for which there is no available literature regarding
   safety performance, and the available literature for other treatments
   lacks rigorous safety evaluations; and (c) further research is needed
   regarding the safety performance of pedestrian crossing control devices,
   particularly in the areas of understanding pedestrian collisions and
   developing accident prediction models.}},

Abstract = {{Local coordinate systems are attached to the conducting bodies in motion
   which allows the usage of the eddy-current integral equation to
   determine the electromagnetic field. The space discretization is
   performed only for the conducting bodies and remains unchanged in time.
   An additional term, similar to the ``motional{''} electromotive force in
   Faraday's law, is introduced in the integral equation. If the imposed
   currents are sinusoidal with time, a phasor representation is employed
   for a frequency-domain analysis based on the eddy-current integral
   equation. Since the ``electrical{''} period is much smaller then the
   ``mechanical{''} period of the body vibration, the time average force
   over an ``electrical{''} period is used in the equation of motion. This
   allows for the solution of the equation of motion to be obtained by
   employing a time step which is greater than the ``electrical{''} period.
   Thus, the efficiency of the method presented is much greater than the
   efficiency of the time-domain methods, where the time step is chosen to
   be a small fraction of the ``electrical{''} period. This is more so at
   higher frequencies, which are used for more efficient levitation
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{A focused study on the C-band polarimetric scattering and physical
   characteristics of experimental sea ice was conducted at the Sea-ice

   Radar measurements were sensitive to four distinct stages of
   development: (I) initial formation, (II) surface brine expulsion, (III)
   frost flower growth, and (IV) decimation. An optimal polarization and
   incidence angle was not readily apparent for the purposes of identifying
   the frost flower development stages I-III; however, low incidence angles
   appear to be most sensitive to the surface brine expulsion. Only the
   dual-polarization measurements at low incidence angles could be used to
   identify the onset of the decimation stage (IV). Backscatter increased
   rapidly during the initial formation, with a local maximum corresponding
   to ca. 80\% areal coverage of frost flowers, followed by a local minimum
   when the surface was covered by a brine-rich surface layer, showing that
   surface brine expulsion may be identified using polarimetric
   scatterometry.}},

Title = {{Hybrid Approach for Clustering Vehicle Classification Data to Support
   Regional Implementation of the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design
   Guide}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},

Pages = {{112-119}},
Abstract = {{This paper develops a hybrid approach for analyzing vehicle
   classification data and applies the approach to a fused data set from
   multiple jurisdictions in the Canadian prairie region. Application of
   the approach results in a set of regional default truck traffic
   classification groups for use in the Mechanistic Empirical Pavement
   Design Guide. The hybrid approach is a conglomeration of three
   components: statistical clustering procedures, expert judgment, and
   industry intelligence. By applying the hybrid approach, analysts receive
   the joint benefits of analytical rigor and industry-oriented pragmatism.
   Application of this approach results in eight truck traffic
   classification groups for the Canadian prairie region that exhibit
   distinct differences from the default distributions developed for
   national use in the United States. The benefits of applying the hybrid
   approach on-fused data sets include (a) the statistical strength gained
   from use of additional classification data, (b) the development of truck
   traffic classification groups that better reflect the diversity of
   patterns in a region, and (c) the potential for improved ability to
   capture future shifts in truck traffic characteristics because of
   experience gained in other jurisdictions. The paper also identifies
   limitations to the hybrid approach that should be considered. These
   limitations include varying data quality between jurisdictions, the
   sensitivity of low-volume sites to changes in industry patterns and the
   ability to track these changes, and potential shortages of continuous
   classification sites. When its benefits and limitations are well
   understood, the hybrid approach can be applied to truck traffic data
   analyses in any jurisdiction.}},

Abstract = {{Aggregated vehicular charging load at locations with potentially
   numerous parking events such as major shopping centers can cause
   significant operational issues for the grid. Characterization of parking
   events in such locations can address the forecast of vehicular charging
   load in the upgrading of the grid in preparation of this load. This
   paper presents a statistical analysis of real-world driving data for the
   city of Winnipeg in Canada for parking events in two major commercial
   centers. Three significant parameters affecting vehicular load
   estimation, namely parking time and duration as well as before-mileage,
   are discussed. Comparison of the results of the two places shows some
   level of similarity between the characteristics of their parking events.
   The results are useful in characterization of the charging load and can
   be used in planning and sizing of the charging stations and the extent
   of fortifications that may be needed in the feeding distribution
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{We presents a queuing theoretic approach to model a packet-oriented data
   network which links a set of phasor measurement units (PMU) to a phasor
   data concentrator (PDC) in a wide area monitoring, protection and
   control system (WAMPaCS). The PMU-PDC communication network is
   approximated as a cyclic polling system and the associated Markov chain
   is set up. Based on this model, closed-form expressions are derived for
   important reliability measures such as the packet loss probability and
   the communication delay. We then demonstrate how the proposed model can
   be used to predict the impact of the number of data sources on the
   network, as well as the buffer capacity of the network switches on the
   overall reliability of the communication link. An important property of
   the proposed model is that it's computational complexity is only linear
   in the number of data sources connected, making it suitable for the
   study of large systems.}},

Abstract = {{We question whether a virtual reality (VR) environment produces the same

   to answer the above question, we examined the perceived rotation of an
   object (a building) in both virtual and natural environments on spatial
   ability of 30 young males, while navigating in a virtual environment. We
   calculated the number of errors they made in finding a destination in a
   virtual reality navigational environment. The subjects performed three
   sets of 4 trials of finding a target room in a virtual building with no
   landmarks. At the beginning of each trial the target room was shown to
   the subject by rotation of the building from outside perspective. The
   building rotation was achieved in three conditions: 1) in virtual
   environment, 2) in real environment by rotating an identical but scaled
   physical building, and 3) by walking around the physical model. Each
   subject performed 4 trials of virtual navigation under each of the above
   conditions. In each trial, the traversed distance and the visited rooms
   were recorded by the program. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
   employed to find any statistical difference between the particpants'
   errors in three conditions. Overall, no statistically significant
   differences were found between the error scores in any of the three

Abstract = {{Due to increasing awareness of environmental and economic issues for
   network operators, energy-efficiency has received much attention lately
   and becomes one of the major design goals in wireless networks. Since
   the power consumption of base stations (BS) occupies most energy cost of
   entire cellular networks, in this paper, we propose a novel power saving
   method denoted as clustering BS-off (CBSO) scheme that all the cells are
   cooperated and dynamically adjusted to switch on/off along with space
   and time. Instead of adopting a unified and consistent BS-off scheme all
   over the network, the proposed CBSO schemes adaptively group BSs in
   several clusters based on the user traffic load fluctuations and runs
   novel BS-off matching scheme in order to find the optimal BS on/off
   mechanism in each cluster separately. Experimental results demonstrate
   the effectiveness of both proposed centralized and distributed CBSO
   algorithms in energy saving.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, topology control in machine-to-machine (M2M) networks is
   discussed. A new topology control algorithm, called topology adaption
   algorithm (TAA), is proposed to address the heterogeneous connectivity
   requirements from different classes of device nodes. The proposed
   algorithm uses network flow theory, introduces a fresh insight about how
   to perform topology control for M2M networks, and provides an
   energy-efficient solution with low computational complexity. Simulation
   results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms
   of total network power consumption and success rate.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a game theoretic power allocation and relay load
   balancing scheme for downlink transmission in an OFDMA-based cellular
   relay network is proposed. In the cell, a BS is located at cell center
   communicating with multiple users assisted by multiple relays. The
   relays adopt the decode-and-forward protocol and can cooperatively
   assist the transmission from BS to users. In order to assign the users
   to relays, achieve the load balancing among relays and distribute the
   power of relays among users while considering the total data rate of the
   network, a game theoretic scheme is introduced to solve the problem.
   Simulation results indicate that, the proposed game-based power
   allocation scheme can improve the average sum-spectral efficiency
   approximately 20\% compared to the traditional scheme.}},

Title = {{Issues and Options for Improved Freight Transportation in Costa Rica}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2379}},
Pages = {{72-79}},
Abstract = {{As international trade grows in Central America, it becomes more
   critical to move freight in an effective and efficient manner. Recent
   trade agreements between Central American countries and the rest of the
   world will likely increase the freight moved in the Central American
   region. Additionally, the expansion of the Panama Canal will result in
   increases in freight as larger vessels will be able to travel through
   the canal. To handle this potential freight growth and maintain their
   competitiveness, Central American countries must prepare their
   infrastructure and improve their operations. The road network is
   essential in moving freight to international border crossings and ports
   in Costa Rica; therefore, the reliability of the infrastructure and key
   connecting links are a primary concern for freight transportation. Port
   and border infrastructure and operations are also essential for the
   throughput of freight at the international level. Although international
   free trade agreements have the potential to increase freight, without
   corresponding improvements to the freight transportation system, the
   overall positive impact might be small. This paper investigates the
   issues and options associated with improved freight movement to, from,
   and through Costa Rica. The issues and options are addressed in the
   context of physical, operational, and regulatory constraints to freight
   mobility. The findings from this work raise issues that should be
   considered in the design, development, and implementation of a modern
   and efficient freight transportation infrastructure that can increase
   the economic competitiveness of Costa Rica relative to other countries
   in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by potential applications in wireless sensor networks, we
   consider the problem of communicating a large number of correlated
   analog sources over a Gaussian multiple-access channel using
   non-orthogonal code-division multiple-access (CDMA). We present a joint
   source-channel decoder which exploits the inter-source correlation for
   interference reduction in the CDMA channel. This decoder uses a linear
   minimum mean square error (MMSE) multi-user detector (MUD) in tandem
   with a MMSE joint source decoder for multiple sources to achieve a
   computational complexity that scales with the number of sources.
   However, iterative exchange of extrinsic information between the MUD and
   the joint source decoder leads to improved interference cancellation.
   Experimental results obtained with decoding observations from Gaussian
   random fields show that the proposed iterative decoder can achieve a
   considerable performance gain compared to a non-iterative decoder. The
   results also show that the iterative decoder is robust against the
   performance degradation due to correlated interference in a
   non-orthogonal CDMA channel.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents findings from an exploratory study designed to
   examine the role of a cooperative education term in the integration of
   international engineering graduates (immigrant engineers) into the
   Canadian engineering profession. The participants in this study were all
   enrolled in a university-based qualifications recognition program, of
   which a co-operative education term is one critical component. Data were
   gathered through focus group interviews, which were designed to obtain
   their perceptions of the cooperative education experience and its
   relationship to their career development. Data were interpreted through
   a theoretical framework of cultural categories and social and cultural
   capital, with the aim of discerning enabling and disabling aspects of a
   cooperative education experience to immigrant professionals' career
   development. Data reveal that the most profound obstacles concerned
   participants' expectations and competencies in the cultural norms and
   interactional styles that are unique to the North American professional
   workplace. The implementation of a professional practice component in
   the academic portion of the university-based program (prior to
   cooperative education placement) helped students to develop a heightened
   awareness of cultural differences in the workplace. The coop term built
   on this preparation and equipped them with opportunities to recognize
   and develop social and cultural capital in the Canadian context,
   relative to the cultivation of professional skills (soft skills) and
   exposure to mentoring and networking opportunities. Implications are
   drawn regarding the integration of immigrant professionals and the
   relationship of findings to other under-represented groups.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports the results of experiments conducted on the
   National Instruments Compact-RIO (cRIO) data acquisition equipment (DAQ)
   aimed at characterizing the contributions to strain measurements
   originating from the DAQ instrument, separate from those of the strain
   gauges and ultimately the structure being monitored. In most laboratory
   based measurement situations, the DAQ is at a fixed environmental
   temperature, and thus does not contribute to the measured strain. In SHM
   applications, however, this is not necessarily the case. To better
   understand the relationship between temperature and instrument induced
   strain, a series of environmental chamber tests were conducted. These
   tests measured strain from twelve metal-foil strain gauges bonded to an
   unloaded steel beam which was subjected to temperature variations in the
   range of -20 degrees C to +20 degrees C. Three separate test cases were
   explored. One with the cRIO at room temperature while a test beam and
   gauges were subjected to temperature variations. A second with the test
   beam at room temperature and the cRIO undergoing temperature variations.
   And a third with both the cRIO and test beam in the same variable
   temperature environment.
   These experiments clearly show that a significant contribution to
   apparent strain comes directly from the DAQ instrument itself. Strains
   reported by the cRIO when only the temperature of the test beam was
   changing indicate a difference of as much as 30 mu epsilon when compared
   to the case where the instrument and beam were both at the same
   temperature. Furthermore, the extent of the variation is different from
   input channel to input channel, and must therefore be characterized for
   each channel separately. Strains measured by the cRIO when only the
   instrument itself was undergoing a temperature change showed an
   approximately linear relationship.}},

Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{159-176}},
Abstract = {{The problem considered in this paper is how to describe and compare
   visual objects. The solution to this problem stems from a consideration
   of nearness relations in two different forms of Efremovic proximity
   spaces. In this paper, the visual objects are picture elements in
   digital images. In particular, this problem is solved in terms of the
   application of rough sets in proximity spaces. The basic approach is to
   consider the nearness of the upper and lower approximation of a set
   introduced by Z. Pawlak during the early 1980s as a foundation for rough
   sets. Two forms of nearness relations are considered, namely, a spatial
   EF- and a descriptive EF-relation. This leads to a study of the nearness
   of objects either spatially or descriptively in the approximation of a
   set. The nearness approximation space model developed in 2007 is refined
   and extended in this paper, leading to new forms of nearness
   approximation spaces. There is a natural transition from the two forms
   of nearness relations introduced in this article to the study of
   nearness granules.}},

Title = {{Recent extreme light sea ice years in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago:
   2011 and 2012 eclipse 1998 and 2007}},

Abstract = {{Remarkably low mean September sea ice area in the Canadian Arctic
   Archipelago (CAA) was observed in 2011 (146 x 10(3) km(2)), a
   record-breaking level that was nearly exceeded in 2012 (150 x 10(3)
   km(2)). These values were lower than previous September records set in
   1998 (200 x 10(3) km(2)) and 2007 (220 x 10(3) km(2)), and are similar
   to 60\% lower than the 1981-2010 mean September climatology. In this
   study, the processes contributing to the extreme light years of 2011 and
   2012 were investigated, compared to previous extreme minima of 1998 and
   2007, and contrasted against historic summer seasons with above average
   September ice area. The 2011 minimum was associated with positive June
   through September (JJAS) surface air temperature (SAT) and net solar
   radiation (K{*}) anomalies that facilitated rapid melt, coupled with
   atmospheric circulation that restricted multi-year ice (MYI) inflow from
   the Arctic Ocean into the CAA. The 2012 minimum was also associated with
   positive JJAS SAT and K{*} anomalies with coincident rapid melt, but
   further ice decline was temporarily mitigated by atmospheric circulation
   which drove Arctic Ocean MYI inflow into the CAA. Atmospheric
   circulation was comparable between 2011 and 1998 (impeding Arctic Ocean
   MYI inflow) and 2012 and 2007 (inducing Arctic Ocean MYI inflow).
   However, preconditioning was more apparent leading up to 2011 and 2012
   than 1998 and 2007. The rapid melt process in 2011 and 2012 was more
   intense than observed in 1998 and 2007 because of the thinner ice cover
   being more susceptible to anomalous thermodynamic forcing. The thinner
   sea ice cover within the CAA in recent years has also helped counteract
   the processes that facilitate extreme heavy ice years. The recent
   extreme light years within the CAA are associated with a longer
   navigation season within the Northwest Passage.}},

   where, instead of having a single solid conductor, multiple laminated
   conductors are used to form the composite conductor. The laminating
   thickness is smaller or of the order of the skin depth of the conductor.
   First, it is shown analytically that in this engineered material, the
   power lost in the material is less compared to the case with a single
   conducting layer. It is confirmed by simulating a microstrip line with
   laminating dielectric layers. The method is applied to a miniaturized

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the impact of channels that have a bursty
   nature in a cognitive radio network scenario. Our goal is to design a
   general statistical model that can handle bursty primary user (PU)
   channel usage. The proposed model describes idle periods with a discrete
   platoon arrival process (PAP) and describes busy periods with a discrete
   phase type (PH) distribution. This channel model is referred to as a
   PAP-PH process. We further introduce a proactive access scheme as the
   potential application of the proposed channel model and use it to
   compare the performance of the proposed model, in terms of spectrum
   utilization and interference probability, with two traditionally
   encountered channel usage models, i.e., the geometrically distributed
   idle-busy period model and the phase type distributed idle-busy period
   model, under both bursty and non-bursty channel scenarios. Numerical
   results show that with the proposed model, the proactive access scheme
   can guarantee the interference threshold to the PU and can be used for
   both bursty and non-bursty spectrum use patterns.}},

Abstract = {{A wireless passive pH sensor for continuous remote bioprocess monitoring
   is presented. The sensor is small enough to fit inside a small
   bioreactor or test tube. It consists of a planar spiral inductor

   combination electrode made of an iridium/iridium oxide sensing electrode
   and a silver/silver chloride reference electrode, is connected in
   parallel to the varactor. As the medium pH changes, the voltage across
   the electrodes varies, shifting the resonant frequency of the sensor.
   For in-fluid monitoring the sensor is hermetically sealed to
   encapsulate, and reduce parasitic capacitive coupling and eddy current
   loss. The resonant frequency of the sensor is tracked remotely by an
   interrogator inductor inductively coupled to the sensor. The
   sterilizable sensor was used for remote pH monitoring of Yarrowia
   lipolytica fermentation in a shake flask over 67 hours. Experiment shows

   sorted by going through the entire recorded signals, which is very
   time-consuming. In the semi-automated method of collection, events are

Abstract = {{This paper presents a software system that generates a database for
   power system dynamic security assessment. The generated database is
   intended to be used in machine learning techniques.
   The development of algorithms to generate data is a very time consuming
   task. This software tool is aimed at facilitating faster generation of
   the appropriate database. Further, the system allows the user to plug-in
   the case specific limit checks and algorithms for system specific
   corrective actions depending on the type of study.
   The proposed system automates the Power System Simulator for Engineering
   (PSSE) which is an industry standard software used in many electrical
   power utilities. The proposed software system, ML4DSA, is based on
   Python which is available in the public domain with plenty of supporting
   communities and powerful libraries. These features enable the user to
   develop algorithms for system specific corrective actions. The web
   interface facilitates access to the authenticated users of PSSE over the
   web, therefore, requires no additional software installed on the client
   computer.
   ML4DSA is successfully tested on the 39 Bus New England test system and
   the Midwest Reliability Organization (MRO) system which has over 50,000
   buses.}},

Abstract = {{The design of attitude determination and control of nanosatellites
   requires innovative solutions that are low-cost, small in size, and
   minimized power consumption. The University of Manitoba T-Sat1 project
   has created a simple complement of sensors and actuators that can
   provide stable determination and orientation. The linear region of
   photodiode readings was combined with magnetometer readings in a
   sensor-fusion attitude determination algorithm. The actuators were
   custom-built torque discs on printed circuit boards that proved easy to
   mount and generate fields 25 nT that are sufficient to orient the
   satellite while in orbit. The torque disc manufacturing process is
   described with details on the imperfections and lessons learned from the
   prototypes. This paper describes the hardware and software design and
   implementation for the attitude determination and control of the T-Sat1
   nanosatellite.}},

Abstract = {{The extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm has been applied widely in
   orbital guidance and navigations problems for mini-and micro-satellites.
   This paper evaluates the performance and computational complexity of EKF
   for smaller satellites. The impact of some limitations, including low
   power and computing capabilities on the implementation of EKF in smaller
   satellites is also addressed. The filter formulation is based on a
   kinematics model propagated with three-axis rate integrating gyros,
   where the attitude is parameterized using quaternions. A multiplicative
   quaternion-error approach is used to define the attitude error, which
   ensures that quaternion normalization is maintained. The results
   indicate that the EKF is sensitive to initial conditions. Using TRIAD
   algorithm to determine initial conditions, the filter converges after 50
   minutes with an average error of 1.5 degrees, but may diverge for
   extreme cases. The time and space complexities of EKF have also been
   estimated to be O(n(3)) and O(n(2)), respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A discrete-time GI/G/1 retrial queue with Bernoulli retrials and
   time-controlled vacation policies is investigated in this paper. By
   representing the inter-arrival, service and vacation times using a
   Markov-based approach, we are able to analyze this model as a
   level-dependent quasi-birth-and-death (LDQBD) process which makes the
   model algorithmically tractable. Several performance measures such as
   the stationary probability distribution and the expected number of
   customers in the orbit have been discussed with two different policies:
   deterministic time-controlled system and random time-controlled system.
   To give a comparison with the known vacation policy in the literature,
   we present the exhaustive vacation policy as a contrast between these
   policies under the early arrival system (EAS) and the late arrival
   system with delayed access (LAS-DA). Significant difference between EAS
   and LAS-DA is illustrated by some numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{Aging is associated with decreasing memory (Luo, 2008). At any age,
   however, it is possible to sharpen and strengthen memory (Kesler et al.,
   2011). The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of brain
   exercises on associative memory in elderly individuals with no apparent
   sign of impaired cognition. We hypothesize that frequent and regular
   exercise of associative memory improves mental state. To test our
   hypothesis, two associative memory exercises targeting the connection
   between the left and right brain hemispheres were designed and applied
   on 9 elderly between 70 to 90 years of age, during 8 consecutive weeks,
   with 3 exercise sessions/week. All participants' memory and mental
   condition were assessed using the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS III)
   questionnaire and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA). These two
   assessments were conducted at the beginning and the end of the exercise
   regime, and again one month afterwards. The results show that, on
   average, exercising participants' memory and mental states improved
   significantly over the eight weeks of trials. The results are
   encouraging; they suggest that the designed memory exercises could be
   used as a tool to improve the cognitive state of the older population.
   Hence, engaging in the proposed memory exercises regularly may delay the
   onset of dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairment. (C) 2013 The Authors.

   Continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC) is developed, and the system
   performance is evaluated in terms of throughput, blocking probability,

Abstract = {{This study developed local mechanistic empirical failure models to

   model predictions were compared with the damage models of the Asphalt
   Institute (AI) and the Mechanistic Empirical Design Guide (MEPDG). The
   results indicated that the predicted equivalent single-axle load
   repetitions to fatigue failure from the local model were higher than
   those of the MEPDG and the AI models by an average of 37\% and 20\%,
   respectively. On the basis of the local model equivalent single-axle
   load predictions, the current SWR deflection limits used in Manitoba

Abstract = {{This paper describes performance evaluation of a teleoperated platform
   which allows operators to remotely perform live-line maintenance.
   Effectiveness of the system is validated when several maintenance tasks
   are performed by novice (students) and experienced (linemen) operators.
   The system comprises a PHANToM Desktop haptic device controlling a
   Kodiak hydraulic manipulator. Validations are performed under two modes,
   when the operators are asked to guide the slave manipulator by moving
   the haptic device implement. In the first mode, the force capability of
   the haptic device is not utilized. In the second mode, the haptic device
   is used to create a forbidden region virtual fixture that helps the
   operator stay on the desired path. In the second mode, the task
   completion time reduces as compared to the mode in which no force is
   generated by the haptic. The concept of virtual fixture also results in
   a smooth motion at the slave manipulator end-effector, and reduces the
   mental load on both expert and novice operators. Furthermore, the system
   familiarizes the participants with new techniques used in live-line
   maintenance in a controlled experimental setting.}},

Abstract = {{The development of effective hemp decortication methods has been
   considered as an emerging need by the bio-composites and other fiber
   industries. In this study, the drop weight method was used for hemp
   decortication. Tests were conducted using a laboratory-scale impactor
   (consisting of a hammer and a mold). In the tests, a 40-g sample of hemp
   stalk was placed in the mold where it was subjected to various impact
   intensities from different numbers of hammer drops. These different
   impact intensities corresponded to different energy inputs onto the
   given mass of hemp sample. The energy inputs were expressed as specific
   energy levels and they were 4.5, 9.1, 13.6, 18.2, 22.7, and 27.2 MJ
   Mg-1. Two types of hemp sample, named as hemp A (unretted hemp) and hemp
   B (retted hemp), were used in the tests. Two different sieving scenarios
   (without-sieving and with-sieving between hammer drops) were also
   applied in the tests. The results showed that using higher specific
   energy to impact hemp stalk, higher fiber yield, and fiber detaching
   efficiency could be achieved. Sieving the chaff (particles smaller than
   20 mm) out between hammer drops could further improve the fiber yield
   and detaching efficiency. The best performance of the drop weight method
   was observed for the treatment of the hemp B with sieving at the highest
   specific energy level. This treatment gave a fiber yield of 24\% and a
   detaching efficiency of 0.89.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces descriptive set patterns that originated from our
   visits with Zdzislaw Pawlak and Andrzej Skowron at Banacha and environs
   in Warsaw. This paper also celebrates the generosity and caring manner
   of Andrzej Skowron, who made our visits to Warsaw memorable events. The
   inspiration for the recent discovery of descriptive set patterns can be
   traced back to our meetings at Banacha. Descriptive set patterns are
   collections of near sets that arise rather naturally in the context of
   an extension of Solomon Leader's uniform topology, which serves as a
   base topology for compact Hausdorff spaces that are proximity spaces.
   The particular form of proximity space (called EF-proximity) reported
   here is an extension of the proximity space introduced by V. Efremovic
   during the first half of the 1930s. Proximally continuous functions
   introduced by Yu. V. Smirnov in 1952 lead to pattern generation of
   comparable set patterns. Set patterns themselves were first considered
   by T. Pavlidis in 1968 and led to U. Grenander's introduction of pattern
   generators during the 1990s. This article considers descriptive set
   patterns in EF-proximity spaces and their application in digital image
   classification. Images belong to the same class, provided each image in
   the class contains set patterns that resemble each other. Image
   classification then reduces to determining if a set pattern in a test
   image is near a set pattern in a query image.}},

   admissible covers of nonempty sets and the problem of quantifying the

   well descriptive intersection and union provides a foundation for the
   study of descriptive admissible covers. Descriptively near sets in
   admissible covers contain sequences of points with members having
   similar descriptions. The motivation for this approach stems from the
   need to consider fine-grained neighbourhoods of points in admissible
   covers that facilitate highly accurate measures of nearness of tiny
   parts of sets of objects of interest. A practical application of local
   admissible covers is given in terms of micropalaeontology and the
   detection of minute similarities and differences in microfossils, useful

   switch on/off status. The reversible pH sensitivity resulted in
   nanoparticles with enhanced functionality through controllable release
   of the anticancer drug. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and
   three dimensional (3D) image capture of the intracellular localization
   of nanoparticles revealed the fast and efficient drug delivery in the
   human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. The results highlight the
   potential of these pH sensitive silica nanoparticles as a novel system
   for the delivery and controlled release of hydrophobic anti-cancer drugs
   in the treatment of solid tumors.}},

Abstract = {{Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging has been widely employed in
   assessing cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerosis is one of the major
   cause cardio vascular diseases. However visual detection of
   atherosclerotic plaque from OCT images is often limited and further
   complicated by high frame rates. We developed a texture based
   segmentation method to automatically detect plaque and non plaque
   regions from OCT images. To verify our results we compared them to
   photographs of the vascular tissue with atherosclerotic plaque that we
   used to generate the OCT images. Our results show a close match with
   photographs of vascular tissue with atherosclerotic plaque. Our texture
   based segmentation method for plaque detection could be potentially used
   in clinical cardiovascular OCT imaging for plaque detection.}},

Abstract = {{For more than three decades, stochastic geometry has been used to model
   large-scale ad hoc wireless networks, and it has succeeded to develop
   tractable models to characterize and better understand the performance
   of these networks. Recently, stochastic geometry models have been shown
   to provide tractable yet accurate performance bounds for multi-tier and
   cognitive cellular wireless networks. Given the need for interference
   characterization in multi-tier cellular networks, stochastic geometry
   models provide high potential to simplify their modeling and provide
   insights into their design. Hence, a new research area dealing with the
   modeling and analysis of multi-tier and cognitive cellular wireless
   networks is increasingly attracting the attention of the research
   community. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey on the
   literature related to stochastic geometry models for single-tier as well
   as multi-tier and cognitive cellular wireless networks. A taxonomy based
   on the target network model, the point process used, and the performance
   evaluation technique is also presented. To conclude, we discuss the open
   research challenges and future research directions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a scenario in which two users communicate via
   a single access point with two buffers using network coding. We focus on
   the particular situation when there are no packets in one of the buffers
   for network coding to proceed. In this case, there is a trade-off
   between the delay due to waiting for a coding opportunity and the
   increased efficiency of spectrum access due to network coding. In order
   to analyze this situation, we develop an analytical model for the system
   using a discrete time Markov chain (DTMC). The packet arrivals for any
   general arrival distribution are modeled as a discrete time Markovian
   arrival process (DMAP). We then find the age distribution of the waiting
   packets and hence determine the waiting-time which achieves the optimal
   trades-off between spectrum access efficiency and packet delay.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) and standard finite
   element procedure is adopted to locally detect and characterize an outer
   surface breaking, axisymmetric notch in an otherwise infinitely long
   steel pipe. Numerical simulations demonstrate that interactions between
   incident, dispersive ultrasonic guided waves and the notch change a
   radial displacement's temporal history and introduce singularities in
   the previously unblemished pipe's Frequency Response Function (FRF). The
   new singularities indicate the presence of a nearby notch. Furthermore,
   the frequency differences between the singularities of the unblemished
   and blemished pipes are shown to reflect the axisymmetric notch's
   dimensions. The conceptually straightforward but computationally
   expensive extension to nonaxisymmetric notches is also suggested.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces sufficiently near visual neighbourhoods of points
   and neighbourhoods of sets in digital image flow graphs (NDIFGs). An
   NDIFG is an extension of a Pawlak flow graph. The study of sufficiently
   near neighbourhoods in NDIFGs stems from recent work on near sets and
   topological spaces via near and far, especially in terms of visual
   neighbourhoods of points that are sufficiently near each other. From a
   topological perspective, non-spatially near sets represent an extension
   of proximity space theory and the original insight concerning spatially
   near sets by F. Riesz at the International Congress of Mathematicians
   (ICM) in 1908. In the context of Herrlich nearness, sufficiently near
   neighbourhoods of sets in NDIFGs provide a new perspective on
   topological structures in NDIFGs. The practical implications of this
   work are significant. With the advent of a study of the nearness of open
   as well as closed neighbourhods of points and of sets in NDIFGs, it is
   now possible to do information mining on a more global level and achieve
   new insights concerning the visual information embodied in the images
   that provide input to an NDIFG.}},

Title = {{The effect of the pool and riffle on dissolved, non-conservative mass
   transport in rivers}},
Journal = {{WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{232-242}},
Abstract = {{One-dimensional substance transport models assume that the river reach
   modelled has a uniform cross-sectional shape which manifests as a
   constant average velocity in the model equations. Rarely do rivers meet
   this criterion. Their channels are seldom uniform in shape but rather
   alternate in a quasi-periodic manner between pool and riffle sections.
   This bedform sequencing imparts a corresponding variation in the average
   cross-sectional velocity which is not accounted for in constant velocity
   transport models. The literature points out that the pool and riffle
   planform may be the reason for the sometimes poor predictions obtained
   from these models. This paper presents a new variable velocity transport
   model and confirms that the fluctuation in average cross-sectional
   velocity caused by the pool and riffle planform does have a marked
   effect on transport in rivers. The pool and riffle planform promotes an
   enhanced decay of a substance when a first-order biochemical reaction is
   simulated with the new transport equation. Investigation of the
   analytical solution shows that the enhanced decay is the result of the
   overall lower velocity experienced in a pool and riffle channel as
   opposed to a uniform channel. This difference in transport velocity
   between a pool and riffle channel and a uniform channel becomes more
   pronounced as flow declines a critical finding for total maximum daily
   load calculations because these regulatory limits are usually determined
   for low flow levels by models that do not account for this phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a framework for power allocation is presented for
   downlink transmissions in an OFDMA-based cellular relay network. We
   consider a system with a single base station communicating with multiple
   users assisted by multiple relays. The relays have limited power which
   must be divided among the users they support in order to maximize the
   data rate of the whole network. By finding the optimal power requirement
   of each user, and based on knapsack problem the optimal power allocation
   which maximizes the data rate is proposed as an upper bound. Another
   power allocation scheme, weighted-based scheme, is proposed considering
   the fairness issue. Finally, to utilize the power wisely and improve the
   data rate of the network, an efficient power reallocation scheme is
   proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
   schemes.}},

   number channel flow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{121-146}},
Abstract = {{A high-resolution particle image velocimetry was used to characterize a
   low Reynolds number turbulent flow in a channel. Experiments were
   conducted over a sand grain-coated surface of large relative roughness,
   and the results were compared with measurements over a smooth surface.
   The roughness perturbation significantly modified the outer layer. Even
   though the streamwise Reynolds stress shows less sensitivity in the
   outer layer to the boundary condition, significant enhancements were
   observed in the wall-normal Reynolds stress and the Reynolds shear
   stress. These modifications were considered as footprints of the
   larger-scale eddies transporting intense wall-normal motions away from
   the rough wall. A quadrant decomposition shows that strong and more
   frequent ejections are responsible for the larger values of the mean
   Reynolds shear stress over the rough wall. The results also indicate
   that spanwise vortex cores with mean vorticity of the same sign as the
   mean shear are the dominant smaller-scale vortical structures over the
   smooth and rough walls. A linear stochastic estimation-based analysis
   shows that the average larger-scale structure associated with these
   vortices is a shear layer that strongly connects the outer layer flow to
   the near-wall flow. A proper orthogonal decomposition of the flow
   suggests that the large-scale eddy is more energetic for the rough wall,
   and contributes more significantly to the resolved turbulent kinetic
   energy and the Reynolds shear stress than the smooth wall.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of a bench-scale system for removal and recovery of
   phosphorus (P) as struvite from CO2-rich wastewater was tested. A
   continuous 12 L reactor system combining a fluidized seedbed and
   aeration for pH increase was developed and tested using synthetic feed.
   For a 100 mL min(-1) influent rate, an aeration and recycle rate
   combination of 7 L min(-1) and 700 mL min(-1) was sufficient for
   increasing and maintaining the reactor pH from 6.7 to between 7.6 and
   8.0. Significant P removal was achieved in 6 h runs without a seedbed
   (91-92\%), while neither the struvite nor sand seedbeds improved P
   removal (91-96\%). Struvite was recovered in all runs, with additional
   calcium (Ca) precipitation in the seedbed runs. Reactor operation was
   possible for an extended period of time, up to 46 h without any major
   adjustment during long-term run. The average P removal was 88\%, and
   precipitate collected after 24 h was found to be mainly struvite, while
   the final precipitate had a Ca: total phosphorus molar ratio of 0.56 and
   also contained calcite. This study has demonstrated the technical
   feasibility of an aerated crystallization reactor system for
   chemical-free struvite removal and recovery from CO2-rich wastewater

Abstract = {{Mung bean (Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek) is one of the major pulse
   crops grown in India. Cowpea weevil (Callosobruchus maculates F.) is the
   major insect that causes qualitative and quantitative losses of mung
   bean kernels during storage. There is an increasing demand from grain
   buyers and consumers toward zero-tolerance to contamination by insects
   in grains and grain products. Uninfested mung bean kernels and kernels
   infested with different stages of C. maculatus were imaged using a
   near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging system within the wavelength
   region of 1000-1600 nm at 10 nm intervals. The wavelengths corresponding
   to the highest principal components (PC) factor loadings (1100, 1290 and
   1450 nm) were considered to be significant. Six statistical features
   (maximum, minimum, mean, median, standard deviation, and variance) and
   ten histogram features from images at the significant wavelengths were
   extracted and given as input to non-parametric statistical classifiers.
   Average classification accuracies of more than 85\% and 82\% were
   obtained using statistical classifiers for identifying uninfested and
   infested mung bean kernels, respectively. Mung beans kernels with pupal
   and adult stages of infestation had higher classification accuracies
   than the egg and larval stages of infestation using both the
   classifiers. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The Barnes-Hut algorithm utilizing hierarchical center-of-radiation
   approximation is applied for acceleration of quasi-static interactions
   in RWG Moment Method discretization of the electric field integral
   equation. As the method uses imbalanced oct-tree in hierarchical
   partitioning of the model, it maintains efficiency in memory and CPU
   usage when geometry of about a wavelength in size presents multiscale
   features. Because the center-of-radiation position in each box of
   hierarchically partitioned space is dependent on the direction to the
   observation point, the field evaluation in the Barnes-Hut algorithm is
   done via an interpolation scheme. Augmentation of the Barnes-Hut
   algorithm with local interpolation schemes is demonstrated. Impact on
   the error control mechanisms via angular interpolation and source
   clustering distance on the efficiency of the algorithm is studied.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the joint resource allocation and admission control problem
   for Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)-based
   femtocell networks. We assume that Macrocell User Equipments (MUEs) can
   establish connections with Femtocell Base Stations (FBSs) to mitigate
   the excessive cross-tier interference and achieve better throughput. A
   cross-layer design model is considered where multiband opportunistic
   scheduling at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer and admission
   control at the network layer working at different time-scales are
   assumed. We assume that both MUEs and Femtocell User Equipments (FUEs)
   have minimum average rate constraints, which depend on their
   geographical locations and their application requirements. In addition,
   blocking probability constraints are imposed on each FUE so that the
   connections from MUEs only result in controllable performance
   degradation for FUEs. We present an optimal design for the admission
   control problem by using the theory of Semi-Markov Decision Process
   (SMDP). Moreover, we devise a novel distributed femtocell power
   adaptation algorithm, which converges to the Nash equilibrium of a
   corresponding power adaptation game. This power adaptation algorithm
   reduces energy consumption for femtocells while still maintaining
   individual cell throughput by adapting the FBS power to the traffic load
   in the network. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate
   the desirable operation of the optimal admission control solution, the
   significant performance gain of the proposed hybrid access strategy with
   respect to the closed access counterpart, and the great power saving
   gain achieved by the proposed power adaptation algorithm.}},

Title = {{Hemicellulose polysaccharide recovery from flax shive using alkaline
   solutions with sodium ethoxide pretreatment}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{165-170}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Flax shive is a by-product of decortication of flax straw for fibre
   recovery, and consists of ligno-cellulosic xylem tissue. It is available
   in large quantities at low cost, and shows promise as a biorefining
   feedstock for recovery of multiple products. The objectives of this work
   were to investigate hemicellulose polysaccharide extractions from flax
   shive using alkaline reagents at mild conditions, and to determine
   impacts of pretreatment using sodium ethoxide in anhydrous ethanol.
   Sodium ethoxide is similar to the catalyst for industrial biodiesel, and
   had been shown previously to recover phenolic constituents from flax
   shive. In this work, carbohydrates extracted from flax shive were
   evaluated quantitatively, in terms of recovered precipitate mass, and
   qualitatively, in terms of backbone monomer composition. Extracts
   obtained using 1.0 M sodium hydroxide, alone or following pretreatment,
   showed no difference in mass yield, with mean recovery of 99.4 +/- 5.1
   mg/g on a dry basis. In terms of composition, extracts obtained using
   1.0 M sodium hydroxide, alone or following pretreatment, showed no
   detectable mannose and no difference in molar concentration ratio of
   xylose-to-glucose, with mean ratio of 25.5 +/- 3.4. Results inferred
   that no glucomannan polymer was extracted, and that glucuronoxylan
   polymer was present at high concentration, greater than 90\% of the
   product stream. Tests using saturated barium hydroxide showed poor mass
   yield, with possible inhibitory effects in mixed solutions. The use of
   saturated barium hydroxide or elevated sodium hydroxide resulted in
   lower glucuronoxylan concentration. Flax shive showed good potential for
   carbohydrate extraction, and the technical feasibility of recovering
   multiple products was demonstrated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   conditions}},
Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{213-223}},

Abstract = {{Sixteen combinations of seven growth nutrients, namely a-cellulose,
   yeast extract (YE), urea, CaCl2 center dot 2H(2)O, MgCl2 center dot
   6H(2)O, FeSO4 center dot 6H(2)O and vitamins, were studied to improve
   direct cellulose fermentation by Clostridium thermocellum DSM 1237 under
   carbon-excess conditions. Varied nutrient compositions improved
   cellulose fermentation conditions for C. thermocellum and displayed two
   major types of effects: a general growth enhancement effect and a
   carbon-flux shifting effect. Different concentrations of the four most
   influential nutrients (YE, alpha-cellulose, CaCl2 and MgCl2) resulted in
   enhanced yields of ethanol or H-2. High ethanol yields, high ethanol to
   acetate (E/A) ratios, and low acetate and H-2 yields were obtained when
   YE, alpha-cellulose and CaCl2 were present at high concentrations, in
   combination with low concentrations of magnesium. Vitamins were
   identified as a relatively less influential nutrient, but high
   concentrations of vitamins supported enhanced yields of acetate and H-2.
   High urea and YE in combination with low MgCl2 concentrations enhanced
   cellulose utilization per unit mass of cells and cell-specific yields of
   both ethanol and H-2. Volumetric yields for ethanol and H-2 were
   improved by 2.3-fold (76.5 mM) and 2.04-fold (71.22 mmol per liter),
   respectively, compared with the basic combination. The highest hydrogen
   yield (1.64 mol/mol glucose) was obtained in the combination with the
   lowest ethanol yields while the lowest hydrogen yielding combination had
   the highest ethanol yield of 1.36 mol/mole glucose, representing 68\% of
   the theoretical maximum for ethanol. The culture conditions determined
   by this study can be optimized further for enhanced production of either
   ethanol or H-2 by direct cellulose fermentation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Performance measures and input uncertainty for pedestrian crossing
   exposure estimates}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{490-498}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Pedestrian safety performance measures often use estimates of annual
   crossing exposure as inputs but relatively little information exists on
   the uncertainty associated with these inputs. This research considers
   two sources of temporal information for expanding short-term counts: (1)
   a composite of pedestrian counts from other cities. and (2) local
   vehicle counts. A database of pedestrian flows from video review
   covering 12 months and including over 350,000 pedestrian observations
   provides a known reference annual volume and a set of short-term counts
   for expansion and testing.
   The research compares the temporal information sources with observed
   pedestrian volumes by analyzing the times and magnitudes of volume
   peaks. The temporal patterns based on local vehicle counts match
   observed pedestrian patterns more closely than the external composite
   pedestrian patterns.
   To quantify exposure estimate uncertainty, the research uses the local
   vehicle and external composite pedestrian patterns to expand a sample of
   short term counts to generate a set of 200 annual estimates, and then
   compares the estimates to the known reference volume. Exposure estimates
   developed by expanding counts with local vehicle factors have the lowest
   errors (mean: -2\%; median: -3\%, standard deviation: 33\%; 90 percent
   of errors between -53\% and 50\%). Exposure estimates based on external
   composite pedestrian patterns have higher errors (mean: 27\%; median:
   9\%; standard deviation: 73\%; 90 percent of errors between -62\% and
   170\%). If methods to obtain pedestrian exposure estimates based on
   short-term counts are improved, more confidence can be placed in safety
   performance measures that use these estimates as inputs. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{One of the routes for thick, multi-year sea ice (MYI) exiting the Arctic
   Ocean is through the Queen Elizabeth Islands (QEI) in the Canadian
   Arctic. Quantifying the volume of MYI that passes through the QEI and
   the associated transit times is important for assessing changes in
   Arctic-wide MYI amount. It is also important because MYI eventually
   invades the Northwest Passage and affects Arctic shipping. One of the
   main gateways through which Arctic sea ice enters the QEI is the Prince
   Gustaf Adolf Sea. In this study, sea-ice influx events into the Prince
   Gustaf Adolf Sea during the 2010 mobile-ice season were investigated.
   Sea-ice motion was derived from RADARSAT imagery using the Canadian Ice
   Service-Automated Sea Ice Tracking System (CIS-ASITS) and validated
   using data from two CIS satellite-tracked beacons. Ice motion results
   indicate that major ice influxes through the Prince Gustaf Adolf Sea
   occur as a series of wind-driven pulses and that ice drift rates are
   approximately 1-2\% of the wind speed. During intervals of southward ice
   drift in 2010, the drift speed along the eastern side of the Prince
   Gustaf Adolf Sea was up to twice as fast as that along the western side.
   This east-west gradient may reflect a pattern of ocean circulation in
   the Prince Gustaf Adolf Sea that has not yet been delineated.}},

Abstract = {{Classification of cereal grains, namely; barley, oat, rye and wheat
   (Canada Western Amber Durum (CWAD) and Canada Western Red Spring (CWRS))
   was performed using morphological and color features. Grain image
   boundary contours were extracted from the digital images of kernels,
   expressed as chain-coded points and then approximated by 13 elliptic
   Fourier coefficients. After normalization of the rotation and starting
   point of the contours, symmetrical standard coefficients were
   determined. The symmetrical Fourier index (S-FX) of individual kernels
   was calculated from the product of the sum of absolute symmetrical
   coefficients and the circularity (roundness) index. Three geometric
   features, namely; aspect ratio (AR), major diameter (M-D) and roundness
   (C-eq) were determined using ellipse fitting and Green's transformation
   of curve integrals, respectively. The morphological classification model
   was defined using S-FX, AR, M-D, and C-eq. The color classification
   model was defined using color indices of individual kernels, which were
   calculated from the RGB color values of their images. The classification
   accuracies of different models were evaluated and compared. The combined
   model defined by morphological and color features achieved a
   classification accuracy of 98.5\% for barley, 99.97\% for CWRS, 99.93\%
   for oat, and 100\% for rye and CWAD. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, the effects of water-to-cement ratio (W/C), cement
   content and coarse aggregate content on the density, void ratio,
   infiltration rate, and compressive strength of portland cement pervious
   concrete (PCPC) were investigated by statistical modelling. Two-level
   factorial design and response surface methodology (RSM) were used. The
   PCPC mixtures were made with W/C in the range of 0.28-0.40, cement
   content in the range of 350-415 kg/m(3)and coarse aggregate content in
   the range of 1200-1400 kg/m(3). In addition, examples were given on
   using multi parametric optimization to produce isoresponses of a
   desirability function for PCPC satisfying specified criteria including
   cost. The results show that W/C, cement content, coarse aggregate
   content and their interactions are key parameters, which significantly
   affect the characteristic performance of PCPC. The statistical models
   developed in this study can facilitate optimizing the mixture
   proportions of PCPC for target performance by reducing the number of
   trial batches needed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The traditional volume electric field integral equation (IE) used for
   solution of full-wave scattering problems on penetrable scatterers of
   arbitrary cross section and its magnetostatic counterpart commonly
   utilized for the resistance and inductance extraction problem are
   reduced to a novel derivative-free single-source surface IE. The
   reduction of volume to surface IE is based on representation of the
   electric field in the cylinder cross section in the form of a
   single-layer ansatz. Substitution of such surface based electric field
   representation into the volume IE reduces it to a surface IE with
   respect to the unknown surface current density. Since the new surface IE
   enforces exactly the field continuity at the material interfaces, the
   radiation condition as well as underlying Helmholtz equations both
   inside and outside the penetrable cylinder, it is rigorously equivalent
   to the solution of Maxwell's equations. The method of moments
   discretization of the new IE is shown to produce an error-controllable
   field approximation. Due to the presence of a product of
   surface-to-volume and volume-to-surface integral operators, the
   discretization of the novel surface-volume-surface IE requires both
   surface and volume meshes.}},

Abstract = {{The susceptibility to heat affected zone cracking of Waspaloy has been
   investigated in terms of its hot ductility, measured as the reduction of
   area (RA). Gleeble testing with on-heating as well as on-cooling test
   cycles was carried out to illuminate the influence of different 4 h
   solution heat treatments between 996 and 1080 degrees C. A ductility
   maximum of between 80 and 90\%RA was found at 1050-1100 degrees C for
   all conditions in the on-heating tests. Although the different heat
   treatment conditions showed similar macrohardness, the particle size and
   distribution of the gamma' and M23C6 phases differed, which
   significantly affected the on-heating ductility in the lower temperature
   test region. The ductile to brittle transition was initiated at 1100
   degrees C in the on-heating testing with indications of grain boundary
   liquation at the higher test temperatures. Ductility recovery, as
   measured in the on-cooling tests from 1240 degrees C, was very limited
   with <30\%RA for all conditions and test temperatures except for the
   1080 degrees C/4 h treatment, which exhibited 60\%RA at 980 degrees C.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Soil-tool interactions are at the centre of many agricultural field
   operations, including slurry injection. Understanding of soil-tool
   interaction behaviours (soil cutting forces and soil disturbance) is
   important for designing high performance injection tools. A discrete
   element model was developed to simulate a slurry injection tool (a
   sweep) and its interaction with soil using Particle Flow Code in Three
   Dimensions (PFC3D). In the model, spherical particles with bonds and
   viscous damping between particles were used to simulate agricultural
   soil aggregates and their cohesive behaviours. To serve the model
   development, the sweep was tested in three different soils (coarse sand,
   loamy sand, and sandy loam). In the tests, soil cutting forces (draught
   and vertical forces) and soil disturbance characteristics (soil
   cross-section disturbance and surface deformation) resulting from the
   sweep were measured. The measured draught and vertical forces were used
   in calibrations of the most sensitive model parameter, particle
   stiffness. The calibrated particle stiffness was 0.75 x 10(3) N m(-1)
   for the coarse sand, 2.75 x 10(3) N m(-1) for the loamy sand, and 6 x
   10(3) N m(-1) for the sandy loam. The calibrated model was validated
   using the soil disturbance characteristics measured in those three
   soils. The simulations agreed well with the measurements with relative
   errors below 10\% in most cases. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Pages = {{227-246}},
Abstract = {{Asymptotic limits of Negative Group Delay (NGD) in linear causal media
   satisfying Kramers-Kronig relations are investigated. Even though there
   is no limit on the NGD-bandwidth product of a linear medium, it is shown
   that the out-of-band to center frequency amplitude ratio, or out-of-band
   gain, increases with the NGD-bandwidth product, and is proportional to
   the amplitude of undesired transients when waveforms with defined ``turn
   on/off{''} times propagate in the media. The optimal dispersion
   characteristic exhibiting NGD, which maximizes the NGD-bandwidth product
   as a function of the out-of-band gain, is obtained through
   Kramers-Kronig relations. It is shown that the NGD-bandwidth product has
   an upper asymptotic limit proportional to the square root of the
   logarithm of the maximum out-of-band gain. The derived NGD-bandwidth
   upper asymptotic limit of the optimally engineered causal dispersion
   characteristic is validated with two examples of physical media, a
   Lorentzian dielectric medium, and an artificially fabricated loaded

Abstract = {{This paper reports new experimental data on the effect of turbulence on
   the vaporization of n-heptane at elevated pressure and room temperature.
   Isotropic turbulence generated in the central volume of a spherical
   vessel was obtained by a set of eight fan blades. Turbulence
   characterization demonstrated that turbulence is isotropic and
   homogeneous within the 40 mm volume in the center of the vessel. The
   vaporization of n-heptane droplet was examined by varying turbulence
   intensity via fan speeds and ambient pressure inside the chamber up to
   21 atm whereas ambient temperature was kept nearly constant at room
   temperature. Results showed that turbulence becomes more effective as
   ambient pressure rises. The present data revealed that the previously
   proposed correlation between the droplet vaporization rate and turbulent
   Reynolds number still holds, and the present data extended its
   applicability over a wider range of flow conditions. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {{The design of a double-ridged horn antenna for medical imaging is
   presented in this paper. The antenna is immersed in canola oil to reduce
   its size and to achieve efficient coupling of the electromagnetic energy
   to the breast tissue. The antenna has wideband performance from 1.5 GHz
   to 5 GHz (3.5 GHz or 108\% of impedance bandwidth), which is suitable
   for radar-based medical imaging. The double-ridged horn antenna has
   exponential tapered section for impedance matching. The detail design
   equations and antenna parameters are presented. The fabricated antenna
   was tested and compared with simulated results, and excellent agreement
   has been observed.}},

   without much difficulty to achieve the desired damping. Eigenanalysis is
   performed on the reduced equivalent of New England New York power
   system. One controller location was found as the best location to
   improve damping of three inter-area modes. Residue analysis reveals the
   presence of a remote signal which has better sensitivity to the same

   uses a local signal and a remote signal is presented and it is shown

Abstract = {{Unbalance in power system caused by the addition of single phase and
   dynamically varying loads are unavoidable. Due to this reason the load
   reactive power is no longer balanced, which causes voltage fluctuation,
   line overloading and high transmission line losses. Researchers have
   come up with technologies to compensate the load reactive power using
   mostly by CUSTOM power devices at distribution level and few FACTS
   devices at transmission level. This paper discusses the unbalance
   reactive power compensation using Dynamic Reactive Power Compensator
   (DRPC), as one of the CUSTOM power device. The DRPC explained here uses
   an extended version of the conventional power theory, to measure
   unbalance reactive power associated with each phases separately. A
   control system was developed to compensate unbalance reactive power and
   it was simulated using PSCAD/EMTDC. Finally the results are provided to
   demonstrate the operation of DRPC. Simulation results confirm that the
   DRPC compensates unbalance reactive power at the load.}},

   linear PI-controller. The controller performance is tested by connecting
   the SVC to a multi-machine power system, which is modeled in RSCAD

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study radio resource allocation (RRA) for multicasting
   in OFDMA based High Altitude Platforms (HAPs). We formulate an
   optimization problem for a scenario in which different sessions are
   multicasted to user terminals (UTs) across HAP service area. We then
   solve it to find the best allocation of HAP resources such as radio
   power, sub-channels, and time slots. The objective is to maximize the
   number of UTs that receive the requested multicast streams in the HAP
   service area in a given OFDMA frame. The optimization problem comes out
   to be a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Program (MINLP). Due to the high
   complexity of the problem and lack of special structures, we believe
   that breaking it into two easier subproblems and iterating between them
   to achieve convergence can lead to an acceptable solution. Subproblem 1
   turns out to be a Binary Integer Linear Program (BILP) of no explicitly
   noticeable structure and therefore Lagrangian relaxation is used to
   dualize some constraints to get a BILP with some special structure that
   is easy to solve. The subgradient method is used to solve for the dual
   variables in the dual problem for three proposed methods to get the
   tightest bound in each. The obtained bounds can be used in a branch and
   bound (BnB) algorithm as its bounding subroutine at each node.
   Subproblem 2 turns out to be a simple linear program (LP) for which the
   simplex algorithm can be used to solve the subproblem to optimality.
   This paper focuses on subproblem 1 and its proposed solution techniques.
   In the results section of this paper, we compare the solution goodness
   for each method versus the well known bounding technique used in BnB
   which is linear program (LP) relaxation.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing number of autonomous heterogeneous devices in future
   mobile networks, an efficient resource allocation scheme is required to
   maximize network throughput and achieve higher spectral efficiency. In
   this paper, performance of network-integrated device-to-device (D2D)
   communication is investigated where D2D traffic is carried through relay
   nodes. An optimization problem is formulated for allocating radio
   resources to maximize end-to-end rate as well as conversing QoS
   requirements for cellular and D2D user equipment under total power
   constraint. Numerical results show that there is a distance threshold
   beyond which relay-assisted D2D communication significantly improves
   network performance when compared to direct communication between D2D
   peers.}},

Abstract = {{Construction of a full PET system requires scaling up from a few
   detectors on the bench top to dozens or even hundreds of detectors all
   operating simultaneously and connected to high channel count
   electronics. Our collaboration is building a MRI compatible PET insert
   system that will contain 16 detector modules in the prototype phase and
   64 detector modules in the final phase. This number of detectors makes
   it difficult, if not impossible, to manually configure and monitor each
   detector in the system. In order to make possible the scaling of the
   system for up to 64 detectors, we require a scalable slow control system
   to manage the low level functions of the PET system, such as controlling
   detector bias and monitoring temperature and power consumption, that can
   be interfaced to and controlled by a host computer. We have implemented
   this slow control system in conjunction with a detector interface board
   (DIB) that is an intermediary between the detectors and the OpenPET
   digitizer system. Each DIB is connected to four detector modules and is
   controlled by a Raspberry Pi (R) computer directly attached to it. The
   Raspberry Pi (R) computers report to a host PC software program
   developed in National Instruments LabWindows (TM)/CVI to provide the
   capability of central monitoring and control.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) have high gain, excellent timing
   performance, and are well suited to PET/MRI applications due, in part,
   to their MR-compatibility and small form factor. Within the constraints
   of a resistor-based multiplexing circuit, it is useful to evaluate the
   four generations of SiPM arrays manufactured by SensL: the SPMArray4,
   ArraySL-4, ArraySM-4, and ArraySB-4. Breakdown voltage and dark current
   were measured as a function of temperature in two each of the four
   generations of SensL SiPM arrays. Flood histograms were created with a
   Ge-68-irradiated 9x9 LYSO crystal array at temperatures of 5 degrees C
   to 45 degrees C in 5 degrees C increments and overvoltages of 2 to 4 V
   in 0.5 V increments. Measurements of dark current vs. bias voltage
   increased as temperature increased, with a corresponding increase in the
   breakdown voltage, V-b. The temperature dependence of V-b is similar
   between all four generations of SiPM arrays with slopes ranging from
   17.0 to 23.8 mV/degrees C. Notably, the ArraySB-4 has lower values for
   the breakdown voltage, with V-b = 24 V at 0 degrees C. Mean energy
   resolution for individual LYSO crystals showed improvements in each
   successive generation. The average energy resolution of the ArraySB-4
   was 11.9\% after correcting for non-linearity in the SiPM pixels. The
   linearity of the SensL SiPM arrays as a function of temperature and
   breakdown voltage makes them a suitable choice for a high-resolution,
   small animal PET/MRI system. Based on its improved resolvability and
   energy resolution, lower sensitivity to temperature and higher PDE, the
   ArraySB-4 will be used in our PET system.}},

   variation of chaotic simulated annealing is proposed and is applied in
   solving a combinatorial optimization problem in multiprocessor task

   a wider initial solution search.}},

Abstract = {{Compared to single-hop networks such as WiFi, multihop infrastructure
   wireless mesh networks (WMNs) can potentially embrace the broadcast
   benefits of a wireless medium in a more flexible manner. Rather than
   being point-to-point, links in the WMNs may originate from a single node
   and reach more than one other node. Nodes located farther than a one-hop
   distance and overhearing such transmissions may opportunistically help
   relay packets for previous hops. This phenomenon is called opportunistic
   overhearing/listening. With multiple radios, a node can also improve its
   capacity by transmitting over multiple radios simultaneously using
   orthogonal channels. Capitalizing on these potential advantages requires
   effective routing and efficient mapping of channels to radios (channel
   assignment (CA)). While efficient channel assignment can greatly reduce
   interference from nearby transmitters, effective routing can potentially
   relieve congestion on paths to the infrastructure. Routing, however,
   requires that only packets pertaining to a particular connection be
   routed on a predetermined route. Random network coding (RNC) breaks this
   constraint by allowing nodes to randomly mix packets overheard so far
   before forwarding. A relay node thus only needs to know how many
   packets, and not which packets, it should send. We mathematically
   formulate the joint problem of random network coding, channel
   assignment, and broadcast link scheduling, taking into account
   opportunistic overhearing, the interference constraints, the coding
   constraints, the number of orthogonal channels, the number of radios per
   node, and fairness among unicast connections. Based on this formulation,
   we develop a suboptimal, auction-based solution for overall network
   throughput optimization. Performance evaluation results show that our
   algorithm can effectively exploit multiple radios and channels and can
   cope with fairness issues arising from auctions. Our algorithm also
   shows promising gains over traditional routing solutions in which
   various channel assignment strategies are used.}},

Title = {{Linking genome content to biofuel production yields: a meta-analysis of
   major catabolic pathways among select H-2 and ethanol-producing bacteria}},
Journal = {{BMC MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Fermentative bacteria offer the potential to convert
   lignocellulosic waste-streams into biofuels such as hydrogen (H-2) and
   ethanol. Current fermentative H-2 and ethanol yields, however, are below
   theoretical maxima, vary greatly among organisms, and depend on the
   extent of metabolic pathways utilized. For fermentative H-2 and/or
   ethanol production to become practical, biofuel yields must be
   increased. We performed a comparative meta-analysis of (i) reported
   end-product yields, and (ii) genes encoding pyruvate metabolism and
   end-product synthesis pathways to identify suitable biomarkers for
   screening a microorganism's potential of H-2 and/or ethanol production,
   and to identify targets for metabolic engineering to improve biofuel
   yields. Our interest in H-2 and/or ethanol optimization restricted our
   meta-analysis to organisms with sequenced genomes and limited branched
   end-product pathways. These included members of the Firmicutes,
   Euryarchaeota, and Thermotogae.
   Results: Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the absence of genes
   encoding acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and bifunctional
   acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE) in Caldicellulosiruptor,
   Thermococcus, Pyrococcus, and Thermotoga species coincide with high H-2
   yields and low ethanol production. Organisms containing genes (or
   activities) for both ethanol and H-2 synthesis pathways (i. e.
   Caldanaerobacter subterraneus subsp. tengcongensis, Ethanoligenens
   harbinense, and Clostridium species) had relatively uniform mixed
   product patterns. The absence of hydrogenases in Geobacillus and
   Bacillus species did not confer high ethanol production, but rather high
   lactate production. Only Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus produced
   relatively high ethanol and low H-2 yields. This may be attributed to
   the presence of genes encoding proteins that promote NADH production.
   Lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate: formate lyase are not conducive for
   ethanol and/or H-2 production. While the type(s) of encoded hydrogenases
   appear to have little impact on H-2 production in organisms that do not
   encode ethanol producing pathways, they do influence reduced end-product
   yields in those that do.
   Conclusions: Here we show that composition of genes encoding pathways
   involved in pyruvate catabolism and end-product synthesis pathways can
   be used to approximate potential end-product distribution patterns. We
   have identified a number of genetic biomarkers for streamlining ethanol
   and H-2 producing capabilities. By linking genome content, reaction
   thermodynamics, and end-product yields, we offer potential targets for
   optimization of either ethanol or H-2 yields through metabolic
   engineering.}},

Journal = {{BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{125}},
Pages = {{88-96}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Bioaugmentation with ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) was tested for
   620 d. A seeding reactor (R1), two seeded reactors (R2 at 21 degrees C;
   R3 at 15 degrees C) and an unseeded-control reactor (R4 at 21 degrees C)
   were operated in parallel (2.4 < SRT < 4 d). The effect of seeding on
   nitritation efficiency was found to be dependent on solids retention
   time (SRT), influent ammonia concentration to the seeded reactors and
   the temperature difference between the seeding and seeded reactors.
   Mathematical modeling and batch tests were used to characterize the AOB
   selected in R1 and the effect of the seeding on AOB kinetics in R2 and
   R3. The AOB kinetics of R2 and R3 reflected the kinetics of R1 but
   differed from those in R4. This behavior affected the efficiency of
   bioaugmentation to varying degrees in the reactors and required a
   specific approach to represent the experimental results through
   mathematical modeling. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{High complexity and high latency are key problems for multiuser
   detection (MUD) to be applied to a mobile station in cellular networks.
   To tackle these problems, an interleave division multiple access (IDMA)
   based multiple access scheme, grouped spread IDMA (GSIDMA), is proposed.
   In a GSIDMA system, lower complexity and latency for mobile stations can
   be achieved by appropriately dividing active users into different
   groups. The system model of GSIDMA is constructed and followed by
   analysing on its system capacity, complexity and latency, and bit error
   rate (BER) performance. The extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart
   is used to analyze the convergence behavior of the iteration process.
   The grouping method and interleavers-reuse issue for GSIDMA are also
   discussed preliminarily. The analyses and simulation results indicate
   that the complexity and latency of the proposed scheme are much lower
   than those of IDMA, whereas its BER performance is close to the latter.
   The properties of low complexity and low latency make it more feasible
   for the practical implementation.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},

Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this research, we numerically investigate the physics of pulsatile
   flows confined within a 3-dimensional channel with a modelled stenosis
   formed eccentrically on the upper wall using the method of large-eddy
   simulation (LES). An advanced dynamic nonlinear subgrid-scale stress
   model was utilized to conduct numerical simulations and its predictive
   performance was examined in comparison with that of the conventional
   dynamic model. The Womersley number tested in the simulation was fixed
   at 10.5 and the Reynolds numbers tested were set to 750 and 2000, which
   are characteristics of human blood flows in large arteries. An in-house
   LES code, based on curvilinear Cartesian coordinates, has been developed
   to conduct the unsteady numerical simulations using three different grid
   systems. The physical characteristics of the flow field have been
   studied in terms of the resolved mean velocity, turbulence kinetic
   energy, viscous wall shear stress, resolved and subgrid-scale turbulent
   shear stresses, local kinetic energy fluxes between the filtered and
   subgrid scales, and turbulence energy spectra along the central
   streamline of the domain. Triggered by the stenosis, the flow field
   driven by the pulsatile inlet condition undergoes
   laminar-turbulent-laminar patterns in the streamwise direction.
   Correspondingly, the slope of the energy spectra deviates significantly
   from the well-known -5/3 law for the inertial subrange to reflect the
   transition in the flow patterns. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

   the conducting polymer, were measured vs. time. For the H-terminated
   samples, the n-Si/polymer contacts were initially rectifying, whereas
   p-Si microwire/polymer contacts were initially ohmic, but the resistance
   of both the n-Si and p-Si microwire/polymer contacts increased over
   time. In contrast, relatively stable, ohmic behavior was observed at the
   junctions between CH3-terminated p-Si microwires and conducting
   polymers. CH3-terminated n-Si microwire/polymer junctions demonstrated
   strongly rectifying behavior, attributable to the work function mismatch
   between the Si and polymer. Hence, a balance must be found between the
   improved stability of the junction electrical properties achieved by
   passivation, and the detrimental impact on the effective resistance
   associated with the additional rectification at CH3-terminated n-Si
   microwire/polymer junctions. Nevertheless, the current system under
   study would produce a resistance drop of similar to 20 mV during
   operation under 100 mW cm(-2) of Air Mass 1.5 illumination with high
   quantum yields for photocurrent production in a water-splitting device.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the feasibility of acoustical analysis for detection of
   swallowing silent aspiration is investigated. As a pilot study, we
   analyzed the breath sounds of 21 dysphagic individuals, 11 of which
   demonstrated aspiration during the fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of
   swallowing (FEES) or videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS). We found
   that the low frequency components of the power spectrum of the breath
   sounds after a swallow show higher magnitude when there is aspiration.
   Thus, we divided the frequency range below 300 Hz into three sub-bands
   and calculated the average power of the breath sound signal in each
   sub-band as the characteristic features for the stage 1 classification
   into two groups of aspirated and non-aspirated patients. Then, for the
   aspirated group, the unsupervised fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm was
   deployed to label the breath sounds immediately after a swallow as
   aspiration or non-aspiration. The results were compared with the
   FEES/VFSS assessments provided by the speech language pathologists. The
   results are encouraging: more than 86 \% accuracy in detection of silent
   aspiration. While the proposed method should be verified on a larger
   dataset, the results are promising for the use of acoustical analysis as
   a clinical tool to detect silent aspiration.}},

Abstract = {{A plant material-based air purifier (PMAP) was evaluated for odour
   removal. Laboratory tests were performed using two identical chambers:
   one treated by PMAP, and one as the control. Swine manure, hydrogen
   sulphide (H2S) and ammonia (NH3) were tested as odour sources. The test
   was also conducted in a swine barn. Air samples were taken from test
   chambers and two rooms in the pig barn and analysed for H2S, NH3 and
   odour concentrations. When treated with PMAP, the H2S concentration in
   the sealed chamber was subject to exponential decay, with the decay
   constant ranging from 0.59 to 0.70 1/h. The H2S concentration was
   reduced from 20 to 3 ppm in 3 h and to 0.2 ppm in 7 h for H2S produced
   by chemical reaction, and from 0.4 to 0.02 ppm in 3 h for swine manure
   as the odour source. When an equal amount of ammonia solution was placed
   in the two test chambers, the NH3 concentration reached a peak value of
   25 ppm in the chamber treated by PMAP, and 43 ppm in the control. The
   NH3 concentration in the treated chamber was reduced to 5 ppm in 3.5 h
   but stayed at 37 ppm in the control. The PMAP reduced the NH3
   concentration from 38 to 10 ppm when swine manure was used as the odour
   source. The PMAP was capable of reducing swine odour in both laboratory
   and in-barn conditions. The reduction rate was at least 50\%. The
   results from this research indicate the plant-based materials provide an
   alternative, environmentally friendly way for odour control. It is also
   shown that the mode of odour reduction by the PMAP was the removal of
   odour compounds, in contrast to odour masking, which occurs for most
   plant materials that have been used for odour control.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of streaming packetized media data in a
   combined wireline/802.11 network. Since the wireless channel is normally
   the bottleneck for media streaming in such a network, we propose that
   wireless fountain coding (WFC) be used over the wireless downlink in
   order to efficiently utilize the wireless bandwidth and exploit the
   broadcast nature of the channel. Forward error correction (FEC) is also
   used to combat errors at the application-layer. We analytically obtain
   the moment generating function (MGF) for the wireless link-layer delay
   incurred by WFC. With the MGF, the expected value of this wireless
   link-layer delay is found and used by the access point (AP), who has no
   knowledge of the buffer contents of wireless receivers, to make a
   coding-based decision. We then derive the end-to-end packet loss/late
   probability based on the MGF. We develop an integrated ns-3/EvalVid
   simulator to evaluate our proposed system and compare it with the
   traditional 802.11e scheme which is without WFC capability but equipped
   with application- and link-layer retransmission mechanisms. Through
   extensive simulations of video streaming, we show that streaming with
   WFC is able to support more concurrent video flows compared to the
   traditional scheme. When the deadlines imposed on video packets are
   relatively stringent, streaming with WFC also shows superior performance
   in terms of packet loss/late probability, video distortion, and video
   frame delay, over the traditional scheme. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley

Abstract = {{The capability of a single impacting tee junction to perform as a full

   the limiting inlet conditions under which full separation was attainable
   using air-water flow at a nominal pressure (P-s) of 200 kPa (abs) and
   ambient temperature in a junction of inside diameter (d) of 13.5 mm and
   outlet inclinations (theta) of 2.5 degrees, 7.5 degrees, 15 degrees, 30
   degrees, 60 degrees, 75 degrees, and 90 degrees. Flow phenomena near the
   limiting conditions were observed and a simple correlation based on the
   similarity between these flow phenomena and the phenomenon of liquid
   entrainment in small upward branches was developed. This correlation was
   capable of accurate prediction of the data in terms of magnitude and
   trend. For high inlet flow rates beyond the limiting conditions, a
   single tee may not achieve full separation, and multi-junction
   separators may be necessary for a high degree of separation. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Reported are a series of river velocity measurements taken one diameter

   A load-bank located on the river shore provides a resistive load for the

   fluctuations at a sample rate of 200 Hz. Analysis of acoustics Doppler
   velocimeter data measured upstream of the turbine quantifies the
   variation in the mean and fluctuating components of river flow velocity.
   Results show that in this particular test site the river contains eddies
   with the same order of magnitude as the turbine diameter or greater.
   Measurements upstream of the operating turbine indicate reduction in the
   mean velocity with eddies breaking down into smaller sizes. These
   smaller eddies increase the turbulence intensity of the incoming flow
   and increase the high frequencies energy level in the power spectra. (C)

Abstract = {{Stem cells hold great promise for treatment of various degenerative
   diseases. However, clinical studies have only shown very moderate
   benefits of cell therapy. We believe that insufficiency of therapeutic
   benefits is due to limited homing of implanted stem cells to targeted
   organs. Microfluidic devices are a very useful research tool for
   quantitative characterizations of stem cells. The present study
   therefore was to assess the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and
   direct current electric field (dcEF) on the growth and trafficking of
   adipose-derived stem cells (ASC). It was found that EGF did not affect
   cell proliferation in cell-culture flasks. However, ASC proliferated at
   a higher rate in microfluidic devices with continuous infusion of EGF.
   Furthermore, we found that ASC migrated toward an EGF gradient in
   microfluidic devices. Moreover, we found that ASC tended to position
   perpendicularly to dcEF. The results suggest that EGF and dcEF may be
   effective in guiding homing and trafficking of implanted ASC.}},

Abstract = {{The construction of pool-type fishways has greatly increased in recent
   years in response to widespread river fragmentation by man-made
   structures. However, the performance of such facilities has often been
   questioned, particularly for non-salmonid fish fauna, which are
   frequently the predominant group of species found in rivers. This study
   presents the main findings from field and experimental research
   conducted over the last 10 years on pool-type fishways in Portugal.
   Specific goals were: (i) to catalogue and evaluate the effectiveness of
   pool-type fishways built at small hydropower plants (SHP); (ii) to
   assess passage patterns of migrant fish populations through a ``highly
   suitable{''} facility; (iii) to assess fish use for submerged orifices
   and surface notches under different flow regimes in experimental
   conditions and (iv) to determine the effect of hydraulic parameters on
   upstream movements of fish within these fishways. More than half (n =
   19,51\%) of the visited fishways were considered to be unsuitable for
   the target potamodromous species. Seasonal movements peaked in the
   spring (>70\%) and occurred independently of time of day. Laboratory
   experiments showed a significantly greater proportion of movements
   occurring through submerged orifices rather than surface notches. Of all
   the analyzed hydraulic parameters, the Reynolds shear stress was the one
   that most influenced fish movements within the fishways investigated.
   The results of this study provide new information and insights that
   could have important implications on the design of future fishways,
   particularly for larger potamodromous cyprinids. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Pocket injection of liquid manure is a new approach for low soil
   disturbance injection of liquid manure. However, equipment for pocket
   injection has not been developed. In this study, three prototypes of a
   pulsing meter were designed, fabricated, and tested. The final prototype
   of the pulsing meter was adapted onto an existing AerWay aerator to form
   a field pocket injector The AerWay aerator created soil pockets
   (cavities in soil), and the pulsing meter delivered liquid manure in
   pulses with the intention of each pulse being placed into a soil pocket.
   Laboratory tests showed that the pulsing meter had the function of
   regulating liquid as pulses, which is desired for pocket injection. The
   volume of pulse varied between 88 and 278 mL (2.98 and 9.40 oz),
   depending on the operational speed of the pulsing meter The pocket
   injector was tested in a forage field and a field with barley stubble.
   The field test results further confirmed the desired pulsing function
   and reliability of the pulsing meter The field results also showed the
   significant reduction in liquid exposure on the soil surface, when
   compared to the traditional manure delivery system of the AerWay aerator}},

Abstract = {{In Canada, the Province of Manitoba is the second largest potato
   producer after Prince Edward Island. Potato is a moisture-sensitive
   crop, and excess or inadequate soil water content can adversely affect
   the yield and quality. Potato in Manitoba experiences periods of excess
   as well as insufficient water content within the soil profile during the
   growing season. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of
   four different water management treatments on potato yield in a fine
   sandy loam soil in southern Manitoba: controlled drainage with
   subirrigation (CDSI), free drainage with overhead irrigation (FDIR), no
   drainage with overhead irrigation (NDIR), and no drainage with no
   irrigation (NDNI). In November 2009, tile drains were installed at a
   depth of 0.9 m. CDSI was done through drainage control structures with a
   target water table depth of 0.6 m. Overhead irrigation was done using a
   traveling gun. Groundwater level, drainage discharge, and potato yield
   data were collected during the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. In 2010,
   potato yield was not found to be significantly different between the
   treatments due to the large variability between the replicates. However,
   in 2011, potato yield from the FDIR treatment was significantly higher
   compared to NDNI and CDSI (p <0.05). The NDNI treatment yield was
   significantly lower (p < 0.05) than the other three treatments. When
   compared with NDNI, the other treatments showed a yield increase of 15\%
   to 32\%. Maintaining adequate soil moisture by overhead irrigation was
   most effective for increasing potato yield when rainfall is inadequate.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal properties of mung bean (Vigna radiata) are essential for
   designing postharvest handling equipment for mung bean processing, The
   specific heat, thermal conductivity, and thermal diffusivity of mung
   bean were determined as a function of moisture content and temperature.
   The specific heat and thermal conductivity were quantified using a
   specially built vacuum flask calorimeter and thermal conductivity probe,
   respectively. The specific heat was determined by mixing hot water with
   a sample maintained at lower temperature and incorporating graphical
   temperature,correction into the calculation. The thermal conductivity
   was determined by measuring the temperature response of the sample when
   heated with a line heat source. The thermal diffusivity was directly
   calculated from the specific heat and thermal conductivity data. The
   specific heat and thermal conductivity of mung bean increased linearly
   from 1.63 to 2.45 kJ kg(-1) K-1 and from 0.092 to 0.141 W m(-1) K-1,
   respectively, with the corresponding increase in moisture content from
   9.9\% to 18.3\% wb. and temperature from 10 degrees C to 50 degrees C.
   The thermal diffusivity of mung bean changed from 0.659 x 10(-7) to
   0.752 x 10(-7) m(2) s(-1) with increase in moisture content and

Abstract = {{As the number of resonances increases, it becomes difficult to improve
   and maintain the performance of dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs),
   over the expanded impedance bandwidth. To remove unwanted modes, adjust
   the frequency distance between individual modes, reduce antenna size and
   cross polarization, and preserve radiation patterns in a wideband
   configuration, a dielectric resonator antenna fed with parallel standing
   strips is proposed in this paper. The use of parallel standing strips
   provides several degrees of freedom in the design procedure to enhance
   the DRA characteristics. To validate the effectiveness of this approach,
   two DRAs with parallel standing strips were fabricated using different
   procedures. The antennas were tested and characterized. The measured
   results are in good agreement with simulation ones. A 46\% size
   reduction was achieved for the multimode DRA. The impedance bandwidth of
   the proposed DRA of simple rectangular shape was over 60\% with a
   measured gain ranging from 5.5 to 9.5 dBi. Broadside radiation patterns
   with fairly low cross polarizations can be maintained over the impedance
   bandwidth. The simulated radiation efficiency is more than 96\% within
   the frequency band.}},

Abstract = {{A low cost printed dipole antenna is proposed as a feed for prime focus
   reflectors. Its geometry is arranged such that the two dipole arms are
   on opposite sides of a dielectric substrate, fed by a microstrip line. A
   printed dipole-reflector is placed parasitically in front of the
   radiating dipole arms to make its radiation backward, toward the
   microstrip line. This allows mounting the feed centrally on a parabolic
   reflector from its apex, eliminating the needs for supporting struts.
   The feed antenna offers an impedance bandwidth of 16.5\%, when printed
   on a substrate of dielectric constant 2.5, and an overall dimension of
   60 x 60 x 1.58 mm(3) at 3 GHz. Its impedance bandwidth is enhanced up to

Abstract = {{Auction theory, as a subfield of economics, provides useful tools to
   model, analyze, and optimize radio resource management in cognitive
   radio environments. By using an auction, radio resources such as
   subchannel, time slot, and transmit power can be allocated among
   licensed and unlicensed users in the system, following market laws. Due
   to the flexibility of mechanism design, there are various auction
   mechanisms that have been applied to cognitive radio systems with
   different characteristics. In this article, we first provide an overview
   of the basics of general auctions. Then the motivations and specific
   design issues in applying auctions to wireless network architectures and
   protocols are discussed. Then we review the state of the art in the use
   of auction theory and mechanism design in cognitive radio networks. This
   will enable the readers to have a general view of auction fundamentals,
   as well as the recent development and applications of auction theory in
   the emerging cognitive wireless networks.}},

Abstract = {{The paper shows that the boundary diffraction wave originating at an
   edge is an omnidirectional cylindrical wave. The experimental set-up
   used to demonstrate this property employs a He-Ne laser beam. The beam
   is split into three beams using a glass plate. One of the beams passes
   straight through, the second beam passes through the glass plate and the
   third beam is the reflected beam. It is shown that the interference
   patterns are observed in all three beams. Analysis of these patterns
   shows that the boundary diffraction wave originating from the edge is an
   omnidirectional cylindrical wave. This analysis also provides strong
   evidence that the boundary diffraction wave travels not only within the
   beam where it originates but also to the neighboring coherent beam. The
   energy re-distribution was also shown to be dependent on the wavelength
   of the incident light beam and hence provides further evidence as to why
   longer wave lengths disperse more compared to shorter wavelengths in
   white light diffraction by an edge. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effect of colloidal nano-silica on concrete
   incorporating single (ordinary cement) and binary (ordinary cement +

   experimental program included tests for adiabatic temperature, rapid
   chloride ion permeability, mercury intrusion porosimetry,
   thermogravimetry and backscattered scanning electron microscopy in order
   to link macro- and micro-scale trends. Significant improvement was
   observed in mixtures incorporating nano-silica in terms of reactivity,
   strength development, refinement of pore structure and densification of
   interfacial transition zone. This improvement can be mainly attributed
   to the large surface area of nano-silica particles, which has pozzolanic
   and filler effects on the cementitious matrix. Micro-structural and
   thermal analyses indicated that the contribution of pozzolanic and
   filler effects to the pore structure refinement depended on the dosage

Abstract = {{We investigate the distributed robust transmission scheduling and power
   control problem in a cognitive spatial-reuse time division multiple
   access (STDMA) network. In particular, we address the problem of
   minimizing the transmission length (in terms of time-slots) of the
   secondary links under their minimum quality-of-service (QoS)
   requirements without violating the maximum tolerable interference limit
   for the primary receivers. Traditionally, the joint transmission
   scheduling and power control problem only considers the average link
   gains; therefore, QoS violation can occur due to improper power
   allocation with respect to instantaneous channel gain realization. To
   overcome this problem of QoS violation, our problem formulation takes
   the channel gain uncertainty into account. Since an optimal solution
   cannot be obtained due to the NP-completeness of the problem, we propose
   a novel distributed two-stage algorithm based on the distributed column
   generation method to obtain the near-optimal solution for the robust
   transmission schedules in an ad-hoc cognitive radio network. To
   demonstrate its relative efficiency, our algorithm is compared with
   previously proposed algorithms. For the proposed algorithm, we also
   derive the bounds on the probability of
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint violation and
   the expected number of additional time-slots required to satisfy the
   traffic demand requirements of secondary links.}},

Abstract = {{Gleeble thermomechanical simulation and microstrucutural analyses of
   laser beam weldability of a newly developed precipitation-hardened
   nickel-base HAYNES alloy 282 were performed to better understand the
   fundamental cause of heat-affected zone (HAZ) cracking and how to
   prevent the cracking problem in the material. Submicron size
   intergranular M5B3 particles are identified for the first time in the
   present work by transmission electron microscopy, and were found to be
   the primary cause of HAZ grain boundary liquation cracking in the alloy.
   Complete dissolution of the liquating M5B3 particles by preweld heat
   treatment exacerbated rather than reduced susceptibility to cracking,
   which could be attributed to nonequilibrium intergranular segregation of
   boron atoms, liberated by the complete dissolution of the boride
   particles, during cooling from heat treatment temperature. Consequently,
   to reduce the HAZ cracking, a preweld heat treatment that reduces the
   volume fraction of the M5B3 particles while minimizing nonequilibrium
   grain boundary boron segregation is necessary, and this is possible by
   heat treating the alloy at 1353 K to 1373 K (1080 A degrees C to 1100 A
   degrees C). Further improvement in cracking resistance to produce
   crack-free welds is achieved by subjecting the alloy to
   thermomechanically induced grain refinement coupled with the preweld
   heat treatment at 1353 K (1080 A degrees C). A Gleeble hot ductility
   test showed that formation of the crack-free welds is unexplainable by
   mere reduction in grain size without considering the effect of grain
   refinement on intergranular liquid produced by subsolidus liquation of
   the M5B3 borides.}},

Abstract = {{Ejection of DNA molecule from carbon nanotubes subjected to torsion is
   investigated with molecular dynamics simulations. The wall of a carbon
   nanotube undergoes a collapse and a corresponding propagation of the
   collapse when a torsion loading applied to the tube is beyond a critical
   value. The van der Waals force between the encapsulated DNA molecule and
   the collapsed wall of the nanotube on one hand is a driving force to
   push the molecule out of the tube, while may also prevent the ejection
   when the onset of the collapsed wall is in front of the molecule. To
   ensure a complete DNA ejection, a design of a stopper, a small fixed
   portion on the carbon nanotube to prevent the collapsed wall from
   propagating in front of the DNA molecule, is developed. The effects of
   the environmental temperature, the torsion loading, and the size of the
   nanotube on the delivering process of the DNA molecule are also
   examined. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of ejection of
   DNA molecules from carbon nanotubes subjected to torsion and provide
   guidance on designs of the DNA delivery in biology and medical

Abstract = {{Strain-controlled low cycle fatigue (LCF) and fatigue crack growth (FCG)
   tests were performed on a newly developed Aerospace superalloy, Haynes
   282, in its standard heat treatment condition which consists of a
   solution heat treatment of 1130 degrees C/2 h/water-quench followed by
   ageing at 1010 degrees C/2 h/air-cool and 788 degrees C/8 h/air-cool.
   Cyclic deformation characteristics of the Haynes 282 at room temperature
   (25 degrees C) were obtained from the LCF test. The LCF test results
   showed that Haynes 282 experienced a relatively short period of initial
   cyclic hardening followed by a regime of cyclic softening to specimen
   failure at all the strain amplitudes employed in the work. Additionally,
   cyclic deformation parameters determined in the work indicate strong
   fatigue deformation resistance of the newly developed superalloy. On the
   other hand, room temperature FCG test results showed that an increase in
   the stress ratio leads to a rise in the crack growth rate. However, in
   contrast to common assumption, the loading frequency was observed to
   have an effect on the crack growth behaviour at room temperature.
   Furthermore, an increase in temperature from 25 degrees C to 600 degrees
   C at a testing frequency of 15 Hz resulted in an increase in the fatigue
   crack growth at all stress intensities. However, at a frequency of 0.05
   Hz, over a relatively large stress intensity range (Delta K), the
   fatigue crack growth rate decreased with an increase in temperature. The
   effect of temperature on the fatigue crack growth rate of Haynes 282 are
   discussed in terms of homogeneity of slip, roughness induced crack
   closure and dynamic strain ageing. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{NONLINEAR DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{70}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Lyapunov exponents indicate the asymptotic behaviors of nonlinear
   systems, the concept of which is a powerful tool of the stability
   analysis for nonlinear systems, especially when the dynamic models of
   the systems are available. For real world systems, however, such models
   are often unknown, and estimating the exponents reliably from
   experimental data is notoriously difficult. In this paper, a novel
   method of estimating Lyapunov exponents from a time series is presented.
   The method combines the ideas of reconstructing the attractor of the
   system under study and approximating the embedded attractor through
   tuning a Radial-Basis-Function (RBF) network, based on which the
   Jacobian matrices can be easily derived, making the model-based
   algorithm applicable. Three case studies are presented to demonstrate
   the efficacy of the proposed method. The H,non map and the Lorenz system
   feature spectra including not only the positive exponent, but also the
   negative one, while the standing biped balance system is characterized
   by four negative exponents. Compared with the existing methods, the
   numerical accuracy of the Lyapunov exponents derived through the newly
   proposed method is much higher regardless of their signs even in the
   presence of measurement noise. We believe that the work can contribute
   to the stability analysis of nonlinear systems of which the dynamics are
   either unknown or difficult to model due to complexities.}},

Abstract = {{The contrast source inversion algorithm is formulated using the
   finite-element method for two-dimensional transverse electric microwave
   imaging problems. Edge-based triangular elements with vector basis
   functions are utilized to solve the TE electromagnetic problem. A single
   finite-element method (FEM) mesh is used to model both the electric
   field as well as the contrast-source and contrast variables used in the
   inverse problem. The electromagnetic field is modeled by taking the
   unknown values to be the tangential components of the transverse
   electric field along the edges of each triangular element. The unknown
   contrast-source and contrast variables are located at the centroids of
   every triangular element of the same FEM mesh, but only inside the
   imaging domain. The adaptation of the FEM-contrast source inversion
   (FEM-CSI) algorithm to 2D-TE problems on such an arbitrary mesh requires
   the implementation of special transformation operators which are
   presented herein. The algorithm's capabilities are demonstrated by
   inverting the Fresnel experimental TE datasets as well as synthetically

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel algorithm to determine the location of dc
   line faults in an HVDC system with multiple terminals connected to a
   common point, using only the measurements taken at the converter
   stations. The algorithm relies on the traveling-wave principle, and
   requires the fault-generated surge arrival times at the converter
   terminals. With accurate surge arrival times obtained from
   time-synchronized measurements, the proposed algorithm can accurately
   predict the faulty segment as well as the exact fault location.
   Continuous wavelet transform coefficients of the input signal are used
   to determine the precise time of arrival of traveling waves at the dc
   line terminals. Performance of the proposed fault-location scheme is
   analyzed through detailed simulations carried out using the
   electromagnetic transient simulation software PSCAD. The algorithm does
   not use reflected waves for its calculations and therefore it is more
   robust compared to fault location algorithms previously proposed for
   teed transmission lines. Furthermore, the algorithm can be generalized
   to handle any number of line segments connected to the star point.}},

Abstract = {{Exact knowledge of the position and proper calibration of robots that
   move by wheels form an important foundation in mobile robot
   applications. In this context, a variety of sensory systems and
   techniques have been developed for accurate positioning of differential
   drive mobile robots. This paper, first, provides a brief overview of
   mobile robots positioning techniques and then, presents a new benchmark
   method capable of calibrating mobile robots with differential drive
   mechanisms to correct systematic errors. The proposed method is compared
   with the commonly used University of Michigan Benchmark (UMBmark)
   odometry method. Two sets of comparisons are conducted on six prototyped
   robots with differential drives. The first set of tests establishes the
   workability and accuracy that can be achieved with the new method and
   compares them with the ones obtained from the UMBmark technique. The
   second experiment compares the performance of a mobile robot, calibrated
   with either the UMBmark or the new method, for an unseen path. It is
   demonstrated that the proposed method of calibration is simple to
   implement, and leads to accuracy comparable to the UMBmark method.
   Specifically, while the error corrections in both methods are within +/-
   5\% of each other, the proposed method requires single straight line
   motion for calibration, which is believed to be simpler and less timely
   to implement than the square path motion required by the UMBmark
   technique. The method should therefore be considered seriously as a new
   tool when calibrating differential drive mobile robots.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a 2-dimensional conformal transformation scheme

   domain to a bounded domain that is more efficiently handled in FEM
   simulations. Due to conformality of the transformation, the magnetic
   stored energy, which is used to calculate the per-unit-length inductance
   matrix, L, is independent from the mapping factor while the longitudinal
   current and its corresponding dissipated energy, which is used to
   calculate the per-unit-length resistance matrix, R, are functions of the
   mapping factor. Numerical results for an overhead transmission line and
   a buried multiconductor cable are compared with those calculated using

Title = {{Proteomic analysis of Clostridium thermocellum core metabolism: relative
   protein expression profiles and growth phase-dependent changes in
   protein expression}},
Journal = {{BMC MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Clostridium thermocellum produces H-2 and ethanol, as well
   as CO2, acetate, formate, and lactate, directly from cellulosic biomass.
   It is therefore an attractive model for biofuel production via
   consolidated bioprocessing. Optimization of end-product yields and
   titres is crucial for making biofuel production economically feasible.
   Relative protein expression profiles may provide targets for metabolic
   engineering, while understanding changes in protein expression and
   metabolism in response to carbon limitation, pH, and growth phase may
   aid in reactor optimization. We performed shotgun 2D-HPLC-MS/ MS on
   closed-batch cellobiose-grown exponential phase C. thermocellum
   cell-free extracts to determine relative protein expression profiles of
   core metabolic proteins involved carbohydrate utilization, energy
   conservation, and end-product synthesis. iTRAQ (isobaric tag for
   relative and absolute quantitation) based protein quantitation was used
   to determine changes in core metabolic proteins in response to growth
   phase.
   Results: Relative abundance profiles revealed differential levels of
   putative enzymes capable of catalyzing parallel pathways. The majority
   of proteins involved in pyruvate catabolism and end-product synthesis
   were detected with high abundance, with the exception of aldehyde
   dehydrogenase, ferredoxin-dependent Ech-type {[}NiFe]-hydrogenase, and
   RNF-type NADH: ferredoxin oxidoreductase. Using 4-plex 2D-HPLC-MS/ MS,
   24\% of the 144 core metabolism proteins detected demonstrated moderate
   changes in expression during transition from exponential to stationary
   phase. Notably, proteins involved in pyruvate synthesis decreased in
   stationary phase, whereas proteins involved in glycogen metabolism,
   pyruvate catabolism, and end-product synthesis increased in stationary
   phase. Several proteins that may directly dictate end-product synthesis
   patterns, including pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductases, alcohol
   dehydrogenases, and a putative bifurcating hydrogenase, demonstrated
   differential expression during transition from exponential to stationary
   phase.
   Conclusions: Relative expression profiles demonstrate which proteins are
   likely utilized in carbohydrate utilization and end-product synthesis
   and suggest that H-2 synthesis occurs via bifurcating hydrogenases while
   ethanol synthesis is predominantly catalyzed by a bifunctional
   aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase. Differences in expression profiles of
   core metabolic proteins in response to growth phase may dictate carbon
   and electron flux towards energy storage compounds and end-products.
   Combined knowledge of relative protein expression levels and their
   changes in response to physiological conditions may aid in targeted
   metabolic engineering strategies and optimization of fermentation
   conditions for improvement of biofuels production.}},

Abstract = {{Subsurface drains are commonly used in humid regions to deal with high
   water tables. However, corn (Zea mays L.) could benefit from subsurface
   drainage even under semi-arid conditions where high-intensity rainfall
   causes the water table to rise within the root zone for short periods.
   In southern Manitoba, seasonally high water tables with high salinity
   have led to salinization of the root zone, making subsurface drainage an
   attractive option to increase yields. The objective of this research was
   to evaluate agronomic performance of corn under water table management
   using subirrigation and tile drainage. Four treatments were tested in
   this experiment: (1) controlled drainage with subirrigation (CDSI), (2)
   no drainage with overhead irrigation (NDIR), (3) free drainage with
   overhead irrigation (FDIR), and (4) no drainage with no irrigation
   (NDNI) as control. The impacts of these treatments on crop performance,
   measured by yield, kernel quality, plant biomass, and plant height, were
   evaluated over two growing seasons. In the first year, which was 57\%
   wetter than the 30-year average, yields were 8.48 (NDNI), 10.36 (NDIR),
   10.10 (FDIR), and 9.22(CDSI) Mg ha(-1) with only the mean yield
   difference for the NDIR and the CDSI treatments being statistically
   significant (p = 0.014). In the second year which was 16\% drier than
   normal, yields were 9.25 (NDNI), 10.47 (NDIR), 11.28 (FDIR), and 9.49
   (CDSI) Mg ha(-1) with no statistically significant differences in yield.}},

Abstract = {{The constraints between biped foot-links and the ground have significant
   effects on bipedal motion planning and control. In this paper, such
   effects on balancing control of a standing biped moving in the sagittal
   plane are investigated. The biped consists of two parts: an inverted
   pendulum representing the legs and the upper body, and a foot having a
   toe-link and a heel-link. The biped is regulated by two torques at the
   ankle-joint and the toe-joint to maintain the upper body at the upright
   position and the foot-links being stationary on the ground. Three
   constraints namely no lifting, no slipping and no rolling over about
   either the toe or the heel are considered. The satisfaction of the
   constraints imposes bounds to the control torques, which are crucial to
   design a control law and predict the type of falls if the constraints
   are violated. The control bounds caused by each individual constraint
   are calculated and the interaction between the constraints is also
   investigated. During the investigation of the control bounds, critical
   angular velocities are calculated above which the constraints are
   violated regardless of the control torques. The importance of the
   toe-joint torque in preventing rolling-over and effect of the toe-link
   length on standing balance control are also discussed in this work.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports results from bench-scale plane-strain laboratory
   tests conducted in order to investigate the behavior of
   geogrid-reinforced silt specimens during freezing and thawing cycles.
   Soil geogrid interaction was analyzed through comparison of the soil and
   geogrid strains. Vertical and lateral pressures were applied to the
   specimens to simulate anisotropic loading conditions in the field.
   Reinforced and unreinforced specimens were subjected to cycles of
   freezing (-25 degrees C) and thawing (+23 degrees C) temperatures inside
   a walk-in temperature-controlled environmental chamber. Measured geogrid
   strains at the end of 12 freezing-thawing cycles were on the order of
   0.57 \%. An additional strain of this magnitude in the reinforcement due
   to the freezing-thawing cycles would have only minimal effect on working
   strain levels in the design, which range from 1 \% to 2 \%. However, the
   strains induced by freezing and thawing can approach working design
   strains as the number of cycles increases. This could have significant
   long-term implications if accumulated strains were to overstrain the
   geogrid. The soil deformations were observed to be mostly horizontal.
   This pattern of deformations during the freezing and thawing of silt
   could result in shallow sliding at the face of slopes and embankments.
   The soil strains were higher than the geogrid strains, indicating
   relative movements between soil and reinforcement, mostly during
   thawing.}},

Abstract = {{A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) can improve fuel economy and
   emission reduction significantly compared to hybrid electric vehicles
   and conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Currently
   there lacks an efficient and effective approach to identify the optimal
   combination of the battery pack size, electric motor, and engine for
   PHEVs in the presence of multiple design objectives such as fuel
   economy, operating cost, and emission. This work proposes a design
   approach for optimal PHEV hybridization. Through integrating the Pareto
   set pursuing (PSP) multiobjective optimization algorithm and powertrain
   system analysis toolkit (PSAT) simulator on a Toyota Prius PHEV
   platform, 4480 possible combinations of design parameters (20 batteries,
   14 motors, and 16 engines) were explored for PHEV20 and PHEV40
   powertrain configurations. The proposed approach yielded the optimal
   solution in a small fraction of computational time, as compared to an
   exhaustive search. This confirms the efficiency and applicability of PSP
   to problems with discrete variables. In the design context we have found
   that battery, motor, and engine collectively define the optimal
   hybridization scheme, which also varies with the drive cycle and all
   electric range (AER). The proposed method and software platform could be
   applied to optimize other powertrain designs. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007149]}},

Abstract = {{An automatic separation procedure of touching objects based on their
   curvature values was developed. Plastic bottles were used as model
   geometries. Using elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs), the image
   contours were smoothed avoiding the occurrence of local pseudo-corners
   resulted from the image acquisition inefficiencies. Then, nodal points
   were determined by evaluating the curvature along the smoothed boundary
   of the images. Nodal points are those points at which the curvature fell
   below a threshold. In situations where multiple nodal points were found,
   the `nearest-neighbor' and `critical radial distance' criteria were used
   to draw the segmentation lines. The algorithm was tested to separate
   bottles of different sizes and shapes with different touching scenarios
   and showed a success rate of more than 99\%. At the current stage of
   development, the algorithm can effectively separate objects with smooth
   boundaries and is thus suitable for separating mechanical objects with
   well-defined geometries. Further work is being done to make it robust
   enough to handle biological entities as well as to deal with scenarios
   where one or more objects are surrounded by a multitude of objects. (C)

Abstract = {{Here we introduce a distribution of floc fractal dimensions as opposed
   to a single fractal dimension value into the floc settling velocity
   model developed in earlier studies. The distribution of fractal
   dimensions for a single floc size was assumed to cover a range from 1.9
   to 3.0. This range was selected based on the theoretically determined
   fractal dimensions for diffusion-limited and cluster cluster
   aggregation. These two aggregation mechanisms are involved in the
   formation of the lime softening flocs analyzed in this study. Fractal
   dimensions were generated under the assumption that a floc can have any
   value of normally distributed fractal dimensions ranging from 1.9-3.0. A
   range of settling velocities for a single floc size was calculated based
   on the distribution of fractal dimensions. The assumption of multiple
   fractal dimensions for a single floc size resulted in a non-unique
   relationship between the floc size and the floc settling velocity, i.e.,
   several different settling velocities were calculated for one floc size.
   The settling velocities calculated according to the model ranged from 0
   to 10 mm/s (average 2.22 mm/s) for the majority of flocs in the size
   range of 1-250 mu m (average 125 mu m). The experimentally measured
   settling velocities of flocs ranged from 0.1 to 7.1 mm/s (average 2.37
   mm/s) for the flocs with equivalent diameters from 10 mu m to 260 mu m
   (average 124 mu m). Experimentally determined floc settling velocities
   were predicted well by the floc settling model incorporating
   distributions of floc fractal dimensions calculated based on the
   knowledge of the mechanisms of aggregation, i.e., cluster cluster
   aggregation and diffusion-limited aggregation. Crown Copyright (C) 2012

Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted in order to investigate the single-
   and two-phase pressure drops in a mini-size, horizontal, impacting tee
   junction with a rectangular cross-section (1.87-mm height x 20-mm
   width). The single-phase experiments covered a wide range of Reynolds
   number using either air or water as the test fluid, while the two-phase
   experiments used air-water mixtures at 200 kPa (abs) and room
   temperature with various inlet flow regimes. The results include the
   fully-developed pressure gradients in the three sides of the junction,
   as well as the pressure drops due to flow in the junction for both the
   single- and the two-phase cases. These results were validated by
   comparisons with exact analytical solutions, existing empirical
   correlations, or new numerical results. The new correlations developed
   for the pressure drop at the junction under single- and two-phase flow
   conditions can be valuable in the design of compact heat exchangers. (C)

Abstract = {{It has been demonstrated that when estimating Lyapunov exponents using a
   time series, nonlinear mapping used for characterizing the evolution of
   the neighbors leads to more accurate negative exponents and is more
   robust to noise in the times series. However, the number of unknown
   elements of the matrices associated with nonlinear mapping increases
   significantly with the embedding dimensions of the state space where the
   dynamics is reconstructed. Such unknown coefficients are solved from a
   set of linear algebraic equations based on the least square-root fit
   method. Derivation of such linear equations and computer programming are
   tedious and error prone especially for the systems with high embedding
   dimensions. In this work, we develop a general form of the linear
   algebraic equations and the corresponding computer program in terms of
   arbitrary embedding dimensions. A stable robotic system with all
   negative Lyapunov exponents and the Lorenz system with positive, zero,
   and negative exponents are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the
   proposed method. The work can contribute significantly to estimating
   Lyapunov exponents for systems with large embedding dimensions.}},

Title = {{Network coding for unicast in a WiFi hotspot: Promises, challenges, and

Abstract = {{In offices and residential buildings. WiFi networks have become a
   primary means for providing Internet access to wireless devices whose
   dominant traffic pattern is unicast. In the meantime, the emergence of
   network coding has brought about great promises for multicast in
   communication networks where intermediate nodes are allowed to process
   independent incoming information flows. Little is known about network
   coding for unicast, however. The objective of this paper is thus to
   depart from multicast scenarios and shed light on several possible
   unicast scenarios to which network coding may be applied in a WiFi
   hotspot in order to obtain communication benefits such as throughput
   gain, fairness, and reduced protocol complexity. We identify five
   representative scenarios in which network coding may be used to benefit
   unicasting in a WiFi hotspot. Several open research issues and practical
   challenges related to each scenario are discussed individually. To
   illustrate the benefits of network coding for unicast in a WiFi hotspot,
   we propose and implement iCORE: The interface COoperation Repeater-aided
   network coding Engine. iCORE is a practical system in which
   multi-channel multi-radio repeaters are used to relay unicast traffic
   for those terminals sitting far away from an access point and suffering
   from weak signals at a WiFi hotspot. It is based on our last scenario
   which illustrates the synergy among network coding, opportunistic
   routing, and interface management. Utilizing idle wireless interfaces
   and listening to traffic opportunistically, iCORE allows packets to move
   across the interfaces and to be coded across flows whenever it sees more
   transmission opportunities. We evaluate iCORE on a four-node chain-like
   topology testbed implemented using IEEE 802.11b/g radios and compare it
   to MORE - the state-of-art intra-flow network coding implementation
   based on opportunistic routing. Our experimental results reveal
   promising gains in terms of throughput over MORE. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of no-wait flow shop scheduling, in
   which a number of jobs are available for processing on a number of
   machines in a flow shop context with the added constraint that there
   should be no waiting time between consecutive operations of a job. Each
   operation has a separable setup time, meaning that the setup time of an
   operation is independent on the previous operations; and the machine can
   be prepared for a specific operation and remain idle before the
   operation actually starts. The considered objective function in this
   paper is the makespan. The problem is proven to be NP-hard. In this
   paper, two frameworks based on genetic algorithm and particle swarm
   optimization are developed to deal with the problem. For the case of
   no-wait flow shop problem without setup times, the developed algorithms
   are applied to a large number of benchmark problems from the literature.
   Computational results confirm that the proposed algorithms outperform
   other methods by improving many of the best-known solutions for the test
   problems. For the problems with setup time, the algorithms are compared
   against the famous 2-Opt algorithm. Such comparison reveals the
   efficiency of the proposed method in solving the problem when separable
   setup times are considered.}},

   with 11.0 +/- 0.8, 13.0 +/- 0.6, and 15.0 +/- 0.5\% moisture content
   (wet basis) or corn (Zea mays L.) with 13.0 +/- 0.2\% moisture content
   (wet basis). At each of five sampled locations, grain was separated into
   three 15-kg vertical layers, and adult numbers in each layer were
   counted. Inside both corn and wheat, adults did not prefer any location
   in the same layer except at high introduced insect density in wheat. The
   adults were recovered from any layer of the corn and >12, 65, and 45\%
   of adults were recovered in the bottom layer of the corn at 20, 25, and
   30 degrees C; respectively. However, <1\% of adults were recovered in
   the bottom layer of wheat. Numbers of adults correlated with those in
   adjacent locations in both vertical and horizontal directions, and the
   temporal continuous property existed in both wheat and corn. Adults had
   highly clumped distribution at any grain temperature and moisture
   content. This aggregation behavior decreased with the increase of adult
   density and redistribution speed. Grain type influenced their
   redistribution speed, and this resulted in the different redistribution
   patterns inside wheat and corn bulks. These characterized distribution
   patterns could be used to develop sampling plans and integrated pest
   management programs in stored grain bins.}},

Abstract = {{The various malfunctions and difficulties of the swallowing mechanism
   necessitate various diagnostic techniques to address those problems.
   Swallowing sounds recorded from the trachea have been suggested as a
   noninvasive method of swallowing assessment. However, acquiring signals
   from the trachea can be difficult for those with loose skin. The
   objective of this pilot study was to explore the viability of using the
   ear and nose as alternative recording locations for recording swallowing
   sounds. We recorded the swallowing and breathing sounds of five healthy
   young individuals from the ear, nose and trachea, simultaneously. We
   computed time-frequency features and compared them for the different
   locations of recording. The features included the peak and the maximum
   frequencies of the power spectrum density, average power at different
   frequency bands and the wavelet coefficients. The average power
   calculated over the 4 octave bands between 150 and 2,400 Hz showed a
   consistent trend with less than 20 dB difference for the breath sounds
   of all the recording locations. Thus, analyzing breath sounds recorded
   from the ear and nose for the purpose of aspiration detection would give
   similar results to those from tracheal recordings; thus, ear and nose
   recording may be a viable alternative when tracheal recording is not
   possible.}},

   production (22\% of cell dry mass) in glucose medium, and it was
   selected for further studies. While it is closely related to other P.
   putida strains (F1, KT2440, BIRD-1, GB-1, S16, and W619), P. putida LS46
   was genetically distinct from these other strains on the basis of
   nucleotide sequence analysis of the cpn60 gene hypervariable region. PHA
   production was detected as early as 12 h in both nitrogen-limited and
   nitrogen-excess conditions. The increase in PHA production after 48 h
   was higher in nitrogen-limited cultures than in nitrogen-excess
   cultures. Pseudomonas putida LS46 produced mcl-PHAs when cultured with
   glucose, glycerol, or C-6-C-14 saturated fatty acids as carbon sources,
   and mcl-PHAs accounted for 56\% of the cell dry mass when cells were
   batch cultured in medium containing 20 mmol/L octanoate. Although
   3-hydroxydecanoate was the major mcl-PHA monomer (58.1-68.8 mol\%) in P.
   putida LS46 cultured in glucose medium, 3-hydroxyoctanoate was the major
   monomer produced in octanoate medium (88 mol\%).}},

Abstract = {{Ultrashort pulses with wavelength tuning in the visible and
   near-infrared (VNIR) ranges (here approximately 680 to 2000 nm) have
   wide application in many biomedical devices especially in imaging and
   spectroscopy. The theoretical studies here consider the phase-matching
   conditions of three periodically poled crystals (PPKTP, MgO:PPcLN and
   MgO:PPSLT) to use for femtosecond optical parametric oscillators (OPO)
   to generate wavelength tunability in this range. The basic optical
   properties and the wavelength tuning ranges are calculated with respect
   to different grating periods and temperature variation. Dispersive
   properties of crystals relevant to the ultrafast operation regime are
   also discussed. The excitation wavelength used here for the analysis is
   520 nm which is the second harmonic wavelength of Yb-doped ultrashort
   pulse solid state lasers. The concept of the tunable femtosecond OPOs
   with green excitation presented here can be a better alternative to the
   widely used expensive Ti:Sapphire lasers.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{An optimal design of a beam structure coupled with a piezoelectric patch
   is developed to achieve high efficiency of power transformation from a
   mechanical input to an electrical output power for the application of
   power harvesting. The power harvesting is realized by generating an
   electric voltage from the electromechanical coupling effect by the
   piezoelectric patch when the host beam is subjected to a dynamic
   loading. The electric power is then collected by a capacitor through an
   alternating current (AC)/direct current (DC) converter circuit (diode
   bridge circuit). To describe the power-harvesting process, a numerical
   model is developed to calculate the output voltage from the
   piezoelectric patch, the charge on the capacitor and the
   power-harvesting efficiency of the piezoelectric coupled vibrating beam.
   In addition, an experimental study is conducted to measure the generated
   voltage on the piezoelectric patch to verify the proposed numerical
   model. The effects of the excitation angular frequency and the patch
   size and location on the power-harvesting efficiency are discussed for
   the optimal design. The research provides a guideline for optimal
   designs of power-harvesting devices made of piezoelectric beam
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{An algorithm called the neural event extraction routine (NEER) and a
   method called Electrovestibulography (EVestG) for extracting field
   potentials (FPs) from artefact rich and noisy ear canal recordings is
   presented. Averaged FP waveforms can be used to aid detection of
   acoustic and or vestibular pathologies. FPs were recorded in the
   external ear canal proximal to the ear drum. These FPs were extracted
   using an algorithm called NEER. NEER utilises a modified complex Morlet
   wavelet analysis of phase change across multiple scales and a template
   matching (matched filter) methodology to detect FPs buried in noise and
   biological and environmental artefacts. Initial simulation with
   simulated FPs shows NEER detects FPs down to -30 dB SNR (power) but only
   13-23\% of those at SNR's <-6 dB. This was deemed applicable to longer
   duration recordings wherein averaging could be applied as many FPs are
   present. NEER was applied to detect both spontaneous and whole body tilt
   evoked FPs. By subtracting the averaged tilt FP response from the
   averaged spontaneous FP response it is believed this difference is more
   representative of the vestibular response. Significant difference (p <
   0.05) between up and down whole body (supine and sitting) movements was
   achieved. Pathologic and physiologic evidence in support of a vestibular
   and acoustic origin is also presented.}},

Title = {{Tolerance spaces: Origins, theoretical aspects and applications}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{195}},
Pages = {{211-225}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{This article considers the origins, theoretical aspects and applications
   of tolerance spaces. In terms of the origin of tolerance spaces, this
   article calls attention to the seminal work by J.H. Poincare (1854-1912)
   and E.C. Zeeman (1925-) on establishing the foundations for tolerance
   spaces. During the period from 1895 to 1912, Poincare introduced sets of
   sensations and sequences of almost the same sensations as a means of
   characterizing the physical spectrum. The perception of physical objects
   that are almost the same leads to a tolerance space view of visual
   perception as well as other forms of perception such as touch and sound.
   Roughly 60 years later (in 1962), Zeeman formally introduced the notion
   of a tolerance space as a useful means of investigating a geometry of
   visual perception. In addition to the general theory of tolerance
   spaces, this article also carries forward earlier work on perceptual
   tolerance relations and considers the resemblance (nearness) between
   tolerance spaces. From an information systems point of view, it can be
   observed that tolerance spaces have proved to be fruitful in a number of
   research areas. Evidence of the utility of tolerance spaces in
   information systems can be seen in the introduction of tolerance rough
   sets, tolerance approximation spaces, and tolerance near sets. The
   contribution of this article is an overview of tolerance spaces
   considered in the context of visual perception and a presentation of a
   formal basis for the study of perceptual tolerance spaces. (C) 2012

Title = {{Spontaneous counter-current imbibition outwards from a hemi-spherical
   depression}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{90-91}},
Pages = {{131-138}},

Abstract = {{Spontaneous counter-current imbibition occurs when brine spontaneously
   displaces oil from a very strongly water-wet rock. Past experiments have
   been performed on cylindrical rock cores, with or without a cylindrical
   hole drilled through them, that have some or all of their faces open to
   imbibition. Changes in the area open to imbibition and the boundary
   conditions of the core plug can make large differences to the rate of
   imbibition. For example, linear imbibition into a core with one-end-open
   is significantly slower than imbibition into an all-faces-open core, and
   radial inwards imbibition goes faster than radial outwards imbibition.
   For linear imbibition, the volume imbibed with time varies as the square
   root of time as compared with almost linear variation with time for
   radial outwards imbibition. The reason for this behaviour during radial
   outwards imbibition is that most of the flow resistance is in the
   vicinity of the cylindrical hole, whereas most of the volume is near the
   closed outer boundary of the core. One would expect similar behaviour
   (i.e. imbibition volume linear with time) from spherical outwards
   imbibition. Experimentally, the situation can be realised by imbibition
   from an open hemi-spherical cavity on one face of a hemi-spherical block
   which is sealed on all other faces. In the present paper, a theory for
   spontaneous spherical outwards imbibition is developed assuming
   piston-like advance of a front from such a hemi-spherical cavity.
   Results are calculated and compared for various boundary conditions and
   the spherical outwards prediction is then tested by experimental results
   obtained for chalk blocks. The predictions and the experiments confirm
   that, for the spherical outwards boundary condition, the production
   curves can be almost linear with time. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The problem of decision fusion for cooperative spectrum sensing in
   cognitive radio (CR) networks is studied when fading channels are
   present between the CRs and the fusion center (FC). The CRs perform
   spectrum sensing using energy detection and transmit their binary
   decisions to the FC for a final decision on the absence or presence of
   the primary user activity. Considering the limited resources in CR
   networks, which makes it difficult to acquire the instantaneous
   channel-state information, noncoherent transmission schemes with on-off
   keying (OOK) and binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK) are employed to
   transmit the binary decisions to the FC. For each of the transmission
   schemes considered, energy-and decoding-based fusion rules are developed
   first. Then, the detection threshold at the CR nodes and at the FC, the
   combining weights (in the case of the energy-based fusion rule), and the
   sensing time are optimized to maximize the achievable secondary
   throughput of the CR network. Simulation results verify the theoretical
   analysis. It is also shown that the energy-based fusion rule outperforms
   the decoding-based fusion rule when the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of
   the reporting channels are low, whereas the opposite is true for high
   SNRs. For the simpler energy-based fusion rule, BFSK achieves higher
   secondary throughput than OOK, at the expense of a larger transmission
   bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{A damage analysis was conducted on a spring weight restricted flexible
   pavement to quantify the effects of reduced tire pressure on pavement
   life and to compare the damage predictions from the Asphalt Institute
   (AI) and the Mechanistic Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) models.
   The models were used to predict the number of repetitions to fatigue and
   rutting failure at three maximum loads and at high and low tire
   pressures. Based on the results, the AI and MEPDG predictions were
   statistically different for both fatigue cracking and rutting damage,
   based on the t-test at 95\% confidence limits. The AI model predicted
   31\% lower fatigue damage than the MEPDG, but 56\% higher rutting
   damage. However, both models produced similar trends in predicting the
   relative effects of reduced tire pressure and load levels on pavement
   life. The methodology and results of the analysis are presented in this
   paper.}},

Abstract = {{Part I of this paper describes the design and implementation of an
   islanding detection method based on transient signals. The proposed
   method utilizes discrete wavelet transform to extract features from
   transient current and voltage signals. A decision-tree classifier uses
   the energy content in the wavelet coefficients to distinguish islanding
   events from other transient generating events. The verification tests
   performed in Part I, for a two generator test system having a
   synchronous generator and a wind farm, showed more than 98\%
   classification accuracy with 95\% confidence and a response time of less
   than two cycles. In Part II, the proposed methodology is applied to an
   extended test system with a voltage-source converter-based dc source.
   The proposed relay's performance is compared with the existing passive
   islanding detection methods under different scenarios. Furthermore, the
   effect of noise on the performance of the proposed method is studied.
   The transient-based islanding detection methodology exhibits very high
   reliability and fast response compared to all other passive islanding
   detection methods and shows that the relay can be designed with a zero
   nondetection zone for a particular system.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a numerical method for determining tortuosity in
   porous beds consisting of randomly packed spherical particles. The
   calculation of tortuosity is carried out in two steps. In the first
   step, the spacial arrangement of particles in the porous bed is
   determined by using the discrete element method (DEM). Specifically, a
   commercially available discrete element package (PFC3D ) was used to
   simulate the spacial structure of the porous bed. In the second step, a
   numerical algorithm was developed to construct the microscopic (pore
   scale) flow paths within the simulated spacial structure of the porous
   bed to calculate the lowest geometric tortuosity (LGT), which was
   defined as the ratio of the shortest flow path to the total bed depth.
   The numerical algorithm treats a porous bed as a series of four-particle
   tetrahedron units. When air enters a tetrahedron unit through one face
   (the base triangle), it is assumed to leave from another face triangle
   whose centroid is the highest of the four face triangles associated with
   the tetrahedron, and this face triangle will then be used as the base
   triangle for the next tetrahedron. This process is repeated to establish
   a series of tetrahedrons from the bottom to the top surface of the
   porous bed. The shortest flow path is then constructed geometrically by
   connecting the centroids of base triangles of consecutive tetrahedrons.
   The tortuosity values calculated by the proposed numerical method
   compared favourably with the values obtained from a CT image published
   in the literature for a bed of grain (peas). The proposed model
   predicted a tortuosity of 1.15, while the tortuosity estimated from the
   CT image was 1.14.}},

Abstract = {{Small additions of B, P, and C can result in dramatic changes in the

   additions of B and P improve the mechanical properties, they have a
   detrimental effect on weldability. Adding C mitigates the negative
   effect on welding while retaining the improvements in mechanical
   performance. In this study, precise observations of the segregation of
   B, P, and C to the grain boundaries are made using site-specific atom
   probe tomography and NanoSIMS. Changes in the segregation behavior
   provide a quantitative explanation for the welding response, where hot
   cracking is attributed to the formation of a eutectic film. Calculations
   of the relative positions of the B, P, and C revealed that these atoms
   were less likely to cluster together in the presence of C, providing
   insight into the likely mechanisms behind the segregation behavior in

Abstract = {{With the growing use of self-consolidating concrete (SCC) in various
   infrastructure applications, it has become necessary to establish
   reliable data on its long-term durability since its mixture design,
   rheology and consolidation are different than that of normal concrete.
   Several applications of SCC involve its exposure to chemical attack,
   particularly to sulphate-rich media such as wastewater treatment
   facilities, industrial and agricultural zones which also encompass
   ammonium cations. Thereby, this study aims at investigating the
   resistance of a wide scope of SCC mixture designs to ammonium sulphate
   attack. Specimens from 23 SCC mixtures were continuously immersed in a
   high concentration ammonium sulphate solution with controlled pH
   (6.0-8.0) up to 54 weeks. The main test variables included the type of
   binder (single, binary, ternary and quaternary), air-entrainment,
   sand-to-total aggregates mass ratio, and the inclusion of fibre
   reinforcement (single and hybrid). The SCC specimens showed variable
   degrees of deterioration after 54 weeks, indicating different modes of
   degradation. The study highlights the role of ternary and quaternary
   binders in improving the resistance of SCC to ammonium sulphate attack.
   It is also emphasized that multiple performance indicators are needed to
   achieve a reliable assessment of cement-based materials under ammonium
   sulphate attack.}},

   induced wave signals at two locations on the sheet, i.e. acquiring
   locations. The simulation results indicate that the nano-sensor is able
   to differentiate noble gas atoms with a recognizable sensitivity. The
   dependence of the mass flow rate of gases from the aperture,
   environmental temperature, and the relative location of the gas exit
   aperture with respect to the acquiring locations on the sensitivity is
   studied. The simulation results also show that the resolution of a
   sensor made of the graphene sheet with a size of 3.62 nm x 15.03 nm can
   achieve an order of the impact rate of 10(-7) femtograms per
   picoseconds. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

   calculate the cost of power-demand estimation error and damage of power

Abstract = {{One of the effective techniques of improving the coverage and enhancing
   the capacity and data rate in cellular wireless networks is to reduce
   the cell size (i.e., cell splitting) and transmission distances.
   Therefore, the concept of deploying femtocells over macrocell has
   recently attracted growing interests in academia, industry, and
   standardization forums. Various technical challenges towards mass
   deployment of femtocells have been addressed in recent literature.
   Interference mitigation between neighboring femtocells and between the
   femtocell and macrocell is considered to be one of the major challenges
   in femtocell networks because femtocells share the same licensed
   frequency spectrum with macrocell. Further, the conventional radio
   resource management techniques for hierarchical cellular system is not
   suitable for femtocell networks since the positions of the femtocells
   are random depending on the users' service requirement. In this article,
   we provide a survey of the different state-of-the-art approaches for
   interference and resource management in orthogonal frequency-division
   multiple access (OFDMA)-based femtocell networks. A qualitative
   comparison among the different approaches is provided. To this end, open
   challenges in designing interference management schemes for OFDMA
   femtocell networks are discussed.}},

Title = {{Microfluidic device for studying cell migration in single or co-existing
   chemical gradients and electric fields}},
Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Cell migration is involved in physiological processes such as wound
   healing, host defense, and cancer metastasis. The movement of various
   cell types can be directed by chemical gradients (i.e., chemotaxis). In
   addition to chemotaxis, many cell types can respond to direct current
   electric fields (dcEF) by migrating to either the cathode or the anode
   of the field (i.e., electrotaxis). In tissues, physiological chemical
   gradients and dcEF can potentially co-exist and the two guiding
   mechanisms may direct cell migration in a coordinated manner. Recently,
   microfluidic devices that can precisely configure chemical gradients or
   dcEF have been increasingly developed and used for chemotaxis and
   electrotaxis studies. However, a microfluidic device that can configure
   controlled co-existing chemical gradients and dcEF that would allow
   quantitative cell migration analysis in complex electrochemical guiding
   environments is not available. In this study, we developed a
   polydimethylsiloxane-based microfluidic device that can generate better
   controlled single or co-existing chemical gradients and dcEF. Using this
   device, we showed chemotactic migration of T cells toward a chemokine
   CCL19 gradient or electrotactic migration toward the cathode of an
   applied dcEF. Furthermore, T cells migrated more strongly toward the
   cathode of a dcEF in the presence of a competing CCL19 gradient,
   suggesting the higher electrotactic attraction. Taken together, the
   developed microfluidic device offers a new experimental tool for
   studying chemical and electrical guidance for cell migration, and our
   current results with T cells provide interesting new insights of immune
   cell migration in complex guiding environments. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{Dielectric particles flowing through a microfluidic channel over a set
   of coplanar electrodes can be simultaneously capacitively detected and
   dielectrophoretically (DEP) actuated when the high (1.45 GHz) and low
   (100 kHz-20 MHz) frequency electromagnetic fields are concurrently
   applied through the same set of electrodes. Assuming a simple model in
   which the only forces acting upon the particles are apparent gravity,
   hydrodynamic lift, DEP force, and fluid drag, actuated particle
   trajectories can be obtained as numerical solutions of the equations of
   motion. Numerically calculated changes of particle elevations resulting
   from the actuation simulated in this way agree with the corresponding
   elevation changes estimated from the electronic signatures generated by
   the experimentally actuated particles. This verifies the model and
   confirms the correlation between the DEP force and the electronic
   signature profile. It follows that the electronic signatures can be used
   to quantify the actuation that the dielectric particle experiences as it
   traverses the electrode region. Using this principle, particles with
   different dielectric properties can be effectively identified based
   exclusively on their signature profile. This approach was used to
   differentiate viable from non-viable yeast cells (Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae). (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the on-line measurement of partial discharges (PD)
   in a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) converter station. The HVDC
   station is a particularly challenging environment for measurement due to
   elevated interference levels caused from the switching of
   thyristor-controlled converters. In this work, online PD measurements
   were performed on two specimens; one is an HVDC converter transformer
   and the other an HVDC converter wall bushing. The measurements were
   performed in the high-frequency range from 400 kHz to 30 MHz with modern
   wideband PD measurement instrumentation. Results demonstrate that
   on-line measurement of PD in an HVDC station environment is possible and
   that a combination of input filtering and modern signal processing
   methods for feature extraction can be used to mitigate the converter
   interference. The feature extraction method used plots partial discharge
   data on a time-frequency classification map. The map enabled isolation
   of individual PD phenomena, and demonstrated that trending to monitor
   insulation degradation is possible with online partial discharge
   measurement. Furthermore, specific strategies for PD measurement and
   analysis are developed for each of the transformer and bushing
   specimens.}},

Abstract = {{The surface polarization caused by traveling SAWs at 1.585 GHz has been
   imaged using a dynamic homodyne electrostatic force microscope
   technique. Instead of measuring topographic changes caused by the SAW,
   the reported technique measures polarization in the piezoelectric
   substrate arising from mechanical stress caused by the SAW. The
   polarization associated with this stress field modulates the scanning
   probe cantilever deflection amplitude, which is extracted using a
   lock-in-based technique. High-resolution imaging is presented with
   images of the interference arising from a metal reflector on a SAW
   device. A mathematical model combining SAW generation and force
   interactions between the probe and the substrate was used to verify the
   experimental data. In addition to overcoming the challenge associated
   with detecting and imaging polarization effects at gigahertz
   frequencies, this imaging technique will greatly assist the development
   of SAW-based devices that exploit the reflection and interference of
   SAWs in areas as diverse as microfluidic mixing, cell sorting, and
   quantum entanglement.}},

Abstract = {{A time-domain distortion characterization of electromagnetic-field
   sensors is performed using Hermite-Gauss functions. For every
   electromagnetic-field sensor, a transformation matrix is calculated in
   the spanned Hermite-Gauss signal subspace. The calculated matrix is then
   compared to a reference transformation matrix to give a measure of
   distortion. Distortion characteristics for different frequency ranges
   are calculated to obtain a spectral interpretation. Unique properties of
   Hermite-Gauss functions under the Fourier transform are used to
   calculate the distortion characteristics from a single set of
   time-domain measurements. Distortion characteristics of an asymptotic
   conical dipole are compared to three wire monopoles of different
   lengths. A time-domain simulation based on solving an electric-field
   integral equation using the method of moments is performed. Distortion
   characteristics resulted from the simulation and those obtained using
   measurement data are compared to each other. Finally, the sensitivity of
   the sensors is taken into account in the distortion analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Civil engineers plan, design, manage, and guide investments in surface
   transportation. Truck weight limits are inextricably linked to the
   consideration of pavements, bridges, safety, asset management,

   constrain truck movement of 32.5 t full ISO (International Organization

   associated implications-for trucks to transport full containers
   notwithstanding FBF B and the cap. We conducted a national investigation
   of truck weight regulations across 50 states to identify options, with
   28 cases involving telephone interviews. Results show the options are

Abstract = {{A simple ring choke excited compact dual-mode circular waveguide feed,
   for offset reflector antennas, is proposed. It consists of a central
   round waveguide with a single longitudinal slot opening to a surrounding
   single choke of circular cross-section. It generates the TE11 mode
   inside the waveguide and the higher order TE21 mode inside the ring
   choke, with a quadrature phase difference. The proposed design,
   therefore, separates the two modes spatially, and isolates the input
   waveguide from the detrimental effects of the higher order TE21 mode. It
   thus provides a wide impedance bandwidth, without the need for a
   matching network. The measured results of the return loss and radiation
   patterns on a fabricated prototype show excellent agreement with the
   numerical data. The antenna structure is very compact and when used as a
   primary feed in offset reflectors it reduces the cross polarization.}},

Abstract = {{Using a bench scale moving bed bioreactor (MBBR), the effect of free
   ammonia (FA, NH3, the un-ionized form of ammonium NH4+) concentration on
   anoxic ammonium oxidation (anammox) was evaluated based on the
   volumetric nitrogen removal rate (NRR). Although, a detailed microbial
   analysis was not conducted, the major NRR observed was assumed to be by
   anammox, based on the nitrogen conversion ratios of nitrite to ammonium
   and nitrate to ammonium. Since the concentration of free ammonia as a
   proportion of the total ammonia concentration is pH-dependent, the
   impact of changing the operating pH from 6.9 to 8.2, was investigated
   under constant nitrogen loading conditions during continuous reactor
   operation. Furthermore, the effect of sudden nitrogen load changes was
   investigated under constant pH conditions. Batch tests were conducted to
   determine the immediate response of the anammox consortium to shifts in
   pH and FA concentrations. It was found that FA was inhibiting NRR at
   concentrations exceeding 2 mg N L-1 In the pH range 7-8, the decrease in
   anammox activity was independent of pH and related only to the
   concentration of FA. Nitrite concentrations of up to 120 mg N L-1 did
   not negatively affect NRR for up to 3.5 h. It was concluded that a
   stable NRR in a moving bed biofilm reactor depended on maintaining FA
   concentrations below 2 mg N L-1 when the pH was maintained between 7 and
   8. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of a robust force control system for an
   electrohydraulic load emulator utilized as part of a
   hardware-in-the-loop flight simulation experiment. In this application,
   the force controlled hydraulic actuator is used to artificially recreate
   in-service loads upon a second hydraulic flight actuator operated in
   closed-loop position control. Electrohydraulic force control is more
   difficult than electrohydraulic position tracking because the load
   dynamics influence the force transfer function in a way that makes it
   challenging to develop an accurate force tracking system using simple
   feedback control. Nonlinear quantitative feedback theory (QFT) is
   applied in this paper to address this issue. First, an effective and
   robust feedback controller is designed by nonlinear QFT to desensitize
   the force control loop to nonlinear servovalve flow/pressure effects and
   typical system uncertainties. A secondary compensator is also designed
   within the QFT framework to extend the force tracking bandwidth with
   respect to the load motion. Experiments demonstrate acceptable force
   tracking performance within the scope of a representative
   flight-simulation experiment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   conducted covering all four inlet flow regimes. Models are proposed for
   predicting the average gas and liquid velocities, and the void
   distribution in the fully-developed region of the inlet side of the
   junction and the results from these models were used as input to the
   phase redistribution model. Good agreement in terms of magnitude and
   trend was obtained between the present experimental data and a
   modification of an existing model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An experimental program was conducted at the University of Manitoba to
   test salvaged timber stringers strengthened with glass fiber-reinforced
   polymer (GFRP) laminates. A total of 20 creosote-treated Douglas Fir
   beams with dimensions of 130 x 330 x 4; 500 mm were tested in
   three-point bending. Two groups were studied to examine the effect of
   GFRP reinforcement on the stiffness increase of the beams. The first
   group of 10 samples were reinforced with GFRP laminates on the tension
   side only (Group T), whereas the other group of 10 samples was
   reinforced with GFRP laminates alongside both tension and compression
   zones (Group TC). This study found that the strengthening with GFRP
   laminates, on average, increased the strength and the stiffness of the
   beams, respectively, by 36 and 3\% for Group T and by 31 and 3.5\% for
   Group TC. An analysis of a database of fiber-reinforced polymer
   (FRP)-strengthened timber beams tested by other researchers facilitated
   further study on the effect of FRP on the behavior of timber. The
   comprehensive analysis revealed a minimal stiffness increase in timber
   beams strengthened with FRP. Some evidence exists, however, that the
   beam span-to-depth ratio is an important factor to consider when
   strengthening timber beams. Beams with smaller span-to-depth ratios
   showed some increase in stiffness with increasing the reinforcement
   ratio; however, beams with larger span-to-depth ratios showed no real
   enhancement of beam stiffness, unless the reinforcement ratio was around
   7 times the minimum code-recommended value. This result supports the
   current CSA provisions that do not advocate for stiffness increase when
   this strengthening method is used. The analysis shows that stiffness
   increase in GFRP-strengthened timber beams, based on results of
   small-scale samples, is minimal. DOI:

Abstract = {{We study the robust transmission scheduling and power control problem
   for spectrum sharing between secondary and primary users in a spatial
   reuse time-division multiple access (STDMA) network. The objective is to
   find a robust minimum-length schedule for secondary users (in terms of
   time slots) subject to the interference constraints for primary users
   and the traffic demand of secondary users. We consider the fact that
   power allocation based on average (or estimated) link gains can be
   improper since actual link gains can be different from the average link
   gains. Therefore, transmission of the secondary links may fail and
   require more time slots. We also consider this demand uncertainty
   arising from channel gain uncertainty. We propose a column
   generation-based algorithm to solve the scheduling and power control
   problem for secondary users. The column generation method breaks the
   problem down to a restricted master problem and a pricing problem.
   However, the classical column generation method can have convergence
   problem due to primal degeneracy. We propose an improved column
   generation algorithm to stabilize and accelerate the column generation
   procedure by using the perturbation and exact penalty methods.
   Furthermore, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm for the pricing
   problem based on a greedy algorithm. For the simulation scenario
   considered in this paper, the proposed stabilized column generation
   algorithm can obtain the optimal schedules with 18.85\% reduction of the
   number of iterations and 0.29\% reduction of the number of time slots.
   Also, the heuristic algorithm can achieve the optimality with 0.39\% of
   cost penalty but 1.67 x 10(4) times reduction of runtime.}},

Abstract = {{A novel methodology leading to well-conditioned formulation of the
   inverse scattering problem is proposed. The solution of the inverse
   scattering problem is made possible through elimination of the inherent
   ill-posedness of the inverse source problem. The latter is achieved by
   staging of the imaging experiment in a medium with the Green's function
   exhibiting focusing properties. The method is shown to cast the inverse
   source problem into a well-conditioned matrix equation without addition
   of the non-physical regularization term to the pertinent integral
   equation. This is contrary to the conventional iterative
   optimization-like methods applied to regularized integral equation with
   non-directional Green's function. The method is shown to be applicable
   in both traditional diffraction limited imaging where the evanescent
   waves do not participate in the information transfer from the object to
   the observation region as well as in the metamaterial media where
   focusing goes beyond the diffraction limit with the aid of the
   evanescent wave propagation. The diffraction limited imaging prototype
   is implemented using a parabolic reflector providing desired focusing
   properties of the Green's function. The Raleigh criteria for diffraction
   limited resolution is revisited to demonstrate that upon availability of
   the medium providing sufficient focusing properties the resolution in
   the conventional diffraction limited microwave tomography can go up to
   half-wavelength. The implementation of algorithm in medium supporting
   evanescent wave propagation is demonstrated using the focusing Green's
   function of the Veselago lens.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the role of turbulence and temperature on
   changes in chemistry (dissolved Ca2+ and pH) of leachate within
   transmission pipes in bioreactor landfills, using synthetic and real
   leachate from the Brady Road Landfill in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Sealed
   reactors with rotating propellers were used to mimic leachate flow
   through the transmission pipes. The reactors were operated under
   turbulent conditions at 32, 83, and 180 rpm for 6 h on and 18 h off to
   represent the daily leachate injection operation of a general landfill.
   A control reactor was operated parallel to the reactors at 0 rpm. During
   the Off phase, the reactors were either sealed or open to the
   atmosphere. Under sealed conditions and pH values lower than 7.2, no
   significant changes in chemistry were observed for the synthetic or real
   leachate. However, for the mixers and control reactors containing real
   leachate at pH values higher than 7.4, pH dropped approximately by
   0.3-0.4 units. This is explained by Ca2+ removal as CaCO3 decreasing the
   carbonate buffering capacity of the leachate, outcompeting the
   re-equilibration of CO2 evolved to the headspace of the reactors and its
   pH effect. The geochemical modeling software MINEQL+ was used to verify
   this interpretation, showing the same pH trend. Under open conditions,
   CO2 evolution, as it equilibrated with the atmospheric concentration,
   was responsible for increasing the pH by one unit for the synthetic
   leachate and between 0.35 to 0.45 units for the real leachate. The
   control reactor also exhibited an increased of pH under open conditions
   for the synthetic and real leachate. This shows that temperature had a
   significant impact on CO2 evolution and leachate pH, and may also affect
   the concentration of dissolved Ca2+ within the leachate, accumulating as
   inorganic solids similar to those clogging the leachate transmission
   pipes. DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000507. (C) 2012 American Society

   carbon FRP bars. The behavior of the deep beams is described in terms of
   load-deflection response, cracking patterns and modes of failure,
   strains in reinforcement and concrete, inclined cracking, and ultimate
   shear strengths. All ten beams showed significant reserve strength after
   the inclined cracking was fully developed. The test results also
   indicated that the ultimate shear strength of the tested beams
   considerably increased with the decrease of the shear span to depth
   ratio. In addition, the ultimate shear strengths of the tested beams

   Parameters established by analysing the ductility dependence on
   temperature indicate a reduced weldability of the material in the coarse
   grain size state (ASTM 3) while indicating an increased weldability when

Abstract = {{In the present work, the vibration characteristics of single- and
   double-walled carbon nanotubes under various layerwise boundary
   conditions at different lengths are investigated. This is accomplished
   by the use of molecular dynamics simulations based on the
   Tersoff-Brenner and Lennard-Jones potential energy functions. The
   effects of initial tensile and compressive strains on the resonant
   frequency of carbon nanotubes are also taken into consideration. From
   the results generated, it is observed that the natural frequency of
   carbon nanotubes is strongly dependent on their boundary conditions
   especially when tubes are shorter in length. The natural frequency and
   its dependence on tube end conditions reduce by increasing the tube
   length. The natural frequency of DWCNTs lies between those of the
   constituent inner and outer SWCNTs and is nearer to those of the outer
   one. It is further observed that the natural frequency is highly
   sensitive to tensile and compressive strains. The frequency shift
   occurring in the presence of small initial strains is positive for
   tensile strains and negative for compressive strains. The results
   obtained provide valuable information for calibrating the small scaling
   parameter of the nonlocal models for the vibration problem of carbon
   nanotubes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three dimensional temporal and spatial distributions of adult
   Oryzaephilus surinamensis at densities of 0.1, 1.0, and 5.0 adults/kg
   wheat (referred to as A/kg) and adult Sitophilus oryzae at densities of
   1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 A/kg were determined in bins filled with 1.5 t wheat
   having 11.0 +/- 0.8, 13.0 +/- 0.6, or 15.0 +/- 0.5\% moisture content at
   20 +/- 1, 25 +/- 1 or 30 +/- 1 degrees C. At each of the five sampled
   locations, wheat was separated into three 15 kg vertical layers and the
   number of adults in each layer was counted.
   Less than 30\% of adult O. surinamensis were recovered in the top layer,
   while more than 80\% of adult S. oryzae were recovered in the top layer.
   Adults of O. surinamensis preferred the center locations in each layer
   and adults of S. oryzae preferred the top layer. Densities of both
   species at adjacent locations in the horizontal direction were
   autocorrelated with each other. The temporal continuous property might
   not exist for the adults of O. surinamensis but exists for the adults of
   S. oryzae. Even though both species had aggregated and clumped
   distribution at any temperature, moisture content and adult density,
   adults of O. surinamensis had a more homogeneous distribution than S.
   oryzae. These characterized patterns of distribution of adult insects
   could be used to effectively estimate their density inside stored
   grain-bins. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a real-time graphic-processor-unit-based search engine
   capable of high-quality peptide identifications in <500 mu s per
   spectrum. The steps of peptide/protein identification, in-silico
   prediction of all possible tryptic peptides from these proteins, and the
   prediction of their expected retention times and m/z values take less
   than 5 s per cycle over similar to 3000 MS/MS spectra. This lays the
   foundation for information-dependent acquisition with exclusion lists
   generated on-the-fly, as the instrument continues to acquire data. While
   a complete evaluation of the dynamic exclusion system requires the
   participation from instrument vendors, we conducted a series of model
   experiments using a whole cell tryptic digestion of the bacterium
   Clostridium thermocellum. We ran a series of five iterative LC-MS/MS
   runs, adding a new exclusion list at each of four chromatographic
   tripping points the elution times of the four standard peptides spiked
   into the sample. Retention times of these standard peptides were also
   used for real-time chromatographic calibration. The dynamic exclusion
   approach gave a similar to 5\% increase in confident protein
   identification (for typical 2 h LC-MS/MS run), and reduced the average
   number of identified peptides per protein from 4.7 to 2.9. Its
   application to a two-times shorter gradient gave a similar to 17\%
   increase in proteins identified. Further improvements are possible for
   instruments with better mass accuracy, by employing a more accurate
   retention prediction algorithm and by developing better understanding of
   the possible chemical modifications and fragmentations produced during
   electrospray ionization.}},

Abstract = {{Heat transfer and dynamic fluid flow have been calculated to predict
   hybrid laser-arc weld pool geometry by establishing a three-dimensional
   numerical model. Based on previous analytical methods, a mathematical
   model and a general procedure are extended for calculating the fraction
   of misoriented stray grains in hybrid laser-arc welds. Solidification
   microstructures in hybrid welds in single-crystal materials are
   evaluated by combining the crystallographic orientation of growing
   dendrites with the solidification front orientation that is derived from
   a geometric model of the dendritic growth pattern. It is shown that
   finer dendrite arm spacing is always found near the solid liquid
   boundary of the top side of the weld or weld root, and the coarsest
   dendritic microstructure occurs in the center of the weld crown. It is
   also found that a higher welding speed and a lower arc current or laser
   power are beneficial to the minimization of stray-grain formation.
   Calculated weld geometries are compared to previous experimental work,
   and calculated dendrite arm spacing agrees reasonably well with the
   experimental result. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Following on from a previously published communication by Guyot and
   Richards (J. Mater. Process. Technol., 2007, 189, (1-3), 162-168) of the
   processing factors affecting the increase in the fraction of special
   boundaries, the present communication attempts to take the relationships
   further by the addition of the factors time and grain size to the
   experimentation. The experimental data were then analysed into three
   equations as a function of the number of cycles (1, 2 and 3). As noted
   previously, simple relationships between the fraction of special
   boundaries F-sp, and the independent variables, temperature, time,
   strain and grain size, were generally not possible, with
   parameter-parameter interactions occurring, as well as single parameter
   relationships. Thus, in general, one can conclude that within one set of
   experimental data, it may be possible to derive F-sp-parameter(s)
   relationships, but an overall understanding of the factors controlling
   the generation of special boundaries by thermomechanical means remains
   very complex.}},

Abstract = {{A method for driving and terminating Holland-Simpson based thin-wire
   models by arbitrary lumped-element circuits is proposed. The approach
   uses the fact that these thin-wire models result in modified
   Telegrapher's equations, and interfacing transmission lines and
   lumped-element circuits is straightforward. The thin-wire voltage and
   current at a circuit/wire junction can be written in terms of circuit
   nodal voltages and branch currents, permitting the circuit solution to
   act as a boundary condition for the thin-wire system. In this work, we
   provide the circuit/wire interfacing conditions and combine circuits
   with Edelvik's Holland-Simpson model that permits thin-wires to be
   arbitrarily oriented within an unstructured mesh. Edelvik's work,
   previously implemented for finite-difference and finite-element
   time-domain solvers is formulated for the finite-volume method.
   Numerical and experimental results for circuit-driven thin-wire antennas

Abstract = {{Recently, network coding has emerged as a new cooperative technique for
   improving network throughputs over traditional routing techniques.
   Network coding allows intermediate nodes to combine packets using an
   algebraic function before forwarding. Selfless cooperation by the
   intermediate nodes is thus implicitly assumed in the network employing
   network coding. Such cooperation in principle should not happen for free
   but for mutual benefits shared by source-destination pairs and the
   cooperating intermediate nodes. Effective resource allocation techniques
   are thus required to efficiently utilize the limited network resources
   at the intermediate nodes. In this article, we propose one such
   effective buffer allocation algorithm, called buffer equalized
   opportunistic network coding (BE-ONC), to dynamically exploit buffer
   spaces at a relay node of a relay-based IEEE 802.11 network. The BE-ONC
   technique combines packets opportunistically based on dynamic buffer
   allocation at the relay. Through simulations, we illustrate that the
   proposed scheme improves over the classical packet scheduling schemes in
   terms of delay and successful packet delivery ratio in a cooperative
   relay-based Wi-Fi network. Our experimental results further confirm the
   potential benefits of BE-ONC in terms of packet delivery ratio, when
   compared with first-in first-out scheduling at the relay node. The
   guidelines for extending our proposed scheme to a more general scenario,
   where more than two users are involved, and the relay is allowed to
   transmit its own packet, are also provided.}},
