This project seeks to perform a basic departmental-level analysis of research output for the University of Alberta Faculty of Engineering. At this point in time, data is sourced via manual download from Web of Science or Scopus in BibTex format. Eventually, I plan to update the code to allow for data collection via the providers' web services. 

In order to use this code, you will need to update the section for reading in downloaded files to reflect the location and names of your BibTex files, as well as the deptUrl value to reflect the source of departmental abbreviations and full names. The "Remove non-UofA addresses" section should be modified to reflect the appropriate institutional affiliation.
