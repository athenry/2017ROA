Abstract = {{Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, in which base
   stations are equipped with a large number of antennas in a
   two-dimensional (2D) antenna array, is one of the most promising
   technologies to improve the spectral efficiency of cellular networks.
   Since there is no channel reciprocity, the frequency-division duplexing
   (FDD) massive MIMO system has to obtain channel state information (CSI)
   with the help of uplink feedback. However, in practice, there are
   several challenges for the implementation of FDD massive MIMO system,
   such as feedback overhead and delay. In this paper, we begin with the
   virtual sectorization using CSI-Reference Signal (RS) beamforming scheme
   to illustrate the implementation of FDD massive MIMO in the standard
   transparent manner, and then we describe the potential performance
   degradation caused by feedback delay. To cope with this issue, we
   propose a historical precoding matrix indicator (PMI) based multi-user
   scheduling algorithm to enhance the system performance. By utilizing
   system-level simulator, we further present the effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic density estimation with vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) can
   facilitate many applications. Traditional density estimation is achieved
   by counting the number of vehicles occupied in a certain area with
   inductive loop detectors and cameras, which is applied over limited
   coverage and brings high cost. In this paper, we propose to fuse vehicle
   spacing information and and compute average spacing in a specific area
   during a short period of time for density estimation. The robustness of
   the proposed scheme against Byzantine attack is then analyzed. Finally,
   we carry our experiments with U.S. Highway 101 data and the results show
   that the average spacing estimation is consistent with the real value.}},

Abstract = {{Most research works of interference alignment (IA) focus on the
   symmetric networks. When the difference of path loss is considered in
   asymmetric networks, topology management (TM) needs to be carefully
   designed for IA-based interference networks, through separating the
   network into an IA subnetwork and some spatial multiplexing (SM)
   subnetworks. Nevertheless, the resource allocation problem has been
   largely ignored in previous works on TM for IA-based networks. In this
   paper, antenna selection (AS) and power allocation (PA) are exploited to
   further improve the performance of IA-based networks. We first apply AS
   technique to the IA subnetwork, through fully utilizing the redundant
   antennas. Then the transmitted power is allocated among the transmitters
   of both the IA and SM subnetworks, to optimize the spectrum efficiency.
   Based on these two techniques, the joint optimization of AS and PA is
   developed through a stepped resource allocation optimization strategy to
   further improve the performance with low computational complexity.
   Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the
   proposed schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Interference alignment (IA) is an emerging technique for interference
   management for multi-user networks. Due to the superposition of signals
   from legitimate users at the eavesdropper, the IA-based network seems to
   be more secure than conventional wireless networks. Nevertheless, when
   adequate antennas are equipped, the legitimate information can still be
   eavesdropped. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the external
   eavesdropper, and propose an artificial noise (AN) scheme for IA-based
   networks without the knowledge of eavesdropper's channel state
   information. In this scheme, a single-stream AN is generated by each
   user, which will disrupt the eavesdropping without introducing any
   additional interference to the legitimate transmission of IA-based
   networks. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of
   the proposed anti-eavesdropping scheme for IA-based networks.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate end user perspectives of four
   existing home access solutions (HAS) and a newly designed experimental
   device (the ARISE). Method: A cross-sectional design was used to
   evaluate the ARISE prototype against other HAS. Specifically,
   participants trialed stairs, a ramp, a platform lift (PL), a stair glide
   and the ARISE, after which they completed questionnaires aimed at
   soliciting their perspectives of these solutions. The time taken by
   participants to use each HAS was also collected. Results: Five HAS
   design features were deemed as important by 90\% of participants: ease
   of use, ability to use independently, reliability, safety and security.
   Time taken to use each HAS from fastest to slowest was: stairs, the
   ARISE, ramp, PL and stair glide. The ARISE prototype was rated as the
   first or second most preferred device by the most number of
   participants, followed by the PL, then the ramp. Conclusions: Results
   from this study provide greater understanding of user perspectives of
   HAS. End user feedback on a novel prototype device has provided valuable
   insight into its usability and function, which should not only guide
   future development of this device, but also provide direction for other
   innovations around home access.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of In-Band Full-Duplexing
   (IBFD) for Broadband Power Line Communication (BB-PLC) systems, to
   potentially double the throughput and spectral efficiency. IBFD
   accomplishes this through simultaneous bidirectional communication over
   the same powerline in the same frequency band, by applying echo
   cancellation (EC) to suppress the interference caused by the
   self-transmitted signal. In light of various EC schemes employed in
   Digital Subscriber Lines, Ethernet, co-axial cables and recently in
   wireless systems, we investigate the specific requirements and
   constraints in BB-PLC, and present solutions for an effective IBFD
   implementation for such systems. We then use our simulated EC gain
   values to examine the overall data rate gains obtained by IBFD under
   different channel attenuations and PLC noise conditions, to determine if
   we truly obtain a 100\% increase in throughput at all conditions.}},

   with evidence in the literature from similar settings, use of Speech
   Recognition Technology (SRT) for patient documentation has shown
   promise. To achieve a user-centred design, the results from a conducted
   ethnographic fieldwork are used to inform SRT features; furthermore,
   exploratory prototyping is used to collect feedback about the wound
   documentation tool from home care nurses. During this study, measures
   developed for healthcare applications of the Technology Acceptance Model
   will be used, to identify SRT features that improve usefulness (e.g.
   increased accuracy, saving time) or ease of use (e.g. lowering
   mental/physical effort, easy to remember tasks). The identified features

Abstract = {{The turbine blade is one of the most critical components of a steam
   turbine. The high thermal loads and large centrifugal forces cause
   extreme stresses on the blade, especially on its root.
   This paper focuses on improving the double-T root of a turbine blade of
   the control stage by decreasing the root's peak equivalent von-Mises
   stress. An 18 \% reduction was achieved in the peak stress by changing
   the convexity of the contact surface between the root and the groove.
   The equivalent von-Mises stress was determined in a static structural
   analysis of a three dimensional finite element model (3D FEM-model)
   using ANSYS Workbench. This numerical model was developed to include one
   blade and the associated part of the shaft, whereas the complete circle
   of blades was considered by applying cyclic symmetry. Furthermore, this
   paper includes a modal analysis comparing the natural frequencies of the
   initial FEM-model with the frequencies of the optimized one. The results
   were established by an investigation of the influence of the FEM-model's
   parameters, its material properties, thermal effects, and an additional
   damping wire in the shroud.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a study that developed crash
   modification (CM) functions for installing left-turn lanes at signalized
   intersection approaches. CM functions were obtained from a longitudinal
   before after safety study that accounted for treatment location
   characteristics (heterogeneity). This approach for developing CM
   functions has several advantages over the commonly used cross-sectional
   evaluations, which have several statistical shortcomings. The developed
   CM functions incorporate a time variable to acknowledge that the safety
   treatment effects do not occur instantaneously but are spread over
   future time; this result was achieved with a nonlinear intervention
   model with the full Bayes method. Twelve treatment sites were selected
   for the evaluation, along with 67 comparison sites. The treatment
   included the addition of one or more LT lanes for each intersection. The
   analysis showed significant safety improvements for fatal-plus-injury
   and total collisions but statistically nonsignificant reductions for
   property-damage-only collisions. The significant covariates included in
   the CM functions were the time trend, total entering volumes, and

Title = {{Conflict-Based Safety Performance Functions for Predicting Traffic
   Collisions by Type}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2583}},
Pages = {{50-55}},
Abstract = {{In road safety analysis, safety performance functions (SPFs) are used to
   predict the average number of collisions per year at a road site. SPFs
   are a function of various amounts of exposure and, in some cases, site
   specific characteristics. Exposure is a measure of opportunities for
   collisions to occur. The circulating traffic volume is commonly adopted
   for this purpose. However, not all vehicles interact unsafely at a road
   site. Alternatively, traffic conflicts may provide a more appropriate
   exposure measure for collisions because they represent only unsafe
   interactions between vehicles. There has been some research on this
   topic, mainly based on aggregated data including all conflict types. In
   this study a stratified analysis was conducted by type of conflict.
   Hence, the main objectives of this research were to establish a
   relationship between predicted collisions and predicted conflicts by
   using an SPF with traffic conflicts as an exposure measure and to
   predict the number of specific types of conflicts and collisions at
   signalized intersections. The methodological framework used was a
   two-phase nested modeling process in which a Poisson gamma SPF that uses
   traffic volume as exposure was used to predict conflicts, which were
   then used in another Poisson gamma SPF to predict collisions. The
   proposed approach was applied to a data set of collision frequency and
   average hourly conflicts for 49 signalized intersections throughout
   British Columbia, Canada. The results demonstrate the proportional
   relationship between conflicts and collisions and the importance of
   carrying out stratified analyses when types of conflicts are combined.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity of interference network is a fundamental issue that eludes
   the researchers for decades. Interference alignment (IA) is an emerging
   interference management technique that is degrees of freedom (DoFs)
   optimal, which means it can approach the capacity of interference
   network at very high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In IA networks, the
   signals are constrained into the same subspaces at the unintended
   receivers through cooperative precoding, and the desired signal can be
   recovered at each receiver by eliminating the aligned interferences
   using decoding matrix. Due to its promising performance in interference
   management, IA has successfully been applied to many kinds of multiuser
   wireless networks with excellent performance. Nevertheless, there are
   still some challenges for the practical utilization of IA, e.g., the
   overhead of channel state information (CSI) feedback, performance
   degradation at low and moderate SNRs, etc. In this review, we provide a
   survey on IA and its applications and discuss some research issues and
   challenges. The dimensions, networks topologies, and applications of IA
   are first introduced. Then some fundamental aspects of IA are discussed,
   including feasibility condition, performance metrics, iterative
   algorithms, and CSI. We also present some recent research issues of
   opportunistic IA, spectrum sharing, green IA, topology management, and
   physical layer security. Finally, some research challenges of IA are
   identified.}},

Journal = {{IEEE COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE LETTERS}},

Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{25-28}},
Month = {{JAN-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) run thousands of parallel threads and
   achieve high Memory Level Parallelism (MLP). To support high Memory
   Level Parallelism, a structure called a Miss-Status Holding Register
   (MSHR) handles multiple in-flight miss requests. When multiple cores
   send requests to the same cache line, the requests are merged into one
   last level cache MSHR entry and only one memory request is sent to the
   Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM). We call this inter-core locality.
   The main reason for inter-core locality is that multiple cores access
   shared read-only data within the same cache line. By prioritizing memory
   requests that have high inter-core locality, more threads resume
   execution. In this paper, we analyze the reason for inter-core locality
   and show that requests with inter-core locality are more critical to
   performance. We propose a GPU DRAM scheduler that exploits information
   about inter-core locality detected at the last level cache MSHRs. For
   high inter-core locality benchmarks this leads to an average 28 percent
   reduction in memory request latency and 11 percent improvement in
   performance.}},

Pages = {{13-38}},
Abstract = {{The delivery of products and services for construction-based businesses
   is increasingly becoming knowledge-driven and information-intensive. The
   proliferation of building information modelling (BIM) has increased
   business opportunities as well as introduced new challenges for the
   architectural, engineering and construction and facilities management
   (AEC/FM) industry. As such, the effective use, sharing and exchange of
   building life cycle information and knowledge management in building
   design, construction, maintenance and operation assumes a position of
   paramount importance. This paper identifies a subset of construction
   management (CM) relevant knowledge for different design conditions of
   building components through a critical, comprehensive review of
   synthesized literature and other information gathering and knowledge
   acquisition techniques. It then explores how such domain knowledge can
   be formalized as ontologies and, subsequently, a query vocabulary in
   order to equip BIM users with the capacity to query digital models of a
   building for the retrieval of useful and relevant domain-specific
   information. The formalized construction knowledge is validated through
   interviews with domain experts in relation to four case study projects.
   Additionally, retrospective analyses of several design conditions are
   used to demonstrate the soundness (realism), completeness, and appeal of
   the knowledge base and query-based reasoning approach in relation to the
   state-of-the-art tools, Solibri Model Checker and Navisworks. The
   knowledge engineering process and the methods applied in this research
   for information representation and retrieval could provide useful
   mechanisms to leverage BIM in support of a number of knowledge intensive
   CM/FM tasks and functions.}},

Abstract = {{In current practice, infrastructure organizations exchange data about

   The core question in this research is ``how to manage these transaction
   specifications? Existing standards focus on the development and not on
   the management of these fransaction specifications in the domain of
   infrastructure management, which emphasizes the motivation to develop a
   web based tool Infrastructure Transaction Management Portal. An
   ontology-based approach was devised to develop the portal using the
   SharePoint platform. The portal was developed based on the knowledge
   represented in the Transaction Domain Ontology built as part of this
   research work. The transaction specification developed for the asset
   inventory and condition assessment reporting was used to demonstrate how
   a fransaction specification can be managed using the proposed portal.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of classifying cells expressing
   different biomarkers. A deep learning based method that can
   automatically localize and count the cells expressing each of the
   different biomarkers is proposed. To classify the cells, a Convolutional
   Neural Network (CNN) was employed. Images of Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
   stained slides that contain these cells were digitally scanned. The
   images were taken from digital scans of IHC stained cervical tissues,
   acquired for a clinical trial. More than 4,500 RGB images of cells were
   used to train the CNN. To evaluate our method, the cells were first
   manually labeled based on the expressing biomarkers. Then we performed
   the classification on 156 randomly selected images of cells that were
   not used in training the CNN. The accuracy of the classification was
   92\% in this preliminary data set. The results have shown that this
   method has a good potential in developing an automatic method for
   immunohistochemical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Collaboration is key for successful delivery of building projects in the
   Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector. Innovative
   project delivery approaches developed over the past two decades envision
   new ways of collaborating and specifically aim at improving the
   performance of and value generated by this key economic sector.
   Collaboration, however, remains an ill-defined and highly amorphous
   concept. This makes it difficult to investigate and consequently develop
   a body of knowledge, which is central to defining a field of expertise
   in this area. The aim of this investigation is to explore the notion of
   an expertise in collaboration in the AEC sector and the implications of
   these innovative project delivery approaches on this expertise. The
   concept of collaboration is developed across five core entities:
   structure, process, agents, artefacts and context. These entities are
   then framed through a critical realist lens to lay the groundwork for a
   body of knowledge of collaboration in the AEC sector. The impact of the
   current shift to these innovative approaches is investigated within this
   framing. The findings set a course of action to develop a body of
   knowledge and a field of expertise on collaboration in the AEC sector.}},

Abstract = {{The web has had a significant impact on our lives. A technology that was
   initially created for sharing documents across the network has evolved
   into a strong medium for developing and distributing software

   industrial and research achievements in software analysis and testing
   techniques geared toward web apps, in the past two decades. We discuss
   static, dynamic, and hybrid analyses approaches, software testing and
   test adequacy techniques, as well as techniques that help developers
   write, analyze and maintain their code. Finally, we present some of the
   current and future challenges and research opportunities ahead in this
   field.}},

Abstract = {{In mobile applications, the amount of memory and bandwidth is
   restricted. Efficient compression of video is essential to provide
   better quality streaming on a mobile device. High efficiency video
   coding (HEVC) standard provide substantial bitrate savings compared with
   the previous standards. The compression efficiency of HEVC has been
   improved by integration of a perceptual video quality metric inside the
   encoder. In the rate distortion optimization process, PSNR-HVS has been
   used to measure distortion for the coding unit mode selection. In this
   paper, we find the optimal Lagrange multiplier based on the quantization
   parameter. Experimental results for various test sequences show the
   compression efficiency of the perceptual HEVC will be improved by
   finding the optimal Lagrange multiplier.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of free-space optical (FSO) communication systems is
   often compromised by atmospheric attenuation and fading effects. One
   effective counter fading technique is the spatial diversity. In this
   paper, an FSO system with spatial diversity is analyzed over correlated
   lognormal fading channels that may have nonidentical variance. We use a
   novel lognormal-Nakagami composite channel model to reveal the
   asymptotic behaviors of the correlated lognormal fading channels. We
   discover that the correlation among the lognormal channels can impose
   large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) penalty when compared to the same
   system with independent lognormal channels. This property is not shared
   with the other commonly used fading channels. In addition, we also
   derive a compact expression for the asymptotic relative diversity order
   (ARDO) between an L branch maximal ratio combing system over correlated
   lognormal channels and a single branch system. It is found that the ARDO
   is related to the number of diversity branches as well as entry-wise
   norm of the covariance matrix of the logarithm of the lognormal channel
   states.}},

Abstract = {{Existing works use power correlation matrix to quantify the correlation
   between Nakagami-m fading channels. However, the power correlation
   matrix cannot uniquely determine the joint probability density function

   correlation between the Nakagami-m random variables is defined using the
   correlation matrix of the accompanying Gaussian random variables, and
   thus the joint probability density function of the Nakagami-m variables
   can be uniquely determined. We propose closed-form and asymptotically
   tight upper and lower bounds for error rates and outage probabilities of
   maximum-ratio combining and selection combining over arbitrarily
   correlated Nakagami-m fading channels. Analytical results and Monte
   Carlo simulation illustrate that power correlation of Nakagami-m
   channels cannot uniquely determine the performance of diversity
   receptions over Nakagami-m fading channels.}},

Title = {{Respiratory rate and pulse oximetry derived information as predictors of
   hospital admission in young children in Bangladesh: a prospective

Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Hypoxaemia is a strong predictor of mortality in children.
   Early detection of deteriorating condition is vital to timely
   intervention. We hypothesise that measures of pulse oximetry dynamics
   may identify children requiring hospitalisation. Our aim was to develop
   a predictive tool using only objective data derived from pulse oximetry
   and observed respiratory rate to identify children at increased risk of
   hospital admission.
   Setting: Tertiary-level hospital emergency department in Bangladesh.
   Participants: Children under 5 years (n=3374) presenting at the facility
   (October 2012-A pril 2013) without documented chronic diseases were
   recruited. 1-minute segments of pulse oximetry (photoplethysmogram
   (PPG), blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and heart rate (HR)) and
   respiratory rate were collected with a mobile app.
   Primary outcome: The need for hospitalisation based on expert physician
   review and follow-up.
   Methods: Pulse rate variability (PRV) using pulse peak intervals of the
   PPG signal and features extracted from the SpO(2) signal, all derived
   from pulse oximetry recordings, were studied. A univariate age-adjusted
   logistic regression was applied to evaluate differences between admitted
   and non-admitted children. A multivariate logistic regression model was
   developed using a stepwise selection of predictors and was internally
   validated using bootstrapping.
   Results: Children admitted to hospital showed significantly (p<0.01)
   decreased PRV and higher SpO(2) variability compared to non-admitted
   children. The strongest predictors of hospitalisation were reduced
   PRV-power in the low frequency band (OR associated with a 0.01 unit
   increase, 0.93; 95\% CI 0.89 to 0.98), greater time spent below an
   SpO(2) of 98\% and 94\% (OR associated with 10 s increase, 1.4; 95\% CI
   1.3 to 1.4 and 1.5; 95\% CI 1.4 to 1.6, respectively), high respiratory
   rate, high HR, low SpO(2), young age and male sex. These variables
   provided a bootstrap-corrected AUC of the receiver operating
   characteristic of 0.76.
   Conclusions: Objective measurements, easily obtained using a mobile
   device in low-resource settings, can predict the need for
   hospitalisation. External validation will be required before clinical
   adoption.}},

Abstract = {{There are severe limitations that photoconductive (PC) terahertz (THz)
   antennas experience due to Joule heating and ohmic losses, which cause
   premature device breakdown through thermal runaway. In response, this
   work introduces PC THz antennas utilizing textured InP semiconductors.
   These textured InP semiconductors exhibit high surface recombination
   properties and have shortened carrier lifetimes which limit residual
   photocurrents in the picoseconds following THz pulse emission-ultimately
   reducing Joule heating and ohmic losses. Fine-and coarse-textured InP
   semiconductors are studied and compared to a smooth-textured InP
   semiconductor, which provides a baseline. The surface area ratio
   (measuring roughness) of the smooth-, fine-, and coarse-textured InP
   semiconductors is resolved through a computational analysis of SEM
   images and found as 1.0 +/- 0.1, 2.9 +/- 0.4, and 4.3 +/- 0.6,
   respectively. The carrier lifetimes of the smooth-, fine-, and
   coarse-textured InP semiconductors are found as respective values of 200
   +/- 6, 100 +/- 10, and 20 +/- 3 ps when measured with a pump-probe
   experimental system. The emitted THz electric fields and corresponding
   consumption of photocurrent are measured with a THz experimental setup.
   The temporal and spectral responses of PC THz antennas made with each of
   the textured InP semiconductors are found to be similar; however, the
   consumption of photocurrent (relating to Joule heating and ohmic losses)
   is greatly diminished for the semiconductors that are textured. The
   findings of this work can assist in engineering of small-scale PC THz
   antennas for high-power operation, where they are extremely vulnerable
   to premature device breakdown through thermal runaway.}},

Abstract = {{A new encoder for radio frequency switch-mode power amplifiers is
   described. The encoder is designed for a transmitter architecture that
   uses envelope delta-sigma modulation (ESDM) and a direct conversion
   transmitter architecture. The ESDM is modified to include a dither
   signal that shapes the out-of-band spectrum while simultaneously
   maintaining good SNDR. The out-of-band dither can also be used to
   improve the power efficiency of the switch-mode power amplifier by
   rectifying the dither signal to recycle power. The encoder is designed
   to be implemented in a FPGA. Simulation and experimental results with an
   LTE modulated carrier are shown to demonstrate the concept.}},

Title = {{Low SNR Uplink CFO Estimation for Energy Efficient IoT Using LTE}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{3936-3950}},
Abstract = {{Machine Type Communications (MTC) is one of the prominent solutions to
   enable the Internet of Things (IoT). With a large number of IoT
   applications envisioned over the cellular network, the Third Generation
   Partnership Project (3GPP) has initiated the support for MTC in the Long
   Term Evolution (LIE)/LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) standards. A significant
   portion of the MTC devices is expected to be low-complexity and
   low-power User Equipment (UE), requiring an energy efficient mode of
   operation. In addition, many such UEs can be located in the regions of
   low network coverage. In this paper, we show that an accurate estimation
   and compensation of the residual carrier frequency offset (CFO) at the
   base-station (eNB) results in a reduction in energy consumption for MTC
   devices in low coverage. For robust and accurate CFO estimation in low
   coverage, we propose a Maximum Likelihood (ML) based CFO estimation
   technique that works for data and/or pilot repetitions in Ll'E/LTE-A
   uplink. Through simulations, we illustrate that our technique shows a
   significant performance improvement over the conventional CFO estimation
   technique using the phase angle of the correlation between the repeated
   data. We determine that residual CFO estimation and compensation at the
   eNB results in 22.5\%-55.2\% reduction in energy consumption of the MTC
   devices, when compared to the case without CFO compensation.}},

Abstract = {{Mathematical programming models have been used to optimize the design
   and management of forest bioenergy supply chains. A deterministic
   mathematical model is beneficial for making optimum decisions; however,
   its applicability to real-world problems may be limited because it does
   not capture all the complexities, including uncertainties in the
   parameters, in the supply chain. In this paper, a combination of Monte
   Carlo Simulation and optimization model is used to evaluate the impact
   of uncertainty in biomass quality, availability and cost, and
   electricity prices on the supply chain of a forest biomass power plant.
   The optimizationime steps over a 1-year planning horizon. Variability in
   biomass quality, i.e model is a deterministic mixed integer non-linear
   model with monthly t. moisture content (MC) and higher heating value
   (HHV), based on the historical data of a real case study is studied in
   detail and fitted probability distributions are used in the model, while
   for electricity prices different scenarios are considered. The results
   show that the impact of variability in the MC on profit is higher than
   that of uncertainty in HHV. It is observed that the annual profit ranges
   between \$13.3 million and \$17.9 million in the presence of all
   possible uncertainties while its average is \$15.5 million. Uncertainty
   in biomass availability and cost and electricity price results in the
   risks of having annual profit of less than \$14 million and low monthly
   storage levels.}},

Abstract = {{The successful use of anaerobic reactors for bioremediation of acid mine
   drainage has been shown in systems with neutral pH. However, the choice
   of an efficient and suitable process for such wastewater must consider
   the capability of operating at acidic pH and in the presence of metals.
   This work studies the performance of an anaerobic batch reactor, under
   conditions of varying initial pH for its efficiencies in sulfate removal
   and metal precipitation from synthetic acid mine drainage. The chemical
   oxygen demand/sulfate (COD/SO42-) ratio used was 1.00, with ethanol
   chosen as the only energy and carbon source. The initial pH of the
   synthetic drainage was progressively set from 7.0 to 4.0 to make it as
   close as possible to that of real acid mine drainage. Metals were also
   added starting with iron, zinc, and finally copper. The effectiveness of
   sulfate and COD removal from the synthetic acid mine drainage increased
   as the initial pH was reduced. The sulfate removal increased from 38.5
   +/- 3.7\% to 52.2 +/- 3\%, while the removal of organic matter started
   at 91.7 +/- 2.4\% and ended at 99 +/- 1\%. These results indicate that
   the sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) community adapted to lower pH
   values. The metal removal observed was 88 +/- 7\% for iron, 98.0 +/-
   0.5\% for zinc and 99 +/- 1\% for copper. At this stage, an increase in
   the sulfate removal was observed, which reaches up to 82.2 +/- 5.8\%.
   The kinetic parameters for sulfate removal were 0.22 +/- 0.04 h(-1) with
   Fe, 0.26 +/- 0.04 h(-1) with Fe and Zn and 0.44 +/- 0.04 h(-1) with Fe,
   Zn, and Cu.}},

   ageing in MOSFET devices}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{34}},
Pages = {{8104-8110}},
Abstract = {{Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) is one of the main ageing
   processes in MOSFET devices, and it is related among others to H
   diffusion within the SiO2 dielectric layer of the device. In this work
   we use molecular simulations to study the underlying mechanism that
   governs the diffusion of H within SiO2, and suggest how to modify the
   material to decrease it. The computed diffusion activation energies are
   in excellent agreement with existing experimental data, and the analysis
   of the diffusion paths reveals a H hopping mechanism governed by the
   same orientational constraints as proton exchange in bulk water. Based
   on this mechanism, we test a hypothetical NBTI ageing retarding
   modification based on a mechanical deformation of the SiO2 dielectric.
   Stretching of the material induces a rearrangement of the silicate
   units, increasing the O-O distance, and consequently the activation
   energy required for H diffusion. Hence, stretching of the semiconductor
   during the MOSFET manufacturing process could reduce significantly the
   NBTI-driven ageing of the devices.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a disposable inkjet dispenser platform
   technology and demonstrate the Lab-on-a-Printer concept, an extension of
   the ubiquitous Lab-on-a-Chip concept, whereby microfluidic modules are
   directly integrated into the printhead. The concept is demonstrated here
   through the integration of an inkjet dispenser and a microfluidic mixer
   enabling control over droplet composition from a single nozzle in
   real-time during printing. The inkjet dispenser is based on a modular
   design platform that enables the low-cost microfluidic component and the
   more expensive actuation unit to be easily separated, allowing for the
   optional disposal of the former and reuse of the latter. To limit
   satellite droplet formation, a hydrophobic-coated and tapered
   micronozzle was microfabricated and integrated with the fluidics to
   realize the dispenser. The microfabricated devices generated droplets
   with diameters ranging from 150-220 mu m, depending mainly on the
   orifice diameter, with printing rates up to 8000 droplets per second.
   The inkjet dispenser is capable of dispensing materials with a viscosity
   up to similar to 19 mPa s. As a demonstration of the inkjet dispenser
   function and application, we have printed type I collagen seeded with
   human liver carcinoma cells (cell line HepG2), to form patterned
   biological structures.}},

Abstract = {{Optical wireless (OW) technologies are an emerging field utilizing
   optical sources to replace existing radio wavelength technologies. The
   vast majority of work in OW focuses on communication; however, one
   smaller emerging field is indoor OW positioning. This emerging field
   essentially aims to replace GPS indoors. One of the primary competing
   methods in indoor OW positioning is angle-of-arrival (AOA). AOA
   positioning uses the received vectors from several optical beacons to
   triangulate its position. The reliability of this triangulation is
   fundamentally based on two aspects: the geometry of the optical
   receiver's location compared to the optical beacon locations, and the
   ability for the optical receiver to resolve the incident vectors
   correctly. The optical receiver is quantified based on the standard
   deviation of the azimuthal and polar angles that define the measured
   vector. The quality of the optical beacon geometry is quantified using
   dilution of precision (DOP). This proceeding discusses the AOA standard
   deviation of an ultra-wide field-of-view (FOV) lens along with the DOP
   characteristics for several optical beacon geometries. The optical
   beacon geometries used were simple triangle, square, and hexagon optical
   beacon geometries. To assist the implementation of large optical beacon
   geometries it is proposed to use both frequency and wavelength division
   multiplexing. It is found that with an ultra-wide FOV lens, coupled with
   the appropriately sized optical beacon geometry, allow for high accuracy
   positioning over a large area. The results of this work will enable
   reliable OW positioning deployments.}},

   by absorbing excess blood and covering the wound. In this study, we
   propose a type of medical dressing using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
   membrane with significant potential to improve wound healing conditions.
   A thin soft Janus PDMS film with opposing porous and nonporous faces is
   fabricated and tested for qualities applicable to improve current
   bandages, such as the porosity, stretchability, and water-wettability.
   The PDMS film can be stretched to 150\% of its original length to allow
   the bending of fingers or joints. The nonporous face of the PDMS film
   provides a natural waterproofing barrier against intrusion by microbes
   and contaminants. The porous face of the bandage with pore size between
   100 mm and 400 mm provides abundant void space for the preloading of
   pharmaceuticals and allows a relatively quick drug release (over 50\% in
   5 min, over 80\% in 30 min), while simultaneously improving water vapor
   permeability. Blood absorbed could be distributed within the film's pore
   network, reducing the chances of forming a large clot and hardened scab
   that may break the wound bed upon removal. All these improvements
   demonstrate that the Janus PDMS film will provide the performance needs
   as a new bandage for wound care.}},

Title = {{Demand-Sensitive Candidate Route Generation Algorithm}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2541}},
Pages = {{10-17}},
Abstract = {{Demand satisfaction is a key component that reflects the quality of
   public transit from the passenger's perspective, whereas cost
   minimization is considered a main objective of transit agencies. This
   trade-off between quality and cost turns transit network design into a
   multiobjective problem in which the interests of passengers and
   operators conflict. Transit network design involves the determination of
   various design elements, such as route alignments and stop locations,
   which are essential to serve transit demand within a particular area.
   The design of a transit network typically starts with the generation of
   a set of potential routes through the use of a candidate route
   generation algorithm. Existing route generation algorithms find the
   shortest path between a route's origin and destination. Demand is
   aggregated without proper attention given to its pattern and
   distribution along the generated route. Given that demand actually is
   scattered along the transit route, the aggregate demand assumption is
   considered a major drawback of existing route generation algorithms. In
   an attempt to fill the highlighted gap in current practice, this paper
   presents a novel demand-sensitive candidate route generation algorithm
   that can address passenger and operator needs in a simple, objective
   function that aims to maximize route-level ridership. The proposed
   approach is well suited to small and rural communities and specialized
   transit services (e.g., flex route, demand responsive service) in which
   transit demand is dispersed.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to conduct a time-series
   (before-to-after) evaluation of the safety performance of a sample of
   locations that have been improved under the Insurance Corporation of
   British Columbia (ICBC) Road Improvement Program. The program started in
   1989 when ICBC established partnerships with local road authorities in
   British Columbia, Canada, and works cooperatively to make sound
   investments in road safety improvements. The overall effectiveness of
   the road improvement program was assessed by determining whether the
   frequency or severity of collisions at the improvement sites has been
   reduced after implementation of the improvement, and by quantifying the
   program costs versus the economic safety benefits to determine the
   return on ICBC's road safety investment. Seventy-two urban intersections
   were included in the evaluation. The methodology adopted for estimating
   the safety benefits was a before-after study with the full Bayesian
   method, while the benefit-cost analysis was carried out by using two
   indicators: net present value and benefit-cost ratio (B/C) with a
   payback period of 5 years. Overall, the total reductions of severe
   (fatal plus injury) and nonsevere (property damage only) collision
   frequency for intersections with new pedestrian signal installations
   were found equal to -24.54\% and -6.21\%, respectively; -22.95\% and
   -10.78\%, respectively, for intersections with geometric design
   improvements; and -13.76\% and -5.04\%, respectively, for intersections
   with traffic signal upgrades. Finally, an overall B/C ratio of 4.32:1
   was achieved.}},

Title = {{Modeled Effects of Traffic Fleet Composition on the Toxicity of Volatile
   Organic Compound Emissions}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2570}},
Pages = {{118-126}},
Abstract = {{Motor vehicle emissions include many different compounds that have
   different levels of toxicity in humans. Volatile organic compounds
   (VOCs) are components of motor vehicle emissions with varying effects on
   human health and cancer risks. Proportional emission rates among
   compounds can vary substantially by vehicle and fuel type. This study
   addressed the question of how traffic fleet composition affects the
   toxicity of VOC emissions. Using inhalation unit risk estimates from the
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, VOC risk profiles were quantified
   for vehicle fuel type combinations, light-duty and heavy-duty vehicle
   fleets, and roadway facility types (on-network and off-network). Of 14
   modeled VOCs, formaldehyde, benzene, naphthalene, and 1,3-butadiene
   contribute most to the cumulative risk of vehicle emissions.
   Formaldehyde and naphthalene are mainly emitted by diesel vehicles;
   benzene and 1,3-butadiene are mainly emitted by gasoline vehicles.
   Cumulative VOC risk generated per on-network vehicle mile is four times
   higher for a gasoline heavy-duty vehicle and eight times higher for a
   diesel heavy-duty vehicle than for a gasoline light-duty vehicle.
   Off-network, cumulative VOC risk generated per vehicle is twice as high
   for gasoline heavy-duty vehicles as for diesel heavy-duty vehicles or
   gasoline light-duty vehicles. A case study of lane management strategies
   demonstrated how traffic management can change a VOC emissions risk
   profile and that changes in VOC emissions risk are different from
   changes in VOC emissions mass.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an automatic localization method for a standard
   hand-held needle in ultrasound based on temporal motion analysis of
   spatially decomposed data. Subtle displacement arising from tremor
   motion has a periodic pattern which is usually imperceptible in the
   intensity image but may convey information in the phase image. Our
   method aims to detect such periodic motion of a hand-held needle and
   distinguish it from intrinsic tissue motion, using a technique inspired
   by video magnification. Complex steerable pyramids allow specific design
   of the wavelets' orientations according to the insertion angle as well
   as the measurement of the local phase. We therefore use steerable pairs
   of even and odd Gabor wavelets to decompose the ultrasound B mode
   sequence into various spatial frequency bands. Variations of the local
   phase measurements in the spatially decomposed input data is then
   temporally analyzed using a finite impulse response bandpass filter to
   detect regions with a tremor motion pattern. Results obtained from
   different pyramid levels are then combined and thresholded to generate
   the binary mask input for the Hough transform, which determines an
   estimate of the direction angle and discards some of the outliers.
   Polynomial fitting is used at the final stage to remove any remaining
   outliers and improve the trajectory detection. The detected needle is
   finally added back to the input sequence as an overlay of a cloud of
   points. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to detect the
   needle using subtle tremor motion in an agar phantom and in-vivo porcine
   cases where intrinsic motion is also present. The localization accuracy
   was calculated by comparing to expert manual segmentation, and presented
   in (mean, standard deviation and root-mean-square error) of (0.93, 1.26
   and 0.87) and (1.53 mm, 1.02 mm and 1.82 mm) for the trajectory and the

Abstract = {{An implicit finite volume solver is developed for the steady-state
   solution of generalised Newtonian fluids on unstructured meshes in 2D.
   The pseudo-compressibility technique is employed to couple the
   continuity and momentum equations by transforming the governing
   equations into a hyperbolic system. A second-order accurate spatial
   discretisation is provided by performing a least-squares gradient
   reconstruction within each control volume of unstructured meshes. A
   central flux function is used for the convective terms and a solution
   jump term is added to the averaged component for the viscous terms.
   Global implicit time-stepping using successive evolution-relaxation is
   utilised to accelerate the convergence to steady-state solutions. The
   performance of our flow solver is examined for power-law and
   Carreau-Yasuda non-Newtonian fluids in different geometries. The effects
   of model parameters and Reynolds number are studied on the convergence
   rate and flow features. Our results verify second-order accuracy of the
   discretisation and also fast and efficient convergence to the
   steady-state solution for a wide range of flow variables.}},

Abstract = {{The Shanghai Tower is one of the super-tall buildings under construction
   in the world and will be the tallest structure in China after
   completion. The building stands approximately 632 m and has 128 stories.
   It was designed with a double curtain wall system, where a triangular
   outer facade gradually shrinks and twists clockwise at approximately 120
   degrees along the height of the building. On May 8th, 2015, an Ambient
   Vibration testing was performed on the building in its final stages of
   construction by a collaborative team from the University of British
   Columbia and Tongji University. The full-scale test had several purposes
   that included the evaluation of the current instrumentation techniques
   and the identification of the dynamic properties of the tower. A set of
   seven GPS-timed velocity/acceleration recorders was utilized, where two
   measurements were taken on almost every 15 floors in each setup. This
   paper presents the signal processing results by using the Frequency
   Domain Decomposition (FDD) and the Enhanced Frequency Domain
   Decomposition (EFDD) techniques. The most significant lateral and
   torsional mode shapes and associated periods of vibration were
   determined within the frequency range of 0.1-2 Hz. The results will
   provide useful information for further finite element model update.}},

   of this goal, an ambient vibration test was carried out on the bridge in
   September 2014 in order to update/calibrate the finite element model of
   the bridge in SAP2000. The updated model will then used to assess the
   seismic performance of the bridge in accordance with the Canadian

Abstract = {{Measuring workers' performance and the level of motivation is of
   paramount importance as the productivity of workers at a workplace
   primarily depends upon their level of motivation. However, measuring the
   level of workers' motivation at workplace is not always straightforward
   because the workers' motivation is a function of various personal and
   external factors. This paper proposes a fuzzy rule-based model for
   evaluating the motivation level of construction workers using their
   working patterns. The motivation level evaluated using the fuzzy
   rule-based model was compared with motivational levels determined by the
   traditional Vroom's expectancy theory or
   Expectancy-Instrumentality-Valence (EIV) method. EIV method used
   questionnaire surveys and interviews to determine workers' motivation.
   The results of fuzzy rule-based models aligned closely with the EIV
   model, especially for the middle range of motivation levels. Compared to
   traditional EIV model, the fuzzy rule-based system is simple to
   implement and found to be very pragmatic in construction field settings.}},

Pages = {{377-394}},
Abstract = {{This article presents an approach for studying different aspects of
   traffic safety at roundabouts. An automated safety analysis framework is
   used to detect different types of traffic conflicts, as well as the
   inappropriate negotiations and the gap acceptance behavior of drivers.
   To test the validity of the proposed method, a case study is used for a
   roundabout in Doha, Qatar. Seven types of traffic conflicts are studied
   and their severity is identified using the time-to-collision conflict
   indicator. Four common types of driver inappropriate negotiations
   behavior are also investigated. The analysis shows that most of the
   inappropriate negotiations and traffic conflicts are due to drivers'
   poor lane discipline that can be partially attributed to the poor lane
   marking. Gap acceptance behavior is also studied by identifying lead,
   lag, and total gaps. The traffic conflicts, inappropriate negotiations,
   and gap acceptance results are validated by a comparison with manual
   observations. The results of the validation process show the viability
   of the automated approach that produces acceptable results with less
   time and effort. Moreover, the data collected using this approach
   provides further insights on roundabout safety evaluation and has the
   potential for use in the assessment of roundabout design.}},

Title = {{Original Symbol Phase Rotated Secure Transmission Against Powerful
   Massive MIMO Eavesdropper}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{3016-3025}},
Abstract = {{Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has been extensively
   studied and considered as a key enabling technology for the fifth
   generation (5G) wireless communication systems, due to its potential to
   achieve high energy efficiency and spectral efficiency. As the concept
   of massive MIMO becomes more popular, it is plausible that the
   eavesdroppers will also employ massive antennas, which may remarkably
   enhance their ability to intercept the information. In this paper,
   motivated by the need to protect against the eavesdroppers equipped with
   powerful large antenna arrays, which has received scarce attention in
   the literature, a physical layer security approach called original
   symbol phase rotated (OSPR) secure transmission scheme is proposed to
   defend against eavesdroppers armed with unlimited antennas. The basic
   idea of the proposed OSPR scheme is to randomly rotate the phase of
   original symbols at the base station (BS) before they are transmitted,
   so that the massive MIMO eavesdropper will be confused by the
   intercepted signals, which may not represent the true information
   symbols. However, the legitimate users are able to infer the correct
   phase rotations and take proper inverse operations to recover the
   original symbols. We show that when the BS has a large enough, but
   finite number of antennas, the proposed OSPR scheme can achieve a
   considerable security performance in that the eavesdropper is unable to
   recover most of the original symbols, even with unlimited antennas. The
   process and the security performance of the proposed OSPR scheme are
   presented in detail. Simulation results are provided to further
   corroborate that the proposed OSPR scheme is a potential green secure
   transmission candidate technique for the future wireless networks.}},

Abstract = {{Growing industrial demand for faster machine tools, makes feed-rate and
   trajectory optimization a challenging problem in machining processes.
   One of the most challenging machining operations for computer
   numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools is corner tracking. In this
   scenario, most of the conventional feed-rate optimization approaches
   sacrifice speed for accuracy. This paper, proposes a new feed-rate and
   trajectory optimization algorithm for CNC machines. At each corner of
   the trajectory, the presented algorithm regenerates the trajectory,
   using a circular move within a desired tolerance limit. Then, a new feed
   rate optimization method is employed, which enables the machine tool to
   travel at the maximum feasible velocity through the corners, while
   taking acceleration constraints into account. Experimental results for
   different desired tolerances indicate that the new algorithm achieves
   significantly shorter travel times than the theoretical minimum time
   trajectory with zero tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we present a method for cell culture on a digital
   microfluidic (DMF) platform. Dielectrophoresis is used for trapping and
   patterning cells encapsulated within a 3D gelatin methacrylate (GelMA)
   hydrogel. In this method, planar traps are patterned within the
   electrodes on the DMF chip. Dispersed HEK 293 cells in GelMA solution
   are used to show negative dielectrophoresis when subject to a voltage at
   20 kHz. The effects of the cell concentration, trap area, and trap
   spacing are analyzed. The rise time for patterning cells is shown to be
   rapid, from 8.5 seconds to 198.3 seconds for 50 mu m and 500 mm diameter
   traps, respectively. The number of cells trapped was significantly
   influenced by the trap diameter and cell concentration. Live/dead
   assayed cells under a fluorescence microscope indicated that clusters of
   HEK 293 cells are 66\% viable after 4 days of culturing. Certain trap
   designs were 78\% viable on average after 4 days. This platform can be
   applied to execute quantitative, automated cell behavior studies and
   drug tests on the array of cells in vitro.}},

Abstract = {{Recent extreme events have shown that total protection can not be
   accomplished. Therefore, Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)
   strategies should focus not only on the prevention of these events but
   also on the response and recovery following them. This shift in CIP
   strategies has put more interest on the concept of infrastructure
   resilience. In this paper, we address the problem of assessing critical
   infrastructure resilience. We first define the infrastructure attributes
   that make it resilient. Then, we propose a modeling framework to capture
   these attributes. After that, a resilience index is introduced to
   quantify the resilience of infrastructure systems. Finally, the
   usefulness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through an
   illustrative example.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{469-487}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a structure-altering feature-based editing scheme
   for triangle mesh models of primitives for engineering application. With
   the increasing usage of 3D scanning and 3D printing technologies in
   product design, triangle mesh has become a vital model format in
   engineering designs. Coupled with its flexible nature in shape
   manipulation, many design models are now constructed in a mesh form.
   However, methods to perform direct feature-based mesh model
   modifications are lacking. Editing features and their defining
   parameters is greatly underdeveloped for mesh models compared with their
   parametric model counterparts. Thus, the proposed scheme aims to enable
   structure-altering feature-based mesh editing through the imposition
   (mapping) of a feature information layer on top of the triangle mesh
   model. Feature-based editing is done on the feature information layer.
   Through information mapping, the mesh model adapts to changes in the
   feature information layer, resulting in a geometric representation that
   accurately reflects the feature information layer content. Large-scale
   model modifications with structure-altering edits are thus achievable
   for mesh models, allowing straightforward feature-based model editing
   without the loss of the flexible mesh representation. Numerous case
   studies have been done to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented
   feature-based editing scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Following the development of microfluidic systems, there has been a high
   tendency towards developing lab-on-a-chip devices for biochemical
   applications. A great deal of effort has been devoted to improve and
   advance these devices with the goal of performing complete sets of
   biochemical assays on the device and possibly developing portable
   platforms for point of care applications. Among the different
   microfluidic systems used for such a purpose, digital microfluidics
   (DMF) shows high flexibility and capability of performing multiplex and
   parallel biochemical operations, and hence, has been considered as a
   suitable candidate for lab-on-a-chip applications. In this review, we
   discuss the most recent advances in the DMF platforms, and evaluate the
   feasibility of developing multifunctional packages for performing
   complete sets of processes of biochemical assays, particularly for
   point-of-care applications. The progress in the development of DMF
   systems is reviewed from eight different aspects, including device
   fabrication, basic fluidic operations, automation, manipulation of
   biological samples, advanced operations, detection, biological
   applications, and finally, packaging and portability of the DMF devices.
   Success in developing the lab-on-achip DMF devices will be concluded
   based on the advances achieved in each of these aspects.}},

Abstract = {{In traditional photoacoustic tomography, external illumination is used
   to excite acoustic waves. However, with the assistance of
   fibre-transmitted light, multidirectional illumination or internal
   illumination can be achieved which can obtain a better image at a deeper
   depth. Laser pulses delivered by fibre are energy-limited by the fibre
   core size and damage threshold. To increase the amplitude of
   photoacoustic waves and their penetration, it is necessary to improve
   the fibre coupling energy and efficiency. To improve the coupling
   performance of single fibres, we use a cylindrical lens array to
   homogenize the incident beam before a coupling lens. Simulation in Zemax
   shows that this approach flattens the beam profile on the front surface
   of the fibre, decreasing the risk of fibre damage. Experimental results
   with fibre core diameters of 1mm and 1.5mm show that both types of fibre
   can output more than 50mJ energy per pulse at 700nm wavelength. The
   coupling efficiency is measured to be above 70\% and even reaches 90\%
   as the wavelength changes from 675nm to 900nm. This improvement of
   coupling energy in single fibres will benefit photoacoustic tomography
   applications using internal illumination.}},

   based on which direction they arrive at the transducer. Most PA image
   reconstruction methods assume that sensors have omni-directional
   response; however, in practice, the sensors show higher sensitivity to
   the ultrasonic waves coming from one specific direction. In DPARS, the
   sensitivity of the transducer to incoming waves from different
   directions are considered. Thus, the DPARS algorithm takes into account
   the relative location of the absorbers with respect to the transducers,
   and generates a linear system of equations to solve for the distribution
   of absorbers. The numerical conditioning and computing times are
   improved by the use of a sparse Discrete Fourier Transform (DCT)
   representation of the distribution of absorption coefficients. Our
   simulation results show that DPARS outperforms the conventional
   Delay-and-Sum reconstruction method in terms of CNR and RMS errors.
   Experimental results confirm that DPARS provides images with higher
   resolution than DAS.}},

   microstructure for different welding scenarios. Here, an integrated

   precipitates, austenite grain growth and austenite decomposition into
   ferrite and bainite. Microstructure maps showing the fraction of
   transformation products as a function of distance from the fusion line
   are obtained and used to compare the effect of different welding

Abstract = {{Optical wireless communications (OWC) offers the potential for
   high-speed and mobile operation in indoor networks. Such OWC systems
   often employ a fixed transmitter grid and mobile transceivers, with the
   mobile transceivers carrying out bi-directional communication via active
   downlinks (ideally with high-speed signal detection) and passive uplinks
   (ideally with broad angular retroreflection and high-speed modulation).
   It can be challenging to integrate all of these bidirectional
   communication capabilities within the mobile transceivers, however, as
   there is a simultaneous desire for compact packaging. With this in mind,
   the work presented here introduces a new form of transceiver for
   bi-directional OWC systems. The transceiver incorporates radial
   photoconductive switches (for high-speed signal detection) and a
   spherical retro-modulator (for broad angular retroreflection and
   high-speed all-optical modulation). All-optical retromodulation are
   investigated by way of theoretical models and experimental testing, for
   spherical retro-modulators comprised of three glasses, N-BK7, N-LASF9,
   and S-LAH79, having differing levels of refraction and nonlinearity. It
   is found that the spherical retro-modulator comprised of S-LAH79, with a
   refractive index of n approximate to 2 and a Kerr nonlinear index of
   n(2) approximate to (1.8 +/- 0.1) x 10(-15) cm(2)/W, yields both broad
   angular retroreflection (over a solid angle of 2 pi steradians) and
   ultrafast modulation (over a duration of 120 fs). Such transceivers can
   become important elements for all-optical implementations in future
   bi-directional OWC systems.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic circuit designers commonly start their design process with a
   schematic, namely an abstract representation of the physical circuit. In
   integrated photonics on the other hand, it is very common for the design
   to begin at the physical component level. In order to build large

   schematic-driven approach. This includes simulations based on
   schematics. schematic-driven layout, layout versus schematic
   verification. and post-layout simulations. This paper describes such a
   design framework implemented using Mentor Graphics and Lumerical

   photonics related to manufacturing, and how these can be taken into

Abstract = {{Silicon photonics is a scalable, cost-effective technology for the
   production of photonic integrated circuits (PICs). The emergence of
   silicon photonics as a dominant technology for PICs is largely because
   it leverages decades of investment in design and fabrication
   technologies for electronic integrated circuits. However, the
   lithography requirements for photonic and electronic components are
   importantly different: geometries are generally curved; sidewall
   roughness is critically important; and, while the feature sizes are
   generally much larger, photonic device performance can be
   extraordinarily sensitive to the precise final geometry. For example,
   rounding of 90 degree corners in y-branches or multimode interferometers
   can have a dramatic impact on performance. The use of optical proximity
   correction (OPC) can greatly reduce these problems but does not
   eliminate them altogether. The designer is therefore faced with the
   problem of potentially optimizing a component using highly accurate
   numerical simulations that cannot be manufactured to the desired
   geometry, leading to a discrepancy between desired and actual
   performance. To solve this problem, we present a method for designing
   and optimizing photonic components that are lithography friendly so that
   the simulated geometry can be readily manufactured. As an example, we
   consider the case of waveguide Bragg gratings which are particularly
   challenging to manufacture by lithography.}},

Abstract = {{Individual units of donated red blood cells (RBCs) do not ordinarily
   undergo analytical testing prior to transfusion. This study establishes
   the utility of Raman spectroscopy for analyzing the biochemistry of
   stored RBC supernatant and reveals interesting storage-related changes
   about the accumulation of lactate, a chemical species that may be
   harmful to certain patients. The data show measurable variations in
   supernatant composition and demonstrate that some units of donated RBCs
   accumulate lactate much more readily than others. The spectra also
   indicate a higher relative concentration of lactate in units collected
   from male donors than female donors (p = 0.004) and imply that there is
   a greater degree of variability at later stages of storage in units from
   older male donors (>45 years). The study proves that Raman analysis has
   promise for elucidating the relationship between the metabolism of
   stored RBCs and donor characteristics. It also suggests that there may
   be benefit in developing a Raman instrument for the rapid non-invasive
   assessment of blood-bag biochemistry by measuring through plastic

Abstract = {{The two-dimensional advection-dispersion equations coupled with
   sequential first-order decay reactions involving arbitrary number of
   species in groundwater system is considered to predict the
   two-dimensional plume behavior of decaying contaminant such as
   radionuclide and dissolved chlorinated solvent. Generalized analytical
   solutions in compact format are derived through the sequential
   application of the Laplace, finite Fourier cosine, and generalized
   integral transform to reduce the coupled partial differential equation
   system to a set of linear algebraic equations. The system of algebraic
   equations is next solved for each species in the transformed domain, and
   the solutions in the original domain are then obtained through
   consecutive integral transform inversions. Explicit form solutions for a
   special case are derived using the generalized analytical solutions and
   are compared with the numerical solutions. The analytical results
   indicate that the analytical solutions are robust, accurate and useful

   Microfluidic Approach for Drug Delivery}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Responsive microgel poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) or PNIPAM is a gel that
   can swell or shrink in response to external stimuli (temperature, pH,
   etc.). In this work, a nanocomposite gel is developed consisting of
   PNIPAM and magnetic iron oxide nanobeads for controlled release of
   liquids (like drugs) upon exposure to an alternating magnetic field.
   Microparticles of the nanocomposite are fabricated efficiently with a
   monodisperse size distribution and a diameter ranging from 20 to 500 mu
   m at a rate of up to 1 kHz using a simple and inexpensive microfluidic
   system. The nanocomposite is heated through magnetic losses, which is
   exploited for a remotely stimulated liquid release. The efficiency of
   the microparticles for controlled drug release applications is tested
   with a solution of Rhodamine B as a liquid drug model. In continuous and
   pulsatile mode, a release of 7\% and 80\% was achieved, respectively.
   Compared to external thermal actuation that heats the entire surrounding
   or embedded heaters that need complex fabrication steps, the magnetic
   actuation provides localized heating and is easy to implement with our
   microfluidic fabrication method.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial wastes that are well pre-treated during related upstream
   industrial processes, such as cassava residuals and furfural residuals,
   are becoming promising feedstocks for producing biofuels. To better use
   these wastes, an approach must be flexible in their use during
   biologically based ethanol production. In the current study, three
   scenarios, including the cellulosic ethanol process, the starchy ethanol
   process, and the integration of 1 G and 2 G ethanol, were compared for
   ethanol production from CR, FR, and corn. Compared with the starch
   ethanol process, the cellulosic ethanol process and integration of 1 G
   and 2 G ethanol produced ethanol at a higher ethanol concentration and
   yield. Of the three processes, the integrated process utilized over 75\%
   of polysaccharides when using multiple materials as feedstocks. Protein,
   cellulose, and starch were yield-determining components in the
   high-solid integration process. Protein provided important nutrients for
   yeast cells. The influences of cellulose and starch were associated with
   product inhibition of cellulases and viscosity. Lignin had a low or
   negligible influence. For an integration process at a 20\% (w/w)
   substrate loading, the optimum concentrations of protein, cellulose, and
   starch included > 1\%, from 4\% to 5\%, and from 8\% to 11\%,
   respectively. At the optimum concentrations, the integration process
   obtained a final ethanol concentration of about 70 g L-1 and an ethanol
   yield of about 80\%.}},

Abstract = {{A rapid method to fabricate a flow-focusing microfluidic device with
   circular channels for droplet generation is presented. To create the
   desired `polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)' channel geometry, moulds using a
   rapid and cheap three dimensional (3D) printing process comparing with
   conventional microfabrication method have been fabricated. The 3D
   printer with a 16 mu m layer resolution utilised to fabricate 100 mu m
   half circular microfluidic moulds. The finished moulds were baked and
   silanized prior to casting to avoid the incomplete curing problem of the
   `PDMS' castings. Casted `PDMS' halves were aligned and bonded together
   to build complete microfluidic chips by an oxygen plasma treatment. Due
   to the resolution limitation of 3D printing, the channels were not
   perfectly circular rather than elliptical. A liquid `PDMS' injection
   process was used and optimised to create fully circular channels, and
   also address challenges regarding the misalignment of the upper and
   lower halves of the microfluidic chip. Circular channels were
   successfully formed in the flow-focusing microfluidic device through the
   post ` PDMS' injection process without any blockage of the cross
   junction. The device functioned well to create similar to 200 mu m
   droplets.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The disturbance on a capillary jet can be imposed by radius modulation,
   velocity modulation, or jet vibration. The objective of the study is to
   understand the equivalence between the three types of disturbances.
   Theoretical analysis based on the Bernoulli equation for unsteady flows
   is conducted. It is found that a radius-modulated disturbance is
   equivalent to a velocity-modulated disturbance with the same wave number
   if the non-dimensional amplitude of the radius disturbance is 1.5 times
   that of the velocity disturbance. This is validated by carrying out
   numerical simulation based on velocity modulation and comparing with the
   linear theory based on radius modulation. It is also revealed that
   disturbance generated by a vibrating nozzle with small amplitude is
   equivalent to velocity disturbance. The non-dimensional amplitude of the
   equivalent velocity disturbance is a function of non-dimensional
   vibration amplitude and vibration wave number. The wave number of the
   velocity disturbance is shown to be twice of the vibration wave number.
   Validated by experimental observation, if the vibration wave number is
   less than 0.5, each nozzle vibration cycle generates two droplets. If
   the vibration wave number is between 0.5 and 1, each vibration cycle
   generates one droplet. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Enhanced visible light driven photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol
   at reduced graphene oxide/CdS nanowires decorated with Pt nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{CATALYSIS SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{3485-3496}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we report the preparation of a novel ternary hybrid
   consisting of reduced graphene oxide/CdS nanowires decorated with Pt
   nanoparticles (rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs) as an efficient electrocatalytic and
   photoelectrocatalytic ethanol oxidation platform in alkaline medium. The
   synthesis was accomplished by a solvothermal method in the first step to
   prepare uniformly sized CdS NWs with diameters of 35 nm and lengths up
   to several micrometers, followed by a simple hydrothermal method to
   assemble CdS NWs decorated with Pt NPs onto rGO sheets using hydrazine
   as a reducing agent. Data regarding the morphology, structure and
   properties of the prepared nanocomposite were obtained through various
   characterization techniques including field-emission scanning electron
   microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy
   dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-visible and photoluminescence
   spectroscopy (PL). Assessing the electrocatalytic activity using cyclic
   voltammetry (CV) and amperometry techniques revealed that the ternary
   hybrid (rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs) exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity
   toward ethanol oxidation in alkaline solution with a more negative onset
   potential compared to nanostructures with various components such as CdS
   NWs, rGO/CdS NWs, CdS NWs/Pt NPs and rGO/Pt NPs. Furthermore,
   experiments using low-power LED as a visible-light illumination source
   showed a dramatic increase in the electrocatalytic activity of the
   proposed nanohybrid toward ethanol oxidation accompanied by a shift of
   the onset potential to a more negative potential of -0.950 V vs. Ag/AgCl
   compared to -0.870 V in dark condition. This high electrocatalytic and
   photoelectrocatalytic performance can be ascribed to providing maximum
   interfacial contact of CdS NWs with rGO, which decreases the
   agglomeration of nanostructures and suppresses the photogenerated
   electron-hole recombination. Furthermore, accelerated electron transfer
   in the presence of rGO and enhanced specific surface area achieved by
   uniform deposition of Pt NPs onto CdS NWs contribute to increasing the
   catalytic activity. This research could promise a simple strategy toward
   the synthesis of a onedimensional semiconductor-rGO/Pt ternary hybrid
   and its applications as an efficient visible-light photocatalyst for
   different chemical transformation and energy conversion devices.}},

Abstract = {{Since the antennas are very low in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenarios,
   the communication link is easily blocked by other vehicles. The
   shadowing effect caused by other vehicles has been ignored in most of
   the existing V2V channel models, and it is thus neglected in the system
   performance evaluation. By incorporating channel state transition with a
   measurement-based dual-slope path loss model, an obstacle-based model is
   presented in this paper for the V2V highway scenarios to capture the
   dynamic characteristics of radio channels, in the presence of other
   vehicles as moving obstacles. The joint effects of the radio environment
   and traffic flow on link connectivity are mainly investigated. The
   obstruction probability is represented, and the connectivity-related
   metrics are evaluated: inter vehicle connectivity probability and link
   duration. All the analytical results are validated by extensive
   simulations under the measurement-based path loss model, and are also
   compared to the existing models.}},

Abstract = {{Visual attention models (VAMs) predict the location of image or video
   regions that are most likely to attract human attention. Although
   saliency detection is well explored for two-dimensional (2-D) image and
   video content, there have been only a few attempts made to design
   three-dimensional (3-D) saliency prediction models. Newly proposed 3-D
   VAMs have to be validated over large-scale video saliency prediction
   datasets, which also contain results of eye-tracking information. There
   are several publicly available eye-tracking datasets for 2-D image and
   video content. In the case of 3-D, however, there is still a need for
   large-scale video saliency datasets for the research community for
   validating different 3-D VAMs. We introduce a large-scale dataset
   containing eye-tracking data collected from 61 stereoscopic 3-D videos
   (and also 2-D versions of those), and 24 subjects participated in a
   free-viewing test. We evaluate the performance of the existing saliency
   detection methods over the proposed dataset. In addition, we created an
   online benchmark for validating the performance of the existing 2-D and
   3-D VAMs and facilitating the addition of new VAMs to the benchmark. Our
   benchmark currently contains 50 different VAMs. (C) 2016 SPIE and IS\&T}},

Abstract = {{Due to growing number of replacement and revision surgeries, total knee
   replacement (TKR) has become one of the most critical biomedical
   applications. For multiple and conflicting criteria, appropriate
   material selection for femoral component of TKR becomes an important
   strategic decision making problem. In this paper, a simple, systematic
   and logical scientific approach is structured to evaluate appropriate
   material for femoral component of TKR through integrating Fuzzy
   Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) with the Preference Ranking
   Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE). The proposed
   decision-making approach takes advantage of the synergy between these
   two well-known multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods in which
   their strong and weak points are detected and a ranking is provided with
   sensitivity analysis which facilitates the final selection for the
   decision maker.}},

Title = {{Maximum operation speed of splined saws}},
Journal = {{WOOD MATERIAL SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{142-146}},
Abstract = {{In the wood processing industry, splined arbour saws are widely used in
   the breakdown of logs to boards of varying dimensions. In a splined saw,
   the inner radius of the blade is splined and matches a splined arbour
   that provides the driving torque for the saw. Lateral constraint for
   these saws is provided by space fixed guide pads which constrain the
   lateral motion of the saw. Experiences indicate that the splined saw is
   able to operate at speeds in excess of its lowest critical speed. This
   paper presents analytical and experimental investigations of a guided
   splined saw. A computer model is developed to consider the idling
   characteristics of the system. The model considers relevant geometrical
   details, friction, contact between components, geometrical
   non-linearity, interaction between the splined arbour and the splined
   blade. Experimental results are presented that support the validity of
   the analysis. The experimental results indicate that flutter instability
   occurs at speeds when a backward travelling wave of a mode meets a
   reflected wave of a different mode. The maximum stable operating speed
   of the splined saw is defined as the initiation of flutter.}},

Title = {{Identification of 3D wood grain angle by directional reflection
   measurement}},
Journal = {{WOOD MATERIAL SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{170-175}},
Abstract = {{Wood grain direction is an important quality-controlling feature of
   wood. It strongly affects wood strength, so much so that a 15-degree
   grain angle deviation can cause a 50\% strength loss. Thus, grain angle
   measurement can provide a powerful means of wood strength grading in
   sawmills. The measurement method used here is a further development of
   an optical technique investigated previously but not much implemented in
   practice because of the complex sensor setup required. The method
   involves measuring the directional distribution of reflected light from
   the wood surface when illuminated by a laser spot. The grain structure
   of the wood causes the light to reflect preferentially in the
   cross-grain direction. The technique is of particular interest because
   it measures the 3D angle of the wood grain, comprising both the surface
   (in-plane) and dive (out-of-plane) grain angles. The measurement
   procedure developed here uses a digital camera to measure the reflected
   light distribution and thereby to identify wood grain direction.
   Measurements with a prototype system on straight-grain lodgepole pine
   specimens with dive angles in a range 0-10 degrees gave dive angle
   measurements with an accuracy of approximately one degree, with
   similarly accurate surface angle measurements up to a 6 degrees dive
   angle.}},

Title = {{SDN-Based Application Framework for Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{1583-1594}},
Abstract = {{As a promising platform for implementing various applications, a
   wireless sensor and actor network (WSAN) consists of many sensor and
   actor nodes that can cooperatively handle complex tasks. However, many
   issues, including nodes' mobility, the heterogeneity of capacity,
   topology, and energy consumption, may bring severe challenges to
   efficient WSAN operation. Currently, the software defined network (SDN)
   appears as a novel approach that is effective to manage and optimize
   networks in a programmable and centralized pattern. This paper studies
   the application framework and relevant methods for applying the SDN
   approach in a WSAN, with the objective of improving network's efficiency
   and scalability. The details of the framework include a three-layer
   structure, the relevant system entities, the enhanced protocol stack,
   and the programmable message types for cooperative communication and
   task execution among WSAN nodes. Based on this framework, this paper
   explores the relevant challenges and mechanisms for effective system
   management from many aspects, including mobility, energy saving,
   reliability maintenance, and topology construction. This paper also
   proposes an optimization method for scheduling decomposed tasks to
   relevant nodes, with an example implemented by the genetic algorithm.
   Next, this paper demonstrates the typical application scenarios,
   including military, industry, transportation, and environmental disaster
   monitoring. Moreover, an indoor application scenario and an outdoor
   application scenario are presented to demonstrate the application of the
   SDN-assisted communication handoff. Finally, the future trends and
   technical challenges for SDN in WSAN are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Safety assessment of oil and gas (O\&G) pipelines is necessary to
   prevent unwanted events that may cause catastrophic accidents and heavy

   represents dependencies of events, updating probabilities and
   representation of uncertain knowledge (such as randomness, vagueness and
   ignorance). The study highlights the utility of FBBN in safety analysis
   of O\&G pipeline because of its flexible structure, allowing it to fit a
   wide variety of accident scenarios. The sensitivity analysis of the
   proposed model indicates that construction defect, overload, mechanical
   damage, bad installation and quality of worker are the most significant
   causes for the O\&G pipeline failures. The research results can help

Abstract = {{The prioritization of water mains for renewal requires the consideration
   of their impact on the deterioration of water quality, in addition to

   to identify the vulnerable locations in water distribution network (WDN)
   that may cause overall system failure not only to compromise structural
   integrity, but also include failures related to water quality and
   hydraulic capacity. The developed DSS was applied to Al-Khobar WDN
   located in the eastern part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. To achieve
   the objectives of the study, an aggregate vulnerability index
   representing the likelihood of system failure was developed using
   multi-criteria decision models. In addition, the potential impacts in
   terms of sensitivity index were also evaluated using advanced soft
   computing methods. Finally, a risk index, based on both vulnerability
   and sensitivity indices, was developed to help water managers to

Abstract = {{In this study, we report a novel and simple synthesis strategy to
   fabricate a leached PtCo/C electrocatalyst, which involves no hydrogen
   and protective agent in the preparation process. This method is composed
   of a chemical impregnation, a heat treatment and a leaching procedure,
   producing PtCo nanoparticles of 4.7 +/- 0.5 nm, slightly larger than the
   size of the PtCo nanoparticles prepared by a tetraoctylammonium bromide
   (TOAB)-assisted approach in which TOAB serves as a protective agent
   preventing the agglomeration of the alloy nanoparticles. After the
   leaching, the as-synthesized leached PtCo/C catalyst demonstrates a
   comparable oxygen reduction reaction mass activity to that of the
   TOAB-assisted leached PtCo/C catalyst, which is ca. 2-fold enhancement
   compared with the in-house Pt(50 wt\%)/C and commercial Pt/C (TKK)
   catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Ru-RuO2/C prepared by galvanic replacement has high catalytic activity
   for sodium borohydride hydrolysis. In the present study, a series of
   Ru-RuO2/C catalysts, Ru-RuO2/C reduced, RuO2/C and Ru supported on Ni
   foam (Ru/Ni foam) are prepared and characterized. Results show that RuO2
   on Ru-RuO2/C is formed from both the consumption of the parent Ni and
   NiO nanoparticles and the disproportionation of RuCl3 with epitaxial
   growth of Ru species. The quantity of RuO2 with oxygen vacancies in
   Ru-RuO2/C determines the hydrolysis activity for sodium borohydride. In
   contrast to Ru-RuO2/C, Ru/Ni foam without oxygen vacancies has the lower
   hydrolysis activity. Results of kinetics calculation further confirm
   that without mass transfer limitation, Ru-RuO2/C has lower intrinsic
   activation energy and correspondingly higher catalytic activity due to
   existence of oxygen vacancies than those from RuRuO2/C reduced, RuO2/C,
   Ru/Ni foam and catalysts from the literature.}},

Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{574-584}},
Abstract = {{Free-space optical communication links operating over lognormal
   turbulence channels using on-off keying (OOK) are studied in this paper.
   Such systems can suffer from irreducible error floors that result from
   the use of demodulation with fixed and unoptimized detection thresholds.
   The resulting error floors are analyzed for the general case of low- and
   high-state offsets (i.e., finite extinction ratios). An electrical
   signalto-noise ratio (SNR) optimized detection system is applied. The
   system uses the electrical SNRs to implement adaptive detection
   thresholds and eliminate the error floors. The system can accommodate
   operation with finite extinction ratios, as it uses the method of
   moments and maximum likelihhod estimation techniques to estimate the
   low- and high-state offsets and electrical SNR. Numerical results show
   that the SNR gap between the electrical-SNR-optimized detection system
   and the adaptive detection system is 2.3 dB at a bit-error rate of
   10(-5) without a state offset. The SNR gap increases to 4.5 dB with a
   state offset of xi = 0.2.}},

Abstract = {{Timber joints with glued-in rods constitute a viable solution for
   numerous applications as they exhibit advantages, e.g., the formation of
   very stiff connections, high fire resistance, and improved aesthetics.
   Most previous research has focused on testing single rod joints to
   evaluate the influence of parameters on structural performance; in
   practice, however, multiple steel rods are required to transfer the
   loads from one structural component to the next. The lack of design
   guidance related to the performance of multiple glued-in rods hinders
   the widespread application of this joint type. This paper describes
   experimental investigations on joints composed of glued-in steel rods in
   glue-laminated timber. The influence of the anchorage length was studied
   to establish performance benchmarks; then joints with multiple rods
   (two, three, and four rods with the spacing between rods varied) were
   manufactured and tested under uniaxial quasi-static tension loading. The
   results showed that for joints using multiple mild steel 12.7 mm
   glued-in rods, a ductile failure can consistently be attained if: i) the
   anchorage length of the rod is longer than 10 times the diameter; and
   ii) the spacing between rods is five times the rod diameter. The results
   contribute toward a better understanding of the performance on timber
   joints with multiple glued-in rods.}},

Abstract = {{A novel methodology was used to create a highly porous foam-formed paper
   that is bonded with highly refined cellulose fiber. In this process,
   cellulose pulp suspension at various consistencies (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and
   2\%) was dispersed in water, followed by foam formation under high shear
   forces in the presence of a surfactant. Various drying methods were used
   to achieve foam formation. These included freeze-drying (FD),
   vacuum-dewatered air-drying (VAD), and dewatered freeze-drying (VFD).
   Increasing the pulp's consistency and changing the drying techniques
   from freeze-drying to air-drying resulted in a more compact
   morphological structure and increased density of foam-formed paper
   samples. Densification of foam-formed samples was measured using a
   Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) machine and a sample with
   densification at lowest strain value was obtained by a 10 wt\% addition
   of microfibrillated cellulose fiber (MFC). At 10 wt\% MFC addition,
   denser foam-formed paper samples with enhanced microstructure were
   obtained. Air filtration efficiency and acoustic properties of
   foam-formed paper were also characterized and optimized by the addition
   of MFC.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Deviations in the Priestley-Taylor (PT) coefficient alpha(PT) from its
   accepted 1.26 value are analyzed over large lakes, reservoirs, and
   wetlands where stomatal or soil controls are minimal or absent. The data
   sets feature wide variations in water body sizes and climatic
   conditions. Neither surface temperature nor sensible heat flux
   variations alone, which proved successful in characterizing alpha(PT)
   variations over some crops, explain measured deviations in alpha(PT)
   over water. It is shown that the relative transport efficiency of
   turbulent heat and water vapor is key to explaining variations in
   alpha(PT) over water surfaces, thereby offering a new perspective over
   the concept of minimal advection or entrainment introduced by PT.
   Methods that allow the determination of alpha(PT) based on low-frequency
   sampling (i.e., 0.1 Hz) are then developed and tested, which are usable
   with standard meteorological sensors that filter some but not all
   turbulent fluctuations. Using approximations to the Gram determinant
   inequality, the relative transport efficiency is derived as a function
   of the correlation coefficient between temperature and water vapor
   concentration fluctuations (R-Tq). The proposed approach reasonably
   explains the measured deviations from the conventional alpha(PT) = 1.26
   value even when R-Tq is determined from air temperature and water vapor
   concentration time series that are Gaussian-filtered and subsampled to a
   cutoff frequency of 0.1 Hz. Because over water bodies, R-Tq deviations
   from unity are often associated with advection and/or entrainment,
   linkages between alpha(PT) and R-Tq offer both a diagnostic approach to
   assess their significance and a prognostic approach to correct the 1.26
   value when using routine meteorological measurements of temperature and
   humidity.}},

   and 4\% or 3\% H2O2 led to lower brightness gains and scattering
   coefficients but increased the tensile strength index by 31\%,
   potentially lowering the total electrical energy required to achieve
   strong pulp. The enhancement of tensile strength caused by the highly
   alkaline peroxide mostly resulted from increased bonding, which was
   attributable to acid group generation rather than the promotion of
   further fibrillation during LC refining.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{298-303}},
Abstract = {{Application of UV/H2O2 process for degradation of micropollutants in
   surface waters could deteriorate the biological stability of treated
   water. This is because of the partial oxidation of natural organic
   matter under the applied UV/H2O2 conditions that in turn leads to an
   increase in assimilable organic carbon (AOC). To address this issue,
   alum coagulation was investigated as a NOM pretreatment alternative
   prior to the UV/H2O2 process in order to improve the treatment efficacy
   and water quality. A recently developed technique was utilized to
   rapidly assess the AOC of the treated water at various stages. Alum was
   effective in removing a substantial portion of large to medium molecular
   weight organic molecules leading to a considerable reduction in AOC.
   However, the fractions not removed by coagulation were shown to promote
   some levels of bacterial regrowth after undergoing subsequent UV/H2O2
   treatment. That said, alum pretreatment was found to be an effective
   strategy for reducing the formation of AOC by 14 to 40\% depending on
   the water used and UV dose applied. The findings of this study are of
   interest for utilities that already have coagulation in use and seek to
   comply with more upcoming stringent regulations by incorporating
   advanced oxidation processes (e.g., UV/H2O2) in their treatment train.}},

Abstract = {{Vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) have drawn significant
   attention by the researchers because of their nanometric size and
   favorable material properties. Patterning of CNT forests in the
   micrometric domain is very important for their application in the area
   of microelectromechanical system (MEMS). For the first time this paper
   reports, detailed experimental investigation on a post growth-patterning
   process of VACNT forests. The micromechanical bending (M2B) process was
   locally applied at the targeted area in order to change the alignment of
   VACNT forests. Interestingly, the VACNT forest was transformed from
   typical black body absorber to reflective mirror as the M2B process was
   applied. Several parameters were identified that govern the resultant
   patterns such as rotational spindle speed, lateral bending speed, step
   size, tool morphology, and total depth of bend. Optimization of the
   parameters was carried out experimentally to obtain the best surface
   roughness and integrity of the microstructure. A minimum average surface
   roughness of Ra = 15 nm was achieved with 2000 rpm spindle speed, 1
   mm/min bending speed and 1 mu m step size.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Abstract = {{A radio-frequency (RF) interrogation method for sensor-integrated
   ``smart{''} stent implants is reported. This device, formed with a
   2-cm-long inductive antenna stent and a micro capacitive pressure
   sensor, both based on a medical-grade stainless steel, serves as a
   wireless resonant pressure sensor designed to detect changes in local
   blood pressure for early detection of post-stenting complications.
   Wireless telemetry of the devices deployed in vascular model and graft
   is demonstrated by reading the decay of resonance in the stent excited
   with pulsed RF fields using two-and single-antenna setups at source
   powers of 4-20 dBm, showing the read ranges of up to 2.75 cm that are 2
   x 3 x larger than those measured with the conventional impedance-phase
   method. The devices immersed in saline are also successfully
   interrogated. The obtained results suggest that the proposed technique
   is a promising alternative path to wireless monitoring of the carotid
   artery through implanted smart stents.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we use fractal method for detection and diagnosis of
   abnormalities in mammograms. We have used 168 images that were carefully
   selected by a radiologist and their abnormalities were also confirmed by
   biopsy. These images included asymmetric lesions, architectural
   distortion, normal tissue and mass lesion where in case of mass lesion
   they included circumscribed benign, ill-defined and spiculated malignant
   masses. At first, by using wavelet transform and piecewise linear
   coefficient mapping, image enhancement were done. Secondly detection of
   lesions was done by fractal method as a ROI. Since in investigation of
   breast cancer, it is important that fibroglandular tissues in both
   breasts be symmetric and for each asymmetric density, evaluation for
   malignancy is necessary, we define new fractal features based on
   extracting asymmetric information from lesions. The fractal features
   were evaluated on 5 data sets using SVM classifier which enabled to
   achieve high accuracy in classification of mammograms and diagnostic
   results. We have also investigated the performance of image enhancement
   in classification of each data set which shows different effects of
   enhancement on different lesion types. (C) 2015 Nalecz Institute of

Journal = {{ANALYST}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1678-1685}},
Abstract = {{After being separated from (donated) whole blood, red blood cells are
   suspended in specially formulated additive solutions and stored (at 4
   degrees C) in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) blood-bags until they are needed
   for transfusion. With time, the prepared red cell concentrate (RCC) is
   known to undergo biochemical changes that lower effectiveness of the
   transfusion, and thus regulations are in place that limit the storage
   period to 42 days. At present, RCC is not subjected to analytical
   testing prior to transfusion. In this study, we use Spatially Offset
   Raman Spectroscopy (SORS) to probe, non-invasively, the biochemistry of
   RCC inside sealed blood-bags. The retrieved spectra compare well with
   conventional Raman spectra (of sampled aliquots) and are dominated by
   features associated with hemoglobin. In addition to the analytical
   demonstration that SORS can be used to retrieve RCC spectra from
   standard clinical blood-bags without breaking the sterility of the
   system, the data reveal interesting detail about the oxygenation-state
   of the stored cells themselves, namely that some blood-bags unexpectedly
   contain measurable amounts of deoxygenated hemoglobin after weeks of
   storage. The demonstration that chemical information can be obtained
   non-invasively using spectroscopy will enable new studies of RCC
   degeneration, and points the way to a Raman-based instrument for
   quality-control in a blood-bank or hospital setting.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to experimentally investigate the
   relationships between local bar forces, plate gap and fiber length in a
   single-disc low consistency refiner. Piezoelectric sensors are used to
   measure normal and shear forces applied to pulp fibers by the refiner
   bars. It is shown that there is a non-linear relationship between
   measured bar forces and length-weighted fiber length that mirrors the
   established relationship between length-weighted fiber length and the
   inverse of plate gap. As the plate gap is reduced, the length-weighted
   fiber length remains relatively constant while net refiner power and the
   mean peak normal and shear forces increase. These trends continue up to
   a threshold values of mean peak normal and shear forces of approximately
   8 N and 2.4 N, respectively. Above this threshold, mean peak normal and
   shear forces continue to increase but the length-weighted fiber length
   exhibits negative linear relationships with these forces. These results
   can be used as the initial study for onset detection of fiber cutting
   and that these sensors have promising potential to be used as the basis
   for advanced refiner control strategies.}},

   wash water}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},

Abstract = {{MSWI fly ash is a potential substitute for some virgin materials, but
   the soluble salts and hazardous trace elements in the ash can limit this
   potential. This study investigated the use of a water-based washing
   process to remove the soluble salts from MSWI fly ash. The removal of
   trace elements by bubbling CO2 through the resulting wastewater was also
   evaluated and compared to the use of a Na2CO3 solution. Washing was
   accomplished at liquid-to-solid ratios (L/S) (L kg(-1)) ranging from 3
   to 20, and at durations from 5 min to 1 h. The optimum washing condition
   was identified by an orthogonal test and an L/S ratio of 10 for 10 min.
   The extraction of chlorides by washing ranged from 62\% to 95\%, while
   the extraction of sulfate was less than 50\% because the solubility of
   these salts was strongly influenced by the L/S ratio. Critical trace
   elements (lead, zinc and copper) were also leached in high
   concentrations (63.7 mg L-1, 4.53 mg L-1 and 0.40 mg L-1, respectively)
   at the optimum washing condition. These elements were effectively
   removed in the CaCO3 or ferrum/aluminum-hydroxides that precipitated
   when CO2 was bubbled into the wastewater. Various analyses showed that
   the precipitate was primarily CaCO3 which formed into spheres. The
   concentration of trace elements incorporated into the precipitate varied
   across the radius of the sphere. A geochemical model was used to help
   explain the mechanism of trace element precipitation. The accelerated
   carbonation of the alkaline MSWI fly ash wash water was effective in
   removing trace elements (Pb, Zn and Cu).}},

   Medicine Applications}},
Journal = {{STEM CELLS INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are a mesenchymal stem cell source
   with properties of self-renewal and multipotential differentiation.
   Compared to bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs), ASCs can be derived
   frommore sources and are harvested more easily. Three-dimensional (3D)
   tissue engineering scaffolds are better able to mimic the in vivo
   cellular microenvironment, which benefits the localization, attachment,
   proliferation, and differentiation of ASCs. Therefore, tissue-engineered
   ASCs are recognized as an attractive substitute for tissue and organ
   transplantation. In this paper, we review the characteristics of ASCs,
   as well as the biomaterials and tissue engineering methods used to
   proliferate and differentiate ASCs in a 3D environment. Clinical
   applications of tissue-engineered ASCs are also discussed to reveal the
   potential and feasibility of using tissue-engineered ASCs in

Abstract = {{The evolution of smartphones together with increasing computational
   power has empowered developers to create innovative context-aware
   applications for recognizing user-related social and cognitive
   activities in any situation and at any location. The existence and
   awareness of the context provide the capability of being conscious of
   physical environments or situations around mobile device users. This
   allows network services to respond proactively and intelligently based
   on such awareness. The key idea behind context-aware applications is to
   encourage users to collect, analyze, and share local sensory knowledge
   in the purpose for a large-scale community use by creating a smart
   network. The desired network is capable of making autonomous logical
   decisions to actuate environmental objects and also assist individuals.
   However, many open challenges remain, which are mostly arisen because
   the middleware services provided in mobile devices have limited
   resources in terms of power, memory, and bandwidth. Thus, it becomes
   critically important to study how the drawbacks can be elaborated and
   resolved and, at the same time, better understand the opportunities for
   the research community to contribute to the context-awareness. To this
   end, this paper surveys the literature over the period of 1991-2014 from
   the emerging concepts to applications of context-awareness in mobile
   platforms by providing up-to-date research and future research
   directions. Moreover, it points out the challenges faced in this regard
   and enlightens them by proposing possible solutions.}},

Title = {{A New Link Scheduling Algorithm for 60 GHz-WPAN Communication System}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{With apparent advantages of several GHz license-free spectra, low power
   consumption, low-cost implementation of CMOS devices, and so forth, 60
   GHz wireless communication technology becomes the first choice for
   short-range high rate wireless communication in future wireless personal
   area network (WPAN) and wireless local area network (WLAN). While
   different from common WPAN system with omnidirectional communication, 60
   GHz-WPAN system generally adopts directional communication. In this
   paper, a device (DEV) interconnected mechanism of 60 GHz-WPAN based on
   switched beamforming technology is structured firstly. Without
   considering the directional transmission characteristic of 60 GHz
   communication, most of the 60 GHz-WPAN Medium Access Control (MAC)
   protocols fail to make full use of the high spatial reuse degree caused
   by directional communication. In this paper, an average time slot
   multiplexing allocation (ATSMA) algorithm based on space/time division
   multiple access (STDMA) solution is proposed, which allows concurrent
   transmission in a single time slot. The designed link schedule process
   includes common channel interference (CCI) probing scheme, link
   coexistence determination scheme, and link schedule algorithm. Extensive
   simulations are conducted in order to demonstrate the efficiency of
   proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrated that the capacity gain
   is obvious using ATSMA algorithm, no matter whether under
   omnidirectional antenna or under directional antenna.}},

Abstract = {{Confined gas-liquid droplet microflows present a lot of new perspectives
   for microfluidic systems that require the presence of a gaseous phase.
   In addition to the benefits associated with the discretization of
   reactive and sensing processes, the highly inertial droplets generated
   in these systems can enable fast efficient mixing by pair collisions as
   well as high system throughput due to the short convective timescales
   involved in the droplet transport. Presented herein is mapping of the
   geometry-specific droplet generation from a binary gas-liquid flow for
   different flow-focusing configurations. The dynamic interactions of
   inertia, shear stress, viscous and surface tension forces create three
   unique regimes in the gas-liquid flow rate space, providing adaptable
   flow configuration to specific applications. Analytical investigation
   and numerical analyses involving governing forces are also introduced to
   predict the effective droplet diameter versus gas flow rate. We found
   that the experimental results were well matched to the analytical
   predictions within 10 \% of uncertainty.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{25}},
Pages = {{21099-21104}},
Abstract = {{Photocrosslinking is a widely-used method to generate cell-laden
   hydrogels for tissue engineering. At present, it usually takes more than
   30 seconds to crosslink hydrogels using UV illumination, and this delay
   makes it more likely that damage will occur in the DNA. With this in
   mind, we introduce an ultrafast photocrosslinking method using a
   low-cost blue laser diode. Experimental results show that a hydrogel
   with a diameter of 8 mm can be crosslinked using this process within 10
   seconds with over 90\% cell viability. Moreover, it is shown that the
   laser can be focused for the implementation of bioprinting. A
   micro-scale cell-laden microtube was successfully fabricated with this
   laser-based system, demonstrating its feasibility for bioprinting.}},

Title = {{Deformability based sorting of red blood cells improves diagnostic
   sensitivity for malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{645-654}},
Abstract = {{The loss of red blood cell (RBC) deformability is part of the pathology
   of many diseases. In malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum infection,
   metabolism of hemoglobin by the parasite results in progressive
   reduction in RBC deformability that is directly correlated with the
   growth and development of the parasite. The ability to sort RBCs based
   on deformability therefore provides a means to isolate pathological
   cells and to study biochemical events associated with disease
   progression. Existing methods have not been able to sort RBCs based on
   deformability or to effectively enrich for P. falciparum infected RBCs
   at clinically relevant concentrations. Here, we develop a method to sort
   RBCs based on deformability and demonstrate the ability to enrich the
   concentration of ring-stage P. falciparum infected RBCs (Pf-iRBCs) by
   >100x from clinically relevant parasitemia (<0.01\%). Deformability
   based sorting of RBCs is accomplished using ratchet transport through
   asymmetrical constrictions using oscillatory flow. This mechanism
   provides dramatically improved selectivity over previous biophysical
   methods by preventing the accumulation of cells in the filter
   microstructure to ensure that consistent filtration forces are applied
   to each cell. We show that our approach dramatically improves the
   sensitivity of malaria diagnosis performed using both microscopy and
   rapid diagnostic test by converting samples with difficult-to-detect
   parasitemia (<0.01\%) into samples with easily detectable parasitemia
   (>0.1\%).}},

Journal = {{ENTROPY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Coupled heat transfer and chemical reaction of fluid flow in complex
   boundaries are explored by introducing two additional properties, i.e.
   particle type and energy state into the Lattice gas automata (LGA)
   Frisch-Hasslacher-Pomeau (FHP-II) model. A mix-redistribute of energy
   and type of particles is also applied on top of collision rules to
   ensure randomness while maintaining the conservation of mass, momentum
   and energy. Simulations of heat transfer and heterogeneous reaction of
   gas flow passing a circular porous cylinder in a channel are presented.
   The effects of porosity of cylinder, gas inlet velocity, and reaction
   probability on the reaction process are further analyzed with respect to
   the characteristics of solid morphology, product concentration, and
   temperature profile. Numerical results indicate that the reaction rate
   increases with increasing reaction probability as well as gas inlet
   velocity. Cylinders with a higher value of porosity and more homogeneous
   structure also react with gas particles faster. These results agree well
   with the basic theories of gas-solid reactions, indicating the present
   model provides a method for describing gas-solid reactions in complex
   boundaries at mesoscopic level.}},

Abstract = {{We study the transmission of a set of correlated sources (U1,...,UK)
   over a Gaussian multiple access relay channel with time asynchronism
   between the encoders. We assume that the maximum possible offset
   d(max)(n) between the transmitters grows without bound as the block
   length n ->infinity, while the relative ratio d(max)(n)/n of the maximum
   possible offset to the block length asymptotically vanishes. For such a
   joint source-channel coding problem and under specific gain conditions,
   we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for reliable
   communications and show that separate source and channel coding achieves
   optimal performance. In particular, we first derive a general outer
   bound on the source entropy content for all channel gains as our main
   result. Then, using Slepian-Wolf source coding combined with the channel
   coding scheme on top of block Markov coding, we show that the thus
   achieved inner bound matches the outer bound. As a corollary, we also
   address the problem of sending a pair of correlated sources over a
   two-user interference channel in the same context.}},

Abstract = {{JAVASCRIPT is a scripting language that plays a prominent role in web
   applications today. It is dynamic, loosely typed and asynchronous and is
   extensively used to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) at
   runtime. All these characteristics make JAVASCRIPT code error-prone;
   unfortunately, JAVASCRIPT fault localization remains a tedious and
   mainly manual task. Despite these challenges, the problem has received
   very limited research attention. This paper proposes an automated
   technique to localize JAVASCRIPT faults based on dynamic analysis,
   tracing and backward slicing of JAVASCRIPT code. This technique is
   capable of handling features of JAVASCRIPT code that have traditionally
   been difficult to analyse, including eval, anonymous functions and
   minified code. The approach is implemented in an open source tool called
   AUTOFLOX, and evaluation results indicate that it is capable of (1)
   automatically localizing DOM-related JAVASCRIPT faults with high
   accuracy (over 96\%) and no false-positives and (2) isolating JAVASCRIPT
   faults in production websites and actual bugs from real-world web
   applications. Copyright (c) 2015John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Observing the states of a linear system has been an extensively studied
   topic over the past few decades. Different from full-state observers and
   reduced-order observers which are used to reconstruct the entire state
   space and the unmeasured states, respectively, functional observers are
   developed for applications in which only a linear combination of the
   states is required. For linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with known
   and/or unknown inputs and assuming availability of the derivatives of
   the input and the output signals, we study the existence of a novel
   stable functional observer. Considering the output to be the extended
   vector of the output and its derivatives, we derive the existence
   conditions for a functional observer by making the estimation error
   asymptotically approach zero. The derived existence conditions are
   applicable to multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems (e.g., with either
   known or unknown inputs, and with or without the derivatives of the
   signals being available). We also provide an estimate of the required
   observer order for the reconstruction of a desired functional and
   present how to design this functional observer by modifying certain
   current techniques. As an application, we apply the designed functional
   observer to model the stage of information comprehension in the user of
   a shared/human controlled system.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the initial stages of the MnO2 electrodeposition on
   different lead-based electrowinning anodes (Pb-MnO2 and PbAg) in
   sulfuric acid electrolyte solutions were investigated. The MnO2
   deposition and its preliminary effects on the oxidation of the anodes
   were studied using electrochemical techniques including potentiostatic
   polarization and linear potential sweep voltammetry. The potentiostatic
   polarizations were accompanied by chemical analysis of the electrolyte
   to investigate the manganese oxidation rates on the anodes. Scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to characterize the deposited
   MnO2 layers. The presence of MnO2 particles on the Pb-MnO2 composite
   anode contributed to the deposition of a very uniform, dense, and stable
   MnO2 layer. The effects of the MnO2 composite particles in the composite
   anode on the current distribution, Mn3+ disproportionation rate and Mn2+
   oxidation rate, were proposed as the possible causes of the observed
   properties of the MnO2 layer on this anode. The MnO2 layer on the
   Pb-MnO2 anode grew quickly during the initial stages. This layer became
   smoother over the course of polarization. Although the oxidation of the
   anodes was hindered by the deposited MnO2 layer, this effect was more
   significant on the composite anode than the conventional PbAg anode.
   This was attributed to different properties of the MnO2 layers deposited
   on these anodes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In daily life, people tend to use mobile networks for more accurate
   overall data. With intelligent mobile devices, almost all kinds of data
   can be collected automatically, which contributes directly to the
   blooming of eHealth. However, large amounts of data are also leading us
   into the era of big data, in which new data collection, transmission,
   and processing techniques are required. To ensure ubiquitous data
   collection, the scale of mobile eHealth networks has to be expanded.
   Also, networks will face more pressure to transmit large amounts of
   eHealth data. In addition, because the processing time increases with
   data volume, even powerful processors cannot always be regarded as
   efficient for big data. To solve these problems, in this article, an
   interests-based reduced variable neighborhood search (RVNS) queue
   architecture (IRQA) is proposed. In this three-layer architecture, a
   fault-tolerant mechanism based on interests matching is designed to
   ensure the completeness of eHealth data in the data gathering layer.
   Then the data integrating layer checks the accuracy of data, and also
   prepares for data processing. In the end, an RVNS queue is adopted for
   rapid data processing in the data analyzing layer. After processing with
   relevant rules, only valuable data will be reported to health care
   providers, which saves their effort to identify these data. Simulation
   shows that IRQA is steady and fast enough to process large amounts of
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Prior performance analyses of diversity receptions over arbitrarily
   correlated Nakagami-m fading channels use power correlation matrix to
   define correlation among branches. However, the power correlation matrix
   cannot uniquely determine the joint probability density function of the
   branch amplitudes as well as the system performance. In this paper, we
   derive asymptotically tight and closed-form upper and lower bounds for
   the error rates and the outage probabilities of maximum-ratio combining,
   equal-gain combining, and selection combining over arbitrarily
   correlated Nakagami-m fading channels. The correlation between the
   Nakagami-m random variables is defined through the correlation matrix of
   the accompanying Gaussian random variables, which can uniquely determine
   the joint probability density function of the Nakagami-m variables.
   Using the analytical results and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that
   the performance of diversity reception systems over Nakagami-m fading
   channels cannot be uniquely determined by the power correlation matrix
   of the branches. Furthermore, we also study the factors that determine
   the asymptotic performance of the diversity receptions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOTOR BEHAVIOR}},

Abstract = {{The notion of an optimal difficulty during practice has been articulated
   in many areas of cognitive psychology: flow theory, the challenge point
   framework, and desirable difficulties. Delivering exercises at a
   participant's desired difficulty has the potential to improve both motor
   learning and users' engagement in therapy. Motivation and engagement are
   among the contributing factors to the success of exercise programs. The
   authors previously demonstrated that error amplification can be used to
   introduce levels of challenge into a robotic reaching task, and that
   machine-learning algorithms can dynamically adjust difficulty to the
   desired level with 85\% accuracy. Building on these findings, we present
   the results of a proof-of-concept study investigating the impacts of
   practicing under desirable difficulty conditions. A control condition
   with a predefined random order for difficulty levels was deemed more
   suitable for this study (compared to constant or continuously increasing
   difficulty). By practicing the task at their desirable difficulties,
   participants in the experimental group perceived their performance at a
   significantly higher level and reported lower required effort to
   complete the task, in comparison to a control group. Moreover, based on
   self-reports, participants in the experimental group were willing, on
   average, to continue the training session for 4.6 more training blocks
   (approximate to 45min) compared to the control group's average. This
   study demonstrates the efficiency of delivering the exercises at the
   user's desired difficulty level to improve the user's engagement in
   exercise tasks. Future work will focus on clinical feasibility of this
   approach in increasing stroke survivors' engagement in their therapy
   programs.}},

Abstract = {{The presentation of carbohydrates on an array can provide a means to
   model (mimic) oligosaccharides found on cell surfaces. Tuning the
   structural features of such carbohydrate arrays can therefore be used to
   help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of protein-carbohydrate
   recognition on cell surfaces. Here we present a strategy to directly
   correlate the molecular and structural features of ligands presented on
   a surface with the kinetics and affinity of carbohydrate-lectin binding.
   The Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) spectroscopy analysis identified
   that by varying the spatial distribution (3D organization) of
   carbohydrate ligands within the surface grafted polymer layer, the mode
   of binding changed from multivalent to monovalent: a near 1000-fold
   change in the equilibrium association constant was achieved. The rupture
   forces measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) force spectroscopy also
   indicated that the mode of binding between lectin and carbohydrate
   ligands can be modulated by the organization of carbohydrate ligands
   within the glycopolymer brushes.}},

   considered using nine UHPFRC slabs with steel reinforcing bars. Three
   more unreinforced UHPFRC slabs with three different SRA ratios and four
   different depths were also fabricated for the comparisons. The use of
   SRA exhibited better behavior with regard to the decrease of shrinkage,
   maximum evaporation rate, and maximum surface-crack width. In addition,
   the application of a larger cover depth was favorable because it caused
   a lower degree of restraint, leading to a lower cracking potential and a
   higher surface-cracking resistance. Finally, the minimum required cover
   depth of the UHPFRC slab is suggested to be 1.3 times larger than the
   diameter of the upper steel reinforcing bar in order to prevent surface

Abstract = {{Micro-Hole Drilling (mu HD) and Micro-Slot Cutting (mu SC) methods for
   the measurement of residual stress at the micron scale have recently
   been proposed but have yet to be evaluated and validated against other
   methods such as X-ray Diffraction (XRD). In this paper near surface and
   sub-surface residual stresses were measured in ceramic-shot peened and
   fatigued Al-7075-T651 double notched samples using mu HD and mu SC
   methods, and compared to XRD micro-diffractometer results and
   Finite-Element (FE) predictions. The micron-seized sampling volumes
   enabled the stress to be evaluated in individual impact craters
   (dimples) showing significant point-to-point variation (similar to +/-
   150 MPa) (with certain dimples even recording tensile stresses). At a
   depth of around 30 mu m the heavily deformed region had largely been
   removed and the stress became much more homogeneous. At this depth the
   mu HD and mu SC results were in good accord with those from XRD and FE
   modelling showing a stress of around 150 MPa far from the notch with
   stress increasing at the notch being to about 200 MPa for the blunt (2
   mm) notch and 500 MPa for the sharp (0.15 mm).}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes Probabilistic Replacement Policy (PRP), a novel
   replacement policy that evicts the line with minimum estimated hit
   probability under optimal replacement instead of the line with maximum
   expected reuse distance. The latter is optimal under the independent
   reference model of programs, which does not hold for last-level caches
   (LLC).
   PRP requires 7\% and 2\% metadata overheads in the cache and DRAM
   respectively. Using a sampling scheme makes DRAM overhead negligible,
   with minimal performance impact. Including detailed overhead modeling
   and equal cache areas, PRP outperforms SHiP, a state-of-the-art LLC
   replacement algorithm, by 4\% for memory-intensive SPEC-CPU2006

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Multisensor image fusion or pansharpening aims to sharpen a
   multispectral (MS) image by integrating the detail map derived from a
   panchromatic (Pan) image. The intensity-hue-saturation (IHS)-based
   methods are well adopted in pansharpening applications. However, the
   pansharpened MS images by IHS-based methods usually suffer from serious
   spectral distortions and local artifacts due to the mismatch between the
   estimated detail map and its ground truth. To overcome these defects, we
   propose a weighted least squares (WLS)-filter-based method in this
   letter. Different from existing IHS-based methods, the proposed method
   eliminates the influence of the low-frequency components of the Pan and
   MS images with the WLS filter. Moreover, the derived detail map is
   further refined based on the spectral signatures for different bands of
   the MS image. We test the proposed method on various satellites data;
   the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs
   well in both spectral and spatial qualities.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor network of regular topology is efficient in area
   covering and targets locating. However, communications with fixed
   channels lead to low spectrum efficiency and high probability of
   conflicts. This paper proposes economical timeslots-and-channels
   allocation methods for scheduling links in square, triangle, and hexagon
   lattice topologies. Based on these scheduling methods in square lattice,
   the authors explore routing methods for load balance and delay
   minimization, respectively, and compare their effects on transmission
   delay and energy consumption. The OMNet++-based simulation for square
   lattice verified the effectiveness of scheduling methods for improving
   network throughput and made performance comparison among different
   scheduling methods. It also proved that delay minimization-oriented
   routing helps to reduce the energy consumption for node standing by and
   load balance-oriented routing helps to reduce the energy consumption for
   packets transmission. However, there is trade-off between the reductions
   of the two types of energy consumptions. The authors further propose the
   idea of hybrid routing with the two aforementioned routing methods for
   reducing overall energy consumption and explore the challenges and
   countermeasures for hybrid routing optimization. Copyright (C) 2014 John

Abstract = {{This paper presents and details the H-Bridge PFC rectifier control
   scheme. This control is a step forward in sensorless current control
   schemes for performance improvements of single-phase bidirectional
   rectifiers. The H-Bridge PFC rectifier is designed based on a single PI
   controller loop fed by DC reference signals. Regarding dynamic operating
   conditions, the proposed control can maintain a regulated DC voltage
   under varying conditions at input (voltage sags) and output (load step
   changes) ports while maintaining an unitary power factor (PF) and
   constant THD current input at any of these conditions. Different to
   other investigations, this control proposal uses SPWM, does not require
   a variable transformation into the dq0 reference frame, and the complex
   compensators accompanying to the PI controller stage are no longer
   needed. Therefore, this proposal is aimed to reduce the complexity of
   the control scheme and to improve the overall dynamic response of the
   PFC rectifier. The experimental results obtained from the scaled-down
   prototype setup, which was built for research purposes, validate the
   control law, mathematical model and quantitative comparison between
   simulation and experiment, both considering the parasitic resistances of
   the inductor and semiconductor switches. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   types, occluding surgical tools, and limited visibility of the objects'
   geometries on the projected camera views. In this paper, we propose a
   multimodal approach to segmentation where preoperative 3D computed
   tomography scans and intraoperative stereo-endoscopic video data are
   jointly analyzed. The idea is to segment multiple poorly visible
   structures in the stereo/multichannel endoscopic videos by fusing
   reliable prior knowledge captured from the preoperative 3D scans. More
   specifically, we estimate and track the pose of the preoperative models
   in 3D and consider the models' non-rigid deformations to match with
   corresponding visual cues in multi-channel endoscopic video and segment
   the objects of interest. Further, contrary to most augmented reality
   frameworks in endoscopic surgery that assume known camera parameters, an
   assumption that is often violated during surgery due to non-optimal
   camera calibration and changes in camera focus/zoom, our method embeds
   these parameters into the optimization hence correcting the calibration
   parameters within the segmentation process. We evaluate our technique on
   synthetic data, ex vivo lamb kidney datasets, and in vivo clinical
   partial nephrectomy surgery with results demonstrating high accuracy and
   robustness.}},

Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The building stock in the world consumes approximately 40\% of the
   energy and emits one third of the total greenhouse gases emissions
   (GHG). Improving the energy efficiency in buildings is vital to address
   the climate change and achieve energy independence (i.e. to become
   net-zero energy). Improving energy performance in existing buildings has
   been receiving significant attention recently, which entails reducing
   energy demand for building operations, without affecting the health and
   comfort of its occupants. This approach requires strategies beyond mere
   technical advancements. However, there is limited published literature
   which has comprehensively addressed these issues.
   The aim of this paper is to critically review existing
   body-of-the-knowledge on improving energy efficiency of operating both
   commercial and institutional buildings. Peer-reviewed journal articles
   published from year 2000 to 2014 in reputed journals were reviewed. This
   review investigated contemporary energy efficiency approaches including
   technical, organizational, and behavioural changes. Based on the
   comprehensive literature review, a strategy map was developed as a
   pathway for achieving better building energy performance. It was noted
   that even though the existing studies predominately focused on technical
   advancements, approaches such as building behavioural changes have been
   largely overlooked. Findings of this study provide an important basis
   for setting up a national and organization wide strategy for improving
   the energy efficiency of commercial and institutional buildings. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents modeling of rock spalling induced by a dynamic pulse
   using the finite-discrete element method, for the purpose of tunnel
   support design to withstand blasting. 1D and 2D model results are
   compared to analytical spalling equations and field test findings. It
   was found that only the 2D models are suitable for support design. A
   distinction between heavy spalling and light rockfall is made based on
   an estimation of the ratio of the peak stress of the arriving wave to
   the rock tensile strength. Accordingly, different design approaches are
   suggested: for heavy spalling a low impedance isolating layer between
   the tunnel liner and surrounding rock is recommended. For light
   rockfall, a simplified static FEM analysis procedure is presented. (C)

Title = {{Injuries at the Whistler Sliding Center: a 4-year retrospective study}},
Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{62-70}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background The Whistler Sliding Centre (WSC) in British Columbia,
   Canada, has played host to many events including the 2010 Winter
   Olympics. This study was performed to better understand sliding sport
   incident (crash, coming off sled, etc) and injury prevalence and provide
   novel insights into the effect of slider experience and track-specific
   influences on injury risk and severity.
   Methods Track documentation and medical records over 4years (2007 track
   inception to 2011) were used to form 3 databases, including over 43200
   runs (all sliding disciplines). Statistics were generated relating
   incident and injury to start location, crash location and slider
   experience as well as to understand injury characteristics.
   Results Overall injury rate was found to be 0.5\%, with more severe
   injury occurring in <0.1\% of the total number of runs. More frequent
   and severe injuries were observed at lower track locations. Of 2605
   different sliders, 73.6\% performed 1-29 runs down the track. Increased
   slider experience was generally found to reduce the frequency of injury.
   Lacerations, abrasions and contusions represented 52\% of all injuries.
   A fatality represented the most severe injury on the track and was the
   result of track ejection.
   Conclusions By investigating the influence of start location, incident
   location and slider experience on incident and injury frequency and
   severity, a better understanding has been achieved of the inherent risks
   involved in sliding sports. Incident monitoring, with particular focus
   on track ejection, should be an emphasis of sliding tracks.}},

Abstract = {{As one of the key components of the smart grid, advanced metering
   infrastructure brings many potential advantages such as load management
   and demand response. However, computerizing the metering system also
   introduces numerous new vectors for energy theft. In this paper, we
   present a novel consumption pattern-based energy theft detector, which
   leverages the predictability property of customers' normal and malicious
   consumption patterns. Using distribution transformer meters, areas with
   a high probability of energy theft are short listed, and by monitoring
   abnormalities in consumption patterns, suspicious customers are
   identified. Application of appropriate classification and clustering
   techniques, as well as concurrent use of transformer meters and anomaly
   detectors, make the algorithm robust against nonmalicious changes in
   usage pattern, and provide a high and adjustable performance with a
   low-sampling rate. Therefore, the proposed method does not invade
   customers' privacy. Extensive experiments on a real dataset of 5000
   customers show a high performance for the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Leakage power is an important component of the total power consumption
   in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) built using 90-nm and smaller
   technology nodes. Power gating was shown to be effective at reducing the
   leakage power. Previous techniques focus on turning OFF unused FPGA
   resources at configuration time; the benefit of this approach depends on
   resource utilization. In this paper, we present an FPGA architecture
   that enables dynamically controlled power gating, in which FPGA
   resources can be selectively powered down at run-time. This could lead
   to significant overall energy savings for applications having modules
   with long idle times. We also present a CAD flow that can be used to map
   applications to the proposed architecture. We study the area and power
   tradeoffs by varying the different FPGA architecture parameters and
   power gating granularity. The proposed CAD flow is used to map a set of
   benchmark circuits that have multiple power-gated modules to the
   proposed architecture. Power savings of up to 83\% are achievable for
   these circuits. Finally, we study a control system of a robot that is
   used in endoscopy. Using the proposed architecture combined with clock
   gating results in up to 19\% energy savings in this application.}},

Title = {{Mathematical modelling and reactor design for multi-cycle
   bioregeneration of nitrate exhausted ion exchange resin}},

Abstract = {{Nitrate contamination is one of the largest issues facing communities
   worldwide. One of the most common methods for nitrate removal from water
   is ion exchange using nitrate selective resin. Although these resins
   have a great capacity for nitrate removal, they are considered non
   regenerable. The sustainability of nitrate-contaminated water treatment
   processes can be achieved by regenerating the exhausted resin several
   times rather than replacing and incineration of exhausted resin. The use
   of multicycle exhaustion/bioregeneration of resin enclosed in a membrane
   has been shown to be an effective and innovative regeneration method.
   In this research, the mechanisms for bioregeneration of resin were
   studied and a mathematical model which incorporated physical desorption
   process with biological removal kinetics was developed. Regardless of
   the salt concentration of the solution, this specific resin is a
   pore-diffusion controlled process (X delta(D) over bar /CDr(0) (5 + 2
   alpha) < < 1). Also, Thiele modulus was calculated to be between 4 and
   12 depending on the temperature and salt concentration. High Thiele
   modulus (>3) shows that the bioregeneration process is controlled by
   reaction kinetics and is governed by biological removal of nitrate.
   The model was validated by comparison to experimental data; the average
   of R-squared values for cycle 1 to 5 of regeneration was 0.94 +/- 0.06
   which shows that the developed model predicted the experimental results
   very well. The model sensitivity for different parameters was evaluated
   and a model bioreactor design for bioregeneration of highly selective
   resins was also presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Thermal plumes in viscoplastic fluids: flow onset and development}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{787}},
Pages = {{474-507}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The purely conductive state in configurations such as the
   Rayleigh-Benard one is linearly stable for yield stress fluids at all
   Rayleigh numbers, Ra. However, changing to localized heater
   configurations the static background state exists only if the yield
   stress is sufficiently large. Otherwise, thermal plumes may be induced
   in a stationary viscoplastic fluid layer, as illustrated in the recent
   experimental study of Davaille et al. (J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech.,
   vol. 193, 2013, 144-153). Here, we study an analogous problem both
   analytically and computationally, from the perspective of an ideal yield
   stress fluid (Bingham fluid) that is initially stationary in a locally
   heated rectangular tank. We show that for a non-zero yield stress the
   onset of flow waits for a start time t(s) that increases with the
   dimensionless ratio of yield stress to buoyancy stress, denoted B. We
   provide a precise mathematical definition of t(s) and approximately
   evaluate this for different values of B, using both computational and
   semianalytical methods. For sufficiently large B >= B-cr, the fluid is
   unable to yield. For the flow studied, B-cr approximate to 0.00307. The
   critical value B-cr and the start time t(s) for B < B-cr, are wholly
   independent of Ra and Pr. For B < B-cr, yielding starts at t = t(s). The
   flow develops into either a weakly or a strongly convective flow. In the
   former case the passage to a steady state is relatively smooth and
   monotone, resulting eventually in a steady convective plume above the
   heater, rising and impinging on the upper wall, then recirculating
   steadily around the tank. With strongly convecting flows, for
   progressively larger Ra we observe an increasing number of distinct
   plume heads and a tendency for plumes to develop as short-lived pulses.
   Over a certain range of (Ra, 8) the flow becomes temporarily frozen
   between two consecutive pulses. Such characteristics arc distinctly
   reminiscent of the experimental work of Davaille et al. (J.
   Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech., vol. 193, 2013, 144-153). The yield stress
   plays a multifaceted role here as it affects plume temperature, size and
   velocity through different mechanisms. On the one hand, increasing B
   tends to increase the maximum temperature of the plume heads. On the
   other hand, for larger B > B-cr, the plume never starts.}},

Title = {{Surface tension and gas dispersion properties of fatty acid solutions}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{138-147}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The gas dispersion properties of aqueous solutions of fatty acids of
   different hydrocarbon chain lengths were assessed through measurements
   of average bubble size and bubble size distributions. Two mechanisms of
   gas dispersion were identified depending on the pH and speciation of the
   tested solutions. Solutions of long chain fatty acids containing
   colloidal precipitates at low pH exhibited low surface tensions, and
   only a small decrease in bubble sizes was observed for such solutions
   compared to bubble sizes measured in water. This relatively small change
   in bubble sizes could theoretically be predicted based only on the
   corresponding change in the surface tension of the solutions. In
   contrast, true solutions of long chain fatty acids affected bubble sizes
   to a much greater extent even though their surface tension values were
   higher and in some cases comparable to the surface tension of water. A
   combination of the surface tension and surface tension gradient effects
   was found to be operative in this case. Experimental results on shorter
   chain fatty acids strongly suggested that the associated acid species
   were more surface-active and more capable of reducing bubble sizes than
   the dissociated carboxylate anion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Acoustic emission (AE) signal generated from defects in rolling element
   bearings are investigated using simulated defects and experimental
   measurements in this paper. Rolling element bearings are crucial parts
   of many machines and there has been an increasing demand to find
   effective and reliable health monitoring technique and advanced signal
   processing to detect and diagnose the size and location of incipient
   defects. Condition monitoring of rolling element bearings comprises four
   main stages, which are, statistical analysis, faults diagnostics, defect
   size calculation, and prognostics. A modified and effective signal
   processing algorithm is designed to diagnose localized defects on
   rolling element bearing components under different operating speeds,
   loadings, and defect sizes. The algorithm is based on optimizing the
   ratio of Kurtosis and Shannon entropy to obtain the optimal band pass
   filter utilizing wavelet packet transform (WPT) and envelope detection.
   Results show the superiority of the developed algorithm and its
   effectiveness in extracting bearing characteristic frequencies from the
   raw acoustic emission signals masked by the background noise under

Abstract = {{Infrastructure owners and operators, or governmental agencies, need

   fragility functions for reinforced concrete girder bridges. Resources
   for detailed assessments should be allocated to bridges with highest
   consequence of damage, for which site hazard, bridge fragility, and
   traffic data are needed. The proposed BBN based model is used to
   quantify seismic fragility of bridges based on data that can be obtained
   by visual inspection and engineering drawings. Results show that the
   predicted fragilities are of sufficient accuracy for establishing
   relative ranking and prioritizing. While the actual data and seismic
   hazard employed to train the network (establishing conditional
   probability tables) refer to the Italian bridge stock, the network

Abstract = {{The coupled effects of varying composite film thicknesses and filler

   (CNT)/polymer composite films are investigated through modeling and
   experiments. Change in average intertube distance is calculated
   statistically through the Monte Carlo simulations for samples with
   different CNT concentrations and film thicknesses for a given filler
   aspect ratio. The composite conductivity is then estimated from the
   intertube distance with a semi-analytical model based on a tunneling
   current. The dependence of conductivity on mechanical strain is
   investigated for varying film thickness for strain sensor applications.
   A partial alignment of CNTs introduced at film thicknesses less than the
   CNT length is observed to have a significant influence on the composite
   conductivity and strain sensitivity, specially at low CNT
   concentrations. The modeling results can explain the observed
   experimental results of conductivity for CNT composites, which
   illustrate a unique dip in conduction with increasing thickness. These
   results are important for understanding the composite characteristics

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},

Abstract = {{In the direct displacement-based design method, energy dissipative
   capacity of structures can be represented by an equivalent viscous
   damping (EVD). A number of studies have been reported in the formulation
   of EVD for different structural systems and hysteretic models. In this
   paper, an EVD model is developed and calibrated for steel-timber hybrid
   structures, where cross-laminated timber (CLT) shear panels are used as
   an infill in steel moment-resisting frames (SMRFs). To develop the EVD
   model, 243 single-story, single-bay CLT-infilled SMRFs analytical models
   are subject to semi-static cyclic analysis. Different model parameters
   of the hybrid structure are varied: gap between CLT panel and steel
   frame, bracket (connection) spacing, CLT panel thickness and strength,
   and postyield stiffness ratio of steel members. The EVD of each model
   was computed from the hysteretic responses based on an area-based
   approach. The design of computer experiments and response surface
   methodology were utilized to formulate the desired relationship between
   coefficients of EVD-ductility law and the model parameters. In order to
   create displacement compatibility between the equivalent linear system
   and time history, an iterative nonlinear time history procedure is
   adopted to calibrate the EVD-ductility law of the models. As a result, a

Abstract = {{Steel beam-column connections with posttensioned (PT) elements are
   proven systems that can provide adequate stiffness, strength, and
   ductility, while eliminating permanent deformations in a
   moment-resisting frame subjected to seismic loading. In this study,
   detailed three-dimensional finite-element (FE) models of steel
   beam-column connections with PT strands are developed and analyzed under
   cyclic loading. Efforts are made to overcome challenges in performing
   the nonlinear FE analysis of large-scale PT connections, which involves
   gap opening and closing behavior as well as contact and sliding
   phenomena. Geometric and material nonlinearities, preloaded bolts and
   strands are also considered in the modeling. Through a verification
   study, the results from the FE models are validated against prior
   experiments on interior PT connections with top-and-seat angles.
   Parametric studies are also conducted to investigate the effects of
   three factors on the cyclic performance of PT connections. The factors
   investigated in this study are: the presence of beam flange reinforcing
   plates, the yield strength and strain hardening of steel angles, and the
   amount of initial posttensioning force in the strands. (C) 2015 American

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Steel moment frame (MF) is one of the most prevalent and well researched
   steel seismic force resisting systems worldwide. However, efficiency and
   feasibility of using MF diminishes for large spans. In this paper, a
   recently developed steel seismic force resisting system, named
   buckling-restrained knee-braced truss moment frame (BRKBTMF), is
   suggested as a better alternative system. The BRKBTMF uses
   buckling-restrained knee-braces with open web trusses. In this paper, a
   four-story prototype office building was designed using both MF and
   BRKBTMF systems. Performance of the prototype building with different
   span lengths was systematically studied. The results show that BRKBTMF
   uses less structural steel, yet it performs better with lower structural
   damage, repair costs, and probability of collapse as compared with the
   MF for all span lengths and under all earthquake intensities considered.
   Hence, it is concluded that BRKBTMF is a viable and effective
   alternative seismic force resisting system for long-span applications.

Title = {{Inter-Utility Performance Benchmarking Model for Small-to-Medium-Sized
   Water Utilities: Aggregated Performance Indices}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{About 95\% of the water supply systems in Canada are being operated by
   small-to-medium-sized water utilities (SMWU) serving populations less
   than 50,000. The representation of these utilities in National Water and
   Wastewater Benchmarking Initiative (NWWBI) is almost negligible due to
   less awareness, issues related to data availability, and financial
   constraints. In the present work, an inter-utility performance
   benchmarking model (IU-PBM) is developed, which entails consideration of
   47 performance indicators (PIs) for different functional components of
   SMWU, such as water resources and environment, personnel, physical
   assets, quality of service, water quality and public health, and
   financial aspects. For performance benchmarking, 47 (linear,
   exponential, logarithmic, and polynomial) transformation functions have
   been established to translate the calculated PIs into performance levels
   between 10 and 100, which is based on literature, NWWBI reports, and
   expert judgment. The weights are estimated using a specific method from
   the literature for ranking of PIs by different water utilities in the
   Okanagan basin, British Columbia, Canada, and opinions of experts
   working in water infrastructure management. Finally, performance indices
   have been established by aggregating the transformed performance levels
   using the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution
   (TOPSIS) (i.e., based on the concept of relative closeness to the most
   desirable performance and remoteness from the least desirable
   performance). The IU-PBM results presented in the form of a web diagram
   demonstrate the utility's performance to the top management for
   pragmatic decision making. The proposed model has also been implemented
   for two SMWU operating in Okanagan Basin to evaluate its practicality.

Abstract = {{The constitutive behaviour of the aluminium-copper casting alloy B206
   has been investigated in both the as-cast and artificially aged states.
   For the as-cast material, a unified plastic flow stress model has been
   developed using experimental data acquired from compression tests
   performed using a Gleeble 3500 thermo-mechanical simulator. The unified
   model considers different constitutive models, each for a specific
   temperature interval, and the transition between these models at an
   intermediate temperature based on the material's strain rate
   sensitivity. For the artificially aged material, a linear-fit yield
   strength evolution model as a function of the heat treatment parameters
   has been developed using experimental data from tensile tests and
   hardness measurements. The yield strength model takes advantage of an
   independently developed microstructure model that specifically describes
   the precipitation kinetics of the material based on differential
   scanning calorimetry measurements. Evaluations of the developed models
   show good fits between the predicted strengths and data from experiments
   as well as the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{359-370}},

Abstract = {{Recently the environmental impact of onshore wind farms is receiving
   major attention from both governments and wind farm designers. As land
   is more extensively exploited for wind farms, it is more likely for wind
   turbines to be in proximity with human dwellings, infrastructure (e.g.
   roads, transmission lines), and natural habitats (e.g. rivers, lakes,
   forests). This proximity makes significant portions of land unusable for
   the designers, introducing a set of land-use constraints. In this study,
   we conduct a constrained and continuous-variable multi-objective
   optimization that considers energy and noise as its objective functions,
   based on Jensen's wake model and the ISO-9613-2 noise standard. A
   stochastic evolutionary algorithm (NSGA-II) solves the optimization
   problem, while the land-use constraints are handled with static and
   dynamic penalty functions. Results of this study illustrate the effect
   of constraint severity and spatial distribution of unusable land on the
   trade-off between energy generation and noise production. (C) 2015

Title = {{New features for speech enhancement using bivariate shrinkage based on
   redundant wavelet filter-banks}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{93-115}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In most of the wavelet based speech enhancement methods, it is assumed
   that the wavelet coefficients are independent of each other. However,
   investigating the joint histogram of the wavelet coefficients reveals
   some dependencies among them. In this regard, Sendur proposed a
   probability density function (pdf) that models the relation between a
   wavelet coefficient of image signal and its parent. Then, this pdf is
   utilized to propose a bivariate shrinkage function which uses the
   dependencies between the child parent wavelet coefficients of Image
   signals to enhance the noisy images. In this paper, we intend to find
   wavelet structures which are more suitable for speech enhancement based
   on bivariate shrinkage. We show that the dependencies between the child
   parent wavelet coefficients can only be modeled rather easily up to two
   stages of two-channel discrete wavelet transform using the Sendur's pdf.
   However, the bivariate shrinkage function works better in three-channel
   redundant wavelet filter-bank with dilation 2, since it has a joint
   distribution which is similar to the Sendur's pdf up to the fourth stage
   of decomposition for speech signals. Furthermore, we show that
   three-channel higher density wavelet obtained by eliminating the
   downsampling part of the third channel is more suitable for the
   bivariate shrinkage function when it is utilized for speech enhancement.
   Then, appropriate filter values for three-channel higher density wavelet
   filter-bank are found. Moreover, we propose four-channel double density
   discrete wavelet filter-bank which leads to some improvement in speech
   enhancement results. Since the probability of speech presence is higher
   in lower frequencies, we suggest level-dependent bivariate shrinkage.
   Finally, Sendur bivariate shrinkage is optimized for speech enhancement
   and new methods are proposed by combining former successful methods with
   the bivariate shrinkage function. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to perform a probabilistic risk analysis
   (PRA) to assess the health risk of Cadmium (Cd), Copper (Cu), and Zinc
   (Zn) through the consumption of food crops grown on farm lands
   fertilized by biosolids. The risk analysis was conducted using 8 years
   of historical heavy metal data (2005-2013) of the municipal biosolids
   generated by a nearby treatment facility considering one-time and
   long-term biosolids land application scenarios for a range of 5-100 t/ha
   fertilizer application rate. The 95th percentile of the hazard index
   (HI) increased from 0.124 to 0.179 when the rate of fertilizer
   application increased from 5 to 100 t/ha at one-time biosolids land
   application. The HI at long-term biosolids land application was also
   found 1.3 and 1.9 times greater than that of one-time land application
   at fertilizer application rates of 5 and 100 t/ha, respectively. Rice
   ingestion had more contribution to the HI than vegetable ingestion. Cd
   and Cu were also found to have more contribution to the health risk
   associated to vegetable and rice ingestion, respectively. Results
   indicated no potential risk to the human health even at long-term
   biosolids land application scenario at 100 t/ha fertilizer application
   rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Procurement is a key process in construction project management. The
   current construction procurement practices have been widely criticized
   for disregarding sustainability in the project life cycle. At present,
   there is a gap of knowledge on status-quo of sustainable procurement in
   Canada. Therefore, the objective of this study is to review sustainable
   procurement practices in the Canadian construction industry. A multi
   method research design was used in this study by combining both
   qualitative and quantitative research methods. Three research tools were
   used in the study; namely questionnaire surveys, review of documents,
   and semi-structured interviews. Data triangulation was used to combine
   the results of all three research tools. The study showed that
   sustainable procurement initiatives have rarely been used in the
   Canadian construction industry. Limited sustainability initiatives are
   used in the project procurement, while environmental sustainability
   criteria are given the prominence, Furthermore a significant deficiency
   is observed in bid evaluation involving triple bottom line of
   sustainability. A majority of construction industry respondents agreed
   that sustainable procurement is a long due necessity and highlighted
   government regulations as the main driver for sustainable procurement.
   This study may be the first step to promote the use of sustainable
   procurement in the Canadian construction sector. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A series of cellulose acetate (CA) ternary system solutions consisting
   of the CA, N,N-dimethylacetamide, and various non-solvents, such as
   1-propanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol, 1-decanol, 1,3-propane diol, and
   glycerol, were prepared, and the effects of the component composition on
   the solutions characteristics and electrospinning were examined. In
   particular, the effects of the nonsolvent concentration, structure, and
   degree of miscibility with other components were studied. In some cases,
   increasing the nonsolvent content increased the solution viscosity and
   facilitated the electrospinning process. However, we found that
   electrospinning was also governed by the structure of the nonsolvents
   and by the solution viscosity. An increase in the number of hydroxyl
   groups or an increase in the hydrocarbon chain length of the
   monohydroxyl alcohol nonsolvent improved the fiber formation. The
   calculated Hansen sphere {[}D(S-p)] values of the CA ternary system
   solution were then used to explain their electrospinnability. The
   increases in the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of system caused by
   changes in the nonsolvent structure increased the D(S-p) values and
   improved fiber formation in electrospinning process. The calculated
   D(S-p) values were also shown to be in good agreement with the obtained
   microscopy images of the electrospun fiber. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{A comparative study has been performed on Ni2P/SiO2 catalysts prepared
   by: (i) conventional temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of calcined
   precursors following wet impregnation of the support, (ii) TPR of a sol
   gel prepared NiO/SiO2 precursor impregnated with NH4H2PO4 and (iii) a
   solution-phase reaction in the presence of the SiO2 support using
   Ni(acac)(2) and trioctylphosphine. Catalyst characterization shows that
   the Ni2P prepared by the solution-phase method has a uniform particle
   size (7.5 +/- 0.8 nm) and H species can easily transfer from the nickel
   sites to the SiO2 support on this catalyst. These properties result in a
   high NaBH4 methanolysis to hydrogen activity. In contrast, the sol gel
   prepared Ni2P/SiO2 has a relatively high catalytic activity for phenol
   hydrodeoxygenation due to a higher concentration of Ni delta+ species
   that act as Lewis acid sites and metal sites, and a higher Ni2P
   crystallinity. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{Gas diffusion layer (GDL) is a crucial component in polymer electrode
   membrane fuel cells. Being highly porous, this layer facilitates
   transport of species from the flow field to the reaction sites and vice
   versa. One of the main characteristics of GDLs is porosity, which has
   been measured using a number of different methods including 3D X-ray
   microtomography (mu XCT). Despite the extensive use of this technique in
   investigating the properties of GDLs, there are variations in the
   results since the surface of the three dimensional volume used to obtain
   the bulk porosity of GDLs is difficult to quantify. In this paper, a
   robust surface identification method, referred to as ``Rolling Ball{''},
   is introduced to identify systematically the surface and hence porosity
   of GDLs from m XCT datasets. In this method, the diameter of the GDL
   carbon fiber is used as the characteristic length in combination with a
   Distance Transform (DT) to robustly identify the surface topology. This
   method is then used to estimate porosity of four different samples of a
   highly porous GDL, SGL 25BA. The results between different samples show
   great consistency. A comparison with other methods is also performed,
   and variations in the bulk and in-plane porosity are observed. The main
   advantage of the proposed Rolling Ball method compared to prior methods
   used in the literature is that it uses the carbon fiber diameter to
   identify the surface results in a systematic fashion. This methodology
   can be easily applied to other highly porous media. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Performance-based design offers a more direct, non-prescriptive and
   rational approach over more traditional approaches used for the design
   of buildings and other structures. However, performance-based design
   requires the use of extensive nonlinear analyses on three-dimensional
   building models and typically requires significant computational
   capabilities and/or time to conduct such analyses. A practical way to
   overcome these limitations is to utilize recent advantages in parallel
   computing using cloud-based servers to conduct the necessary analyses.
   This approach can be used as a cost-effective way to conduct structural
   analyses in a fraction of the time compared with traditional
   computational methods. This paper explores the use of parallel and cloud
   computing in the performance-based design and analysis of tall
   buildings. Two case studies are presented that highlight the application
   of high-performance computing for the nonlinear dynamic analysis of a
   detailed 52-story building model. These case studies highlight both the
   cost and time benefits provided by high-performance computing for
   performance-based earthquake engineering. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley

Title = {{Force Ripple Attenuation of 6-DOF Direct Drive Permanent Magnet Planar
   Levitating Synchronous Motors}},

Abstract = {{A novel direct drive 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) planar levitating
   synchronous motor has been developed that is comprised of multiple 1-D
   magnet arrays attached to a moving stage and multiple stationary 1-D
   coils built as a printed circuit board
   (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-r4Tv7GbB8o). Together these make up a
   set of four 2-DOF Lorentz force motors that actuate the moving stage in
   6-DOF over a large planar range. This motor topology allows scalability
   with minimal increase in controller and drive complexity as well as
   direct drive actuation of a single mover body without intervening
   bearing elements, making it ideal for a variety of industrial automation
   and manufacturing applications. For high performance applications that
   require rapid high-precision motion, a linear, position independent
   force characteristic is desired to minimize the controller effort and
   reduce the intrinsic force disturbances, which adversely affect
   positioning accuracy. In the presented planar levitating synchronous
   motor, the primary source of force disturbance is the interaction
   between higher order spatial harmonics of the magnetic field of the
   mover and the commutated excitation current in the stationary coils.
   This paper presents analysis and experiment results of a novel method of
   reducing force ripple associated with permanent magnet planar levitating
   synchronous motors through the design of appropriately split and spaced
   magnet arrays. This method internally cancels out specific force
   harmonics within each 2-DOF motor, without adding controller complexity
   or resorting to higher order magnet arrays. Experimental results
   demonstrate force ripple reduction from 1.1\% without magnet array
   splitting to 0.12\% with magnet array splitting.}},

Abstract = {{Solar plants based on single-stage conversion photovoltaic (PV)
   inverters (no dc-dc boost stage) have gained popularity due to their
   simplicity, high efficiency, and cost effectiveness. Existing PV plants
   mostly operate under 1000 V and are subject to wide dc-bus voltage
   variations due to the effect of PV cell temperature and the voltage of
   the maximum power point (well below the open-circuit voltage). In
   particular, attractive locations, such as U.S.-Canada mountain and
   central regions, are subject to extreme PV surface temperatures, making
   the dc-bus voltage variation a challenge for single-stage solar
   inverters. This paper investigates 1500 V solar inverters with a focus
   on dc-bus voltage range extension capabilities through novel modulation
   and power devices utilization. A comparative analysis with the existing
   1000 V solar inverters is presented to illustrate the significant
   advantages of the wide dc-bus range in 1500 V systems. A lower voltage
   limit in the dc-bus is achieved by employing a novel voltage reactive
   power dc-bus control strategy and modified modulation. A higher dc-bus
   peak voltage is obtained by maximizing the use of power switches. As a
   result, the 1500 V inverter dc-bus voltage is significantly extended to
   capture energy under extreme PV surface temperatures, greatly improving
   the limited range of traditional 1000 V inverters. Simulations and
   experimental results using a three-phase three-level neutral
   point-clamped inverter level are presented to validate the proposed
   dc-bus extension range, control strategy, and modulation scheme.}},

Abstract = {{We present experimental data on the thermodynamics and kinetics of
   bubble nucleation and growth in weakly H2O-oversaturated rhyolitic
   melts. The high-temperature (900-1100 degrees C) experiments involve
   heating of rhyolitic obsidian from Hrafntinnuhryggur, Krafla, Iceland to
   above their glass transition temperature (Tg approximate to 690 degrees
   C) at 0.1 MPa for times of 0.25-24 h. During experiments, the rhyolite
   cores increase in volume as H2O vapor-filled bubbles nucleate and
   expand. The extent of vesiculation, as tracked by porosity, is mapped in
   temperature-time (T-t) space. At constant temperature and for a
   characteristic dwell time, the rhyolite cores achieve a maximum volume
   where the T-t conditions reach thermochemical equilibrium. For each T-t
   snapshot of vesiculation, we use 3-D analysis of X-ray computed
   tomographic (XCT) images of the quenched cores to obtain the bubble
   number density (BND) and bubble-size distribution (BSD). BNDs for the
   experimental cores are insensitive to T and t, indicating a single
   nucleation event. All BSDs converge to a common distribution,
   independent of T, melt viscosity (), or initial degree of saturation,
   suggesting a common growth process. We use these data to calibrate an
   empirical model for predicting the rates and amounts of vesiculation in
   rhyolitic melts as a function of and thermochemical affinity (A): two
   computable parameters that are dependent on T, pressure and H2O content.
   The model reproduces the experimental data set and data from the
   literature to within experimental error, and has application to natural
   volcanic systems where bubble formation and growth are not diffusion
   limited (e.g., lavas, domes, ignimbrites, conduit infill).}},

Abstract = {{Enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) relies on diverse but
   specialized microbial communities to mediate the cycling and ultimate
   removal of phosphorus from municipal wastewaters. However, little is
   known about microbial activity and dynamics in relation to process
   fluctuations in EBPR ecosystems. Here, we monitored temporal changes in
   microbial community structure and potential activity across each
   bioreactor zone in a pilot-scale EBPR treatment plant by examining the
   ratio of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) to SSU rRNA gene (rDNA)
   over a 120 day study period. Although the majority of operational
   taxonomic units (OTUs) in the EBPR ecosystem were rare, many maintained
   high potential activities based on SSU rRNA : rDNA ratios, suggesting
   that rare OTUs contribute substantially to protein synthesis potential
   in EBPR ecosystems. Few significant differences in OTU abundance and
   activity were observed between bioreactor redox zones, although
   differences in temporal activity were observed among phylogenetically
   cohesive OTUs. Moreover, observed temporal activity patterns could not
   be explained by measured process parameters, suggesting that other
   ecological drivers, such as grazing or viral lysis, modulated community
   interactions. Taken together, these results point towards complex
   interactions selected for within the EBPR ecosystem and highlight a
   previously unrecognized functional potential among low abundance
   microorganisms in engineered ecosystems.}},

   Characteristics and Comparative Performance}},
Journal = {{FUEL CELLS}},

Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The microporous layer (MPL) provides many beneficial properties for
   performance improvement of H-2 PEM fuel cells, particularly with respect
   to water management and two-phase (gas/liquid) flow dynamics. However,
   the interface between the catalyst layer (CL) and MPL could be a source
   of additional overpotential losses due to poor electronic conductivity
   and/or mass transfer limitations. This is particularly important for low
   loading CLs which may suffer from spatial disconnect with the
   micro-scaled features of conventional MPLs. In an effort to better
   understand the factors influencing the MPL vertical bar CL interface,
   the conventional carbon MPL is comparatively studied with respect to
   three alternative layers: graphene foam, perforated graphitic sheet and
   perforated stainless steel. The graphene foam shows beneficial
   interfacial properties that contribute to electrode kinetic and ohmic
   improvements during polarization. This can be attributed to the
   graphene's ability to conform at local length scales due to its unique
   flake-like structure (achieved upon compression), an ability to
   intimately adhere to the CL and the layer's superior conductivity.
   Further investigation through single cell performance tests supports the
   application of the graphene foam as an MPL alternative. The results also
   highlight the interplay of various factors that influence the MPL
   vertical bar CL interface and ultimately the overall polarization
   performance, such as: morphology, conductivity, connectivity,
   compression and adhesive effects between layer components.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To compare the accuracy and efficiency of the respiratory

   Volunteers used both devices to measure RR from reference videos of
   infants and children. Measurements were compared using correlation,
   Bland-Altman analysis, error metrics and time taken. RESULTS:
   Measurements with either device were highly correlated to the reference
   (r = 0.991 and r = 0.982), and to each other (r = 0.973). RRate had a
   larger bias than the ARI Timer (0.6 vs. 0.04 br/min), but tighter limits
   of agreement (-4.5 to 3.3 br/min vs. -5.5 to 5.5 br/min). RRate was more
   accurate than the ARI Timer (percentage error 10.6\% vs. 14.8\%, root
   mean square error 2.1 vs. 2.8 br/min and normalized root mean square
   error 5.6\% vs. 7.5\%). RRate measurements were 52.7 seconds (95\% CI

   measured RR quicker with a similar accuracy compared to the ARI Timer.}},

Abstract = {{A novel, biodegradable calorimetric chemosensor for Cu2+ ions detection
   in aqueous water was designed using poly (aspartic acid) nanofibrous
   hydrogel, based on the strong complexation ability of poly (aspartic
   acid) nanofibrous hydrogel and the specific color change phenomena of
   biuret reaction. The poly (aspartic acid) nanofibrous hydrogel sensor
   exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity toward Cu2+ ions over other
   competing ions with a detection limit of 0.01 mg/L Furthermore, the poly
   (aspartic acid) nanofibrous hydrogel sensor displayed a sensitive
   colorimetric response in the presence of Cu2+ ions according to the pH
   values it exposed to. The on-off-on color switching behavior upon pH
   alternation between 14 and 1 illustrated an excellent reversible color
   change. This low-cost, biodegradable and reversible sensor possessed a
   promising application for practical Cu2+ ions detection in real water
   samples and provided a new insight into the design of colorimetric
   sensor based on nanofibrous hydrogel. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Mercury emissions from artisanal mining present a significant
   development and environmental challenge globally. The Colombia Mercury
   Project (CMP), a joint initiative of the United Nations Industrial
   Development Organization (UNIDO), the Government of Antioquia, Colombia,
   and various other organizations, conducted a three year mercury
   reduction initiative in the Department of Antioquia. The CMP estimate
   that they prevented 46-70 tonnes of mercury from being used and released
   by various methods: technical assistance, elimination of whole ore
   amalgamation, mercury vapour capture, and introduction of alternative
   (and cleaner) extraction technologies all contributed to these
   successes.
   Maps of airborne mercury concentrations show the distribution and
   intensity of mercury emissions that can be used to estimate human health
   risk. Direct comparison with international air quality standards is
   possible by extrapolating annual average concentrations from short term
   atmospheric monitoring. Mercury vapour concentrations in the urban core
   of Segovia, Colombia have decreased 50\% from 2010 to 2012, despite a
   30\% increase in gold production. Part of the reduction may be displaced
   emissions, as sources have been relocated to adjacent rural areas. This
   is the first time that reductions in environmental concentrations of
   mercury associated with a mercury abatement project have been measured.
   The mercury mitigation efforts applied by UNIDO provide a hopeful model
   for future remediation campaigns. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Life cycle greenhouse gas analysis of bioenergy generation alternatives

Journal = {{RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{105}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Utilization of forest and wood residues as bioenergy feedstock in some
   remote communities could reduce environmental burdens and increase
   development opportunities. In a thorough bioenergy project planning, in
   addition to the economic performance, the potential greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions from investment alternatives should be considered. We present
   an economic assessment and a life cycle analysis of GHG emissions of
   alternative bioenergy systems, which include four combustion and
   gasification technologies with different capacities (0.5 MW, 2 MW and 5
   MW), in two remote communities in British Columbia, Canada. In the
   analysis, all stages from harvesting to energy production are included,
   and the GHG emissions of the baseline system in each community (the
   current situation with all the products and services it provides) are
   used as the reference for comparison. Results of this study show that
   for small scale alternatives (0.5 MW and 2 MW), cogenerating plants
   using boiler/steam turbines generate the cheapest electricity, while for
   larger scale alternatives (5 MW), the most economical plant alternative
   is a gasification cogeneration system. In the community where all energy
   needs are currently satisfied using fossil fuels, and all biomass
   residues (forest and sawmill residues) are currently disposed by
   burning, net reductions of up to 40,909 t of CO2 equivalent GHG
   emissions could be achieved with the installation of a 5 MW boiler/steam
   turbine cogenerating heat and electricity. In the community where the
   current energy mix is mostly supplied from other renewable sources (i.e.
   hydro), and where forest residues are disposed by burning and sawmill
   residues are landfilled, the net GHG emission reductions that can be
   achieved with a bioenergy system are considerably lower (2535 t of CO2
   equivalent emissions with a 5 MW cogenerating gasification system) or
   null, since the carbon capture of current biomass disposal in landfill
   outweighs the carbon emission reduction of most bioenergy alternatives.

Abstract = {{A blind comparison of independent invasive (downhole, standard
   penetration, bender element) and noninvasive microtremor shear-wave
   velocity (Vs) profiling is presented for 11 strong-motion stations in
   central and southern Chile that recorded the 2010 M-W 8.8 Maule
   earthquake. For the majority of stations, site classification based on
   average V-s in the upper 30 m (V-s30) is consistent irrespective of
   methodology. For a variety of geological conditions, excellent to good
   agreement is obtained between invasive and noninvasive V-s structure at
   five stations over the entire borehole length and in the uppermost layer
   at three stations. Site classification based on site period is evaluated
   using earthquake and microtremor recordings. Short site periods are
   observed at stiff coarse-grained stations whereas longer site periods
   are observed at soft fine-grained stations. The use of both V-s30 and
   site period criteria are recommended in future revisions of the Chilean
   building code for robust earthquake site response characterization. (c)

   comparing the time-average voidage in a region of the bed operated with

   turbulent fluidization regime was visually inspected from images
   obtained by the X-ray system and quantitatively characterized in terms
   of statistical parameters associated with grayscale intensity
   probability distribution functions (PDF). Voidage data obtained by
   different measurement techniques are compared with time-average voidages

Abstract = {{As an emerging technology, vehicular networks have evolved into an
   indispensable part of intelligent transport systems (ITS). Thus, this
   paper focuses on the performance analysis of the cluster-based
   heterogeneous vehicular networks (C-HetVNETs) with dynamic data arrival
   rate and different vehicle densities. Different from the previous
   studies, which mainly focus on network capacity in just one
   wireless-technology-supported vehicular network, such as dedicated
   short-range communication (DSRC) or Third-Generation Partnership Project
   (3GPP) long-term evolution (LTE), we focus on the different performance
   metrics of uplink transmission in C-HetVNET. First, we develop a
   framework of C-HetVNET by employing the cluster mechanism. Then, the
   performance analysis models of intracluster and intercluster
   communications are designed based on a Markov queuing model. Due to the
   explosion of state space, model decomposition and iteration techniques
   are proposed to handle this problem. Based on the developed analytical
   model, the performance metrics of different scheduling schemes, in terms
   of throughput, delay, dropping probability, and queue length, are
   studied and compared. The performances of C-HetVNETs under different
   vehicle densities and data arrival rates are obtained via analysis and
   simulations, which give a useful guideline for network configuration of
   C-HetVNETs. The proposed analytical model can be also used for
   heterogeneous or two-tier network analysis and validation of network
   simulators under various traffic conditions. In addition, we investigate
   the performances of LTE networks used for vehicular communications for
   the purpose of performance comparison.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic, accurate and real-time registration is an important step in
   providing effective guidance and successful anatomic restoration in
   ultrasound (US)-based computer assisted orthopedic surgery. We propose a
   method in which local phase-based bone surfaces, extracted from
   intra-operative US data, are registered to pre-operatively segmented
   computed tomography data. Extracted bone surfaces are downsampled and
   reinforced with high curvature features. A novel hierarchical
   simplification algorithm is used to further optimize the point clouds.
   The final point clouds are represented as Gaussian mixture models and
   iteratively matched by minimizing the dissimilarity between them using
   an L2 metric. For 44 clinical data sets from 25 pelvic fracture patients
   and 49 phantom data sets, we report mean surface registration accuracies
   of 0.31 and 0.77 mm, respectively, with an average registration time of
   1.41 s. Our results suggest the viability and potential of the chosen
   method for real-time intra-operative registration in orthopedic surgery.

Abstract = {{In future mobile computing systems, cognitive radio (CR) emerges as a
   promising solution for alleviating spectrum shortage and satisfying the
   high bandwidth demand of multimedia streaming, while it presents tough
   challenges in provisioning user experience-perceived quality of service
   (QoS) and conserving transmission energy. In this paper, an adaptive
   rate control (ARC) scheme with the aid of the receive buffer is
   presented for energy-efficient transmission of streaming media over CR
   with QoS guarantee. The QoS metric, either display smoothness or
   transmission delay, is quantified by the state of the receive buffer.
   Cross-layer information is utilized to form a closed-loop feedback
   optimal control. A novel analytical model called event-driven
   discrete-time Markov control process is introduced to formulate the
   QoS-guaranteed energy-efficient ARC problem. Based on potential theory,
   a policy iteration algorithm that combines potentials estimation and
   stochastic approximation is proposed for finding the optimal policy
   online. By exploiting the system dynamics, this algorithm does not
   depend on any prior knowledge of channel availability or fading
   statistics, and it can converge to the global optimum with a low
   computational cost and reasonable speed. Simulation results demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Title = {{Simulations of radiation pressure experiments narrow down the energy and
   momentum of light in matter}},
Journal = {{REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Consensus on a single electrodynamic theory has yet to be reached.
   Discord was seeded over a century ago when Abraham and Minkowski
   proposed different forms of electromagnetic momentum density and has
   since expanded in scope with the gradual introduction of other forms of
   momentum and force densities. Although degenerate sets of electrodynamic
   postulates can be fashioned to comply with global energy and momentum
   conservation, hope remains to isolate a single theory based on detailed
   comparison between force density predictions and radiation pressure
   experiments. This comparison is two-fold challenging because there are
   just a handful of quantitative radiation pressure measurements over the
   past century and the solutions developed from different postulates,
   which consist of approximate expressions and inferential deductions, are
   scattered throughout the literature. For these reasons, it is
   appropriate to conduct a consolidated and comprehensive re-analysis of
   past experiments under the assumption that the momentum and energy of
   light in matter are degenerate. We create a combined
   electrodynamic/fluid dynamic simulation testbed that uses five
   historically significant sets of electrodynamic postulates, including
   those by Abraham and Minkowski, to model radiation pressure under
   diverse configurations with minimal assumptions. This leads to new
   interpretations of landmark investigations of light momentum, including
   the Balazs thought experiment, the Jones-Richards and Jones-Leslie
   measurements of radiation pressure on submerged mirrors, observations of
   laser-deformed fluid surfaces, and experiments on optical trapping and
   tractor beaming of dielectric particles. We discuss the merits and
   demerits of each set of postulates when compared to available
   experimental evidence and fundamental conservation laws. Of the five
   sets of postulates, the Abraham and Einstein-Laub postulates provide the
   greatest consistency with observations and the most physically plausible
   descriptions of electrodynamic interactions. Force density predictions
   made by these two postulates are unique under many conditions and their
   experimental isolation is potentially within reach.}},

Abstract = {{A biosensor can be defined as a compact analytical device or unit
   incorporating a biological or biologically derived sensitive recognition
   element immobilized on a physicochemical transducer to measure one or
   more analytes. Microfluidic systems, on the other hand, provide
   throughput processing, enhance transport for controlling the flow
   conditions, increase the mixing rate of different reagents, reduce
   sample and reagents volume (down to nanoliter), increase sensitivity of
   detection, and utilize the same platform for both sample preparation and
   detection. In view of these advantages, the integration of microfluidic
   and biosensor technologies provides the ability to merge chemical and
   biological components into a single platform and offers new
   opportunities for future biosensing applications including portability,
   disposability, real-time detection, unprecedented accuracies, and
   simultaneous analysis of different analytes in a single device. This
   review aims at representing advances and achievements in the field of
   microfluidic-based biosensing. The review also presents examples
   extracted from the literature to demonstrate the advantages of merging
   microfluidic and biosensing technologies and illustrate the versatility
   that such integration promises in the future biosensing for emerging

Abstract = {{Coverage control is one of the most fundamental issues in directional

   directional sensor network is formulated as a multi-objective
   optimization problem. It takes into account the coverage rate of the

   network. The coverage problem considered in this paper is characterized
   by the geographical irregularity of the sensed events and heterogeneity
   of the sensor nodes in terms of sensing radius, field of angle and
   communication radius. To solve this multi-objective problem, we
   introduce a learning automata-based coral reef algorithm for adaptive
   parameter selection and use a novel Tchebycheff decomposition method to
   decompose the multi-objective problem into a single-objective problem.
   Simulation results show the consistent superiority of the proposed

Abstract = {{This paper reports an electrothermally active stent targeted at the
   application to endohyperthermia treatment for in-stent restenosis, a
   common complication that causes failures of stent implantation. The
   stainless-steel stent designed to function as an electrical inductor is
   integrated with a flexible capacitor strip to form a passive resonant
   circuit. This stent-based circuit serves as a frequency-selective
   wireless heater that is controlled using a tuned radiofrequency (RF)
   electromagnetic field radiated externally, locally applying thermal
   stress to the stented site to suppress neointimal hyperplasia, the main
   cause of in-stent restenosis. The fabricated stent device with the
   initial diameter of 2 mm is expanded up to 6 mm in diameter to
   simultaneously deploy the resonant heater circuit and the mechanical
   scaffolding structure inside an artificial artery using a balloon
   catheter. The expanded device is revealed to generate electromotive
   forces close to 1V and shows heat generation with temperature rise of
   >30 degrees C in air when resonated using an RF source power of 320 mW.
   Temporal and frequency characteristics are evaluated to demonstrate
   rapid heating ability with strong frequency sensitivity. These results
   encourage further studies and design optimization towards wireless stent
   hyperthermia that potentially offers a novel therapeutic path to
   long-term inhibition and management of in-stent restenosis. (C) 2015

   sections by a final refinement step. Furthermore, postprocessing
   algorithms have been developed to calculate the length and coarseness of
   the segmented fibres. The fibre segmentation algorithm is the first ever
   reported method for the automated segmentation of the tortuous
   three-dimensional morphology of papermaking fibres within

Abstract = {{A mathematical model using the commercial finite element method software
   package DEFORM 2D was developed and validated to model extrusion of
   AA3xxx aluminum alloys rods. Using a simple approach based on the
   initial grain size and material flow during extrusion, the deformed
   grain thickness during and after extrusion could be predicted with good
   accuracy. The model predicted deformed grain thickness, which, in
   conjunction with knowledge of the subgrain size during deformation, was
   used to predict the occurrence of the creation of a different
   microstructure near the surface of the extrudate as compared to the
   centre. The model predicts with good accuracy the deformed grain
   thickness and how it varies spatially both through the diameter of the
   extruded rod and along its length. The model predicts that the deformed
   grain thickness decreases dramatically from the center to the surface of
   the extrudate and how this is impacted by the extrusion ratio. Applying
   a cutoff value of the subgrain size, allows the prediction of the
   critical radius beyond which a more granular microstructure occurs at
   the surface. Optical microscopy and orientation imaging microscopy of
   the extruded AA3xxx rods were used to validate the model predictions of
   the deformed grain structure, both in terms of the grain thickness and
   the critical radius, beyond which the microstructure becomes more
   granular close to the rod surface. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials

Abstract = {{Bioprinting is a rapidly developing technique for biofabrication.
   Because of its high resolution and the ability to print living cells,
   bioprinting has been widely used in artificial tissue and organ
   generation as well as microscale living cell deposition. In this paper,
   we present a low-cost stereolithography-based bioprinting system that
   uses visible light crosslinkable bioinks. This low-cost
   stereolithography system was built around a commercial projector with a
   simple water filter to prevent harmful infrared radiation from the
   projector. The visible light crosslinking was achieved by using a
   mixture of polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) and gelatin
   methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel with eosin Y based photoinitiator. Three
   different concentrations of hydrogel mixtures (10\% PEG, 5\% PEG +5\%
   GelMA, and 2.5\% PEG + 7.5\% GelMA, allw/v) were studied with the
   presented systems. The mechanical properties and microstructure of the
   developed bioink were measured and discussed in detail. Several
   cell-free hydrogel patterns were generated to demonstrate the resolution
   of the solution. Experimental results with NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells show
   that this system can produce a highly vertical 3D structure with 50 mu m
   resolution and 85\% cell viability for at least five days. The developed
   system provides a low-cost visible light stereolithography solution and
   has the potential to be widely used in tissue engineering and
   bioengineering for microscale cell patterning.}},

Journal = {{HYDROMETALLURGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{158}},
Pages = {{149-156}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Lower extraction of silver than gold in conventional cyanidation process
   has been commonly observed in practice. Acanthite (Ag2S) is one of the
   typical silver minerals with low solubility in aqueous cyanide medium,
   which contributes to low overall silver extraction. The performance of
   different auxiliary oxidants, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2),
   calcium peroxide (CaO2), and LeachWELL (TM), in cyanidation of synthetic
   silver sulfide has been investigated with the purpose of increasing the
   rate and extent of silver extraction. The addition of H2O2 does not only
   promote cyanidation of silver sulfide, but also increases the
   consumption of cyanide and hydroxide. Comparatively, the addition of
   CaO2 exhibits less impact on silver extraction under the experimental
   conditions. LeachWELL (TM) has a better performance than H2O2 and CaO2
   in terms of increasing silver extraction and reducing cyanide and
   alkaline consumptions. The slurry pH exhibits insignificant effect on
   the performance of LeachWELL (TM) during leaching of silver sulfide.
   Similar performance of LeachWELL (TM) and lead nitrate on cyanidation of
   silver sulfide indicates that Pb(NO3)(2) acts as the main active
   component in cyanidation process. Leaching of natural lead-bearing
   acanthite sample without auxiliary oxidant results in higher silver
   extraction compared to leaching of synthetic Ag2S. Addition of H2O2 or
   CaO2 during leaching of lead-bearing acanthite can promote silver
   extraction while the addition of LeachWELL (TM) exhibits little effect.

Abstract = {{In this letter, we propose a practical non-linear energy harvesting
   model and design a resource allocation algorithm for simultaneous
   wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems. The algorithm
   design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem for the
   maximization of the total harvested power at energy harvesting receivers
   subject to minimum required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios
   (SINRs) at multiple information receivers. We transform the considered
   non-convex objective function from sum-of-ratios form into an equivalent
   objective function in subtractive form, which enables the derivation of
   an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm. In each iteration,
   a rank-constrained semidefinite program (SDP) is solved optimally by SDP
   relaxation. Numerical results unveil a substantial performance gain that
   can be achieved if the resource allocation design is based on the
   proposed non-linear energy harvesting model instead of the traditional
   linear model.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{226}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We study steady inertial flows of a Bingham fluid through 2D
   ``washout{''} geometries, that represent longitudinal sections of an oil
   and gas well under construction, thus extending our previous work
   (Roustaei et al., 2015) into the inertial regime. The washout geometry
   is characterised by dimensionless depth h and length delta(-1). The
   other dimensionless parameters of problem are the Reynolds number Re and
   Bingham number B. The effects of increasing Re were studied for fixed B
   and for fixed Hedstrom number, He = ReB. The latter represents an
   increase in flow rate for fixed geometry and fluid properties. In both
   cases we observed that the variation in flowing area of the washout
   (i.e. that area that is mobilised) was non-monotone. Increasing Re
   resulted in a straightening of the streamlines passing through the
   washout region, in the main part of the channel. For fixed He, beyond a
   first critical value of Re the flowing area was observed to decrease,
   i.e. increasing the flow rate results in larger parts of the washout
   being static, as is quite counterintuitive and contrary to the
   industrial perception that pumping faster will circulate/condition the
   mud better. This trend persists for a significant range of Re. On
   passing a second critical value of Re, we observe the onset of zones of
   recirculation within the washout. The flowing area thus increases but
   the area of washout from which fluid is displaced during conditioning
   continues to decrease. Finally, we considered self-selection of the flow
   geometry, as observed in Roustaei et al. (2015) for Re = 0. We conclude
   that the same phenomenon holds in inertial flows for a given geometry,
   i.e. at large h the flowing areas of washouts with static regions become
   similar in shape. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{13-23}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have quantified relationships between bicyclist exposure to
   air pollution and roadway and traffic variables. As a result,
   transportation professionals are unable to easily estimate exposure
   differences among bicycle routes for network planning, design, and
   analysis. This paper estimates the effects of roadway and travel
   characteristics on bicyclist exposure concentrations, controlling for
   meteorology and background conditions. Concentrations of volatile
   organic compounds (VOC) and carbon monoxide (CO) are modeled using
   high-resolution data collected on-road. Results indicate that average
   daily traffic (ADT) provides a parsimonious way to characterize the
   impact of roadway characteristics on bicyclists' exposure. VOC and CO
   exposure increase by approximately 2\% per 1000 ADT, robust to different
   regression model specifications. Exposure on off-street facilities is
   higher than at a park, but lower than on-street riding - with the
   exception of a path through an industrial corridor with significantly
   higher exposure. VOC exposure is 20\% higher near intersections.
   Traffic, roadway, and travel variables have more explanatory power in
   the VOC models than the CO model. The quantifications in this paper
   enable calculation of expected exposure differences among travel paths
   for planning and routing applications. The findings also have policy and
   design implications to reduce bicyclists' exposure. Separation between
   bicyclists and motor vehicle traffic is a necessary but not sufficient
   condition to reduce exposure concentrations; off-street paths are not
   always low-exposure facilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{449-458}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an effective way to recover energy and
   nutrients from organic waste; however, several issues including the
   solubilization of bound nutrients and the production of corrosive,
   highly odorous and toxic volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in AD biogas
   can limit its wider adoption. This study explored the effects of adding
   two different doses of ferric chloride, aluminum sulfate and magnesium
   hydroxide directly to the feed of complete mix semi-continuously fed
   mesophilic ADs on eight of the most odorous VSCs in AD biogas at three
   different organic loading rates (OLR). Ferric chloride was shown to be
   extremely effective in reducing VSCs by up to 87\%, aluminum sulfate had
   the opposite effect and increased VSC levels by up to 920\%, while
   magnesium hydroxide was not shown to have any significant impact. Ferric
   chloride, aluminum sulfate and magnesium hydroxide were effective in
   reducing the concentration of orthophosphate in AD effluent although
   both levels of alum addition caused digester failure at elevated OLRs.
   Extensive foaming was observed within the magnesium hydroxide dosed
   digesters, particularly at higher doses and high OLRs. Certain metal
   salt additions may be a valuable tool in overcoming barriers to AD and
   to meet regulatory targets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The key steps involved in X100 pipeline steel passivation in
   bicarbonate-based simulated soil solutions from the pre-passive to
   transpassive potential regions have been analyzed here using a step-wise
   anodizing-electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) routine.
   Pre-passive steps involve parallel dissolution-adsorption in early
   stages followed by clear diffusion-adsorption control shortly before
   iron hydroxide formation. Aggressive NS4 chlorides/sulfate promote steel
   dissolution whilst inhibiting diffusion in pre-passive steps. Diffusive
   and adsorptive effects remain during iron hydroxide formation, but
   withdraw shortly thereafter during its removal and the development of
   the stable iron carbonate passive layer. Passive layer protectiveness is
   evaluated using EIS fitting, current density analysis, and correlations
   with semiconductive parameters, consistently revealing improved
   robustness in colder, bicarbonate-rich, chloride/sulfate-free
   conditions. Ferrous oxide formation at higher potentials results in
   markedly lower impedances with disordered behavior, and the involvement
   of the iron(III) valence state is observed in Mott-Schottky tests
   exclusively for 75 degrees C conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Modelling the regional variability of the probability of high
   trihalomethane occurrence in municipal drinking water}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{187}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The regional variability of the probability of occurrence of high total
   trihalomethane (TTHM) levels was assessed using multilevel logistic
   regression models that incorporate environmental and infrastructure
   characteristics. The models were structured in a three-level
   hierarchical configuration: samples (first level), drinking water
   utilities (DWUs, second level) and natural regions, an ecological
   hierarchical division from the Quebec ecological framework of reference
   (third level). They considered six independent variables: precipitation,
   temperature, source type, seasons, treatment type and pH. The average
   probability of TTHM concentrations exceeding the targeted threshold was
   18.1 \%. The probability was influenced by seasons, treatment type,
   precipitations and temperature. The variance at all levels was
   significant, showing that the probability of TTHM concentrations
   exceeding the threshold is most likely to be similar if located within
   the same DWU and within the same natural region. However, most of the
   variance initially attributed to natural regions was explained by
   treatment types and clarified by spatial aggregation on treatment types.
   Nevertheless, even after controlling for treatment type, there was still
   significant regional variability of the probability of TTHM
   concentrations exceeding the threshold. Regional variability was
   particularly important for DWUs using chlorination alone since they lack
   the appropriate treatment required to reduce the amount of natural
   organic matter (NOM) in source water prior to disinfection. Results
   presented herein could be of interest to authorities in identifying
   regions with specific needs regarding drinking water quality and for
   epidemiological studies identifying geographical variations in
   population exposure to disinfection by-products (DBPs).}},

Abstract = {{Contrary to conventional gaming-on-demand services that stream gaming
   video from cloud to players' terminals, a decomposed cloud gaming
   platform supports flexible migrations of gaming components between the
   cloud server and the players' terminals. In this paper, we present the
   design and implementation of the proposed decomposed gaming system. The
   cognitive resource optimization of the system under distinct targets,
   including the minimization of cloud, network, and terminal resources and
   response delay, subject to quality of service (QoS) assurance, is
   formulated as a graph partitioning problem that is solved by exhaustive
   searches. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate the
   feasibility of cognitive resource management in a cloud gaming system to
   efficiently adapt to variations in the service environments, such as
   increasing the number of supported devices and reducing the network
   bandwidth consumption of user terminals, while satisfying different QoS
   requirements for gaming sessions. We also suggest two heuristic
   algorithms based on local greedy and genetic algorithm approaches, which
   can potentially provide scalable but suboptimal solutions in large-scale
   implementations.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud gaming systems host the game in the cloud, while Gameplays and
   views are streamed to the players' terminals in the form of encoded
   video frames. To address the high-bandwidth issue of real-time gaming
   video transmission, we have proposed a cloudlet-assisted multiplayer
   cloud gaming system to encourage cooperative video sharing, which
   exploits the similarities of video frames among multiple players in the
   same crowd playing the same game via a secondary ad hoc network. In this
   paper, we provide a detailed modeling of the proposed system, including
   the correlation between video frames, mobility of terminal devices, and
   diversity of network quality of service for distinct players. With
   necessary mathematical formulations, we study the players' behaviors
   regarding the cooperative sharing patterns to optimize the system
   performance in terms of the quality of users' experience. Also,
   heuristic algorithms are proposed to reduce the computational
   complexity. Empirical study and trace-driven simulation results
   illustrate the impact of mobility on the system performance and show
   that the proposed solution is able to provide better quality of

Abstract = {{A common challenge when performing surface-based registration of images
   is ensuring that the surfaces accurately represent consistent anatomical
   boundaries. Image segmentation may be difficult in some regions due to
   either poor contrast, low slice resolution, or tissue ambiguities. To
   address this, we present a novel non-rigid surface registration method
   designed to register two partial surfaces, capable of ignoring regions
   where the anatomical boundary is unclear. Our probabilistic approach
   incorporates prior geometric information in the form of a statistical
   shape model (SSM), and physical knowledge in the form of a finite
   element model (FEM). We validate results in the context of prostate
   interventions by registering pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) to 3D transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). We show that both the
   geometric and physical priors significantly decrease net target
   registration error (TRE), leading to TREs of 2.35 +/- 0.81 mm and 2.81
   +/- 0.66 mm when applied to full and partial surfaces, respectively. We
   investigate robustness in response to errors in segmentation, varying
   levels of missing data, and adjusting the tunable parameters. Results
   demonstrate that the proposed surface registration method is an
   efficient, robust, and effective solution for fusing data from multiple
   modalities.}},

Abstract = {{We report on a wavelength-selective, polarization-rotating filter using
   a partially etched asymmetric Bragg grating on a compact single-mode,
   silicon-on-insulator (SOI) strip waveguide. The asymmetric Bragg grating
   rotates and reflects the fundamental transverse electric (TE) and
   transverse magnetic (TM) modes at selected wavelengths. Our device
   offers wavelength-selective, polarization-rotating reflection at its
   reflection port and wavelength-selective, polarization-independent notch
   filtering at its through port. The device is fabricated using a
   CMOS-compatible process with 193 nm-deep ultraviolet lithography on an
   SOI platform. We present results for a 294.4 mu m long device that has a
   3 dB bandwidth of 2.63 nm and a low-excess loss of less than 1 dB. This
   device also has a maximum polarization-extinction-ratio of greater than
   27 dB. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The aim was to measure the minimal thickness of the remaining canal wall
   dentine in the mesiobuccal roots of maxillary first molars using a
   virtual model to simulate the attempt to remove fractured instruments.
   Thirty-seven molars were scanned by micro-computed tomography. The
   application framework for the simulation of the attempt to remove a
   broken instrument was constructed. The staging platform was created and
   followed by the use of ultrasonic tips to trephine dentine around the
   fragment to reveal the coronal 1.5mm. The minimum canal wall thickness
   in the mesiobuccal roots was then measured. The concavity groove was
   found on all the distal aspects of the mesiobuccal root. The minimum
   thickness of the remaining canal wall distally to the canal was
   significantly thinner than mesially to the canals when sizes 25/0.06 and
   25/0.02 instruments were broken at 3 and 5mm away from the canal
   orifice. When the sizes 20/0.02 and 25/0.06 instruments were broken at
   5mm away from the canal orifice, the minimum thickness of the distal
   dentine wall was only 300-400m which was significantly less than when
   the instrument was broken at 3mm.}},

Abstract = {{Recent experiments have found that neutrophils may be activated after
   passing through microfluidic channels and filters. Mechanical
   deformation causes disassembly of the cytoskeleton and a sudden drop of
   the elastic modulus of the neutrophil. This fluidization is followed by
   either activation of the neutrophil with protrusion of pseudopods or a
   uniform recovery of the cytoskeleton network with no pseudopod. The
   former occurs if the neutrophil traverses the narrow channel at a slower
   rate. We propose a chemo-mechanical model for the fluidization and
   activation processes. Fluidization is treated as mechanical destruction
   of the cytoskeleton by sufficiently rapid bending. Loss of the
   cytoskeleton removes a pathway by which cortical tension inhibits the
   Rac protein. As a result, Rac rises and polarizes through a wave-pinning
   mechanism if the chemical reaction rate is fast enough. This leads to
   recovery and reinforcement of the cytoskeleton at the front of the
   neutrophil, and hence protrusion and activation. Otherwise the Rac
   signal returns to a uniform pre-deformation state and no activation
   occurs. Thus, mechanically induced neutrophil activation is understood
   as the competition between two timescales: that of chemical reaction and
   that of mechanical deformation. The model captures the main features of
   the experimental observation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a general framework for a modeling platform and a
   visualization tool for bicycle volume data of different quality and
   quantity. The modeling platform is aimed to estimate the annual average
   daily bicycle traffic (AADB) on links where bicycle volume data are
   collected during part of the year even if very limited data exist. The
   visualization tool, on the other hand, displays the estimated AADBs
   along with their associated quality indices on a digital network map so
   that it becomes available to both officials and end users. This paper
   describes the general structure of the model along with the estimation
   algorithms used in different stages. The assumptions associated with
   model development are discussed along with their implications. A case
   study is presented and is referred to as Vancouver Cycling Data Model.
   It was shown that the model could lead to a coverage ratio of more than
   70\% using an initial dataset that included only 5\% of the total number
   of hourly volumes that are actually needed to calculate the AADBs. This
   demonstrates the efficiency of the model in expanding the estimation of
   AADB over the entire network using limited data. This research effort is
   one of only few existing studies that attempted to develop cycling data
   models that can be used as useful decision-making tools for planners and
   sustainable transportation experts.}},

Abstract = {{Road crashes have become a leading cause of injury and death and a major
   source of greenhouse gas emissions. Modes of active transportation (AT)
   such as walking and cycling are often overlooked in the community

   the objective of balancing the needs of safety and health for residents,
   with those of the automobile and AT, all in pursuit of enhanced
   community sustainability. This study assesses the effectiveness of the
   FG model via the application of two recently developed assessment tools:
   the Canadian Healthy Development Index (HDI), and the Dutch Sustainable
   Transport Safety (STS) principles (collectively known as i-THRIVE in a
   new on-line tool). It was found that the FG is a successful model for
   building sustainably safe and healthy communities as it easily met the
   criteria of both the HDI and STS principles. However, while the FG model
   can be applied relatively easily to a new community, retrofitting
   existing neighbourhoods can be challenging and is the subject of further
   research.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to establish a pedestrian model that is
   capable of simulating pedestrian movement at the microscopic level under

   modeling approach in which a continuous space was used to represent the
   pedestrian environment. This paper presents the first step of the model
   development: details of a unidirectional micro-simulation pedestrian
   model along with its calibration and validation. The model was validated
   by comparing simulated trajectories with real trajectories extracted
   from video footage by means of computer vision techniques. Results show
   that the average location difference between simulated and actual
   trajectories was 20 cm in the X direction and 40 cm in the Y direction.
   Results also show that the model is capable of predicting pedestrian
   speed with relative error of 12.8\%.}},

Volume = {{118}},

Abstract = {{Although the effects of chemical additives on the geotechnical
   properties of soils have been investigated in recent years, the strength
   properties and micro-structural characteristics of clayey soils
   stabilized with magnesium chloride (MgCl2) solution, a green soil
   stabilizer, have not been clearly brought out. The objective of this
   study is therefore to investigate the time-dependent engineering
   properties, mineralogy, morphology and molecular characteristics of
   MgCl2 stabilized tropical fine-grained soils. Bentonite and kaolin,
   which represent high and low swelling clays, respectively were employed
   as the soils tested in this study. Compaction, unconfined compression
   strength (UCS) and standard direct shear tests were undertaken to assess
   the engineering properties of the stabilized clayey soils. The
   mechanisms that may have contributed to the stabilization process were
   discussed based on the micro-structural analysis using different
   spectroscopic and microscopic techniques such as X-ray diffractometry
   (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM),
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDAX), Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR) and Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (N-2-BET) surface
   area analysis. From an engineering point of view, the MgCl2 improved the
   compressive strength of the bentonite and kaolin significantly. The
   7-day UCS of MgCl2 stabilized bentonite and kaolin were approximately 2
   times higher than that of unstabilized ones. The micro-structural study
   revealed that the stabilization process modified the porous network of
   the tested clayey soils. The pores of the soils had been filled by newly
   formed crystalline compounds known as magnesium silicate hydrate (M-S-H)
   and magnesium aluminate hydrate (M-A-H) for the bentonite and kaolin,
   respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we adopt an energy-efficiency (EE) metric, named
   worst-EE, that is suitable for EE fairness optimization in the uplink
   transmission of amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative orthogonal
   frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) networks. More specifically,
   we assign subcarriers and allocate powers for mobile and relay stations
   in order to maximize the worst-EE, i.e., to maximize the EE of the
   mobile station (MS) with the lowest EE value, subject to MSs transmit
   power, relay station (RS) transmit power, and MSs quality-of-service
   (QoS) constraints. The formulated primal max-min optimization problem is
   nonconvex fractional mixed integer nonlinear program, i.e., NP-hard to
   solve. We provide a novel optimization framework that studies the
   structure of the primal problem and prove that the dual min-max
   optimization problem attains the same optimal solution of the primal
   problem. Additionally, we propose a modified Dinkelbach algorithm, named
   dual Dinkelbach, to achieve the optimal solution of the dual problem in
   a polynomial time complexity. We further exploit the structure of the
   obtained optimal solution and develop a low complexity suboptimal
   heuristic. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed
   algorithm to improve the network performance in terms of fairness
   between MSs, worst-EE, and average network transmission rate when
   compared to traditional schemes that maximize the EE of the whole
   network. Presented results also show that the suboptimal heuristic
   balances the achieved performance and the computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{To cope with increasing energy consumption in mobile devices, the mobile
   cloud offloading has received considerable attention from its ability to
   offload processing tasks of mobile devices to cloud servers, and
   previous studies have focused on single type tasks in fixed network
   environments. However, real network environments are spatio-temporally
   varying, and typical mobile devices have not only various types of
   tasks, e.g., network traffic, cloud offloadable/nonoffloadable workloads
   but also capabilities of CPU frequency scaling and network interface
   selection between WiFi and cellular. In this paper, we first jointly
   consider the following three dynamic problems in real mobile
   environments: 1) cloud offloading policy, i.e., determining to use local
   CPU resources or cloud resources; 2) allocation of tasks to transmit
   through networks and to process in local CPU; and 3) CPU clock speed and
   network interface controls. We propose a DREAM algorithm by invoking the
   Lyapunov optimization and mathematically prove that it minimizes CPU and
   network energy for given delay constraints. Trace-driven simulation
   based on real measurements demonstrates that DREAM can save over 35\% of
   total energy than existing algorithms with the same delay. We also
   design DREAM architecture and demonstrate the applicability of DREAM in
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Field programmable gate array (FPGA) routing is one of the most time
   consuming steps in a typical computer-aided design flow. The problem
   itself is similar to the NP-complete problem of computing a set of
   disjoint paths in a graph. The routing resource graph (RRG) that
   represents an FPGA routing network is necessarily large, and becomes
   even larger when modeling modern FPGAs that integrate sparse
   intracluster routing crossbars. This paper introduces two scalable
   heuristics that reduce the runtime and memory footprint of FPGA routing:
   1) selective RRG expansion (SERRGE), which employs an
   application-specific memory manager that stores the RRG in a compressed
   form, and dynamically decompresses it as the router proceeds and 2)
   partial prerouting (PPR) locally routes all nets within each logic
   cluster, followed by a global routing stage to complete the routes. PPR
   and SERRGE converge faster than a traditional router using a fully
   expanded RRG. PPR runs faster and uses less memory than SERRGE, while
   SERRGE yields the highest clock frequencies among the three.}},

Abstract = {{Newly developed VSC-HVDC systems are reaching power levels of up to 1000
   MW. At this power level, the non-minimum phase behavior of the VSC-HVDC
   systems' dc plant becomes a threat to the stability of the direct
   voltage for fast dc control-loop dynamics. This paper presents a novel
   compensation scheme, called RHP-zero shifting+damping, designed to deal
   with the nonminimum phase dynamics of the dc plant by adding additional
   compensation loops to the current controller of the VSC-HVDC system. The
   compensation scheme can work along with linear controllers and allows
   the closed-loop bandwidth of the direct voltage controller to be
   increased without affecting the direct voltage stability of high-power
   VSC-HVDC systems. As a result, the direct voltage variations are
   significantly reduced during power changes in the ac or dc network. The
   performance of the compensation scheme is evaluated through simulations
   and corroborated in a 1-kW experimental test bed.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{784}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Many micro-organisms find themselves immersed in fluids displaying
   non-Newtonian rheological properties such as viscoelasticity and
   shear-thinning viscosity. The effects of viscoelasticity on swimming at
   low Reynolds numbers have already received considerable attention, but
   much less is known about swimming in shear-thinning fluids. A general
   understanding of the fundamental question of how shear-thinning rheology
   influences swimming still remains elusive. To probe this question
   further, we study a spherical squirmer in a shear-thinning fluid using a
   combination of asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations.
   Shear-thinning rheology is found to affect a squirming swimmer in
   non-trivial and surprising ways; we predict and show instances of both
   faster and slower swimming depending on the surface actuation of the
   squirmer. We also illustrate that while a drag and thrust decomposition
   can provide insights into swimming in Newtonian fluids, extending this
   intuition to problems in complex media can prove problematic.}},

Abstract = {{Shear strains may have negligible influence on maximum displacements at
   the top of slender shear walls, but may significantly increase
   interstory drift ratios at lower levels where gravity-load columns are
   often less flexible. A nonlinear finite-element (FE) model calibrated
   with experimental results confirmed that large shear strains occur in
   flexural tension regions of concrete walls due to vertical tension
   strains in the presence of diagonal cracks and in the absence of demand
   on the horizontal shear reinforcement. A fan of diagonal cracks will
   form at the base of flexurally hinging walls independent of the shear
   stress level. A parametric study confirmed that a principal strain angle
   of 75 degrees can be used to estimate shear strains from vertical
   tension strains. Thus interstory drift ratios due to shear strains can
   be estimated from the easily calculated flexural demands. A simple and
   safe estimate of interstory drift ratio due to shear strains is 60\% of
   the global drift ratio. Interstory drift ratios from shear strains up to
   0.8\% have been measured in slender wall tests. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{Master alloys of Ti with Aluminum (Al), Boron (B) or Carbon (C) have
   been of interest to the aluminum foundry industries for grain refinement
   of Al alloy systems. However, the use of titanium carbide (TiC)
   inoculants to refine Al-Cu-Si systems has not yet been successful. Thus,
   this work examined the possibility of grain refining of B319 aluminum
   alloy by the direct addition of TiC powder into liquid melt. TiC
   addition levels of 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.1 wt\% were examined.
   The results suggested that the addition of TiC powder to the alloy
   refined the microstructure and promoted segregation of eutectic phases.
   Thermal analysis confirmed a decrease in the nucleation temperature of
   primary alpha-Al during solidification as TiC concentration increased.
   Secondary Dendrite Arm Spacing decreased with increasing addition of
   TiC, resulting in a concomitant increase in the hardness and the yield
   strength of the as-cast alloy.}},

Abstract = {{Building information modeling (BIM) has been presented as a potential
   solution to current facilities management problems related to
   information exchange during handover, and facilities information
   management during operations. However, implementing BIM in an owner
   organization is a complex challenge that necessitates reconfiguration of
   work practices and internal structures to fully realize the benefits.
   Owners are often unsure about how or whether they should go through the
   challenges related to implementation. Although previous studies have
   documented the potential benefits of BIM adoption for owners, such as
   improvements in work order processing, very little research has
   specifically looked at the transition to BIM and the scale of the effort
   required for large and diverse owner organizations. This paper presents
   the results of a long-term embedded case study analysis of a large
   owner-operator institutional organization that investigated the
   alignment of facility management (FM) practices across organizational
   and project contexts. The research objective was to examine current
   organizational practices in order to understand the potential, as well
   as the challenges, of transitioning from a paper-based to a model-based
   approach in handover and operations. We describe the current state of
   handover, information management and facility management practices and
   developed a framework to characterize the alignment between
   organizational constructs, available technology, project artifacts and
   owner requirements. This investigation of the current state of practice
   enables us to understand the gap between available and required
   information, processes and technology, and to better understand the
   enormous challenges owners face when considering the transition to BIM.}},

Abstract = {{This work is a case study of the energy performance gap in a LEED
   Platinum-certified university building. Comparing the whole-building
   energy modeling results with the overall measured energy consumption,
   the building shows approximately 60\% higher energy consumption during
   its first year of operation than the initial model prediction. The
   building is heavily instrumented and a large amount of detailed data is
   logged, providing a unique opportunity to compare energy model
   prediction to actual building performance and operations. Energy
   performance gaps of this magnitude are commonly found and the reasons
   are not yet well understood. There are many potential sources for
   discrepancies: different usage of the building in model and reality,
   design, construction and commissioning deficiencies, software limitation
   and modeling errors and different weather in reality than in the model
   are the factors typically considered. To better understand the. nature
   of the performance gap, potential sources of discrepancy between model
   and measurement have been eliminated in a series of steps, to evaluate
   their significance in the case of this particular building, starting
   with eliminating the most intrinsic prediction challenge to any energy
   model - the. weather - and continuing toward increased controllability
   and interdependence: occupancy, lighting and equipment loads, envelope
   performance, mechanical systems and ventilation.
   The present paper shows that in the case of the CIRS building the major
   sources of the performance gap are that the building has been built and
   is operated differently from what was expected. A major component of the
   CIRS energy concept is heat exchange with a neighboring building;
   however, because of design and commissioning deficits, the heat exchange
   falls short of the design intent. Furthermore, a waste water treatment
   plant located in the building is on the building's meters and included
   in the measured data, but not in the energy model. The transformers'
   electricity consumption was not in the energy model either and they were
   significantly inefficient. Part of the building's unanticipated usage is
   large lighting and plug loads. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Heterogeneity is an inherent component of rock and may be present in
   different forms including mineral heterogeneity, geometrical
   heterogeneity, weak grain boundaries and micro-defects. Microcracks are
   usually observed in crystalline rocks in two forms: natural and
   stress-induced; the amount of stressinduced microcracking increases with
   depth and in-situ stress. Laboratory results indicate that the physical
   properties of rocks such as strength, deformability, P-wave velocity and
   permeability are influenced by increase in microcrack intensity. In this
   study, the finite-discrete element method (FDEM) is used to model
   microcrack heterogeneity by introducing into a model sample sets of
   microcracks using the proposed micro discrete fracture network (mu DFN)
   approach. The characteristics of the microcracks required to create mu
   DFN models are obtained through image analyses of thin sections of Lac
   du Bonnet granite adopted from published literature. A suite of
   two-dimensional laboratory tests including uniaxial, triaxial
   compression and Brazilian tests is simulated and the results are
   compared with laboratory data. The FDEM-mu DFN models indicate that
   micro-heterogeneity has a profound influence on both the mechanical
   behavior and resultant fracture pattern. An increase in the microcrack
   intensity leads to a reduction in the strength of the sample and changes
   the character of the rock strength envelope. Spalling and axial
   splitting dominate the failure mode at low confinement while shear
   failure is the dominant failure mode at high confinement. Numerical
   results from simulated compression tests show that microcracking reduces
   the cohesive component of strength alone, and the frictional strength
   component remains unaffected. Results from simulated Brazilian tests
   show that the tensile strength is influenced by the presence of
   microcracks, with a reduction in tensile strength as microcrack
   intensity increases. The importance of microcrack heterogeneity in
   reproducing a bi-linear or S-shape failure envelope and its effects on
   the mechanisms leading to spalling damage near an underground opening
   are also discussed. (C) 2015 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics,

Abstract = {{The building sector has a huge impact on the environment; it consumes
   30-40 \% of global natural resources and 40 \% of energy. The impacts of
   the building sector can be reduced drastically by implementing a
   net-zero approach in both design and sustainability management of
   buildings. Net-zero building is a building system that uses sustainable
   materials and produces its needed energy and water throughout its life
   cycle. Unlike green buildings, there is a limited number of
   sustainability rating systems for net-zero buildings (e.g., Living
   Building Challenge). Despite the importance of geographical
   characteristics and local environmental conditions, spatial
   consideration in green and net-zero buildings is largely lacking in the
   literature. Considering the variability of environmental behavior around
   the globe and its significant effects on energy, water demands, and
   availability of construction materials, it is a major shortcoming to
   ignore the role of geography in net-zero buildings. This paper discusses
   a new methodology in the assessment of net-zero buildings by integrating
   regional characteristics and life cycle sustainability assessment. The
   methodology outlined in this paper can assist in sustainability design
   and decision making of net-zero buildings.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundClinical indications for the perioperative use of
   dexmedetomidine in pediatric anesthesia are accumulating. However, in
   2013, dexmedetomidine was added to the list of medications with possible
   risk of prolonging the QT interval and/or inducing Torsades de Pointes.
   Unfortunately, current evidence for dexmedetomidine-induced QT
   prolongation is sparse and somewhat contradictory.
   ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to evaluate temporal changes in
   corrected QT interval (QTc) after a rapid bolus administration of
   dexmedetomidine under total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with a
   standardized propofol and remifentanil administration.
   MethodsElectrocardiography (ECG) and corresponding trend data were
   extracted from automated electronic data capture of physiological
   monitoring. Ten-second epochs of ECG data were extracted in 1-min
   intervals for 12min, starting 1min before dexmedetomidine bolus
   administration, and ending 10min after. QT intervals were extracted
   using an automated routine in MATLAB, and corrected for heart rate (HR)
   using Bazett's (QTcB) and Fridericia's formulas (QTcF). QTcB and QTcF
   were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test between baseline
   measurements and the subsequent four interval values.
   ResultsData from 21 subjects (17 male) with median (range) age 7.1
   (5.4-9.5) yr, weight 23.6 (16.2-36.7)kg, and height 121 (103-140) cm
   were analyzed. Bolus administration of dexmedetomidine reduced HR in all
   subjects (median 22\%), and caused transient reduction of QT interval,
   with its peak at 1-min postbolus administration: QTcB (median reduction
   30.7ms, P<0.001) or QTcF (median reduction 15.4ms, P=0.001); QT
   shortening became statistically insignificant 4min following
   dexmedetomidine bolus administration for QTcB and 2min for QTcF.
   ConclusionIn this study, a rapid bolus of dexmedetomidine transiently
   shortened corrected QT intervals. However, these effects are confounded
   by dexmedetomidine-induced bradycardia. These findings should be
   confirmed in pediatric studies without concomitant TIVA administration
   and with optimized correction of baseline HR.}},

Abstract = {{A novel thermal-chemical treatment technology using radiofrequency
   heating and oxidants (hydrogen peroxide, ozone and a combination of
   both) was used for the treatment of sewage sludge. This was to evaluate
   the process effectiveness on cell disintegration and nutrient release of
   sludge, physical property changes such as particle size distribution,
   dewaterability and settleability, and their inter-relationships. The
   effectiveness of treatment processes was in the following order, from
   the most to least: thermal-oxidation process, oxidation process and
   thermal process. The thermal-oxidation process greatly increased cell
   disintegration and nutrient release, improved settleability, and
   decreased particle sizes. The treatment scheme involving ozone addition
   followed by hydrogen peroxide and radiofrequency heating yielded the
   highest soluble chemical oxygen demand, volatile fatty acids, ammonia
   and metals, while proffering the shortest capillary suction time and
   excellent settling properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Impact of hydrodynamics on pollutant degradation and energy efficiency
   of VUV/UV and H2O2/UV oxidation processes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{164}},
Pages = {{114-120}},

Abstract = {{The Vacuum-UV/UV process, an incipient catalyst/chemical-free advanced
   oxidation process (AOP), is potentially a cost-effective solution for
   the removal of harmful micropollutants from water. Utilizing a novel
   mechanistic numerical model, this work aimed to establish a thorough
   understanding of the degradation mechanisms in the VUV/UV process
   operating under continuous flow conditions, when compared with the
   widely applied H2O2/UV AOP. Of particular interest was the examination
   of the impact of flow characteristics (hydrodynamics) on the degradation
   efficacy of a target micropollutant during the VUV/UV and H2O2/UV AOPs.
   While hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) oxidation was the dominant
   degradation pathway in both processes, the degradation efficacy of the
   VUV/UV process showed much stronger correlation with the extent of
   mixing in the photoreactor. Under a uniform flow regime, the degradation
   efficiency of the target pollutant achieved by the H2O2/UV process with
   2- and 5 ppm H2O2 was greater than that provided by the VUV/UV process.
   Nonetheless, introduction of mixing and circulation zones to the VUV/UV
   reactor resulted in superior performance compared with the H2O2/UV AOP.
   Based on the electrical energy-per-order (EEO) analysis, incorporation
   of circulation zones resulted in a reduction of up to 50\% in the
   overall energy cost of the VUV/UV AOP, while the corresponding reduction
   for the 5-ppm H2O2/UV system was less than 5\%. Furthermore, the extent
   of (OH)-O-center dot scavenging of natural organic matter (NOM) on
   energy efficiency of the VUV/UV and H2O2/UV AOPs under continuous flow
   conditions was assessed using the EEO analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This study presents high temperature water-only continuous flowthrough
   pretreatment coupled with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as a
   promising analytical tool to examine the plant cell wall, to understand
   its recalcitrance (i.e., cell wall resistance to deconstruction), and to
   probe the chemistry occurring during batch pretreatment of biomass.
   C-13-enriched corn stover stems were pretreated at 170 degrees C for 60
   min with a hot-water flow rate of 20 mL/min to control fractionation of
   the cell wall. This approach helped elucidate the nature of plant cell
   wall chemical recalcitrance and biomass pretreatment chemistry by
   tracking cell wall fragmentation as a function of time. Fractions of the
   reactor effluent were collected in a time-resolved fashion and
   characterized by various NMR techniques to determine the degree and
   sequence of fragments released, as well as, the chemical composition,
   molecular structure, and relative molecular weight of those released
   fragments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Spinning of a common aluminium automotive casting alloy A356
   (Al-7Si-0.3Mg) at elevated temperatures has been investigated

   element model aimed at quantifying the processing history (stress,
   strain, strain-rate and temperature) and predicting the final geometry.
   The geometric predictions of this model have been compared directly to
   the geometry of the workpieces obtained experimentally. This study is
   novel in regards to both the size and shape of the component as well as
   the constitutive material representation employed. The model predictions
   are in reasonable agreement with experimental results for small
   deformations, but errors increase for large deformation conditions. The
   model has also enabled the characterization of the mechanical state
   which leads to a common spinning defect. Suggestions for improving the
   accuracy and robustness of the model to provide a predictive tool for
   industry are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fifty street dust samples were collected from Southern and Eastern parts

   under dry and stable weather conditions. Total concentrations of copper
   (Cu), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn),
   iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and lithium (Li) were determined. Ten samples
   were then selected for characterization, metals fractionation and single
   stage extraction studies. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence
   (XRF) were utilized to study the crystalline forms of metals and
   chemical compositions. In addition, sequential and single extraction
   procedures were used to determine the concentrations of six heavy metals
   (i.e. Cu, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni and Zn), and also the mobility and
   bioavailability of elements. The risk assessment code (RAC) and I-POLL
   were employed for the risk assessment and pollution intensity of metals,
   respectively. Results showed that the single extraction procedure could
   be used to estimate the total concentrations of most metals as an
   appropriate alternative for total digestion. The mobility and potential
   availability of metals in Tehran street dust followed the order of Cd >
   Zn > Pb > Cu > Ni > Cr. The risk assessment code results showed high
   risk for Pb, Cd and Zn and low-medium risk for Ni, Cr and Cu, and

Abstract = {{A key challenge in transfusion medicine research and clinical hematology
   is to develop a simple and non-destructive method to measure the quality
   of each blood unit prior to use. RBC deformability has long been
   proposed as an indicator of blood quality. We measured RBC deformability
   using the pressure required for single cells to transit through a
   micrometer scale constriction to examine longitudinal changes in RBC
   deformability, as well as the variability in blood quality and storage
   capacity across donors. We used a microfluidic device to monitor
   deformability changes in RBCs stored in plastic tubes and in blood bags
   over 14 and 56 days respectively. We found consistent storage based
   degradation of RBC deformability with statistically significant
   variability in both the initial RBC deformability and storage capacity
   among donors. Furthermore, all samples exhibited a transient recovery
   phenomenon. Deformability profiling of stored RBCs using transiting
   pressure showed significant donor variability in initial quality and

Abstract = {{Binary structure II (sII) clathrate hydrates of tetrahydropyran (THP)
   with methane and carbon dioxide are synthesized and characterized with

   Analysis of PXRD results shows that 83\% of the small 12-sided
   (dodecahedral, D) sII cages are occupied by CO2 in CO2 + THP hydrate,
   whereas 93\% of the D cages are occupied by CH4 in CH4 + THP hydrate.
   The effects of the tighter fit of CO2 molecules in the D cages of the
   binary hydrate were observed in longer lattice constants and lower cage
   occupancies compared to binary THP hydrates with CH4 molecule in the D
   cage. MD simulations of 1,4-twist-boat and chair conformers of the THP
   in the sII clathrate hydrate phase with the CO2 and CH4 help gases are
   performed at temperatures between 153 to 250 K. Simulations suggest
   shape and size of D cage guest molecules does not affect the
   conformation of H cage guest molecule, but the steric repulsions between
   CO2 molecule and cages water molecules limits its motion and promotes
   interaction between H cage guest molecule and the cage at higher extent

Abstract = {{Background
   The reduction in the deaths of millions of children who die from
   infectious diseases requires early initiation of treatment and improved
   access to care available in health facilities. A major challenge is the
   lack of objective evidence to guide front line health workers in the
   community to recognize critical illness in children earlier in their
   course.
   Methods
   We undertook a prospective observational study of children less than 5
   years of age presenting at the outpatient or emergency department of a
   rural tertiary care hospital between October 2012 and April 2013. Study
   physicians collected clinical signs and symptoms from the facility
   records, and with a mobile application performed recordings of oxygen
   saturation, heart rate and respiratory rate. Facility physicians decided
   the need for hospital admission without knowledge of the oxygen
   saturation. Multiple logistic predictive models were tested.
   Findings
   Twenty-five percent of the 3374 assessed children, with a median
   (interquartile range) age of 1.02 (0.42-2.24), were admitted to
   hospital. We were unable to contact 20\% of subjects after their visit.
   A logistic regression model using continuous oxygen saturation,
   respiratory rate, temperature and age combined with dichotomous signs of
   chest indrawing, lethargy, irritability and symptoms of cough, diarrhea
   and fast or difficult breathing predicted admission to hospital with an
   area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89 (95\%
   confidence interval -CI: 0.87 to 0.90). At a risk threshold of 25\% for
   admission, the sensitivity was 77\% (95\% CI: 74\% to 80\%), specificity
   was 87\% (95\% CI: 86\% to 88\%), positive predictive value was 70\%
   (95\% CI: 67\% to 73\%) and negative predictive value was 91\% (95\% CI:
   90\% to 92\%).
   Conclusion
   A model using oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and temperature in
   combination with readily obtained clinical signs and symptoms predicted
   the need for hospitalization of critically ill children. External
   validation of this model in a community setting will be required before
   adoption into clinical practice.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{280}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The axial motion of HDPE, Acetal, and PTFE spheres immersed in a 3-D bed
   of the conventional fluidization materials was studied using the
   non-invasive radioactive particle tracking (RPT) technique. Coarse and
   fine sand as well as FCC were chosen as the fluidization material. The
   experiments were carried out at two excess gas velocities, i.e. U-e =
   0.25 m/s and U-e = 0.50 m/s.
   Rise of an object immersed in a bubbling fluidized bed can be descried
   by two characteristic velocities, i.e. rise and upward velocity. When
   circulation pattern is fully established, the mean upward and rise
   velocity to the mean bubble velocity ratios become comparable. It is
   shown that the object rise takes place principally in the drift of
   bubbles. The mean object rise velocity is primarily influenced by the
   excess gas velocity. Comparatively, the ratio between the physical
   properties of the fluidization medium and the object such as size and
   density has trivial impact on the rise velocity of the object. The mean
   object upward velocity can satisfactorily be predicted with a
   theoretical model with no adjustable parameter.
   The frequency of the object rise along the bed is independent of the
   object properties but influenced by the fluidization material. Comparing
   to coarse sand and FCC, the objects immersed in fine sand rise less
   frequently. This is attributed to the relatively longer residence time
   of the object in the emulsion phase of fine sand particles. The
   intermittent circulation of the medium and large size Acetal spheres in
   beds of FCC and fine sand is featured by the low upward and rise object
   velocities and the very limited height travelled by the object. (C) 2015

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{280}},
Pages = {{66-73}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The effect of catalyst supports on NOx adsorption and reduction by C3H6
   over Fe/zeolites was studied at a temperature range of 200-400 degrees
   C. NOx conversion over Fe/zeolites decreased in the order of Fe/MOR >
   Fe/FER approximate to Fe/ZSM-5 > Fe/Beta at low temperatures between 200
   degrees C and 300 degrees C. At temperatures above 300 degrees C, the
   order of catalytic activity became Fe/Beta > Fe/FER > Fe/ZSM-5 > Fe/MOR.
   NOx adsorption capacities on Fe/zeolite catalysts decreased in the order
   of Fe/MOR > Fe/FER > Fe/ZSM-5 > Fe/Beta. The selective catalytic
   reduction (SCR) activity of zeolites showed a slight difference from 200
   degrees C to 400 degrees C. The adsorption capacities of NO on zeolites
   placed within the rank of MOR > FER > ZSM-5 > Beta. No correlation was
   found between surface area/pore volume and NOx reduction/adsorption on
   Fe/zeolites. The ratio of Fe2+/Fe3+ in the surface layer of Fe/zeolites
   decreased in the order of Fe/Beta > Fe/FER > Fe/MOR > Fe/ZSM-5. The peak
   of Fe3O4 was clearly detected on Fe/Beta by TPR. The inhibition of the
   adsorption capacities of Fe/zeolites became severe in the presence of
   SO2, CO2, and H2O. CO2 exerted virtually no effect on the SCR activity
   of Fe/zeolites. The inhibition of NO conversion by H2O was reversible
   for all catalysts. NOx conversion dropped significantly on Fe/zeolites

Abstract = {{In this study, a series of catalysts of composition Ni/X\% CeO2-Y\%
   TiO2, (where X and Y range from 0\% to 100\%), was prepared by
   impregnation. The effects of different ratio of CeO2/TiO2 on the
   catalytic activity and stability were examined during methane dry
   reforming. Ni/TiO2 showed better initial activity than Ni/CeO2. However,
   Ni/CeO2 was much more stable. The Ni/CeO2-TiO2 catalyst, which has
   optimum Ce/Ti ratio, showed excellent activity and stability in dry
   reforming. XPS analysis, H-2 TPR, and a reverse water gas shift reaction
   (RWGS) test confirmed that higher dispersion of Ni sites on the surface
   of the support could improve the catalytic activity, and that great
   reducibility of catalyst could improve the stability of catalyst. (C)

Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{In the flotation in highly concentrated electrolyte solutions not only
   ionic strength but also chemical composition, flotation pH and mineral
   properties play an important role. As a result an improvement or
   depression may be observed. A strong improvement in the floatability of
   hydrophobic bituminous coals and other inherently hydrophobic minerals
   is characteristic for the ``salt flotation process{''}, which is carried
   out in concentrated electrolyte solutions at natural pH and without
   addition of any flotation reagents. However, pH is a key factor when
   saline waters with hydrolyzing metallic ions are used as a process
   water. In the case of flotation of Cu-Mo sulfide ores in seawater,
   molybdenite is strongly depressed by the Mg2+ hydrolysis products when
   pH is raised to depress pyrite. The process waters with a high content
   of Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions, and this also includes seawater, have deleterious
   effect on the anionic flotation of industrial minerals with fatty acids
   due tithe precipitation of Ca/Mg fatty acid salts. The flotation Of
   potash ores is carried out in NaCl-KCl saturated brine (6-7 mol/L of
   NaCl and MCl) with the use of long-chain primary amines. Such a high
   electrolyte concentration changes dramatically the amine Krafft point
   making the collector insoluble in brine; its mode of action entirely
   differs from that in conventional flotation processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The spreading of axisymmetric viscoplastic droplets extruded slowly on
   glass surfaces is studied experimentally using shadowgraphy and
   swept-field confocal microscopy. The microscopy furnishes vertical
   profiles of the radial velocity using particle image velocimetry (PIV)
   with neutrally buoyant tracers seeded in the fluid. Experiments were
   conducted for two complex fluids: aqueous solutions of Carbopol and
   xanthan gum. On untreated glass surfaces, PIV demonstrates that both
   fluids experience a significant amount of effective slip. The
   experiments were repeated on glass that had been treated to feature
   positive surface charges, thereby promoting adhesion between the
   negatively charged polymeric constituents of the fluids and the glass
   surface. The Carbopol and xanthan gum droplets spread more slowly on the
   treated surface and to a smaller radial distance. PIV demonstrated that
   this reduced spreading was associated with a substantial reduction in
   slip. For Carbopol, the effective slip could be eliminated entirely to
   within the precision of the PIV measurements; the reduction in slip was
   less effective for xanthan gum, with a weak slip velocity remaining
   noticeable.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{The impact of a single liquid drop on a flowing liquid film is
   experimentally and theoretically studied. The drop impact produces a
   crownlike rising liquid sheet, which radially expands. Small droplets
   can be formed from the crown sheet, resulting in splash. The present
   study results in three major contributions. (1) A theoretical model is
   developed to predict the expansion of the crown base. The model with an
   introduced energy loss factor is shown to be in satisfactory agreement
   with our experimental observations of drop impact on both stationary and
   flowing films. The energy loss factor is correlated to the properties of
   the film and drop. (2) Analysis is conducted to derive an equation for
   evaluating the stretching rate of the rising crown sheet, which is the
   local gradient of the rising velocity at the top edge of the crown
   sheet. It shows that the highest stretching rate appears where the drop
   spreading flow is right opposite to the film flow, which helps explain
   why the same location is most probable for splash to take place. (3) A
   parameter as a function of modified Weber and Reynolds numbers is
   defined to predict splash and nonsplash of drop impact on flowing films.
   The two nondimensional numbers evaluate the competition of the two flows
   (drop and film) against viscosity and surface tension effects. A
   threshold value of the parameter is found for the occurrence of splash
   impact on flowing films.}},

Abstract = {{Oscillatory flow superimposed on steady laminar flow in a pipe (or

   for conditions under which removal of particles and fouling layers from

   flow reversal, which is cited in literature as one of the requirements
   for removal of fouling layers. As wall shear stress is a relevant
   measure to evaluate removal of particle/fouling layers, calculations are
   performed to derive the conditions under which wall shear stress with
   superimposed oscillatory flow is energy efficient. The results are
   presented in the parameter space of a pressure gradient ratio
   (oscillatory/steady) and Womersley number. This phase plot would be
   useful for experimentalist to locate operating regions whence energy
   efficient removal can be achieved using superimposed oscillatory flow.}},

Abstract = {{Continued advances toward cell-based therapies for human disease
   generate a growing need for unbiased and label-free monitoring of
   cellular characteristics. We used Raman microspectroscopy to
   characterize four important stages in the 26-day directed
   differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to
   insulin-positive cells. The extent to which the cells retained
   spectroscopic features of pluripotent cells or developed spectroscopic
   features suggestive of pancreatic endocrine cells, as well as assessing
   the homogeneity of the cell populations at these developmental stages,
   were of particular interest. Such information could have implications
   for the utility of Raman microspectroscopy process analysis for the
   generation of insulin-positive cells from hESCs. Because hESC seeding
   density influences the subsequent pancreatic development, three
   different seeding density cultures were analyzed. Transcription factor
   and other marker analyses assessed the progress of the cells through the
   relevant developmental stages. Increases in the Raman protein-to-nucleic
   acid band ratios were observed at the final endocrine stage analyzed,
   but this increase was less than expected. Also, high glycogen band
   intensities, somewhat unexpected in pancreatic endocrine cells,
   suggested the presence of a substantial number of glycogen containing
   cells. We discuss the potential process analytical technology
   application of these findings and their importance for cell
   manufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{Gas hydrate deposition can cause plugging in oil and gas pipelines with
   resultant flow assurance challenges. Presently, the energy industry uses
   chemical additives in order to manage hydrate formation, however these
   chemicals are expensive and may be associated with safety and
   environmental concerns. Here we show the effect of a hydrophobically
   coated surface on hydrate formation in the presence of an antifreeze
   protein type I (AFP I) and a biodegradable synthetic polymer
   (LuvicapBio) in a high pressure crystallizer setup. The hydrophobic
   surface increased the hydrate induction time and reduced the hydrate
   growth significantly in pure deionized water (control). Furthermore, in
   the presence of 0.02 wt\% of LuvicapBio or 0.014 wt\% AFP I in the
   hydrophobic coated crystallizer; the hydrate growth was reduced to
   almost the same level as obtained with 0.20 wt\% of LuvicapBio in a
   stainless steel crystallizer. This indicates that 10 to 14 times less
   KHI is needed in the presence of a hydrophobically coated surface. These
   experimental studies suggest that the use of hydrophobic surfaces or
   pipelines could serve as an alternative or additional flow assurance
   approach for gas hydration mitigation and management. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study simulates the flexural behavior of ultra-high-performance
   fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) beams reinforced with steel and glass
   fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) rebars. For this, micromechanics-based
   modeling was first carried out on the basis of single fiber pullout
   models considering inclination angle. Two different tension-softening
   curves (TSCs) with the assumptions of 2-dimensional (2-D) and
   3-dimensional (3-D) random fiber orientations were obtained from the
   micromechanics-based modeling, and linear elastic compressive and
   tensile models before the occurrence of cracks were obtained from the
   mechanical tests and rule of mixture. Finite element analysis
   incorporating smeared crack model was used due to the multiple cracking
   behaviors of structural UHPFRC beams, and the characteristic length of
   two times the element width (or two times the average crack spacing at
   the peak load) was suggested as a result of parametric study. Analytical
   results showed that the assumption of 2-D random fiber orientation is
   appropriate to a non-reinforced UHPFRC beam, whereas the assumption of
   3-D random fiber orientation is suitable for UHPFRC beams reinforced
   with steel and GFRP rebars due to disorder of fiber alignment from the
   internal reinforcements. The micromechanics-based finite element
   analysis also well predicted the serviceability deflections of UHPFRC
   beams with GFRP rebars and hybrid reinforcements.}},

Abstract = {{When foundations are capacity-protected, inelastic deformations will
   occur primarily in the seismic force-resisting system. Soil flexibility
   can be ignored when determining seismic loads, but footings will rotate
   when subjected to the maximum overturning moment, and this may increase
   building drifts, particularly in lower stories where gravity-load
   columns are less flexible. A ``hand calculation{''} method is presented
   for estimating rotation of a footing from the uniform bearing stress
   distribution required to resist the applied overturning moment. The
   method, which has been adopted in the 2015 Canadian building code,
   accounts for initial linear rotation of footings and additional
   nonlinear rotation due to footing uplift and nonlinearity of soil. A
   quick, safe estimate can be made using approximate equations, or a more
   accurate estimate can be made by determining two parameters from
   figures. Design examples demonstrate how the method can be used to
   design foundations for improved performance at a small additional cost.}},

Abstract = {{Steel is one of the most popular seismic force resisting systems (SFRS)
   in use worldwide. In Canada, several SFRS have been prequalified for use
   in the national and provincial building codes. The design of each SFRS
   has been covered comprehensively in literature. However, no guidance has
   been provided in selecting the optimum system for a project. In this
   paper, a prototype building located in Vancouver, Canada, was designed
   nine times to utilize each of the prequalified SFRS. Detailed seismic
   hazard and finite element models were developed for each system. The
   performance in terms of initial construction and life-cycle cost was
   used to rank each SFRS. The result of this analysis shows that the
   eccentrically braced configuration has the lowest material usage and
   life cycle maintenance cost; it is therefore the most economic system in
   this study. The presented methodology is transparent and can be easily
   adopted by engineers to select the most economic seismic system for
   projects with different configurations and geometries than those given
   in this research. Furthermore, this system introduces a metric with
   which to estimate the life-cycle costs of a structure taking into
   account seismic damage over the service life.}},

Abstract = {{Visible-light communication (VLC) systems leverage solid-state
   illumination devices to create high-speed communication links.
   Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been considered
   for these intensity-modulated/direct-detection (IM/DD) optical channels,
   however, it suffers from high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).
   Moreover, the implementation of linear, power-efficient, high-current,
   wideband drivers is challenging. In this paper, the concept of spatial
   summing is developed where wideband, high PAPR OFDM signals are
   partitioned into many low-PAPR narrowband signals that are transmitted
   from multiple LEDs. The signals from different LEDs are allowed to sum
   in space before being detected by a conventional OFDM receiver. Spatial
   optical-OFDM (SO-OFDM) is proposed in which filtered subsets of carriers
   are emitted by each LED. In addition, low-PAPR optical single-carrier
   FDMA (OSC-FDMA) is developed where different collections of LEDs act as
   virtual users in a multiple-access scheme. The different variations of
   SO-OFDM and OSC-FDMA are compared to conventional DC-biased optical
   (DCO) OFDM and are shown to achieve lower PAPR and more robustness to
   LED nonlinearities leading to error rate performance gains at high
   signal-to-noise ratios.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a general regression neural network (GRNN) is developed
   for predicting soil type and standard penetration test (SPT) N (standard
   penetration resistance) values based on SPT test results. It focuses on
   soils mainly in Khulna City, Bangladesh that comprise fine-grained
   alluvium deposits of mostly silt and clay with some organic content and
   sand. A detailed geological and geotechnical investigation of the city
   and its surroundings was conducted to generalize the subsoil condition
   of the study area based on soil type and SPT values. The investigation
   results showed that the city is divided into four geological units and
   three geotechnical zones. To develop the GRNN model, more than 2326
   field SPT values (N) have been collected from 42 clusters containing 143
   boreholes spread over an area of 37 km(2). Two trained models were
   developed: initially the borehole locations were trained with the soil
   types and after that the borehole location-soil types were trained with
   the N-c values. The model prediction was compared with the borehole data
   and the results showed that the GRNN model predicts well compared with
   the actual site investigation data. Therefore, this model can be used
   for future planning and expansion of the city.}},

Title = {{Circular hydraulic jump on finite surfaces with capillary limit}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A round liquid jet impinging on a circular disc with free edge generates
   a thin liquid film in the center surrounded by a thick film. For low
   flow rates, the thick film is bounded by a stable rim around the disc
   edge and flows off only from one spot at the edge. The outer Froude
   number remains constant for varied flow rates and disc sizes but changes
   with the surface tension of the fluid. The jump radius increases
   linearly with the flow rate, and the linear slope varies with the
   surface tension. Due to the stable-rim edge condition, the constant
   outer Froude numbers observed in our study are different from the
   constant value reported by Duchesne et al. {[}{''}Constant Froude number
   in a circular hydraulic jump and its implication on the jump radius
   selection,{''} Europhys. Lett. 107, 54002 (2014)]. Despite the constant
   outer Froude numbers being independent of the flow rate, the inner
   Froude number changes with the flow rate, which is due to the surface
   tension force at the jump location. Force analysis is conducted by
   taking into account the stable rim, and the derived equations provide
   the relationship of jump radius with the contact angle of the stable
   rim, disc size, and jet flow. The maximum outer Froude number and the
   minimum inner Froude number are theoretically analyzed. Depending on the
   pre-jump velocity profile and the surface tension force at the jump, the
   maximum outer Froude number could be larger than unity. The shape of
   free surface at the jump is analyzed to evaluate the theoretical
   assumption of steep jump. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes the effect of shrinkage-reducing admixture (SRA) on
   free and restrained autogenous shrinkage behaviors of
   ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC). To
   investigate the cracking potential, tensile strength development was
   experimentally obtained and predicted on the basis of the degree of
   hydration model. Three different SRA to cement weight ratios of 0, 1,
   and 2\% and three different reinforcement ratios of 1.3, 2.9, and 8.0\%
   were considered. A higher SRA content contributed to a slightly higher
   tensile strength and a lower autogenous shrinkage. In addition, a higher
   SRA content and a lower reinforcement ratio resulted in better
   restrained autogenous shrinkage behaviors, such as lower autogenous
   shrinkage stress and cracking potential. Therefore, it can be concluded
   that the use of SRA or a lower reinforcement ratio is favorable for
   improving the restrained shrinkage behaviors of UHPFRC. (C) 2015

Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{84-92}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This study aims to investigate the flexural behavior of
   steel-fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) beams under quasi-static and
   impact loads. For this, a number of SFRC beams with three different
   compressive strengths (f(c)', of approximately 49, 90, and 180 MPa) and
   four different fiber volume contents (v(f) of 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0\%)
   were fabricated and tested. The quasi-static tests were carried out
   according to ASTM standards, while the impact tests were performed using
   a drop-weight impact test machine for two different incident potential
   energies of 40 and 100 J. For the case of quasi-static load,
   enhancements in the flexural strength and deflection capacity were
   obtained by increasing the fiber content and strength, and higher
   toughness was observed with an increase in the fiber content. For the
   case of impact load, an increase in the load carrying capacity was
   obtained by increasing the potential energy and strength, and an
   improvement in the post-peak behavior was observed by increasing the
   fiber content. The increases in fiber content and strength also led to
   enhancements in residual flexural performance after impact damage.
   Finally, the flexural strength became less sensitive to the strain-rate
   (or stress-rate) as the strength of concrete increased. (C) 2015

Title = {{A novel heat transfer switch using the yield stress}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{783}},
Pages = {{526-566}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We explore the feasibility of a novel method for the regulation of heat
   transfer across a cavity, by using a controllable yield stress in order
   to suppress the convective heat transfer. Practically, this type of
   control can be actuated with electro-rheological or magneto-rheological
   fluids. We demonstrate that above a given critical yield stress value
   only static steady regimes arc possible, i.e. a purely conductive
   unyieldcd fluid fills the cavity. We show that this limit is governed by
   a balance of yield stress and buoyancy stresses, here described by B.
   With proper formulation the critical state can be described as a
   function of the domain geometry, and is independent of other
   dimensionless flow parameters (Rayleigh number, Ra, and Prandtl number,
   Pr) On the theoretical side, we examine the conditional stability of the
   static regime. We derive conservative conditions on disturbance energy
   to ensure that perturbations from a static regime decay to zero.
   Assuming stability, we show that the kinetic energy of the perturbed
   field decays to zero in a finite time, and give estimates for the
   stopping time, to. This allows us to predict the response of the system
   in suppressing advective heat transfer, The unconditional stability is
   also considered for the first time, illustrating the role of yield
   stress. We focus on the hydrodynamic characteristics of Bingham fluids
   in transition between conductive and convective limits. We use
   computational simulations to resolve the Navier Stokes and energy
   equations for different yield stresses, and for different imposed
   controls. We show that depending on the initial conditions, a yield
   stress less than the critical value can result in temporary arrest of
   the flow. The temperature then develops conductively until the fluid
   yields and the flow restarts. We provide estimates of the hydrodynamic
   timescales of the problem and examples of flow transitions. In total,
   the theoretical and computational results establish that this
   methodology is feasible as a control, at least from a hydrodynamic
   perspective.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The extrudate swell of high-density polyethylenes (HDPEs) in capillary
   flow is studied using an optical micrometer attached to the capillary
   rheometer. The effects of molecular structure, shear rate, die
   geometrical characteristics (entrance angle, length-to-diameter ratio
   and diameter) and temperature on extrudate swell are studied
   systematically and found to have a significant effect. In particular,
   extrudate swell increases with decrease of LID ratio and changes
   nonlinearly with entrance angle exhibiting different trends for concave
   (swell increases from 60 to 180) and convex (swell decreases from 180 to
   300) angles. The swell also depends nonlinearly on die diameter,
   exhibiting a maximum at certain diameter. The molecular weight and its
   distribution (dominant) are also found to affect significantly the
   extrudate swell of HDPE. The ambient temperature is also an important
   parameter that is the higher its value, the higher the extrudate swell.
   Ultimate swell measurements have also been performed and the relative
   effects of stress relaxation and surface tension have been assessed
   independently through both experimentation and modeling. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The extrudate swell phenomenon of a high-molecular-weight HDPE is
   modeled using the following viscoelastic constitutive equations: the
   multi-mode Kaye-Bernstein-Kearsley-Zapas (K-BKZ) integral model with the
   Wagner and the Papanastasiou-Scriven-Macosko (PSM) damping functions,
   and multi-mode Phan-Thien-Tanner (PTT), Giesekus and Double Convected
   Pom-Pom (DCPP) differential models. The high-molecular-weight high
   density polyethylene (HDPE) is rheologically characterized and the
   experimental data have been used to fit the parameters of the
   constitutive models. Experimental results on extrudate swell are
   compared with the numerical predictions. The simulation results showed
   that the integral K-BKZ model highly over-predicts and the differential
   PTT, Giesekus and DCPP models slightly under-predict the experimental
   measurements. When the capillary reservoir is excluded from the
   simulations, the predictions of the integral models are significantly
   reduced close to the experimental data, while those of the differential
   models remain practically unaffected. Although both integral and
   differential models used represent the rheological data equally well, an
   explanation of the dramatically different predictions of extrudate swell
   by the integral and differential models remains elusive. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The half-duplex (HD) multi-hop relay channel consists of a source,
   multiple HD relays connected in series, and a destination where links
   are present only between adjacent nodes. In this paper, we focus on
   decode-and-forward relays and assume that the links are impaired by
   block fading and additive white Gaussian noise. We design a new protocol
   which, unlike the conventional protocols for the multi-hop relay
   channel, does not adhere to a fixed and predefined pattern of using the
   transmit, receive, and silent states of the nodes. In particular, the
   proposed protocol selects the optimal states of the nodes and the
   corresponding optimal transmission rates based on the instantaneous
   channel state information (CSI) of the involved links in each fading
   block such that the achievable average rate from source to destination
   is maximized. To enable adaptive scheduling of the states of the nodes,
   the relay nodes have to be equipped with buffers for temporary storage
   of the information received from the preceding node. Additionally, we
   discuss and address two practical challenges arising in the
   implementation of the optimal protocol, namely the unconstrained
   end-to-end delay due to data buffering at the relays and the required
   CSI overhead. Numerical results confirm the superiority of the proposed
   buffer-aided protocols compared to existing multi-hop relaying
   protocols.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the use of a robot's gaze to improve the
   timing and subjective experience of face-to-face robot-to-human
   handovers. Based on observations of human gaze behaviors during
   face-to-face human-human handovers, we implement various gaze behaviors
   on a PR2 humanoid robot. We conducted two consecutive robot-to-human
   handover studies. Results show that when the robot continually gazes at
   a projected handover position while handing over an object, the human
   receivers reach for the object significantly earlier than when the robot
   looks down, away from the handover location; further, when the robot
   continually gazes at the receiver's face instead of the handover
   position, the receivers reach for the object even earlier. When the
   robot-instead of continually gazing at a location-transitions its gaze
   from the handover position to the receivers' face, or vice versa, the
   receivers' reach time did not improve; however, the receivers perceive
   these gaze transitions to better communicate handover timing than
   continual gazes. Finally, the receivers perceive the robot to be more
   likeable and anthropomorphic when it looks at their face than when it
   does not. Findings from our studies indicate that robot's use of gaze
   can help improve both fluency and subjective experience of the
   robot-to-human handover interactions.}},

Abstract = {{In Canada, small to medium sized water utilities (SMWU) do not often
   participate in National Water and Wastewater Benchmarking Initiative due
   to lesser economies of scale, lack of resources, and data limitations.
   Consequently, such SMWU are managing their functional components (i.e.,
   environmental, personnel, operational, physical assets, customer
   satisfaction, public health, and financial) without quantitatively
   assessing and knowing if they are meeting their performance objectives.
   A multilevel performance management framework, consisting of five
   modules has been developed and implemented for SMWU in BC, Canada. The
   framework provides an approach to identify and select the suitable
   performance indicators for SMWU, and to use them for inter-utility
   performance benchmarking under limited data. The subsequent modules can
   be used for detailed performance management at utility, system, and
   sub-component levels. The utility managers can effectively employ this
   framework to identify the underperforming functional components and can
   rationally take corrective actions, and address customer satisfaction
   with efficient inventory management and data analyses.}},

   mean central frequency and wavelet features extracted from a group of
   patients can be used to build a nonlinear classifier which can be
   applied successfully to differentiate between cancerous and normal
   tissue regions of an unseen patient. Results: In a cross-validation
   strategy, we show an average area under receiver operating
   characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.93 and classification accuracy of 80\%.
   To validate our results, we present a detailed ultrasound to histology

Abstract = {{In surface-based registration for image-guided interventions, the
   presence of missing data can be a significant issue. This often arises
   with real-time imaging modalities such as ultrasound, where poor
   contrast can make tissue boundaries difficult to distinguish from
   surrounding tissue. Missing data poses two challenges: ambiguity in
   establishing correspondences; and extrapolation of the deformation field
   to those missing regions. To address these, we present a novel non-rigid
   registration method. For establishing correspondences, we use a
   probabilistic framework based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) that
   treats one surface as a potentially partial observation. To extrapolate
   and constrain the deformation field, we incorporate biomechanical prior
   knowledge in the form of a finite element model (FEM). We validate the
   algorithm, referred to as GMM-FEM, in the context of prostate
   interventions. Our method leads to a significant reduction in target
   registration error (TRE) compared to similar state-of-the-art
   registration algorithms in the case of missing data up to 30\%, with a
   mean TRE of 2.6 mm. The method also performs well when full
   segmentations are available, leading to TREs that are comparable to or
   better than other surface-based techniques. We also analyze robustness
   of our approach, showing that GMM-FEM is a practical and reliable
   solution for surface-based registration.}},

Abstract = {{Zirconia ceramics are often considered in the nuclear industry for high
   temperature applications due to their radiation resistance, chemical
   inertness, high thermal stability and low thermal conductivity. However,
   wide application of zirconia ceramics is hindered by their degradation
   behavior in aqueous media. In this research, moderately dense 8mol\%
   Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) as well as YSZ based ceramics
   containing 5, 10 and 15mol\% CeO2 were fabricated via Spark Plasma
   Sintering (SPS). Sintered ceramics were subjected to static degradation
   testing in supercritical water at 400 degrees C and 31MPa. The weight
   loss and microstructural changes of the ceramics associated with
   supercritical water exposure were studied, and the results suggest that
   the addition of CeO2 significantly reduced the degradation rate and
   improved the bulk structural stability of the ceramic composite. This
   behavior was attributed to the enhanced stabilization of the zirconia
   lattice, preventing the evolution of the undesirable monoclinic-ZrO2
   phase.}},

Abstract = {{The paste extrusion process of two types of PTFE has been studied in
   capillary extrusion using dies having different reduction ratio (RR) and
   die entrance angles. The extrusion pressure shows a weak increase with
   shear rate over a wide range of flow rates and a more significant
   increase with reduction ratio. Moreover, the extrusion pressure exhibits
   a minimum for entrance angle at around 30 degrees. A simple analytical
   model based on the radial flow hypothesis (previously developed) has
   been found to represent the extrusion pressure adequately as a function
   of flow rate (shear rate) and geometrical characteristics of the
   capillary dies. The extrudates collected at different processing
   conditions were dried and tested in uniaxial extension to assess their
   effect on mechanical properties. The tensile modulus, yield stress and
   ultimate tensile strength of the obtained extrudates were found to be
   increasing functions of reduction ratio, although the opposite effect
   was found for the ultimate elongational strain. These mechanical
   properties are also found to be insensitive to changes in the die
   entrance angle although the ultimate tensile strength has shown a
   maximum at the entrance angle of about 60 degrees. The PTFE paste
   extrudates show a Poisson's ratio equal to zero in tensile experiments,
   thus exhibiting expansion (significant density reduction with
   stretching). Finally, a simple model was derived for the density change
   in tensile deformation by taking into the account the Poisson's ratio
   and the strain recovery (recovery of the elastic energy stored upon
   removal of the tensile stress).}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Ultrasound imaging provides a low-cost, real-time modality to
   guide needle insertion procedures, but localizing the needle using
   conventional ultrasound images is often challenging. Estimating the
   needle trajectory can increase the success rate of ultrasound-guided
   needle interventions and improve patient comfort. In this study, a novel
   method is introduced to localize the needle trajectory in curvilinear
   ultrasound images based on the needle reflection pattern of circular
   ultrasound waves.
   Methods: A circular ultrasound wave was synthesized by sequentially
   firing the elements of a curvilinear transducer and recording the
   radio-frequency signals received by each element. Two features, namely,
   the large amplitude and repetitive reflection pattern, were used to
   identify the needle echoes in the received signals. The trajectory of
   the needle was estimated by fitting the arrival times of needle echoes
   to an equation that describes needle reflection of circular waves. The
   method was employed to estimate the trajectories of needles inserted in
   agar phantom, beef muscle, and porcine tissue specimens.
   Results: The maximum error rates of estimating the needle trajectories
   were on the order of 1 mm and 3. for the radial and azimuth coordinates,
   respectively.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method can improve
   the robustness and accuracy of needle segmentation methods by adding
   signature-based detection of the needle trajectory in curvilinear
   ultrasound images. The method can be implemented on conventional
   ultrasound imaging systems. (C) 2015 American Association of Physicists

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{491-498}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study, torrefied sawdust produced from pine sawdust in a fixed
   bed reactor was mixed with different binders in a ratio of 5-30 wt.\%,
   and then compressed into pellets in a single die press to explore the
   feasibility of making torrefied pellets from torrefied powders. The
   quality of torrefied pellets was examined based on pellet density,
   higher heating value, hardness, saturated moisture uptake, and energy
   density. Results showed that torrefied sawdust particles prepared under
   typical torrefaction conditions (280-300 degrees C for 10-30 min) could
   be made into strong pellets by compression at a die temperature higher
   than 220 degrees C or by introducing biomass binders such as untreated
   sawdust, starch or lignin at a lower die temperature. The pellets
   density and bulk density made at a low die temperature with binders were
   slightly lower than those made at a die temperature of 220 degrees C or
   higher without the binder, and the energy density of torrefied pellets
   was similar to the control pellets made from untreated sawdust. Since
   the raw sawdust is abundantly available and much cheaper than lignin and
   starch, it is recommended as a low-cost and effective binder for
   densifying torrefied sawdust into torrefied pellets. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   index for drinking water management in small systems}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{187}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to produce a drinking water assessment tool
   for operators of small distribution systems. A drinking water quality
   index (DWQI) was developed and applied to small systems based on the
   water quality index of the Canadian Council of Ministers of Environment.
   The drinking water quality index was adapted to specific needs by
   creating four drinking water quality scenarios. First, the temporal and
   spatial dimensions of drinking water quality variability were taken into
   account. The DWQI was designed to express global drinking water quality
   according to different monitoring frequencies. Daily, monthly, and
   seasonal assessment was also considered. With the data made available,
   it was possible to use the index as a spatial monitoring tool and
   express water quality in different points in the distribution system.
   Moreover, adjustments were made to prioritize the type of contaminant to
   monitor. For instance, monitoring contaminants with acute health effects
   led to a scenario based on daily measures, including easily accessible
   and affordable water quality parameters. On the other hand, contaminants
   with chronic effects, especially disinfection by products, were
   considered in a seasonal monitoring scenario where disinfection
   by-product reference values were redefined according to their seasonal
   variability. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out to validate the
   index. Globally, the DWQI developed is adapted to the needs of small
   systems. In fact, expressing drinking water quality using the DWQI
   contributes to the identification of problematic periods and segments in
   the distribution system. Further work may include this index in the
   development of a customized decision-making tool for small-system
   operators and managers.}},

Abstract = {{Distribution systems are undergoing many enhancements and developments
   to enable the future smart grid, and distribution system state
   estimation (DSSE) provides the control centers with the information
   necessary for several of its applications and operational functions.
   However, the quality of DSSE typically suffers from a lack of
   adequate/accurate measurements. Recently, many electric utilities have
   started to install fairly accurate smart meters throughout their
   distribution networks, which create an opportunity to achieve higher
   quality DSSE. However, the signals provided by smart meters are
   generally not synchronized and the difference between the measurement
   times of smart meters can be significant. Therefore, a complete snapshot
   of the entire distribution system may not be available. This paper
   proposes a method to deal with the issue of nonsynchronized measurements
   coming from smart meters based on the credibility of each available
   measurement and appropriately adjusting the variance of the measurement
   devices. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two
   IEEE benchmark systems are used. The results show that the proposed
   method is robust and improves the accuracy of DSSE compared with the
   traditional DSSE approach.}},

Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{41-53}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Several studies have investigated the relationship between
   field-measured conflicts and the conflicts obtained from
   micro-simulation models using the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model
   (SSAM). Results from recent studies have shown that while reasonable
   correlation between simulated and real traffic conflicts can be obtained
   especially after proper calibration, more work is still needed to
   confirm that simulated conflicts provide safety measures beyond what can
   be expected from exposure. As well, the results have emphasized that
   using micro-simulation model to evaluate safety without proper model
   calibration should be avoided. The calibration process adjusts relevant
   simulation parameters to maximize the correlation between field-measured
   and simulated conflicts.
   The main objective of this study is to investigate the transferability
   of calibrated parameters of the traffic simulation model (VISSIM) for
   safety analysis between different sites. The main purpose is to examine
   whether the calibrated parameters, when applied to other sites, give
   reasonable results in terms of the correlation between the
   field-measured and the simulated conflicts. Eighty-three hours of video
   data from two signalized intersections in Surrey, BC were used in this
   study. Automated video-based computer vision techniques were used to
   extract vehicle trajectories and identify field-measured rear-end
   conflicts. Calibrated VISSIM parameters obtained from the first
   intersection which maximized the correlation between simulated and
   field-observed conflicts were used to estimate traffic conflicts at the
   second intersection and to compare the results to parameters optimized
   specifically for the second intersection. The results show that the
   VISSIM parameters are generally transferable between the two locations
   as the transferred parameters provided better correlation between
   simulated and field-measured conflicts than using the default VISSIM
   parameters. Of the six VISSIM parameters identified as important for the
   safety analysis, two parameters were directly transferable, three
   parameters were transferable to some degree, and one parameter was not
   transferable. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The V0 interneuronal population is derived from Dbx1 expressing
   progenitors. Initial studies on these interneurons in the mouse spinal
   cord demonstrated that they project commissural axons and are involved
   in coordinating left-right alternation during locomotion. Subsequent
   work has indicated that the V0 population can be divided into
   genetically distinct ventral (V0(V)) and dorsal (V0(D)) subpopulations,
   and experimental evidence suggests that each is responsible for
   left-right alternation at different locomotor speeds. In this study, we
   perform a series of experiments to probe the location and connectivity
   of these subpopulations in neonatal mice and demonstrate that they are
   more diverse than previously predicted. While the distribution of either
   subpopulation remains consistent along the extent of the lumbar spinal
   cord, a cluster of V0(D) cells lateral to the central canal receive
   substantial input from primary afferents. Retrograde tracing and
   activity dependent labeling experiments demonstrate that a group of V0
   interneurons located in this same region preferentially project axons
   towards contralateral motoneurons via an oligosynaptic pathway, and are
   active during fictive locomotion. Our results suggest that this subset
   of V0 interneurons may be primarily responsible for coordination of
   left-right alternation during locomotion. Furthermore these experiments
   indicate that while genetic identity is one determinant of the function
   of a neuron during locomotion, the specific position in which the cell
   is located may also play a key role. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract = {{A generalized mechanics model of multi-point thread turning operations
   is presented. The cross section of the chip is determined from the

   considering the varying effective oblique cutting angles and chip
   thickness. The nonlinear Kienzle force model is used to account for the
   effect of edge radius at low chip thickness values. Total cutting forces
   are obtained by resolving the elemental forces in the insert coordinate
   system, and integrating them along the engaged teeth. The experimentally
   validated generalized mechanics model can be used to predict the chip
   and cutting load distributions for multi-point inserts with custom
   thread profiles and infeed plans. The model can be used for both process

   Illustrative Example with the City of Calgary Water Main Failure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PIPELINE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Several statistical models have been proposed to study effects of
   different covariates in the failure of water pipes. In this paper, three
   statistical models, the Weibull proportional hazard model (WPHM), the
   Cox proportional hazard model (Cox-PHM), and the Poisson model (PM),
   were considered. Curve fitting techniques were proposed for estimation
   of a baseline hazard function equation for the Cox-PHM to allow for its
   application in break prediction. The water main failure in the City of
   Calgary is used for this study. From the statistical models, physical
   covariates (e.g., pipe diameter, length) compared with environmental
   covariates (e.g., temperature) were the critical factors impacting the
   pipe failure rate. Furthermore, WHPM and PM showed the best fit for
   prediction of metallic and PVC pipes, respectively. Pipe break
   prediction through estimation of baseline hazard by curve fitting
   techniques produces good results especially for a young system. This
   study recommends that a combination of models rather than a single model
   be used in assessing pipe network condition based on the rate of
   deterioration and material type of the system. (C) 2015 American Society

   graphene}},
Journal = {{ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Carbon nanomaterials are promising for making high-performance
   supercapacitors. However, their specific capacitances and energy
   densities still need further improvement for many important and
   challenging applications. Here we report the superior capacitive
   performance of heteroatom-doped graphene synthesized by a thermal
   annealing method at low temperature (200 degrees C), and remarkably
   enhanced specific capacitance of 629 F g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1), energy
   density of 43 Wh kg(-1) at 140W kg(-1), and cycle life of 10,000 times
   are achieved. The mechanisms for the outstanding performance are
   analyzed, and a corresponding model connecting the dopant and
   capacitance is proposed and validated by the first-principle
   calculations. The thermal annealing temperature plays a critical role in
   the dopant configuration of heteroatom and hence significantly affects
   the capacitive properties of graphene If annealing at low temperature,
   non-graphitic dopant configuration is dominant, inducing a large
   Faradaic pseudocapacitance; if annealing at high temperature, graphitic
   clopant configuration is dominant, giving rise to a relatively lower
   electrical double layer capacitance. These findings demonstrate that the
   supercapacitance of graphene can be purposely tuned by the rational
   doping of heteroatoms, which may open up new strategies for further
   design and application of advanced graphene-based materials for
   electrochemical supercapacitors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{BULLETIN OF EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A simple approach is introduced to identify and calibrate analytical
   models of multi-story buildings from their vibration records. The method
   is based on the Transfer Matrix formulation of the response, and
   requires that vibration time histories are known at every floor of the
   building. Since this is typically not the case, first a methodology is
   developed to estimate vibration time histories at non-instrumented
   floors of the building from those recorded at the instrumented floors,
   based on the assumption that the mode shapes of a multi-story building
   can be approximated as a linear combination of the mode shapes of a
   shear beam and a bending beam. Once the vibration time histories are
   known at every floor, it is shown by using the Transfer Matrix
   formulation that the top-to-bottom spectral ratio of the records at a
   particular story is dependent only on the properties of this story and
   the stories above. In other words, any change in the characteristics of
   the stories below does not affect the spectral ratio for this story.
   Therefore, starting from the top story, we can identify frequency of
   each story (i.e., story stiffness/story mass), or directly story
   stiffness if the story mass is known. In addition to system
   identification, the approach also provides a simple tool to calibrate
   analytical models of multi-story buildings from their vibration records.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, ten large ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) beams
   reinforced with steel rebars were fabricated and tested. The
   experimental parameters included reinforcement ratio and steel fiber
   type. Two different reinforcement ratios (rho = 0.94\% and 1.50\%) and
   steel fiber types (smooth and twisted steel fibers) were adopted. In
   addition, three different fiber lengths (L-f = 13, 19.5, and 30 mm) for
   the smooth steel fibers and one fiber length (L-f = 30 mm) for the
   twisted steel fiber were considered. For a control specimen, a UHPC
   matrix without fiber was also considered. Test results indicated that
   the addition of steel fibers significantly improved the load carrying
   capacity, post-cracking stiffness, and cracking response, but it
   decreased the ductility. Specifically, with the inclusion of 2\% by
   volume of steel fibers, approximately 27-54\% higher load carrying
   capacity and 13-73\% lower ductility were obtained. In addition, an
   increase in the length of smooth steel fibers and the use of twisted
   steel fibers led to the improvements of post-peak response and
   ductility, whereas no noticeable difference in the load carrying
   capacity, post-cracking stiffness, and cracking response were obtained
   according to the fiber length and type. Sectional analysis incorporating
   the suggested material models was also performed based on AFGC/SETRA
   recommendations, and the ratios of flexural capacities obtained from
   experiments and numerical analyses ranged from 0.91 to 1.19. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The hydrodynamics of rectangular spout-fluid beds are studied using
   Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM), a
   powerful approach in simulating gas-solid flows. Modified Navier-Stokes
   equations for the gas phase mass and momentum balance, and Newton's
   second law for the solid phase motion are coupled with Newton's third
   law of motion. Contact forces of particles and particle-wall collisions
   are based on a spring-damper system. The results show good agreement
   with 24,500 spherical particles for a column of 15 mm thickness and 150
   mm width. The effect of column thickness and 3D effects are investigated
   by studying thicknesses of 30, 60, and 90 mm with 49,000, 98,000, and
   147,000 particles. The effects of 2D and 3D CFD modeling on the pressure
   drop, air velocity, particle flux, and voidage profiles in different
   directions are compared in a column of thickness 30 mm. In addition to
   demonstrating the capability of CFD-DEM to model rectangular spout-fluid
   beds, it is shown that bed thickness and CFD modeling dimensions affect
   the flow and should be considered in numerical simulations. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The effect of mean stress on the multiaxial High Cycle Fatigue (HCF)
   behaviour of cast A356-T6 alloy containing natural and artificial
   defects with varying Secondary Dendrite Arming Spacing (SDAS) has been
   investigated experimentally. Tension, torsion and combined tension
   torsion fatigue tests have been performed for two loading ratios:
   R-sigma = 0 and R-sigma = 1. A Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was
   used to perform fractographic analysis of the fracture surfaces to
   characterise the defect causing failure. In order to gauge the effect of
   mean stress and defects, the results are reported with standard Kitagawa
   and Haigh diagrams. A surface response method has been employed to
   characterise the influence of defect size and SDAS on the fatigue limit.
   Relationships and correlations describing the observed behaviour have
   been incorporated in the Defect Stress Gradient (DSG) criterion with the
   goal of determining the influence of defects on the fatigue limit
   through a stress gradient approach.
   Results clearly show that: (i) the mean stress has a detrimental effect
   on the fatigue limit. This effect is a function of the loading, which is
   most pronounced under tension, less under combined tension torsion, and
   least pronounced under torsion conditions; (ii) in the absence of
   defects, the SDAS controls the fatigue limit of cast A356, this effect
   is much more important under torsion loading; (iii) the DSG criterion is
   improved by the mean of a parameter describing the microstructure effect
   through the SDAS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gasification of blends of biomass and coal can offer renewable fuels the
   scale and extent of deployment usually associated with fossil fuels. For
   significant penetration of renewables, however, co-utilization of
   significant quantities of biomass is required, which significantly
   impacts process performance. At a fundamental level, char reactivity
   affects many practical aspects of gasifier operation, and is complicated
   by the influence of blends of coal and biomass and their different
   behaviour during devolatilization. In this work, intrinsic gasification
   reaction kinetics of chars from biomass and coal mixtures with different
   proportions were studied: one set of chars produced separately and mixed
   prior to gasification; and another with chars produced from co-pyrolysis
   of biomass-coal blends. Lower specific and intrinsic rates were observed
   for the samples where the biomass and coal were pyrolyzed together than
   when they were pyrolyzed separately, suggesting some interaction during
   devolatilization that affects reactivity behaviour. XRD results showed
   that the catalytically-active calcium species in the biomass interacted
   with the aluminosilicate species in the coal mineral matter to form
   Ca2Al2SiO7 (gehlenite) crystals, which are catalytically inert. The
   conversion of catalytically-active Ca to catalytically-inactive Ca may
   have led to lower reactivity of co-pyrolyzed mixtures, highlighting the
   importance of understanding the type and nature of often
   catalytically-active species when investigating the gasification
   behaviour of blends of coal and biomass materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3425-3436}},

Abstract = {{The deployment of the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in
   distribution systems provides an excellent opportunity for load
   monitoring applications. Load decomposition can be done at the smart
   meters level, providing a better understanding of the load behavior at
   near-real-time. In this paper, loads' current and voltage waveforms are
   processed offline to form a comprehensive library. This library consists
   of a set of measurements projected onto the eigenloads space. Eigenloads
   are basically the eigenvectors describing the load signatures space.
   Similar to human faces, every load has a distinct signature. Each load
   measurement is transformed into a photo and an efficient face
   recognition algorithm is applied to the set of photos. A list of all the
   online devices is always stored and can be accessed at any time. The
   proposed method can be implemented at the smart meters level. The
   distributed computation that can be achieved by performing simple
   calculations at each smart meter, without the need for sending intensive
   data to a central processor, is beneficial. From a system operator
   perspective, load composition in near-real-time provides the loads'
   voltage dependence that are needed, for example, in volt-VAR
   optimization (VVO) in distribution systems. Further applications of load
   composition data are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Novel magnetically recyclable spinel nickel ferrite/multi-walled carbon
   nanotubes hybrids (NiFe2O4/MWCNTs hybrids) with different MWCNTs content
   were prepared by a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The as-prepared
   NiFe2O4/MWCNTs hybrids were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), scanning electron
   microscope (SEM) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Photocatalytic
   activity of NiFe2O4/MWCNTs hybrids was investigated by photocatalytic
   decolorization of Congo Red (CR) in aqueous solution under simulated
   solar light irradiation. NiFe2O4/MWCNTs yielded efficient decolorization
   of CR solution with an apparent rate constant of 0.01433 min(-1), which
   was 2.18 times that of NiFe2O4. Significantly enhanced activity of
   NiFe2O4/MWCNTs hybrids resulted from the synergistic contribution of
   both high adsorption capacity towards CR and the participation of holes
   (h(+)), center dot OH radicals and O-2(center dot-) radicals. In
   addition, the NiFe2O4/MWCNTs hybrids can be recovered conveniently using
   an external magnet. As a result, the novel NiFe2O4/MWCNTs could gain a
   promising application in treatment of various dyestuff wastewaters on a
   large scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights

Abstract = {{Recent environmental sharp curbs on fossil fuel energy systems such as
   coal power plants due to their greehhouse gas emissions have compelled
   industries to include renewable fuels. Biomass/coal co-gasification
   could provide a transition from energy production based on fossil fuels
   to renewables. A low-ash coal and switchgrass rich in potassium were
   selected on the basis of previous thermogravimetric studies to steam
   co-gasify 50:50 wt\% coal:switchgrass mixtures in a pilot scale bubbling
   fluidized bed reactor with silica sand as the bed material at similar to
   800 and 860 degrees C and 1 atm. With the switchgrass added to coal, the
   hydrogen and cold gas efficiencies, gas yield and HHV of the product gas
   were enhanced remarkably relative to single-fuel gasification. The
   product gas tar yield also decreased considerably due to decomposition
   of tar catalyzed by switchgrass alkali and alkaline earth metals.
   Switchgrass ash therefore can act as inexpensive natural catalysts for
   steam gasification and assist in operating at lower temperatures without
   being penalized by an increase in product tar yield. An equilibrium
   model over-predicted hydrogen and under-predicted methane
   concentrations. However, an empirically kinetically-modified model was
   able to predict the product gas compositions accurately. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We present a technique for multiple foreground video co-segmentation in
   a set of videos. This technique is based on category-independent object
   proposals. To identify the foreground objects in each frame, we examine
   the properties of the various regions that reflect the characteristics
   of foregrounds, considering the intra-video coherence of the foreground
   as well as the foreground consistency among the different videos in the
   set. Multiple foregrounds are handled via a multi-state selection graph
   in which a node representing a video frame can take multiple labels that
   correspond to different objects. In addition, our method incorporates an
   indicator matrix that for the first time allows accurate handling of
   cases with common foreground objects missing in some videos, thus
   preventing irrelevant regions from being misclassified as foreground
   objects. An iterative procedure is proposed to optimize our new
   objective function. As demonstrated through comprehensive experiments,
   this object-based multiple foreground video co-segmentation method
   compares well with related techniques that co-segment multiple
   foregrounds.}},

Abstract = {{Median filtering detection has recently drawn much attention in image
   editing and image anti-forensic techniques. Current image median
   filtering forensics algorithms mainly extract features manually. To deal
   with the challenge of detecting median filtering from small-size and
   compressed image blocks, by taking into account of the properties of
   median filtering, we propose a median filtering detection method based
   on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can automatically learn
   and obtain features directly from the image. To our best knowledge, this
   is the first work of applying CNNs in median filtering image forensics.
   Unlike conventional CNN models, the first layer of our CNN framework is
   a filter layer that accepts an image as the input and outputs its median
   filtering residual (MFR). Then, via alternating convolutional layers and
   pooling layers to learn hierarchical representations, we obtain multiple
   features for further classification. We test the proposed method on
   several experiments. The results show that the proposed method achieves
   significant performance improvements, especially in the cut-and-paste
   forgery detection.}},

Title = {{Reduced deformability of parasitized red blood cells as a biomarker for
   anti-malarial drug efficacy}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{Background: Malaria remains a challenging and fatal infectious disease
   in developing nations and the urgency for the development of new drugs
   is even greater due to the rapid spread of anti-malarial drug
   resistance. While numerous parasite genetic, protein and metabolite
   biomarkers have been proposed for testing emerging anti-malarial
   compounds, they do not universally correspond with drug efficacy. The
   biophysical character of parasitized cells is a compelling alternative
   to these conventional biomarkers because parasitized erythrocytes become
   specifically rigidified and this effect is potentiated by anti-malarial
   compounds, such as chloroquine and artesunate. This biophysical
   biomarker is particularly relevant because of the mechanistic link
   between cell deformability and enhanced splenic clearance of parasitized
   erythrocytes.
   Methods: Recently a microfluidic mechanism, called the multiplexed
   fluidic plunger that provides sensitive and rapid measurement of single
   red blood cell deformability was developed. Here it was systematically
   used to evaluate the deformability changes of late-stage
   trophozoite-infected red blood cells (iRBCs) after treatment with
   established clinical and pre-clinical anti-malarial compounds.
   Results: It was found that rapid and specific iRBC rigidification was a
   universal outcome of all but one of these drug treatments. The greatest
   change in iRBC rigidity was observed for (+)-SJ733 and NITD246
   spiroindolone compounds, which target the Plasmodium falciparum
   cation-transporting ATPase ATP4. As a proof-of-principle, compounds of
   the bisindole alkaloid class were screened, where cladoniamide A was
   identified based on rigidification of iRBCs and was found to have
   previously unreported anti-malarial activity with an IC50 lower than
   chloroquine.
   Conclusion: These results demonstrate that rigidification of iRBCs may
   be used as a biomarker for anti-malarial drug efficacy, as well as for
   new drug screening. The novel anti-malarial properties of cladoniamide A
   were revealed in a proof-of-principle drug screen.}},

Abstract = {{Titania-Alumina coatings were grown on titanium substrates by
   Eectrophoretic Enhanced Micro Arc Oxidation (EEMAO) technique in
   electrolytes containing various concentrations of alumina nanopartides.
   The effect of concentration of alumina on surface morphology, phase
   composition, microhardness, and corrosion behavior was investigated at
   different voltages. It was found that the impact of alumina
   concentration on microstructure actually depends on the voltage and its
   effects gets more conspicuous at intermediate and high voltages. A finer
   morphology was obtained at higher concentrations of alumina at a
   constant voltage. The coatings mainly consisted of anatase and rutile.
   Tialite was observed at 450V and 3 gl(-1) alumina. The formation
   kinetics and thermodynamics of the tialite phase was studied. In all
   voltages, samples prepared in an alumina-rich electrolyte showed a
   higher surface hardness. The nanocompo site coatings exhibited an
   enhanced corrosion resistance compared to the titanium substrates where
   the effect of alumina concentration became more tangible when the
   voltage exceeded a critical value (350V). At 450V, the polarization
   resistance of the sample prepared in alumina-rich electrolytes was
   higher by 3 orders of magnitude compared to the coating prepared in the
   electrolyte containing 1 gl(-1) alumina. A
   processing-microstructure-properties correlation is established. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents, within the performance-based earthquake engineering
   framework, a comprehensive probabilistic seismic loss estimation method
   that accounts for main sources of uncertainty related to hazard,
   vulnerability, and loss. The loss assessment rigorously integrates
   multiple engineering demand parameters (maximum and residual inter-story
   drift ratio and peak floor acceleration) with consideration of
   mainshock-aftershock sequences. A 4-story non-ductile reinforced
   concrete building located in Victoria, British Colombia, Canada, is
   considered as a case study. For 100 mainshock and mainshock-aftershock
   earthquake records, incremental dynamic analysis is performed, and the
   three engineering demand parameters are fitted with a probability
   distribution and corresponding dependence computed. Finally, with
   consideration of different demolition limit states, loss assessment is
   performed. From the results, it can be shown that when seismic
   vulnerability models are integrated with seismic hazard, the aftershock
   effects are relatively minor in terms of overall seismic loss (1-4\%
   increase). Moreover, demolition limit state parameters, uncertainties of
   collapse fragility, and non-collapse seismic demand prediction models
   have showed significant contribution to the loss assessment. The seismic
   loss curves for the reference case and for cases with the varied
   parameters can differ by as large as about 150\%. Copyright (c) 2015

Title = {{Quantification of confocal fluorescence microscopy for the detection of
   cervical intraepithelial neoplasia}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cervical cancer remains a major health problem, especially
   in developing countries. Colposcopic examination is used to detect
   high-grade lesions in patients with a history of abnormal pap smears.
   New technologies are needed to improve the sensitivity and specificity
   of this technique. We propose to test the potential of fluorescence
   confocal microscopy to identify high-grade lesions.
   Methods: We examined the quantification of ex vivo confocal fluorescence
   microscopy to differentiate among normal cervical tissue, low-grade
   Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN), and high-grade CIN. We sought
   to (1) quantify nuclear morphology and tissue architecture features by
   analyzing images of cervical biopsies; and (2) determine the accuracy of
   high-grade CIN detection via confocal microscopy relative to the
   accuracy of detection by colposcopic impression. Forty-six biopsies
   obtained from colposcopically normal and abnormal cervical sites were
   evaluated. Confocal images were acquired at different depths from the
   epithelial surface and histological images were analyzed using in-house
   software.
   Results: The features calculated from the confocal images compared well
   with those features obtained from the histological images and
   histopathological reviews of the specimens (obtained by a gynecologic
   pathologist). The correlations between two of these features (the
   nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and the average of three nearest
   Delaunay-neighbors distance) and the grade of dysplasia were higher than
   that of colposcopic impression. The sensitivity of detecting high-grade
   dysplasia by analysing images collected at the surface of the
   epithelium, and at 15 and 30 mu m below the epithelial surface were
   respectively 100, 100, and 92 \%.
   Conclusions: Quantitative analysis of confocal fluorescence images
   showed its capacity for discriminating high-grade CIN lesions vs.
   low-grade CIN lesions and normal tissues, at different depth of imaging.
   This approach could be used to help clinicians identify high-grade CIN
   in clinical settings.}},

Abstract = {{R2{*} relaxometry of the brain is a quantitative magnetic resonance
   technique which is influenced by iron and myelin content across
   different brain regions. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common
   inflammatory, demyelinating disease affecting both white and grey matter
   regions of the CNS. Using R2{*}, increased iron deposition has been
   described in deep gray matter of MS patients. Iron accumulation might
   promote oxidative stress in the brain, which can lead to cell death and
   neurodegeneration. However, recent histological work indicates that iron
   may be reduced within the normal appearing white matter (WM) in MS. In
   the present study we analyzed the R2{*} signal across the white matter
   in 39 patients with MS, 31 asymptomatic age matched siblings of patients
   and 30 age-matched controls. The measurement of R2{*} in white matter is
   affected by the signal's dependency on white matter fibre orientation
   with respect to the main magnetic field which can be accounted using
   diffusion tensor imaging. We observed a clear separation of the three
   study groups in R2{*}. The values in the MS group were significantly
   lower compared to the siblings and controls, while the siblings group
   presented with significantly higher R2{*} values than both unrelated
   healthy controls and patients. Furthermore, we found significantly
   decreased normal-appearing white matter R2{*} values in patients with
   more severe disease course. Angle resolved analysis of R2{*} improves
   the sensitivity for detecting subtle differences in WM R2{*} compared to
   standard histogram based analyses. Our findings suggest that the
   decreased R2{*} values in MS are due to diffuse tissue damage and
   decreased myelin in the normal appearing and diffusely abnormal WM. The
   increased R2{*} in unaffected siblings may identify a predisposition to
   increased iron and the potential for oxidative stress as a risk factor
   for developing MS.}},

Abstract = {{Structural changes of aggregates composed of inorganic salts exposed to
   relative humidity (RH) between 0 and 80\% after formation at selected RH
   between 0 and 60\% were investigated using a tandem differential
   mobility analyzer (TDMA) and fluorescence microscopy. The TDMA was used
   to measure a shift in peak mobility diameter for 100-700 nm aggregates
   of hygroscopic aerosol particles composed of NaCl, Na2SO4, (NH4)(2)SO4,
   and nonhygroscopic Al2O3 as the RH was increased. Aggregates of
   hygroscopic particles were found to shrink when exposed to RH greater
   than that during the aggregation process. The degree of aggregate
   restructuring is greater for larger aggregates and greater increases in
   RH. Growth factors (GF) calculated from mobility diameter measurements
   as low as 0.77 were seen for NaCl before deliquescence. The GF
   subsequently increased to 1.23 at 80\% RH, indicating growth after
   deliquescence. Exposure to RH lower than that experienced during
   aggregation did not result in structural changes. Fluorescent microscopy
   confirmed that aggregates formed on wire surfaces undergo an
   irreversible change in structure when exposed to elevated RH. Analysis
   of 2D movement of aggregates shows a displacement of 5-13\% compared to
   projected length of initial aggregate from a wire surface. Surface
   tension due to water adsorption within the aggregate structure is a
   potential cause of the structural changes.}},

Title = {{Effect of temperature \& salt concentration on salt tolerant
   nitrate-perchlorate reducing bacteria: Nitrate degradation kinetics}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{345-353}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{The sustainability of nitrate-contaminated water treatment using
   ion-exchange processes can be achieved by regenerating the exhausted
   resin several times. Our previous study shows that the use of multicycle
   bioregeneration of resin enclosed in membrane is an effective and
   innovative regeneration method. In this research, the effects of two
   independent factors (temperature and salt concentration) on the
   biological denitrification rate were studied. The results of this
   research along with the experimental results of the previous study on
   the effect of the same factors on nitrate desorption rate from the resin
   allow the optimization of the bioregeneration process.
   The results of nitrate denitrification rate study show that the
   biodegradation rate at different temperature and salt concentration is
   independent of the initial nitrate concentration. At each specific salt
   concentration, the nitrate removal rate increased with increasing
   temperature with the average value of 0.001110 +/- 0.0000647
   mg-nitrate/mg-VSS.h.degrees C. However, the effect of different salt
   concentrations was dependent on the temperature; there is a significant
   interaction between salt concentration and temperature; within each
   group of temperatures, the nitrate degradation rate decreased with
   increasing the salt concentration. The temperature affected the
   tolerance to-salinity and culture was less tolerant to high
   concentration of salt at low temperature. Evidenced by the difference
   between the minimum and maximum nitrate degradation rate being greater
   at lower temperature. At 35 degrees C, a 32\% reduction in the nitrate
   degradation rate was observed while at 12 degrees C this reduction was
   69\%. This is the first published study to examine the interaction of
   salt concentration and temperature during biological denitrification.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},

Abstract = {{We study nonlinear transmission of wave energy in a finite dissipative
   periodic structure, which is harmonically driven at one end at a forcing
   frequency lying within its stop band. We show that there is a threshold
   for the driving amplitude above which there is a sudden increase in the
   energy transmitted across the finite structure. This generic phenomenon
   for discrete nonlinear periodic systems is due to a loss of stability of
   the periodic solutions that are initially localized to the driven end of
   the structure. The transmission threshold is therefore predicted
   analytically based on the corresponding saddle node bifurcation. The
   influence of damping, strength of coupling and the type of nonlinearity
   (hardening or softening) are assessed. In particular, we show that
   damping may eliminate the transmission phenomenon within a frequency
   range in the stop band. Increasing the strength of coupling between the
   units is found to increase the minimum force required for the onset of
   transmission, and the type of nonlincarity determines on which side of
   the pass band the enhanced transmission may occur. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Atomistic study of diffusion-mediated plasticity and creep using phase
   field crystal methods}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{The nonequilibrium dynamics of diffusion-mediated plasticity and creep
   in materials subjected to constant load at high homologous temperatures
   is studied atomistically using phase field crystal (PFC) methods. Creep
   stress and grain size exponents obtained for nanopolycrystalline
   systems, m similar or equal to 1.02 and p similar or equal to 1.98,
   respectively, closely match those expected for idealized diffusional
   Nabarro-Herring creep. These exponents are observed in the presence of
   significant stress-assisted diffusive grain boundary migration,
   indicating that Nabarro-Herring creep and stress-assisted boundary
   migration contribute in the same manner to the macroscopic constitutive
   relation. When plastic response is dislocation-mediated, power-law
   stress exponents inferred from dislocation climb rates are found to
   increase monotonically from m similar or equal to 3, as expected for
   generic climb-mediated natural creep, to m similar or equal to 5.8 as
   the dislocation density.d is increased beyond typical experimental
   values. Stress exponents m greater than or similar to 3 directly
   measured from simulations that include dislocation nucleation, climb,
   glide, and annihilation are attributed primarily to these large rho(d)
   effects. Extrapolation to lower rho(d) suggests that m similar or equal
   to 4-4.5 should be obtained from our PFC description at typical
   experimental rho(d) values, which is consistent with expectations for
   power-law creep via mixed climb and glide. The anomalously large stress
   exponents observed in our atomistic simulations at large rho(d) may
   nonetheless be relevant to systems in which comparable densities are
   obtained locally within heterogeneous defect domains such as dislocation
   cell walls or tangles.}},

Abstract = {{Construction industry creates a massive amount of waste, which typically
   ends up in landfills. Canadian construction industry represents 30\% of
   the total municipal solid waste deposited in landfills. Construction and
   demolition (C\&D) waste has created negative socioeconomic and
   environmental impacts including contaminating ground water, emitting
   greenhouse gases, and adding more waste to scarce landfills. Literature
   is cited rework/waste generation due to ambiguity/errors in construction
   contract documents. Exculpatory clauses in contract documents are
   included in contractual agreements to prevent contractor claims, which
   often cause rework. After an extensive contract documents review, these
   clauses were categorized in to eight major areas. This paper (1)
   analyses expert opinions on pre-identified contractual clauses; and (2)
   introduces recommendations to minimize rework and waste in construction
   projects. It was found that the clauses related to quality, workmanship,
   and field quality control/inspection have the most potential to generate
   construction waste.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel decision-making framework for seismic
   vulnerability assessment of bulk power systems by using hierarchical
   network decomposition. This decomposition incorporates both the
   electrical properties of the network (e.g. electrical distance, power
   flow) and the system's configuration (i.e. form). Vulnerability is
   evaluated in terms of two basic criteria: form and strength. Thus, the
   hierarchical decomposition is used to evaluate weaknesses in the
   intrinsic structure of the system and to identify critical elements in
   terms of form. On the other hand, the element mechanical properties
   characterise the strength, which is defined in terms of the probability
   of obtaining a certain damage level of the power system under different
   earthquake scenarios. The proposed approach is illustrated with an
   assessment of the benchmark case of the IEEE 118 Bus Test Case. Results
   showed it provides a better insight and understanding of seismic
   vulnerability compared to traditional methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computational study for a high-speed centrifugal
   compressor stage with a design pressure ratio equal to 4, the stage
   consisting of a splittered unshrouded impeller and a wedged vaned
   diffuser. The aim of this paper is to investigate numerically the
   modifications of the flow structure during a surge cycle. The
   investigations are based on the results of unsteady three-dimensional,
   compressible flow simulations, using large eddy simulation (LES) model.
   Instantaneous and mean flow field analyses are presented in the impeller
   inducer and in the vaned diffuser region through one surge cycle time
   intervals. The computational data compare favorably with the measured
   data, from the literature, for the same compressor and operational
   point. The surge event phases are well detected inside the impeller and
   diffuser. The time-averaged loading on the impeller main blade is
   maximum near the trialing edge and near the tip. The amplitude of the
   unsteady pressure fluctuation is maximum for the flow reversal condition
   and reaches values up to 70\% of the dynamic pressure. The diffuser vane
   exhibits high-pressure fluctuation from the vane leading edge to 50\% of
   the chord length. High-pressure fluctuation is detected during the
   forward flow recovery condition as a result of the shock wave that moves
   toward the diffuser outlet.}},

Abstract = {{It is predicted that billions of intelligent devices and networks, such
   as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), will not be isolated but connected
   and integrated with computer networks in future Internet of Things
   (IoT). In order to well maintain those sensor devices, it is often
   necessary to evolve devices to function correctly by allowing device
   management (DM) entities to remotely monitor and control devices without
   consuming significant resources. In this paper, we propose a lightweight
   RESTful Web service (WS) approach to enable device management of
   wireless sensor devices. Specifically, motivated by the recent
   development of IPv6-based open standards for accessing wireless
   resource-constrained networks, we consider to implement IPv6 over
   low-power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN)/routing protocol for
   low power and lossy network (RPL)/constrained application protocol
   (CoAP) protocols on sensor devices and propose a CoAP-based DM solution
   to allow easy access and management of IPv6 sensor devices. By
   developing a prototype cloud system, we successfully demonstrate the
   proposed solution in efficient and effective management of wireless
   sensor devices.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the design of a proof-of-concept drug delivery device
   that is actuated using the bubbles formed during electrolysis. The
   device uses a platinum (Pt) coated nickel (Ni) metal foam and a solid
   drug in reservoir (SDR) approach to improve the device's performance.
   This electrochemically-driven pump has many features that are unlike
   conventional drug delivery devices: it is capable of pumping
   periodically and being refilled automatically; it features drug release
   control; and it enables targeted delivery. Pt-coated metal foam is used
   as a catalytic reforming element, which reduces the period of each
   delivery cycle. Two methods were used for fabricating the Pt-coated
   metal: sputtering and electroplating. Of these two methods, the
   sputtered Pt-coated metal foam has a higher pumping rate; it also has a
   comparable recombination rate when compared to the electroplated
   Pt-coated metal foam. The only drawback of this catalytic reformer is
   that it consumes nickel scaffold. Considering long-term applications,
   the electroplated Pt metal foam was selected for drug delivery, where a
   controlled drug release rate of 2.2 mu g +/- 0.3 mu g per actuation
   pulse was achieved using 4 mW of power.}},

Abstract = {{Many common needle intervention procedures are performed with ultrasound
   guidance because it is a flexible, cost-effective and widely available
   intra-operative imaging modality. In a needle insertion procedure with
   ultrasound guidance, real-time calculation and visualization of the
   needle trajectory can help to guide the choice of puncture site and
   needle angle to reach the target depicted in the ultrasound image. We
   found that it is feasible to calculate the needle trajectory with a
   single camera mounted directly on the ultrasound transducer by using the
   needle markings. Higher accuracy is achieved compared with other similar
   transducer-mounted needle trackers. We used an inexpensive, real-time
   and easy-to-use tracking method based on an automatic feature extraction
   algorithm and a closed-form method for pose estimation of the needle.
   The overall accuracy was 0.94 +/- 0.46 mm. (E-mail: rohling@ece.ubc.ca)

Abstract = {{Phase matching of backward second harmonic generation (SHG) in a
   periodic structure of collagen fibrils is investigated through
   theoretical modeling, simulation, and experiments. The lattice structure
   of collagen fibrils is considered to provide a virtual momentum for
   assisting the phase matching of backward SHG. Phase matching over a
   relatively wide excitation wavelength range is achieved by tilting the
   angle of the fundamental excitation and SHG wave vectors. The SHG
   intensity in the periodic structure is simulated to quantify the phase
   matching effect. The effect of the fundamental excitation and the SHG
   emission angles on the peak excitation wavelength of the SHG excitation
   spectrum is further validated in experiments, where the excitation and
   emission angles are controlled by spatial filtering. It is found that an
   optimized excitation wavelength exists for a certain collagen fibril
   structure, which shifts toward a shorter wavelength when the excitation
   and emission angles are increased. Our results show that the lattice
   structure of collagen fibrils can assist the phase matching, providing a
   mechanism for generating backward SHG in multiphoton microscopy. (C)

Abstract = {{Recent clinical studies show that the contour of the photoplethysmogram
   (PPG) wave contains valuable information for characterizing
   cardiovascular activity. However, analyzing the PPG wave contour is
   difficult; therefore, researchers have applied first or higher order
   derivatives to emphasize and conveniently quantify subtle changes in the
   filtered PPG contour. Our hypothesis is that analyzing the whole PPG
   recording rather than each PPG wave contour or on a beat-by-beat basis
   can detect heat-stressed subjects and that, consequently, we will be
   able to investigate the impact of global warming on human health. Here,
   we explore the most suitable derivative order for heat stress assessment
   based on the energy and entropy of the whole PPG recording. The results
   of our study indicate that the use of the entropy of the seventh
   derivative of the filtered PPG signal shows promising results in
   detecting heat stress using 20-second recordings, with an overall
   accuracy of 71.6\%. Moreover, the combination of the entropy of the
   seventh derivative of the filtered PPG signal with the root mean square
   of successive differences, or RMSSD (a traditional heart rate
   variability index of heat stress), improved the detection of heat stress
   to 88.9\% accuracy.}},

   recordings. After examining 14 time domain features using leave-one-out
   cross-validation, we found that the aa energy extracted from PPG signals
   is the most informative feature for classifying heat-stressed subjects,
   with an overall accuracy of 79\%. Moreover, the combination of the aa
   energy with the traditional heart rate variability index of heat stress
   (i.e., the square root of the mean of the squares of the successive aa
   intervals) improved the heat stress detection to an overall accuracy of
   83\%.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum communication holds the promise of creating disruptive
   technologies that will play an essential role in future communication
   networks. For example, the study of quantum communication complexity has
   shown that quantum communication allows exponential reductions in the
   information that must be transmitted to solve distributed computational
   tasks. Recently, protocols that realize this advantage using optical
   implementations have been proposed. Here we report a proof-of-concept
   experimental demonstration of a quantum fingerprinting system that is
   capable of transmitting less information than the best-known classical
   protocol. Our implementation is based on a modified version of a
   commercial quantum key distribution system using off-the-shelf optical
   components over telecom wavelengths, and is practical for messages as
   large as 100 Mbits, even in the presence of experimental imperfections.
   Our results provide a first step in the development of experimental
   quantum communication complexity.}},

   using two different placement methods, and an image analysis was
   performed to quantitatively evaluate the fiber distribution
   characteristics such as fiber orientation, fiber dispersion, and number
   of fibers per unit area. The biaxial flexural performances including
   load carrying capacity, energy absorption capacity, and cracking
   behavior were found to be improved with the increase in fiber length up
   to 19.5 mm. The biaxial flexural performances were also influenced by
   the placement method; the specimens with concrete placed at the center
   (maximum moment region) showed better flexural performances than those
   with concrete placed at the corner. These observations were confirmed by
   the image analysis results, which showed poorer fiber orientation and
   fewer fibers across the crack surfaces at the maximum moment region for
   the specimens with concrete placed at the corner, compared with their
   counterparts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{1207-1218}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A thermodynamic analysis has been performed to predict the biomass
   gasification performance on the basis of the minimization of Gibbs free
   energy. The theoretical methane yield was further predicted based on the
   equilibrium in the downstream processes. A C-H-O ternary diagram is
   proposed to predict the boundary for the formation of carbon deposit.
   Three zones, namely carbon deposit, carbon-free and intermediate zone,
   are defined, with possible carbon formation or elimination mechanisms
   being postulated. The biomass gasification performance using different
   gasifying agents, namely H2O, CO2, O-2 or air, was then analyzed.
   Results showed that the steam addition is conductive to enhance carbon
   conversion and shrink the carbon deposit zone, but the use of air, O-2
   and CO2 will impose a negative impact on the methane yield and H-2/CO
   ratio. The maximum methane yield can be achieved at the temperature at
   which carbon is completely converted. The effects of pressure are
   dependent on whether or not solid carbon is absent. Based on the
   analysis on thermodynamic and exergetic efficiencies, it is concluded
   that steam gasification is the preferred conversion scheme for
   biomethane production. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To maintain desirable residual chlorine for a groundwater source,
   optimizing the chlorine dose in small-to medium-sized water distribution
   systems (SM-WDS) is a daunting task in developing countries. Mostly,
   operators add a random chlorine dose without recognizing the smaller
   size of their distribution network. In this research, a modelling
   framework for optimizing chlorine dose in SM-WDS is developed. In order
   to evaluate its practicality, the proposed framework has been applied in
   a case study of a residential neighbourhood in Lahore (Pakistan) with a
   small network spanning over 0.35 km(2). Three datasets for residual
   chlorine were monitored at 6 locations spread over the study area.
   EPANET 2.0 software was used for hydraulic and residual chorine
   modelling. The bulk decay coefficient (K-b) was determined in the
   laboratory, whereas the wall decay coefficient (K-w) was estimated by
   calibrating the simulation results with the residual chlorine determined
   in the field. Based on the calibrated EPANET simulations, a fuzzy
   rule-based model was developed for pragmatic application of the proposed
   framework. Scenario analyses for different situations have also been
   carried out for achieving residual chlorine required at the consumer
   end. This exercise revealed that much lower chlorine doses than the
   existing practice can generate detectable chlorine residuals. Moreover,
   the model can be used to deal with emergency situations, which may arise
   in developing countries due to viral outbreaks and cross-contamination
   events in SM-WDS.}},

Abstract = {{Developing efficient backhauling solutions for small cells is considered
   as one of the most significant challenges in the rollout of the upcoming
   5G cellular systems where massive numbers of small cells will be
   deployed. In this article, we first review small cell evolutions and the
   consequent radio access network architecture evolution toward
   heterogeneity and centralized baseband processing. The backhaul
   solution, which is mainly determined by the availability of existing
   backhaul infrastructures and service demand, will lead to a
   heterogeneous backhaul network architecture. Radio resource management
   issues including cell association, and interference management and
   scheduling with inter-node coordination, as well as how they are related
   to backhaul solutions are discussed. Based on the existing RRM solutions
   and their limitations in multi-tier 5G systems with heterogeneous
   backhaul network architecture, backhaul-aware RRM strategies are
   envisioned. Results from a simple case study of joint cell association
   and bandwidth allocation with a massive MIMO-based in-band wireless
   backhauling framework are presented to demonstrate the performance gain

Title = {{Identification of scalp EEG circadian variation using a novel
   correlation sum measure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective. In this paper, we propose a novel method to determine the
   circadian variation of scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) in both
   individual and group levels using a correlation sum measure, quantifying
   self-similarity of the EEG relative energy across waking epochs.
   Approach. We analysed EEG recordings from central-parietal and
   occipito-parietal montages in nine healthy subjects undergoing a 72 h
   ultradian sleep-wake cycle protocol. Each waking epoch (similar to 1s)
   of every nap opportunity was decomposed using the wavelet packet
   transform, and the relative energy for that epoch was calculated in the
   desired frequency band using the corresponding wavelet coefficients.
   Then, the resulting set of energy values was resampled randomly to
   generate different subsets with equal number of elements. The
   correlation sum of each subset was then calculated over a range of
   distance thresholds, and the average over all subsets was computed. This
   average value was finally scaled for each nap opportunity and considered
   as a new circadian measure. Main results. According to the evaluation
   results, a clear circadian rhythm was identified in some EEG frequency
   ranges, particularly in 4-8 Hz and 10-12 Hz. The correlation sum measure
   not only was able to disclose the circadian rhythm on the group data but
   also revealed significant circadian variations in most individual cases,
   as opposed to previous studies only reporting the circadian rhythms on a
   population of subjects. Compared to a naive measure based on the EEG
   absolute energy in the frequency band of interest, the proposed measure
   showed a clear superiority using both individual and group data. Results
   also suggested that the acrophase (i. e., the peak) of the circadian

Abstract = {{We consider nonlinear signal processing algorithms for downlink
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with multiple-antenna
   users. The design goal is to improve bit error rate (BER) performance by
   jointly optimizing the transceiver, data streams, and user ordering,
   under given total transmit power. We consider a general global objective
   function, whose elements are Schur-convex functions of the mean square
   error (MSE) of each user. With nonlinear Tomlinson-Harashima precoding
   combined with block successive zero-forcing precoding at the
   transmitter, we show that the optimal nonlinear transceiver leads to
   favorable diagonal and parallel structures for all users with the
   general global performance metric. The number of data streams of each
   user is allowed to be an arbitrary number no more than the rank of the
   effective channel. We then provide closed-form expressions of the
   transceiver matrices and optimal power allocation of each user, and
   analytically characterize the optimal number of data streams of each
   user for the minimax and average BER metrics. The user ordering is also
   optimized to further improve the system performance. We also
   analytically investigate the impact of channel spatial correlation on
   the performance of our scheme and illustrate why our proposed adaptive
   strategy canmitigate the performance degradation caused by channel
   spatial correlation. The superiority of our proposed framework is
   demonstrated through numerical results.}},

Abstract = {{Improving the safety of roads and passengers is the main goal of
   intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, reducing traffic and
   car accidents can only be achieved by disseminating safety information
   in a timely manner with high reliability. Although mathematical modeling
   of this process is extremely beneficial, analyzing the information
   dissemination is considerably complex due to the dynamics of vehicles
   and varying travel behavior. We present a mathematical model to study
   the delay-reliability features in a vehicular network. The proposed
   model not only captures both physical and medium access control (MAC)
   layers' characteristics of this network but addresses the partitioning
   problem, i.e., the tendency of cars to form disconnected islands, as
   well. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first delay
   model that does all of these, and it can be used to understand the
   message propagation behavior in vehicular networks. The common
   assumption in the literature is that the intervehicle distances (IVDs)
   both inside the island and between islands have the same exponential
   distribution. We show that this assumption is flawed, and subsequently,
   a new and more accurate model is presented. Simulation studies validate
   the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed model for both highway
   and urban scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Assuring quality-of-service (QoS) and guaranteeing effective utilization
   of resources in a network with heterogeneous traffic is difficult due to
   the conflicting requirements associated with the different types of
   traffic. Nevertheless, emerging high-bandwidth third/fourth-generation
   (3G/4G) technologies, such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and
   LTE-Advanced, are expected to meet the demands of new applications by
   providing high data rates while simultaneously satisfying each of the
   individual QoS criteria. The relevant standards recommend single-carrier
   frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA) as the preferred uplink
   transmission scheme. In this paper, we have formulated the uplink
   scheduling problem for SC-FDMA-based heterogeneous traffic systems
   considering both standard specific constraints and individual user QoS
   requirements. To capture the QoS requirements of different types of
   traffic, we adopt a utility function that is already used for the
   downlink operation of code-division multiple-access (CDMA)-based
   systems. We also consider an opportunity cost function that is based on
   granular resource utilization to increase the usefulness of our results
   in practical situations. We have used the dual decomposition method to
   solve the resulting problem. Given the high computational complexity of
   the optimal solution, we have also proposed a suboptimal algorithm that
   is less complex but which offers acceptable performance. In our
   evaluation of the performance of our proposed uplink scheduling scheme,
   we assume that the offered traffic is a combination of best effort
   traffic, traffic with specified delay bounds, and traffic with specified
   throughput requirements. An extensive set of simulation results
   demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of our scheme compared with
   existing solutions employed by LTE, which is a representative
   SC-FDMA-based system.}},

Abstract = {{The current wireless cellular networks can be used to provide
   machine-to-machine (M2M) communication services. However, the Long Term
   Evolution (LTE) networks, which are designed for human users, may not be
   able to handle a large number of bursty random access requests from
   machine-type communication (MTC) devices. In this paper, we propose a
   scheme that uses both access class barring (ACB) and timing advance
   information to prevent random access overload in M2M systems. We
   formulate an optimization problem to determine the optimal ACB
   parameter, which maximizes the expected number of MTC devices
   successfully served in each random access slot. Hence, the number of
   random access slots required to serve all MTC devices can be minimized.
   To reduce the computational complexity and improve the practicability of
   the proposed scheme, we propose a closed-form approximate solution to
   the optimization problem and present an algorithm to estimate the number
   of active MTC devices requiring access in each random access slot. The
   correctness of the analytical model and the accuracy of the estimation
   algorithm are validated via simulations. Results show that both
   numerical and approximate solutions provide the same performance. Our
   proposed scheme can reduce nearly half of the random access slots
   required to serve all MTC devices compared to the existing schemes,
   which use timing advance information only, ACB only, or cooperative ACB.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses a joint downlink and uplink aware cell association
   problem in a multi-tier heterogeneous network in which base stations
   (BSs) have finite number of resource blocks (RBs) to distribute among
   the users. An optimization problem is defined to maximize the sum of
   weighted utility of long term data rate in downlink and uplink through
   cell association and RB distribution while maintaining quality of
   service (QoS). Separate outage requirements are considered as QoS
   constraints for downlink and uplink of a user. Using outage QoS
   constraints renders the problem suitable for fast fading environments.
   We propose a distributed scheme for the cell association problem. As
   users cannot measure the uplink attributes by listening to the reference
   signals of BSs, a limited amount of feedback is added to the reference
   signals of the BSs to inform the users of the uplink interference and
   make the distributed algorithm design possible. Moreover, by assigning
   different weights to the downlink and uplink data rates, the proposed
   scheme can be downlink oriented, uplink oriented, or both downlink and
   uplink aware. Comparing the proposed scheme with the downlink oriented
   maximum signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) scheme,
   significant uplink rate gains are observed in the simulations as well as
   for the downlink rates.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the robust design of the relay beamforming (rBF)
   and destination equalization (dEQ) filters for broadband multiuser
   multi-relay networks employing single-carrier frequency-division
   multiple access (SC-FDMA) and orthogonal frequency-division multiple
   access (OFDMA). Thereby, we consider the realistic case where only
   imperfect channel state information is available for rBF and dEQ filter
   optimization. Our goal is to maximize a lower bound for the weighted
   achievable bit rate (ABR) of the network, subject to either individual
   relay power constraints (Ind-PCs) or an aggregate relay power constraint
   (Agg-PC). We first derive the optimal dEQ filters and the phases of the
   optimal rBF filter coefficients, which are independent of the power
   constraints. For the Agg-PC, the amplitude optimization of the rBF
   filter coefficients is decomposed into two subproblems, which correspond
   to the optimization of the power allocation across the relays and the
   power allocation across the users and subcarriers, respectively. We
   obtain a closed-form structural solution for the first subproblem by
   fixing the powers across users and subcarriers, and the global optimal
   solution for the second subproblem. For the Ind-PCs, the corresponding
   optimization problem is formulated as a reverse-convex problem with
   convex constraints. Subsequently, the constrained convex concave
   procedure is applied to approximate the original non-convex problem with
   a sequence of convex problems, which can be efficiently solved using
   convex optimization techniques. Simulation results validate the
   excellent performance of the proposed robust rBF and dEQ filter designs
   and show their superiority compared to conventional non-robust and naive
   relaying schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc oxide (ZnO) is electrochemically grown using Zn(NO3)(2) with both
   platinum and zinc counter electrodes. The effect of the counter
   electrode at different potentials and varying durations on the quality
   of the resulting ZnO film is examined. Measurements included
   time-varying pH, surface morphology, deposition current, film thickness,
   and crystallinity. It was observed that films grown at high potentials
   or for long durations using an inert electrode caused a drop in solution
   pH due to zinc ion exhaustion in the growth medium. In the standard
   electrochemical reaction, zinc ions are consumed faster than nitrate
   ions, causing hydrogen ions resulting from the electrolysis of water at
   the counter electrode to persist in the growth solution. The resulting
   acidity when at a sufficiently low pH significantly inhibits further
   growth of ZnO and damages the existing film. The growth of high quality,
   thicker films using Zn(NO3)(2) therefor requires mitigative measures
   such as using a zinc counter electrode, replacing lost zinc, or by
   diluting the acid in the growth solution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Fluidization of biomass particles in the absence of inert bed materials
   has been tested in a pulsed fluidized bed with vibration, with the
   pulsation frequency ranging from 033 to 6.67 Hz. Intermittent
   fluidization at 033 Hz and apparently `normal' fluidization at 6.67 Hz
   with regular bubble patterns were observed. Pulsation has proven to be
   effective in overcoming the bridging of irregular biomass particles
   induced by strong inter-particle forces. The vibration is only effective
   when the pulsation is inadequate, either at too low a frequency or too
   low in amplitude. Drying of biomass has been carried out to quantify the
   effectiveness of gas pulsation for fluidized bed dryers and torrefiers
   in terms of gas-solid contact efficiency and heat and mass transfer
   rates. The effects of gas flow rate, bed temperature, pulsation
   frequency and vibration intensity on drying performance have been
   systematically investigated. While higher temperature and gas flow rate
   are favored in drying, there exists an optimal range of pulsation
   frequency between 0.75 Hz and 1.5 Hz where gas-solid contact is enhanced
   in both the constant rate drying and falling rate drying periods. (C)

Abstract = {{While we believe that pre-eclampsia matters because it remains a leading
   cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide we are
   convinced that the time has come to look beyond single clinical entities
   (e.g. pre-eclampsia, postpartum hemorrhage, obstetric sepsis) and to
   look for an integrated approach that will provide evidence-based
   personalized care to women wherever they encounter the health system.
   Accurate outcome prediction models are a powerful way to identify
   individuals at incrementally increased (and decreased) risks associated
   with a given condition. Integrating models with decision algorithms into
   mobile health (mHealth) applications could support community and first
   level facility healthcare providers to identify those women, fetuses,
   and newborns most at need of facility-based care, and to initiate
   lifesaving interventions in their communities prior to transportation.
   In our opinion, this offers the greatest opportunity to provide
   distributed individualized care at scale, and soon. (C) 2015 Published

Abstract = {{Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is an excellent computational tool to
   assess the hemodynamics and detailed blood-flow structure for
   cardiovascular applications. Modeling turbulence for cardiovascular
   applications can be achieved (to some extent) using available numerical
   models such as Reynolds average Navier-Stokes (RANS), the large eddy
   simulation (LES) and the direct numerical solution (DNS). In order to
   develop an efficient model which is as accurate as DNS and as quick as
   RANS, our laboratory's focus is on LES. In this study, we develop an
   efficient numerical model which is based on LES and structured but
   non-orthogonal finite volumes. Using the proposed model, the detailed
   flow structure and turbulent features of the blood stream in a
   complicated geometry is captured. The aim of this study is to model
   blood-flow through an eccentric stenosis accurately and quickly. The
   results are similar to those obtained using DNS but in a fraction of the
   CPU time. The computational tools implemented in this study are based on
   a FORTRAN based in-house code coupled with parallel computing using
   SHARCNET. The developed model is a significant computational tool which
   can be used to assess the hemodynamic properties for cardiovascular
   applications, e.g., prosthetic heart valves and atherosclerosis.}},

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a scalable one-pot template-free synthesis strategy was
   employed to fabricate CuO-incorporated TiO2 hollow microspheres in large
   scale. The as-prepared hollow spherical TiO2 nanoparticles possess
   unique structural characteristics, namely, large surface area and a
   hierarchical nanoarchitecture composed of a hollow macroporous core
   connected with large mesopores in the shell. The large surface area
   provides a great number of surface active sites for the reactant
   adsorption and reaction whereas the hierarchical nanoarchitecture
   enables fast mass transport of reactant and product molecules within the
   porous framework. In addition, the hollow macroporous core-mesoporous
   shell nanostructure favors multilight scattering/reflection, resulting
   in enhanced harvesting of exciting light. Furthermore, the incorporated
   CuO clusters work efficiently as a cocatalyst to improve the
   photocatalytic activity. As a result, the CuO-incorporated TiO2 hollow
   microsphere catalyst demonstrates much higher photocatalytic activity
   toward photodriven reduction of CO2 with H2O into CH4 compared with the
   state-of-the-art photocatalyst, commercial Degussa P25 TiO2. Also, the
   simple synthesis strategy would enable large-scale industrial production
   of CuO-TiO2 hollow microspheres.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneity in the clonal outputs of individual human embryonic stem
   cells (hESCs) confounds analysis of their properties in studies of bulk
   populations and how to manipulate them for clinical applications. To
   circumvent this problem we developed a microfluidic device that supports
   the robust generation of colonies derived from single ESCs. This
   microfluidic system contains 160 individually addressable chambers
   equipped for perfusion culture of individual hESCs that could be shown
   to match the growth rates, marker expression and colony morphologies
   obtained in conventional cultures. Use of this microfluidic device to
   analyze the clonal growth kinetics of multiple individual hESCs induced
   to differentiation revealed variable shifts in the growth rate, area per
   cell and expression of OCT4 in the progeny of individual hESCs.
   Interestingly, low OCT4 expression, a slower growth rate and low nuclear
   to cytoplasmic ratios were found to be correlated responses. This study
   demonstrates how microfluidic systems can be used to enable large scale
   live-cell imaging of isolated hESCs exposed to changing culture
   conditions, to examine how different aspects of their variable responses
   are correlated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the degree of similarity between fluidized beds
   and bubble columns based on Eulerian-Eulerian two-dimensional
   simulations of an air-water bubble column and an air-FCC fluidized bed.
   Predictions for both systems are compared with available hydrodynamic
   experimental data, i.e. bed expansion, local axial velocity, local gas
   hold-up, and wall pressure fluctuations at different heights and for
   different gas velocities. Dynamic characteristics of the simulated
   pressure fluctuations are compared with measured fluctuations. The local
   gas holdup in the bubble column and bubble volume fraction in the
   fluidized bed are qualitatively analogous and, to a lesser degree,
   quantitatively similar. It is also demonstrated that the liquid and
   solid velocities are distributed in similar manners. The mean bubble
   diameters in the bubble column and fluidized bed are more similar at low
   gas velocities than at higher gas velocities. Frequency spectra of the
   fluidized bed and bubble column reveal differences and similarities
   related to the liquid and solid properties. The outcome of this work can
   be used to improve procedures for hydrodynamic characterization of both
   systems for scale-up purposes based on hydrodynamic similarities and
   differences.}},

   network enables the implementation of very wide band nested coaxial

Abstract = {{This paper presents a resonance-based wireless power transfer system
   using a single layer of inductor coil windings, in a pancake
   configuration, in order to obtain a compact system for implantable
   electronic applications. We theoretically analyzed the system and
   characterized it by measuring its inductance, self-resonant frequency,
   and quality factor Q. In our resonance-based wireless power transfer
   prototype, we proposed a 3-coil system, using two 15-mm radius
   implantable coils, with a resonance frequency of 6.76MHz. This system
   can effectively transfer power for a distance of up to 50mm. Moreover,
   our proposed 3-coil system can achieve a high Q-factor and has a
   comparable power transfer efficiency (PTE) to previously reported works
   about 3-coil and 4-coil systems. The experimental PTE can achieve 82.4\%
   at a separation distance of 20mm and more than 10\% PTE at a distance of

Abstract = {{This paper presents a wireless, electrothermally active stent with an
   integrated temperature limiter toward the application to
   endohyperthermia treatment of restenosis, a major post-stenting
   complication. A stent-based resonant circuit serves as a frequency
   selective wireless heater controlled using a tuned radio-frequency (RF)
   electromagnetic field radiated externally, applying local thermal stress
   to the stented site to suppress in-stent restenosis. A biocompatible 1.5
   x 2 x 0.6-mm(3) chip of micro circuit breaker with an embedded capacitor
   is developed and integrated with the stent to establish the resonant
   circuitry with a series-connected micro breaker. A micromachined
   shape-memory-alloy cantilever serves as a thermoresponsive switch in the
   chip that opens/closes the circuit depending on the stent temperature,
   automatically preventing the stent from overheating in a fully passive
   manner. Wireless heating tests of the prototypes deployed into
   artificial artery using commercial balloon catheters demonstrate the
   designed function of the circuit breaker, regulating the stent
   temperature within 50 degrees C-66 degrees C when excited in air at an
   output RF power of 320 mW, which heats the device to 78 degrees C
   without the breaker. Their performance in physiological saline is also
   tested and discussed in detail. The experimental results validate the
   device concept and approach toward enabling reliable and safeguarded
   hyperthermia treatment through wireless stents. {[}2015-0007]}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we show that the droplet morphology varies significantly
   during the transport process in digital microfluidic (DMF) systems
   depending on the gap height between the top and bottom plates. The
   experimental results elucidate the effect of changing the gap height on
   the initiation and progression of droplet motion. For example, extreme
   necking is observed during transport from one electrode to another at
   low gap heights. In essence, this necking is unlike the previously
   reported necking occurring during the splitting process over three
   electrodes. Pronounced elongation of droplets at certain stages during
   the droplet motion was examined. The effect of changing the gap height
   on the droplet velocity profile is illustrated. We found that prolonged
   actuation time is needed to transport the droplet successfully at low
   gap heights. This paper entails detailed experimental and numerical
   characterization of droplet morphology to insinuate useful design and
   prototyping tips for enhanced DMF devices. Such deformation, elongation,
   and necking corroborate that the existing analytical models may be
   inadequate for certain gap heights as they typically assume a circular
   shape for the droplet during motion.}},

Abstract = {{A new type of carbon nanotube, based on the graphenylene motif, is
   investigated using density functional and tight-binding methods.
   Analogous to conventional graphene-based nanotubes, a two-dimensional
   graphenylene sheet can be ``rolled{''} into a seamless cylinder in
   armchair, zigzag, or chiral orientations. The resulting nanotube can be
   described using the familiar (n,m) nomenclature and possesses 4-, 6-,
   and 12-membered rings, with three distinct bond lengths, indicating a
   nonuniform distribution of the electron density. The dodecagonal rings
   form pores, 3.3 angstrom in diameter in graphenylene, which become
   saddle-shaped paraboloids in smaller-diameter nanotubes. Density
   functional theory predicts zigzag nanotubes to be small-band gap
   semiconductors, with a generally decreasing band gap as the diameter
   increases. Interestingly, the calculations predict metallic
   characteristics for armchair nanotubes with small diameters (<2 nm), and
   small-band gap semiconducting characteristics for larger-diameter ones.
   Graphenylene nanotubes with indices mod(n-m,3) = 0 exhibit a band gap
   approximately equal to that of armchair graphenylene nanotubes with
   comparable diameter.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Si-Ge interdiffusion with different P doping configurations was
   investigated. Significant interdiffusion happened when the Ge layers
   were doped with P in high 10(18) cm(-3) range, which resulted in a SiGe
   alloy region thicker than 150 nm after defect annealing cycles. With
   high P doped Ge, Si-Ge interdiffusivity is enhanced by 10-20 times in
   the x(Ge) >0.7 region compared with the control sample without P doping.
   We attribute this phenomenon to the much faster P transport towards the
   Ge seeding layers from the Ge side during the Ge layer growth, which
   increases the negatively charged vacancy concentrations and thus the
   interdiffusivity due to the Fermi effect in Si-Ge interdiffusion. This

Title = {{Developing crash modification functions for pedestrian signal
   improvement}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{47-56}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Pedestrian signals are viable traffic control devices that help
   pedestrians to cross safely at intersections. Although the literature is
   extensive when dealing with pedestrian signals design and operations,
   few studies have focused on the potential safety benefits of installing
   pedestrian signals at intersections. Most of these studies employed
   simple before-after (BA) safety evaluation techniques which suffer from
   methodological and statistical issues.
   Recent advances in safety evaluation research advocate the use of crash
   modification functions (CMFunctions) to represent the safety
   effectiveness of treatments. Unlike crash modification factors (CMFs)
   that are represented as single values, CMFunctions account for variable
   treatment location characteristics (heterogeneity). Therefore, the main
   objective of this study was to quantify the safety impact of installing
   pedestrian signals at signalized intersections by developing CMFunctions
   within an observational BA study. The use of observational BA framework
   to develop the CMFunctions avoids the cross-sectional approach where the
   functions are derived based on a single time period and no actual
   treatment intervention.
   Treatment sites heterogeneity was incorporated into CMFunctions using
   fixed-effects and random-effects regression models. In addition to
   heterogeneity, the paper also advocates the use of CMFunctions with a
   time variable to acknowledge that the safety treatment (intervention)
   effects do not occur instantaneously but are spread over future time.
   This is achieved using non-linear intervention (Koyck) models, developed
   within a hierarchical full Bayes context. The results demonstrated the
   importance of considering treatment sites heterogeneity (i.e., different
   circulating volumes and area type among treated locations) and time
   trends when developing CMFunctions for pedestrian signal improvement.

Abstract = {{There remains significant potential for improvement in oxygen transfer
   efficiency, which can account for 60\% of water and wastewater treatment
   energy requirements. This research examined superoxygenation, or
   aerating water under pressure with high-purity oxygen gas. Examined were
   the effects superoxygenation has on five key aeration design parameters:
   the mass transfer coefficient (K(L)a), saturation concentration
   (C-sat{*}), standard oxygen transfer rate (SOTR), standard aeration
   efficiency (SAE), and standard oxygen transfer efficiency (SOTE). This
   research compared values under pressures of 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kPa
   using air and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) generated oxygen. It was
   found that with increasing pressure for both air and PSA oxygen: K(L)a
   decreased, C-sat{*} increased, SOTR and SAE remained constant, and SOTE
   increased. While comparing air and PSA oxygen, oxygen was found to have
   a similar K(L)a, larger C-sat{*}, SOTR, and SOTE, and a lower SAE. It
   was concluded that superoxygenation is a viable method for increasing
   oxygen transfer and could potentially reduce oxygenation costs in water
   treatment processes.}},

Title = {{Assessing the performance of the building information modeling (BIM)

Abstract = {{The current shift to building information modeling (BIM) enabled project
   delivery in the construction industry is promising important benefits.
   For small and micro businesses, which represent 99.0\% of the employers
   in the Canadian construction industry, adopting these trends could
   significantly impact their bottom line. However, this often represents
   considerable cost and risk. Assessing the performance of BIM
   implementation therefore becomes an important part of the process,
   namely in ensuring that it is on track and progressing as required. This
   article presents the findings from a case study research project
   conducted over a 2 year period within a small mechanical contracting
   firm. The objective of this research project was to develop an
   evolutionary approach, supported by specific measures, to assess the
   performance of the BIM implementation process within a specialty
   contracting small enterprise. The findings suggest that BIM has had a
   positive impact over time on predictability for indicators such as total
   project cost and labor cost. On the other hand, project scope and
   quality were not shown to be influenced by BIM in the projects studied.
   The variability uncovered in the findings reinforces the central tenant
   of BIM as an enabler for collaboration. Indeed, most of the projects
   studied were performed in a lonely manner and thus the measured impact
   of BIM on project delivery was limited, even if it was perceived as very
   beneficial. Lastly, the article highlights the need for a parallel
   reconfiguration of practice: performance assessment and BIM
   implementation need to be developed conjointly to serve one another.}},

Abstract = {{CO2 sequestration by mineral carbonation can permanently store CO2 and
   mitigate climate change. However, the cost and reaction rate of mineral
   carbonation must be balanced to be viable for industrial applications.
   In this study, it was attempted to reduce the carbonation costs by using
   mine waste rock as a feed stock and to enhance the reaction rate using
   wet mechanical activation as a pre-treatment method. Slurry rheological
   properties, particle size distribution, specific surface area,
   crystallinity, and CO2 sequestration reaction efficiency of the initial
   and mechanically activated mine waste rock and olivine were
   characterized. The results show that serpentine acts as a catalyst,
   increasing the slurry yield stress, assisting new surface formation, and
   hindering the size reduction and structure amorphization. Mechanically
   activated mine waste rock exhibits a higher carbonation conversion than
   olivine with equal specific milling energy input. The use of a
   high-speed stirred mill may render the mineral carbonation suitable for
   mining industrial practice.}},

   Drosophila germband extension}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Germband extension during Drosophila development features the merging of
   cells along the dorsal-ventral (DV) axis and their separation along the
   anterior-posterior (AP) axis. This intercalation process involves planar
   cell polarity, anisotropic contractile forces along cell edges, and
   concerted cell deformation and movement. Although prior experiments have
   probed each of these factors separately, the connection among them
   remains unclear. This paper presents a chemo-mechanical model that
   integrates the three factors into a coherent framework. The model
   predicts the polarization of Rho-kinase, myosin and Bazooka downstream
   of an anisotropic Shroom distribution. In particular, myosin accumulates
   on cell edges along the DV axis, causing them to contract into a vertex.
   Subsequently, medial myosin in the cells anterior and posterior to the
   vertex helps to elongate it into a new edge parallel to the body axis.
   Thus, the tissue extends along the AP axis and narrows in the transverse
   direction through neighbor exchange. Model predictions of the polarity
   of the proteins and cell and tissue deformation are in good agreement
   with experimental observations.}},

Abstract = {{Productivity in the construction industry is a well-documented and
   expansive field of research. It benefits from over four decades of
   research that have developed models and methods for evaluation and
   identified multiple factors that influence it. In parallel, building
   information modeling (BIM) has emerged as a disruptive innovation,
   showing great potential to mitigate many of the factors negatively
   affecting construction productivity. Indeed, studies are increasingly
   looking into the impact of BIM on project performance. Improving
   construction productivity, labor productivity in particular, is one of
   the widely reported benefits. For organizations looking to transition to
   BIM, being able to grasp these benefits and quantify their impact is
   extremely important to ensure the viability of the BIM implementation
   process. This article presents the findings of an action-research
   project undertaken with a small mechanical contractor which investigates
   the impact of BIM on labor productivity on a large commercial project.
   The objective of the action-research was to assist the organization in
   reconfiguring its performance measurement practices in light of the
   transition to BIM and prefabrication. The article discusses the
   challenges of this reconfiguration and presents the findings from the
   performance measurement process which was put in place. The findings
   suggest a clear positive impact of BIM on labor productivity on the
   project studied: the areas that were modeled and prefabricated showed an
   increase in productivity ranging from 75\% to 240\% over the areas that
   were not modeled. More importantly, however, the article operationalizes
   a strategy allowing organizations to consistently assess their
   performance relating to labor productivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators are widely used in many
   applications. Determining the OWA operator weights is still an open
   issue. In this paper, an ordered visibility graph weighted averaging
   (OVGWA) aggregation operator is proposed based on complex network
   methodology. After the argument values are ordered in descending order,
   a network is constructed using ordered visible graph (OVG) method. The
   arriving probabilities of random walker in the network are utilized as
   the weights of the corresponding data. Compared with the classical OWA,
   the proposed OVGWA not only takes the information of orders but also the
   argument values themselves into consideration to determine the weights.
   An application of produced water management is used to illustrate the
   application of the proposed OVGWA aggregation operator. In addition, the
   aggregated results are compared with those obtained by maximal entropy
   method. The results show that the proposed method is effective. To study
   the impacts of the influencing factors, a sensitivity analysis has been
   carried out. It is utility to understand the role of different
   indicators on aggregated value. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{705-716}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Outlier removal is a fundamental and critical data processing task so as
   to ensure quality of scanned point clouds and their applications. Point
   clouds collected from reflective surfaces are often contaminated by
   extensive outliers. Existing outlier removal methods usually rely on
   analyzing the point cloud data only without the knowledge of outlier
   formation and the information of the scanning operation. They generally
   show limited effectiveness in detecting the extensive outliers. This
   paper aims to utilize the outlier formation characteristics in relation
   to scanning orientations in order to develop an effective outlier
   removal approach. It is observed that the regions where outliers occur
   are generally dependent on the scanning orientation whereas ordinary
   scanned surface points are almost invariant regardless of the scanning
   orientation. An outlier removal method based on a rotating scan scheme
   is proposed to detect such view-dependent outliers. The key feature of
   the rotating scan scheme is to utilize the scanning orientation
   information together with the raw scanned point clouds to reliably
   detect outliers. Numerous case studies have been conducted to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed rotating scan scheme in
   comparison with various existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of recycled coarse aggregates (RCAs) on the fresh,

   Four different mixes were considered with natural aggregate and three
   different replacement levels of RCA {[}i.e., (1) 30\%, (2) 40\%, and (3)
   50\%]. The fresh and hardened properties of RAC were investigated
   according to national standards where the target strength was 35 MPa in
   56 days. The compressive strengths of different concrete mixes were
   determined after 3, 7, 28, 56, and 120 days of moist curing. The results
   are also presented in terms of stress-strain curves, modulus of
   elasticity, and Poisson's ratio. Freeze-thaw durability performance of
   RAC was studied in accordance with a national standard. This paper shows
   that the performance of RAC slightly decreases with increasing RCA
   replacement levels; however, their overall performance is comparable to
   natural aggregate concrete (NAC). This paper indicates that the use of
   RCA in new concrete production can lead to a greener environment and

Pages = {{72-85}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Spinning of sheet metals into cylindrical cups is an important sheet
   metal forming process for its advantages of flexible tooling and very
   small forming loads. The most challenging aspect in this process is its
   low formability due to wrinkling formation in the free flange. In this
   work, a new deep spinning process with roller set aided with
   blank-holder of constant clearance is proposed aiming to suppress the
   wrinkling formation in the deformation zone. Experimental work on
   annealed and hard aluminum sheet metals is carried out to assess the new
   process. The proposed spinning process has shown rapid increase in the
   formability of the sheet metals as the roller feed increases. On the
   other hand, significant increase in the roller feed worsens the
   formability of sheet metals in conventional spinning. The Limiting
   Spinning Ratios, LSRs; or the blank to mandrel diameters ratios, have
   increased from 1.75 using the conventional spinning to 2.40 using the
   deep spinning with annealed aluminum sheets in one pass. Also, the LSRs
   have increased from 1.67 using the conventional spinning to 2.24 using
   the deep spinning with hard aluminum sheets in one pass. New failure
   modes of flange jamming and wall fracture have been presented and
   discussed. In addition, the formability limitations, thickness strains,
   and spun cup form features at different process parameters are
   experimentally investigated and discussed. Further, a finite element
   model for the new process is presented and verified showing the
   limitation of the available shell elements offered by ANSYS Mechanical
   APDL in modeling the new process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Effect of frothers and dodecylamine on bubble size and gas holdup in a

Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{109-115}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Bubble size and gas holdup were characterized in a two phase gas-water
   system in a laboratory downflow column. The effect of the cationic
   surfactant dodecyl amine (MW 185, HLB 10.7) and the frothers MIBC (MW
   102, HLB 6.05) and polyglycol F507 (MW 425, HLB 8.63) on the bubble size
   and gas holdup were investigated. In addition, the effect of blends of
   MIBC-dodecyl amine (DDA) and F507-DDA on these parameters was assessed.
   The bubble Critical Coalescence Concentration (CCC) followed the order
   MIBC > DDA > F507. When blending the frothers with DDA at a
   concentration below its CCC, the frother CCC decreased and bubbles of
   finer size were obtained below and above the frother CCC. Static surface
   tension measurements of aqueous solutions with frothers and DDA as well
   as with frothers-DDA blends show coadsorption of DDA at the air/aqueous
   solution interface. The surface tension of aqueous solutions prepared
   with the blends decreased with the addition of DDA and varied linearly
   with the frother concentration within the concentration range studied.
   The gas holdup in the downflow column was determined by the bubble size
   and decreased with the bubble size. It is shown that frother-DDA blends
   gave the lowest gas holdup in the downflow column. This work is relevant
   for the reverse flotation of quartz from iron ores using amine
   collectors in cells with downflow systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{zSelf-propelled particles that transport cargo through flowing blood and

Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Delivering therapeutics deep into damaged tissue during bleeding is
   challenging because of the outward flow of blood. When coagulants cannot
   reach and clot blood at its source, uncontrolled bleeding can occur and
   increase surgical complications and fatalities. Self-propelling
   particles have been proposed as a strategy for transporting agents
   upstream through blood. Many nanoparticle and microparticle systems
   exhibiting autonomous or collective movement have been developed, but
   propulsion has not been used successfully in blood or used in vivo to
   transport therapeutics. We show that simple gas-generating
   microparticles consisting of carbonate and tranexamic acid traveled
   through aqueous solutions at velocities of up to 1.5 cm/s and delivered
   therapeutics millimeters into the vasculature of wounds. The particles
   transported themselves through a combination of lateral propulsion,
   buoyant rise, and convection. When loadedwith active thrombin, these
   particles worked effectively as a hemostatic agent and halted severe
   hemorrhage inmultiple animalmodels of intraoperative and traumatic
   bleeding. Many medical applications have been suggested for
   self-propelling particles, and the findings of this study show that the
   active selffueled transport of particles can function in vivo to enhance
   drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Model-based controllers based on incorrect estimates of the true plant
   behaviour can be expected to perform poorly. This work studies the
   effect of model plant mismatch on the closed loop behaviour and system
   performance for a certain class of MIMO systems. Performance is measured
   using a minimum variance index and a closely related user-specified
   criterion. We study the effect of model plant mismatch on the output
   variance and performance indices. Under mild assumptions, the
   performance of each output in a MIMO system can be analysed
   independently. Moreover, we propose an approach to distinguish the
   effect of model-plant mismatch from the effect of changes in disturbance
   characteristics on closed-loop performance. We define a sensitivity
   measure that relates system performance to model-plant mismatch, and use
   it to explore this sensitivity for three realistic types of parametric
   modelling errors. Next, we suggest a quantitative method that compares a
   system's actual output to its desired response in a transient setting.
   The performance of the transient response is demonstrably more sensitive
   to the model-plant mismatch than the steady state performance. The
   results are illustrated on industrial paper machine data. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This study presents a compact high precision positioner which is
   designed specifically for vertical axis motion with centimeter range
   based on a piezoworm motor arranged in flexure frames. The piezoworm
   motor for providing motion in Z axis is developed in complementary clamp
   configuration, provided that no power is required to maintain a fixed
   vertical position, holding the payload against the force of gravity at
   any time to ensure the safe climbing. Two identical amplified
   piezoelectric actuators are used in parallel for the extender section to
   achieve longer and equal step motion in vertical direction. The design
   is extended to a prototype where the actuator is integrated into a stage
   body, maintaining a compact size. After assembly, buckling effect on the
   stationary clamp flexures is evident due to the applied compressive
   load. Hence the positioner is evaluated through several tests in open
   loop with the aid of counterweights, ranging from 2-3.3 kg. Experiments
   on the inertially counterbalanced stage show that it is capable of
   providing a speed of 5.4 mm/s, an output force of 8.8 N, a travel range
   of 20 mm, and a possible resolution of 120 nm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns energy harvesting from vehicle suspension systems.
   The generated power associated with bounce, pitch, and roll modes of
   vehicle dynamics is determined through analysis. The potential values of
   power generation from these three modes are calculated. Next,
   experiments are carried out using a vehicle with a four jack shaker rig
   to validate the analytical values of potential power harvest. For the
   considered vehicle, maximum theoretical power values of 1.1, 0.88, and
   0.97 kW are associated with the bounce, pitch, and roll modes,
   respectively, at 20 Hz excitation frequency and peak-to-peak
   displacement amplitude of 5 mm at each wheel, as applied by the shaker.
   The corresponding experimental power values are 0.98, 0.74, and 0.78 kW.
   An experimental rig is also developed to study the behavior of
   regenerative actuators in generating electrical power from kinetic
   energy. This rig represents a quarter-vehicle suspension model where the
   viscous damper in the shock absorber system is replaced by a
   regenerative system. The rig is able to demonstrate the actual
   electrical power that can be harvested using a regenerative system. The
   concept of self-powered actuation using the harvested energy from
   suspension is discussed with regard to applications of self-powered
   vibration control. The effect of suspension energy regeneration on ride
   comfort and road handling is presented in conjunction with energy
   harvesting associated with random road excitations.}},

Abstract = {{Friction control at the wheel-rail interface, using on-board solid stick
   friction modifier systems can lead to enhanced track life, reduced wear,
   and increased fuel economy in railroads. Frictional contact between the
   solid stick and the railway wheel itself can potentially cause
   vibrations within the modifier systems, influencing their stability and
   performance. A frequency domain linearized stability analysis of the
   state of steady sliding at the frictional contact between the solid
   stick and the wheel is performed. The proposed approach relies on
   individual frequency response functions (FRFs) of the wheel and the
   applicator-bracket subsystems of the on-board friction modifier.
   Stability characteristics of three representative bracket designs are
   qualitatively compared, using the FRFs generated by their respective
   finite element (FE) models. The FE models are validated by comparing the
   predicted natural frequencies with corresponding experimentally measured
   values on a full wheel test rig (FWTR) facility. The validated FE models
   are then used to compute stability maps which delineate stable and
   unstable regions of operation in the design parameter space, defined by
   train speed, angle of applicator, friction coefficient, and bracket
   design. Strong dependence of stability upon the bracket designs is
   observed. The methodology developed here can be used by design engineers
   to assess the effectiveness of design changes on the stability of the
   applicator-bracket assembly in a virtual environment-thus avoiding
   costly retrofitting and prototyping. Directions for further model
   refinement and testing are provided.}},

Abstract = {{The Pico Lantern is a miniature projector developed for structured light
   surface reconstruction, augmented reality and guidance in laparoscopic
   surgery. During surgery it will be dropped into the patient and picked
   up by a laparoscopic tool. While inside the patient it projects a known
   coded pattern and images onto the surface of the tissue. The Pico
   Lantern is visually tracked in the laparoscope's field of view for the
   purpose of stereo triangulation between it and the laparoscope. In this
   paper, the first application is surface reconstruction. Using a stereo
   laparoscope and an untracked Pico Lantern, the absolute error for
   surface reconstruction for a plane, cylinder and ex vivo kidney, is 2.0
   mm, 3.0 mm and 5.6 mm, respectively. Using a mono laparoscope and a
   tracked Pico Lantern for the same plane, cylinder and kidney the
   absolute error is 1.4 mm, 1.5 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively. These results
   confirm the benefit of the wider baseline produced by tracking the Pico
   Lantern. Virtual viewpoint images are generated from the kidney surface
   data and an in vivo proof-of-concept porcine trial is reported. Surface
   reconstruction of the neck of a volunteer shows that the pulsatile
   motion of the tissue overlying a major blood vessel can be detected and
   displayed in vivo. Future work will integrate the Pico Lantern into
   standard and robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper provides a comprehensive overview of developments and recent
   trends in H-2 separation technology that uses dense proton-electron
   conducting ceramic materials and their associated membranes. Various
   proton-electron conducting materials and their associated membranes are
   summarized and classified into several important categories, such as
   Ni-composite proton-conducting materials, as well as tungstate-based,
   BaPrO3-based, LaGaO3-based, and niobate/tantalite composite metal
   oxide-based ceramic materials/membranes. Various membrane designs,
   including asymmetric ceramic membranes (supported and self-supported)
   and surface-modified membranes, are also reviewed. Several important
   properties of ceramic materials and membranes, such as proton and
   electron conductivity and performance (i.e., H-2 transport flux and
   lifetime stability), are also discussed. To highlight the technical
   progress in this area, all possible ceramic materials and associated
   membranes are summarized, along with their properties and performance,
   to help readers quickly locate the information they are looking for.
   Based on this review, several challenges hindering the maturation of
   this technology are analyzed in depth, and possible research directions
   for overcoming these challenges are suggested. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{67-68}},
Pages = {{1-12}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method to generate efficient ball-end milling
   tool paths for three-axis sculptured surface machining, The fundamental
   principle of the presented method is to generate the tool paths
   according to a preferred feed direction (PFD) field derived from the
   surface to be machined. The PFD at any point on the surface is the feed
   direction that maximizes the machining strip width. Theoretically, tool
   paths that always follow the direction of maximum machining strip width
   at every cutter contact point on the surface would result in shorter
   overall tool path length. Unfortunately, overlaps of adjacent machining
   strips commonly exist for tool paths that follow the preferred
   directions exactly. Such redundant machining can be reduced by
   iso-scallop tool paths. Nonetheless, iso-scallop tool paths do not in
   general follow the preferred feed directions. To improve machining
   efficiency via generating short overall tool path length, the presented
   method analyzes the PFD field of the surface and segments the surface
   into distinct regions by identifying the degenerate points and forming
   their separatrices. The resulting segmented regions are characterized by
   similar PFD's and iso-scallop tool paths are then generated for each
   region to mitigate redundant machining. The developed method has been
   validated with numerous case studies. The results have shown that the
   generated tool paths consistently have shorter overall length than those
   generated by the existing methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Taguchi design of experiments is a much known statistical method for
   cost/time reduction during experimental investigation and quality
   engineering of complex systems and processes. In the present article,
   efficiency, accuracy, strengths and limitations of this method in
   predicting and discretely optimizing impact response of FRP composites
   have been studied through a case study on polypropylene/E-glass
   laminates with unidirectional, plain, and twill weave architectures. In
   parallel, drop weight impact tests, X-ray micro-tomography, and pre- and
   post-impact four-point flexural testing are employed for two purposes:
   (a) gaining further knowledge on induced impact damage mechanisms, and
   (b) further assessment and verification of the Taguchi results. In spite
   of the fact that impact events of the FRP laminates are highly nonlinear
   and accompany high level of uncertainty, it was found that this design
   of experiments method is capable of predicting and maximizing the
   absorbed impact energy with a reduced number of runs and reasonable
   error. Finally, by correlating macro-level predictions to micro-level
   damage observations via X-ray tomography, the underlying assumptions of
   the method were further scrutinized, and in particular it was found that
   the plies interaction effect is not a limiting factor in predicting the
   total absorbed energy of the laminates. Overall, the experimental
   time/cost saving in the performed impact optimization case study was
   over 50\% using the Taguchi L9 orthogonal array. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Predicting water main failures using Bayesian model averaging and
   survival modelling approach}},

Abstract = {{To develop an effective preventive or proactive repair and replacement
   action plan, water utilities often rely on water main failure prediction
   models. However, in predicting the failure of water mains, uncertainty
   is inherent regardless of the quality and quantity of data used in the
   model. To improve the understanding of water main failure, a Bayesian
   framework is developed for predicting the failure of water mains
   considering uncertainties. In this study, Bayesian model averaging
   method (BMA) is presented to identify the influential pipe-dependent and
   time-dependent covariates considering model uncertainties whereas
   Bayesian Weibull Proportional Hazard Model (BWPHM) is applied to develop
   the survival curves and to predict the failure rates of water mains. To
   accredit the proposed framework, it is implemented to predict the
   failure of cast iron (Cl) and ductile iron (DI) pipes of the water
   distribution network of the City of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Results
   indicate that the predicted 95\% uncertainty bounds of the proposed
   BWPHMs capture effectively the observed breaks for both Cl and DI water
   mains. Moreover, the performance of the proposed BWPHMs are better
   compare to the Cox-Proportional Hazard Model (Cox-PHM) for considering
   Weibull distribution for the baseline hazard function and model
   uncertainties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Poor crumb rubber-cement matrix interface contributes to the reduction
   in mechanical strength observed in cement composites containing recycled
   scrap tires as fine aggregate. In this paper, the efficacy of a
   two-stage approach of using limestone powder (LP) pre-coated crumb
   rubber and silica fume (SF) to enhance the performance of rubberized
   cement mortar was investigated. LP pre-coated crumb rubber at 0\%, 5\%,
   10\% and 15\% volume substitution of fine aggregate,. and SF at 10\%
   volume cement replacement were used. Mortar compressive strength,
   flexural strength, abrasion resistance, cement paste-crumb rubber
   interface and sorptivity were evaluated. As-received crumb rubber
   generally reduces the mechanical strength of mortar. However, in
   comparison to the reference mixture, comparable compressive strength and
   higher flexural strength were obtained in mixtures containing SF and up
   to 10\% LP pre-coated crumb rubber. Optical micrographs showed that
   enhanced crumb rubber-cement paste interface and matrix densification
   are the main reasons for the strength enhancement. Moreover, the
   addition of crumb rubber to mixtures reduced the sorptivity of
   rubberized mortar. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Even without hardener, epoxy resin is able to harden in the presence of
   hydroxyl ions produced during cement hydration process. In this study
   commercially available Bisphenol A-type epoxy resin without hardener was
   used as a polymeric admixture to prepare epoxy-modified mortars, whose
   properties and chemical composition were then investigated. The mortars
   were prepared with a mass ratio of 1:3 (cement:fine aggregate),
   water-to-cement ratio (WIG) of 0.48, and epoxy content of 5\%, 10\%,
   15\% and 20\% of cement. The specimens were subjected to dry and wet-dry
   curing. Workability, setting time, compressive strength, flexural
   strength, and tensile splitting strength tests were conducted. A Fourier
   transformation infrared spectroscopy test was also administered to
   determine the molecular composition and structure of mortars. Results
   showed an inverse relationship between workability and setting time of
   mortars versus epoxy content. The compressive, flexural, and tensile
   splitting strengths of epoxy-modified mortars were noted to be the
   highest for mortars containing 10\% epoxy in wet-dry curing. A
   significant improvement in strength development of mortars without
   hardener had been achieved through dry curing due to gradual hardening
   of epoxy resin with hydrated cement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A comparative study has been carried out to determine the ability of
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational particle fluid
   dynamics (CPFD) codes to predict the hydrodynamics of FCC particles in a
   bubbling fluidized bed. Simulations were conducted in both 2-dimensional
   (2-D) and 3-dimensional (3-D) CFD configuration and in a 3-D CPFD model.
   The new structure based force-balance (FB) model of Ahmadi Motlagh et
   al. (2014. Chem. Eng. Sci. 120, 22-36.) was incorporated in CFD to
   simulate the behavior of FCC in the bubbling fluidization regime. This
   model modifies the conventional drag correlation by considering the
   effect of interparticle forces on the formation of agglomerates inside
   the bed, updating the drag calculations by replacing the particle
   diameter in the Wen and Yu correlation by an agglomerate diameter. The
   effects of superficial gas velocity, particle diameter,
   particle-particle restitution coefficient and specularity coefficient on
   voidage are examined. The sensitivity of different gas-solid drag
   closures in CFD are tested and compared. Experimental time-average axial
   and radial voidage profiles were simulated with varying degrees of
   agreement with experimental data obtained using different advanced
   experimental techniques in the `Traveling fluidized bed{''} (Dubrawski
   et al., 2013. Powder Technol. 235, 203-220; Tebianian et al., 2014.

   Bed Technology, (Eds.), J. Li, X.J. Bao and W. Wang. Chemical Industry
   Press, Beijing 137-142.). Both the FB and CPFD models were successful in
   resolving key issues in 3-D, whereas 2-D models tended to seriously
   underpredict particle volume fraction, especially near the wall. (C)

Abstract = {{Indium and zinc complexes, {[}(NNOtBu)InCl](2)(mu-Cl)(mu-OTHMB) (2) and
   (NNiOtBu)Zn(CH2CH3) (3), were used to produce monodispersed three- and
   six-armed star-shaped PHBs using tris(hydroxymethypbenzene (THMB) and
   dip entaerythritol as the chain transfer agents. Reactions catalyzed by
   complex 2 were highly controlled, with THMB:catalyst ratios of up to
   590:1, resulting in star-shaped PHBs with predictable molecular weights
   (M-n = 1.25-219 kDa) and narrow dispersities (D = 1.02-1.08). The
   zinc-based catalyst, 3, was less controlled than the indium analogue but
   nevertheless generated moderately syndiotactic PHBs with maximum M-n
   values of similar to 100 kDa. Importantly, 3 allowed the formation of
   previously unknown 6-armed star PHBs, allowing us to compare the effects
   of the different PHB architectures on the rheological behavior of the
   materials. High molecular weight linear and star polymers were
   characterized using solution and melt viscoelastic studies. Zero-shear
   viscosity of linear PHBs exhibited a power law relationship with the
   span molecular weight; however, it scaled exponentially for star
   polymers with slightly higher values for the 6-armed star PHBs. This was
   attributed to the moderately syndiotactic microstructure of these
   polymers. The absence of a district arm retraction relaxation in the
   dynamic master curves, and overshoot in the transient viscosity for the
   6-armed star PHBs, are due to the lower entanglement density and
   slightly broader molecular weight distribution of these polymers.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that n-doped resistive heaters in silicon waveguides show
   photoconductive effects with high responsivities. These photoconductive
   heaters, integrated into microring resonator (MRR)-based filters, were
   used to automatically tune and stabilize the filter's resonance
   wavelength to the input laser's wavelength. This is achieved without
   requiring dedicated defect implantations, additional material
   depositions, dedicated photodetectors, or optical power tap-outs.
   Automatic wavelength stabilization of first-order MRR and second-order
   series-coupled MRR filters is experimentally demonstrated. Open eye
   diagrams were obtained for data transmission at 12.5 Gb/s while the
   temperature was varied by 5 degrees C at a rate of 0.28 degrees C/s. We
   theoretically show that series-coupled MRR-based filters of any order
   can be automatically tuned by using photoconductive heaters to monitor
   the light intensity in each MRR, and sequentially aligning the resonance
   of each MRR to the laser's wavelength. (C) 2015 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{We demonstrate spiral Bragg grating waveguides (BGWs) on the

   waveguides have lower propagation losses. Our spiral waveguides are
   space-efficient, requiring only areas of 131 x 131 mu m(2) to
   accommodate 4 mm long BGWs, and, thus, are less susceptible to
   fabrication nonuniformities. Due to the lengths and reduced
   susceptibility to fabrication non-uniformities, we were able to obtain
   narrow bandwidth, large extinction ratio (ER) devices, as narrow as 0.09
   nm and as large as 52 dB, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate a 4 mm
   long TM chirped spiral Bragg grating waveguide with a negative, average,

Abstract = {{In this letter, image receivers are characterized to address the
   challenges of indoor positioning with optical wireless location systems.
   Image receivers are studied according to their field-of-view (FOV)
   characteristics: 1) the first image receiver uses a wide-FOV (95
   degrees) microlens and 2) the second image receiver uses an
   ultrawide-FOV (130 degrees) microlens. An angle of arrival
   characterization of the image receiver is used to quantify azimuthal,
   phi, and polar, theta, angles of incident light from optical beacons. A
   dilution of position (DOP) characterization is used to quantify
   geometrical effects of the optical beacon distribution. It is found that
   the ultrawide-FOV microlens (with a mean positioning error of 1.5 cm)
   can better image widely separated optical beacons, and thus operate at a
   lower DOP, compared with the wide-FOV microlens (with a mean positioning
   error of 3.2 cm).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the results of analytical and experimental analyses for
   the flexural response of steel-fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) beams
   are presented. In the analytical part, to predict the flexural response
   of SFRC beams according to the strength of concrete and steel fiber
   content, a model for compression was adopted from a previous research
   and a trilinear tension-softening curve (TSC) was suggested based on
   inverse analysis. To obtain the TSC, a number of notched SFRC beams with
   two parameters such as (1) strength of concrete (normal- and
   high-strengths) and (2) steel fiber content (0.0\%, 0.5\%, 1.0\%, 2.0\%)
   were fabricated and tested in accordance with the Japan Concrete
   Institute (JCI) standard. The suggested models were verified through a
   comparison of the previous four-point flexural test results and the
   sectional analyses. For the experimental part, the compressive strength
   and elastic modulus showed negligible changes with the inclusion of
   steel fibers, while the strain capacity and post-peak behavior were
   improved by including steel fibers. The addition of more than V-f of
   1.0\% steel fibers resulted in the significant improvement of flexural
   strength, deflection capacity, and post-peak ductility, while the
   increase of compressive strength led to an increase in the flexural
   strength and a decrease in the post-peak ductility. Lastly, the fracture
   energy increased with the increase in the fiber content and the decrease
   in the strength. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics scheme
   is presented for simulation of rigid bodies moving through Newtonian
   fluids. The scheme relies on combined usage of the rigidity constraints
   and the viscous penalty method to simulate rigid body motion. Different
   viscosity ratios and interpolation schemes are tested by simulating a
   rigid disc descending in quiescent medium. A viscosity ratio of 100
   coupled with weighted harmonic averaging scheme has been found to
   provide satisfactory results. The performance of the resulting scheme is
   systematically tested for cases with linear motion, rotational motion
   and their combination. The test cases include sedimentation of a single
   and a pair of circular discs, sedimentation of an elliptic disc and
   migration and rotation of a circular disc in linear shear flow.
   Comparison with previous results at various Reynolds numbers indicates
   that the proposed method captures the motion of rigid bodies driven by
   flow or external body forces accurately. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The performance of non-line-of-sight ultraviolet (UV) scattering
   communication depends largely on atmospheric parameters. In this paper,
   we consider haze, fog, two common types of aerosols, and introduce the
   density and size of aerosols as variables to study the channel path loss
   for the UV scattering communications. We modify a Monte-Carlo based
   multiple-scattering model and provide fitting functions to replace the
   complex calculations of Mie theory, which can be used to obtain the
   atmospheric coefficients and phase functions for the aerosols.
   Simulation results reveal that, given fixed elevation angles, the
   channel path loss is related to both communication range, the aerosol
   density, and size of aerosols. For a short communication range, an
   increase of aerosol density can reduce the path loss, which improves the
   performance of UV scattering communication. However, when the
   communication range is extended, the path loss will fall first and then
   rise with density of aerosols. This phenomenon also occurs for an
   increase of fog drop size. The density or size of aerosols that has the
   lowest path loss is inversely proportional to the communication range.

Abstract = {{Over the past decades, technological advances and mining requirements
   have led to larger, more complex and more costly equipment. This trend
   in mining equipment has resulted in changing maintenance strategies from
   unplanned and scheduled maintenance to a condition-based maintenance
   (CBM) strategy. However, condition monitoring techniques used in CBM
   programmes are more than a maintenance management tool; they can provide
   the means to improve machine performance, production capacity and
   overall mine production. Vibration monitoring is usually the dominant
   technique of CBM programmes for critical machines such as electric rope
   shovels. It has been demonstrated that abnormal machine behaviour can be
   diagnosed using vibration monitoring techniques. However, this article
   aims to show the applicability of vibration monitoring of electric rope
   shovels for post-blast assessment rather than maintenance management. As
   a result, an electric rope shovel's vibrations experienced by its boom
   during different operating conditions are measured by a tri-axial
   accelerometer mounted inside an enclosure on the side of shovel's boom.
   The results show that the amount of apparent energy experienced by the
   tri-axial accelerometer can be used as an indirect measure of muck-pile
   digging conditions. Additionally, instantaneous and/or averaged
   vibration can be used as part of a system to monitor operator
   performance which potentially leads towards a machine with higher
   reliability, availability and maintainability and with higher
   productivity.}},

Pages = {{62-67}},
Month = {{SEP 2}},
Abstract = {{Nanofibers have gained increasing attention because of their potential
   for a wide range of applications. In order to fully exploit the
   potential of nanofibers, there is a need to understand the relationship
   between the mechanical properties, especially tensile properties, of an
   individual nanofiber and that of nanofiber assemblies. In this study, we
   examined the relationship between a single nanofiber and a nanofiber mat
   formed by randomly oriented nanofibers through geometric analysis. The
   analysis showed that the tensile strength of a randomly oriented
   nanofiber mat is a function of fiber packing density (porosity), test
   specimen dimension (width to length ratio), and the tensile strength of
   a single nanofiber. Similar relationship can also be derived for the
   elastic modulus of individual nanofibers and that of the nanofiber mats.
   Parametric study was carried out using this fabric geometry model and
   the applicability of the model was evaluated using published
   experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE AND PHYSICAL FITNESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{969-977}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Aim. Posture and plantar pressure distribution can influence several
   factors, including both foot type and heritability. Therefore, the
   purpose was to assess the influence of foot type and heritability and
   their effects on foot characteristics. Static and dynamic balance and
   plantar pressure distribution was assessed, and the participants were
   pairs of female twins.
   Methods. Sixteen monozygotic and fourteen dizygotic pairs with no
   history of injuries were included in this causal-comparative study,
   divided into three foot types by navicular drop test: pes planus, pes
   rectus and pes cavus. Static balance was measured using the stork test
   and dynamic balance using the SEBT test. Plantar pressure distributions
   were measured by the emed platform. Two-way ANOVA, F test, heritability
   estimate, intraclass correlation coefficient and Fisher Z test were used
   for statistical analysis.
   Results. No significant differences were found between foot types or
   zygosities in static and dynamic balance and peak pressure (P>0.05).
   Within-pair variances were significantly different in dynamic balance in
   PL and L directions (P<0.05). Heritability was 0.43, 0.52, 0.62, 0.65
   and 0.39 in static balance and dynamic balance variables in P, PL, L and
   mean of eight directions, respectively. Genetic factors revealed no
   influence on peak pressure. Within-pair correlations were significantly
   different in dynamic balance results in PL and L directions (P<0.05).
   Conclusion. Foot type and zygosities had no influence on balance or peak
   pressure. Genetic factors moderately influenced postural balance, but
   not peak pressure. The current study is an asset to identify and manage
   influential factors in these variables for female twins.}},

Abstract = {{In order to produce long-lasting, non-wettable surfaces, femtosecond
   laser ablation process was used to produce micro/nano structures on
   metallic surfaces. The effects of femtosecond laser irradiation process
   parameters (fluence, scanning speed and laser beam overlap) on the
   hydrophobicity of the resulting micro/nano-patterned morphologies on
   stainless steel were studied in detail. Seven distinctly different
   micro/nano patterns, namely nano-rippled, paraboloidal, sinusoidal,
   triple roughness, cauliflowered, tulip and scaly patterns, were
   fabricated. The latter pattern (scaly) was found to be identical to that
   of the butterfly wing structure. All patterns were classified according
   to laser intensity and scanning speed. Consequently, the fabricated
   substrates were chemically treated by silanization (Young contact angle
   (CA) of about 105 degrees) in order to examine the additional effects of
   nanopatterning on wettability. The analysis of wettability revealed
   enhanced superhydrophobicity for most of these structures, particularly
   for the cauliflowered and scaly patterns with CAs in excess of 160
   degrees and contact angle hysteresis of less than 10 degrees. Finally,
   the cauliflowered pattern was found to possess a stable composite state,
   which is important for certain applications such as friction
   (Cassie-Baxter).}},

Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Implantable drug delivery devices are becoming attractive due to their
   abilities of targeted and controlled dose release. Currently, two
   important issues are functional lifetime and non-controlled drug
   diffusion. In this work, we present a drug delivery device combining an
   electrolytic pump and a thermo-responsive valve, which are both remotely
   controlled by an electromagnetic field (40.5 mT and 450 kHz). Our
   proposed device exhibits a novel operation mechanism for long-term
   therapeutic treatments using a solid drug in reservoir approach. Our
   device also prevents undesired drug liquid diffusions. When the
   electromagnetic field is on, the electrolysis-induced bubble drives the
   drug liquid towards the Poly (N-Isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) valve that
   consists of PNIPAM and iron micro-particles. The heat generated by the
   iron micro-particles causes the PNIPAM to shrink, resulting in an open
   valve. When the electromagnetic field is turned off, the PNIPAM starts
   to swell. In the meantime, the bubbles are catalytically recombined into
   water, reducing the pressure inside the pumping chamber, which leads to
   the refilling of the fresh liquid from outside the device. A catalytic
   reformer is included, allowing more liquid refilling during the limited
   valve's closing time. The amount of body liquid that refills the drug
   reservoir can further dissolve the solid drug, forming a reproducible
   drug solution for the next dose. By repeatedly turning on and off the
   electromagnetic field, the drug dose can be cyclically released, and the
   exit port of the device is effectively controlled. (C) 2015 AIP

Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Implantable drug delivery systems can provide long-term reliability,
   controllability, and biocompatibility, and have been used in many
   applications, including cancer pain and non-malignant pain treatment.
   However, many of the available systems are limited to zero-order,
   inconsistent, or single burst event drug release. To address these
   limitations, we demonstrate prototypes of a remotely operated drug
   delivery device that offers controllability of drug release profiles,
   using osmotic pumping as a pressure source and magnetically triggered
   membranes as switchable on-demand valves. The membranes are made of
   either ethyl cellulose, or the proposed stronger cellulose acetate
   polymer, mixed with thermosensitive poly( N-isopropylacrylamide)
   hydrogel and superparamagnetic iron oxide particles. The prototype
   devices' drug diffusion rates are on the order of 0.5-2 mu g/h for
   higher release rate designs, and 12-40 ng/h for lower release rates,
   with maximum release ratios of 4.2 and 3.2, respectively. The devices
   exhibit increased drug delivery rates with higher osmotic pumping rates
   or with magnetically increased membrane porosity. Furthermore, by vapor
   deposition of a cyanoacrylate layer, a drastic reduction of the drug
   delivery rate from micrograms down to tens of nanograms per hour is
   achieved. By utilizing magnetic membranes as the valve-control
   mechanism, triggered remotely by means of induction heating, the
   demonstrated drug delivery devices benefit from having the power source
   external to the system, eliminating the need for a battery. These
   designs multiply the potential approaches towards increasing the
   on-demand controllability and customizability of drug delivery profiles
   in the expanding field of implantable drug delivery systems, with the
   future possibility of remotely controlling the pressure source. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The use of fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs) is rapidly increasing in
   air, land, and marine manufacturing sectors. This is despite the fact
   that a universal methodology has not been yet developed to assist
   designers in selecting optimum reinforcing fiber architectures under
   different loading scenarios. The focus of the present article is to
   recommend a systematic approach for selecting the architecture of
   long-fiber fabric reinforcements in FRP composite structures under
   impact events. Namely, nine design criteria were selected and quantified
   for four types of PP/glass laminates through drop tower impact testing
   under 200J energy, four-point flexural bending before and after impact,
   as well as microtomographic damage analysis of impacted samples.
   Subsequently, ranking of the candidate laminates was found using a
   multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) technique to aid in selecting
   the overall best performing fiber reinforcement option under the
   presence of conflicting and inter-dependent design attributes. (C) 2015

Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},

Abstract = {{A process model was developed to determine the net energy ratio (NER)
   for both regular and steam-pretreated pellet production from
   ligno-cellulosic biomass. NER is a ratio of the net energy output to the
   total net energy input from non-renewable energy source into the system.
   Scenarios were developed to measure the effect of temperature and level
   of steam pretreatment on the NER of both production processes. The NER
   for the base case at 6 kg h(-1) is 1.29 and 5.0 for steam-pretreated and
   regular pellet production respectively. However, at the large scale NER
   would improve. The major factor for NER is energy for steam and drying
   unit. The sensitivity analysis for the model shows that the optimum
   temperature for steam pretreatment is 200 degrees C with 50\%
   pretreatment (Steam pretreating 50\% feed stock, while the rest is
   undergoing regular pelletization). Uncertainty result for
   steam-pretreated and regular pellet is 1.35 +/- 0.09 and 4.52 +/- 0.34
   respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal relay placement is studied for free-space optical multihop
   communication with link obstacles and infeasible regions. An optimal
   relay placement scheme is proposed to achieve the lowest outage
   probability, enable the links to bypass obstacles of various geometric
   shapes, and place the relay nodes in specified available regions. When
   the number of relay nodes is large, the searching space can grow
   exponentially, and thus, a grouping optimization technique is proposed
   to reduce the searching time. We numerically demonstrate that the
   grouping optimization can provide suboptimal solutions close to the
   optimal solutions, but the average searching time linearly grows with
   the number of relay nodes. Two useful theorems are presented to reveal
   insights into the optimal relay locations. Simulation results show that
   our proposed optimization framework can effectively provide desirable
   solution to the problem of optimal relay nodes placement.}},

Title = {{A Novel Phonology- and Radical-Coded Chinese Sign Language Recognition
   Framework Using Accelerometer and Surface Electromyography Sensors}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},

Pages = {{23303-23324}},

Abstract = {{Sign language recognition (SLR) is an important communication tool
   between the deaf and the external world. It is highly necessary to
   develop a worldwide continuous and large-vocabulary-scale SLR system for
   practical usage. In this paper, we propose a novel phonology- and
   radical-coded Chinese SLR framework to demonstrate the feasibility of
   continuous SLR using accelerometer (ACC) and surface electromyography
   (sEMG) sensors. The continuous Chinese characters, consisting of coded
   sign gestures, are first segmented into active segments using EMG
   signals by means of moving average algorithm. Then, features of each
   component are extracted from both ACC and sEMG signals of active
   segments (i.e., palm orientation represented by the mean and variance of
   ACC signals, hand movement represented by the fixed-point ACC sequence,
   and hand shape represented by both the mean absolute value (MAV) and
   autoregressive model coefficients (ARs)). Afterwards, palm orientation
   is first classified, distinguishing Palm Downward sign gestures from
   Palm Inward ones. Only the Palm Inward gestures are sent for further
   hand movement and hand shape recognition by dynamic time warping (DTW)
   algorithm and hidden Markov models (HMM) respectively. Finally,
   component recognition results are integrated to identify one certain
   coded gesture. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SLR
   framework with a vocabulary scale of 223 characters can achieve an
   averaged recognition accuracy of 96.01\% +/- 0.83\% for coded gesture
   recognition tasks and 92.73\% +/- 1.47\% for character recognition
   tasks. Besides, it demonstrats that sEMG signals are rather consistent
   for a given hand shape independent of hand movements. Hence, the number
   of training samples will not be significantly increased when the
   vocabulary scale increases, since not only the number of the completely
   new proposed coded gestures is constant and limited, but also the
   transition movement which connects successive signs needs no training
   samples to model even though the same coded gesture performed in
   different characters. This work opens up a possible new way to realize a
   practical Chinese SLR system.}},

Abstract = {{Portable sensors and biomedical devices are influenced by the recent
   advances in microfluidics technologies, compact fabrication techniques,
   improved detection limits and enhanced analysis capabilities. This paper
   reports the development of an integrated ultraportable, low-cost, and
   modular digital microfluidic (DMF) system and its successful integration
   with a smartphone used as a high-level controller and post processing
   station. Low power and cost effective electronic circuits are designed
   to generate the high voltages required for DMF operations in both open
   and closed configurations (from 100 to 800 V). The smartphone in turn
   commands a microcontroller that manipulate the voltage signals required
   for droplet actuation in the DMF chip and communicates wirelessly with
   the microcontroller via Bluetooth module. Moreover, the smartphone acts
   as a detection and image analysis station with an attached microscopic
   lens. The holder assembly is fabricated using three-dimensional (3D)
   printing technology to facilitate rapid prototyping. The holder features
   a modular design that enables convenient attachment/detachment of a
   variety of DMF chips to/from an electrical busbar. The electrical
   circuits, controller and communication system are designed to minimize
   the power consumption in order to run the device on small lithium ion
   batteries. Successful controlled DMF operations and a basic colorimetric
   assay using the smartphone are demonstrated.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{223}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We measure the shear rheology of two-dimensional liquid foams in a
   Couette device, and correlate the variation of the shear stress with the
   evolution of the foam microstructure. For a monodisperse foam, inception
   of shearing results in a rapid rise of the shear stress, which then
   saturates into a quasi-steady state of fluctuations about a
   time-independent mean value. The dominant frequency of the oscillation
   correlates closely with the time scale of one row of bubbles sliding
   past the next row. The mean stress decreases with increasing bubble
   size. In bidisperse foams, the shear stress exhibits two regimes of
   transient behavior. If the shear rate and the large-to-small bubble size
   ratio are both below certain thresholds, the stress behaves similarly to
   that in a monodisperse foam. Above these thresholds, however, the
   instantaneous shear stress oscillates around a mean value that declines
   gradually over several minutes. The foam eventually approaches a
   quasi-steady state similar to that of a monodisperse foam. This gradual
   decrease in shear stress can be attributed to the size-based segregation
   of bubbles. Finally, we propose a mixing rule that relates the effective
   viscosity of a bidisperse foam in the quasi-steady state to those of
   monodisperse foams made of the two constituent bubble sizes. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The impact of differential thermal heating on pressure propagation is
   assessed for pipelines filled with weakly compressible gel. The
   temperature influence on a strain (shear history) dependent rheological
   model is established from literature data. In order to consider thermal
   effects on the pressure propagation and flow restart, temperature of the
   pipeline wall is assumed to be above the wax appearance temperature. The
   impact of thermal treatment on pressure propagation is analyzed as heat
   is conducted axially and radially in the pipeline and degrades the gel
   rheology. Commensurate with weakly compressible fluid properties,
   isothermal compressibility and fluid thermal expansion coefficients
   establish density as a function of pressure and temperature. Comparison
   of results for non-isothermal and isothermal conditions validates the
   selected numerical algorithm. Axial conduction is negligible in
   comparison to radial conduction due to the large pipe aspect ratio.
   Convective flow penetrates only a small axial distance during the
   pressure propagation process. It is shown that by providing differential
   heating of gel, the restart process may be accelerated by several orders
   of magnitude. Preheating of the gel is thereby shown to be an effective
   method for increasing the velocity of the pressure wave. Finally, it is
   also shown that the gel deforms faster in the presence of heating,
   further facilitating flow commencement. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Objectives. To evaluate the influence of different resin blends
   concentrations and nanofibers mass ratio on flexural properties of
   experimental Poliacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers reinforced composites.
   Materials and methods. Poliacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers mats were
   produced by electrospinning and characterized by tensile testing and
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Experimental resin-fiber composite
   beams were manufactured by infiltrating PAN nanofiber mats with varied
   concentrations of BisGMA-TEGDMA resin blends (BisGMA/TEGDMA: 30/70,
   50/50 and 70/30 weight\%). The mass ratio of fiber to resin varied from
   0\% to 8\%. Beams were cured and stored in water at 37 degrees C.
   Flexural strength (FS), flexural modulus (FM) and work of fracture (WF)
   were evaluated by three-point bending test after 24 h storage.
   Results. The tensile properties of the PAN nanofibers indicated an
   anisotropic behavior being always higher when tested in a direction
   perpendicular to the rotation of the collector drum. Except for WF, the
   other flexural properties (FS and FM) were always higher as the ratio of
   BisGMA to TEGDMA increased in the neat resin beams. The addition of
   different ratios of PAN fibers did not affect FS and FM of the composite
   beams as compared to neat resin beams (p > 0.05). However, the addition
   of fibers significantly increased the WF of the composite beams, and
   this was more evident for the blends with higher TEGDMA ratios (p <
   0.05).
   Significance. The inclusion of PAN nanofibers into resin blends did not
   negatively affect the properties of the composite and resulted in an
   increase in toughness that is a desirable property for a candidate
   material for prosthodontics application. (C) 2015 Academy of Dental

Abstract = {{A novel technique for efficient simulation of progressive delamination

   eliminating the a priori requirement to implant cohesive elements at all

   lending the method suitable for treatment of practical size structures.

Abstract = {{Cooperative communication can significantly enhance the efficient
   utilization of spectrum in wireless networks. The performance of
   wireless cooperative networks depends on carefulmedium access control
   (MAC) and resource allocation such as relay selection and cooperative
   link scheduling policy for interference management. Most of the previous
   centralized works rely on precise instantaneous channel state
   information (CSI). In this paper, considering the impact of multirelay
   link interference on relay selection and dynamic spectrum sharing, we
   propose a fully distributed relay MAC scheme for wireless cooperative
   networks based on a Stackelberg game framework with only one-hop local
   CSI, where source nodes that have their own information to send act as
   leader users and where the others act as follower users. In this
   scenario, each relay node prices its spectrum resource to the
   corresponding source node to maximize its revenue. In addition, the
   proposed scheme helps not only source nodes to find relay nodes by
   channel gains and obtain an optimal system performance but relay nodes
   to maximize their revenue by asking a suitable resource price as well.
   The interactions between the sources and relays iteratively lead to a
   Stackelberg equilibrium, in which the cooperation system achieves high
   throughput and low transmission delay. Simulation results are presented
   to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{During aging, changes occur in the collagen network that contribute to
   various pathological phenotypes in the skeletal, vascular, and pulmonary
   systems. The aim of this study was to investigate the consequences of
   age-related modifications on the mechanical stability and in vitro
   proteolytic degradation of type I collagen. Analyzing mouse tail and
   bovine bone collagen, we found that collagen at both fibril and fiber
   levels varies in rigidity and Young's modulus due to different
   physiological changes, which correlate with changes in cathepsin K
   (CatK)-mediated degradation. A decreased susceptibility to CatK-mediated
   hydrolysis of fibrillar collagen was observed following mineralization
   and advanced glycation end product-associated modification. However,
   aging of bone increased CatK-mediated osteoclastic resorption by similar
   to 27\%, and negligible resorption was observed when osteoclasts were
   cultured on mineral-deficient bone. We observed significant differences
   in the excavations generated by osteoclasts and C-terminal telopeptide
   release during bone resorption under distinct conditions. Our data
   indicate that modification of collagen compromises its bio-mechanical
   integrity and affects CatK-mediated degradation both in bone and tissue,
   thus contributing to our understanding of extracellular matrix aging.}},

Abstract = {{Shrinkage cracking is a major issue that affects the durability of
   concrete structures. Plastic shrinkage of cementitious materials can
   lead to cracking within 24 h of casting and sets the stage for premature
   deterioration. Although test techniques exist that can be used to
   evaluate the plastic shrinkage cracking potential of cement-based
   materials, mathematical models that predict the influence of various
   parameters such as water-cement ratio (w/c), aggregate to cement ratio,
   and the effect of fibers on cracking are not available. This paper
   presents a model that can be used to predict plastic shrinkage cracking
   in cement-based materials. The model is developed by using factorial
   design and utilizes representative data generated with a technique
   developed by the authors. The effectiveness and limitations of the model
   in predicting crack areas and width are discussed. The effect of
   variables such as w/c, sand/cement ratio, fiber dosage, and the
   interaction between these variables is also presented in this paper. (C)

Abstract = {{Visible light communication (VLC) reuses illumination devices,
   particularly light-emitting diodes (LEDs), for communication purposes.
   It has great potential to alleviate the strain on radio-frequency
   spectrumin indoor environments. VLC-enabled LED luminaries form VLC
   attocells that carry downlink data traffic to indoor mobile or
   stationary terminals. While one of the advantages of indoor VLC is low
   interference due to natural cell boundaries such as walls, multiple VLC
   attocells within a room would interfere. This is because illumination
   requirements often mandate a rich overlap of emissions of luminaries in
   a room. In this paper, we suggest the coordination of multiple VLC
   attocells (i.e., VLC-enabled LED luminaries) to turn the problem of
   overlap and thus interference into an advantage. We stipulate that this
   coordination can be accomplished through power line communication, which
   has been considered before as a means to transport data to VLC
   transmitters. Borrowing from concepts developed for radio-frequency
   wireless communications, we develop several precoding schemes for the
   new coordinated VLC broadcasting architecture. These include designs for
   the case of imperfect channel knowledge at the VLC transmitter, since
   channel information is usually provided through a low-rate feedback
   channel. The performance advantages for VLC transmission due to the
   proposed coordination and precoding designs are demonstrated based on a

Abstract = {{Fecal based tests have limited diagnostic values in detecting
   adenomatous polyps, the precursor lesions to colorectal cancer (CRC).
   Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) using silver nanoparticles as
   substrate is a multiplexed analytical technique capable of detecting
   biomolecules with high sensitivity. This study utilizes SERS to analyze
   blood plasma for detecting both CRC and adenomatous polyps for the first
   time. Blood plasma samples are collected from healthy control subjects
   and patients diagnosed with adenomas and CRC. Using a real-time Raman
   system, SERS spectra for blood plasma samples are measured in 1 s. The
   collected SERS spectra are analyzed with partial least
   squares-discriminant analysis. Classification of normal versus CRC plus
   adenomatous polyps achieved diagnostic sensitivity of 86.4\% and
   specificity of 80\%. The results suggest that blood plasma SERS analysis
   could be a potential screening test to detect both CRC and adenomas.

Abstract = {{Facet joint injections of analgesic agents are widely used to treat
   patients with lower back pain. The current standard-of-care for guiding
   the injection is fluoroscopy, which exposes the patient and physician to
   significant radiation. As an alternative, several ultrasound guidance
   systems have been proposed, but have not become the standard-of-care,
   mainly because of the difficulty in image interpretation by the
   anesthesiologist unfamiliar with the complex spinal sonography.
   We introduce an ultrasound-based navigation system that allows for live
   2D ultrasound images augmented with a patient-specific statistical model
   of the spine and relating this information to the position of the
   tracked injection needle. The model registration accuracy is assessed on
   ultrasound data obtained from nine subjects who had prior CT images as
   the gold standard for the statistical model. The clinical validity of
   our method is evaluated on four subjects (of an ongoing in vivo study)
   which underwent facet joint injections.
   The statistical model could be registered to the bone structures in the
   ultrasound volume with an average RMS accuracy of mm. The shape of the
   individual vertebrae could be estimated from the US volume with an
   average RMS surface distance error of mm. The facet joints could be
   identified by the statistical model with an average accuracy of mm.
   The results of this initial feasibility assessment suggest that this
   ultrasound-based system is capable of providing information sufficient
   to guide facet joint injections. Further clinical studies are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic emission tests were performed using a split Hopkinson pressure
   bar system (SHPB) on 50-mm-diameter bars of granite, limestone,
   sandstone and skarn. The results show that the amplitude distribution of
   hits is not well centralized around 50 dB, and that some hits with large
   amplitudes, usually larger than 70 dB, occur in the early stages of each
   test, which is different from the findings from static and
   low-loading-rate tests. Furthermore, the dominant frequency range of the
   recorded acoustic emission waveforms is between 300 kHz and 500 kHz, and
   frequency components higher than 500 kHz are not significant. The hit
   with the largest values of amplitude, counts, signal strength, and
   absolute energy in each test, displays a waveform with similar frequency
   characteristics and greater correlation with the waveform obtained from
   the elastic input bar of the split Hopkinson pressure bar system
   compared with the waveforms of the other hits. This indicates that the
   hit with the largest values of amplitude, counts, signal strength, and
   absolute energy is generated by elastic wave propagation instead of
   fracture within the rock specimen.}},

Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{The use of dynamic computational methods has become indispensable for
   addressing problems related to rockfall hazard. Although a number of
   models with various degrees of complexity are available, model
   parameters are rarely calibrated against observations from rockfall
   experiments. A major difficulty lies in reproducing the apparent
   randomness of the impact process related to both ground and block
   irregularities. Calibration of rigorous methods capable of explicitly
   modeling trajectories and impact physics of irregular blocks is
   difficult, as parameter spaces become too vast and the quality of model
   input and observation data are insufficient. The model presented here
   returns to the simple ``lumped-mass{''} approach and simulates the
   characteristic randomness of rockfall impact as a stochastic process.
   Despite similarities to existing approaches, the model presented here
   incorporates several novel concepts: (i) ground roughness and particle
   roughness are represented as a random change of slope angle at impact;
   (ii) lateral deviations of rebound direction from the trajectory plane
   at impact are similarly accounted for by perturbing the ground
   orientation laterally, thus inducing scatter of run-out directions; and
   (iii) a hyperbolic relationship connects restitution factors to impact
   deformation energy. With these features, the model is capable of
   realistically accounting for the influence of particle mass on dynamic
   behaviour. The model only requires four input parameters, rendering it
   flexible for calibration against observed datasets. In this study, we
   calibrate the model against observations from the rockfall test site at
   Vaujany in France. The model is able to reproduce observed distributions
   of velocity, jump heights, and runout at observation points. In
   addition, the spatial distribution of the trajectories and landing
   points has been successfully simulated. Different parameter sets have
   been used for different ground materials such as an avalanche channel, a
   forest road, and a talus cone. Further calibration of the new model
   against a range of field datasets is essential. This study is part of an
   extensive calibration program that is still in progress at this first
   presentation of the method, and focuses on fine-tuning the details of
   the stochastic process implemented both in two-dimensional (2D) and
   three-dimensional (3D) versions of the model.}},

Abstract = {{Contaminant intrusion in a distribution network (DN) refers to the entry
   of harmful chemicals and pathogens in the presence of three conditions:
   (i) the availability of a contaminant source near water mains; (ii) a
   pathway: leakage or breakage; and (iii) a driving force: low or negative
   pressure in the water main. The occurrence of contamination in a DN can
   take place frequently as there is no specific treatment at this stage
   except secondary disinfection. Contaminant intrusion requires as much
   attention as source water protection or treatment plants, particularly
   given that at this point, water is near the final stage prior to human
   consumption. Failure to detect and treat at this time could have
   potential negative impacts on consumers' health. Following the September
   11, 2001 attack, strict regulations are now enforced by the
   municipalities to monitor water quality within DNs. This review article
   focuses on various aspects of contaminant intrusion in DNs based on more
   than 90 journal articles, peer-reviewed conference proceedings, and
   research reports. Here we present details on the conditions of
   contaminant intrusion, water quality regulations, sampling, protection
   and mitigation strategies, and various modelling approaches for decision
   making. Based on this review, we propose an integrated model that will
   help guide effective decision making for contaminant detection and
   mitigation.}},

Title = {{Do in vivo kinematic studies provide insight into adjacent segment
   degeneration? A qualitative systematic literature review}},

Abstract = {{While much evidence suggests that adjacent segment degeneration is
   merely a manifestation of the natural degenerative process unrelated to
   any spine fusion, a significant body of literature supports the notion
   that it is a process due in part to the altered biomechanics adjacent to
   fused spine segments. The purpose of this study was to review and
   critically analyze the published literature that investigated the in
   vivo kinematics of the adjacent segments and entire lumbar spine in
   patients receiving spinal fusion or motion-preserving devices.
   A systematic review of the PubMed database was conducted, initially
   identifying 697 studies of which 39 addressed the in vivo kinematics of
   the segments adjacent to spinal implants or non-instrumented fusion of
   the lumbar spine.
   Twenty-nine articles studied fusion, of which three reported a decrease
   in range of motion of the caudal adjacent segment post-fusion. Examining
   the rostral adjacent segment, twelve studies observed no change, nine
   studies found a significant increase, and three studies reported a
   significant decrease in sagittal plane range of motion. Of the six
   studies that analyzed motion for the entire lumbar spine as a unit, five
   studies showed a significant decrease and one study reported no change
   in global lumbar spine motion. Kinematics of the segment rostral to a
   total disc replacement was investigated in six studies: four found no
   change and the results for the other two showed dependence on treatment
   level. Fifteen studies of non-fusion posterior implants analyzed the
   motion of the adjacent segment with two studies noting an increase in
   motion at the rostral level.
   There appears to be no overall kinematic changes at the rostral or
   caudal levels adjacent to a fusion, but some patients (similar to 20-30
   \%) develop excessive kinematic changes (i.e., instability) at the
   rostral adjacent level. The overall lumbar ROM after fusion appears to
   decrease after a spinal fusion.}},

   instrumented adjacent segment biomechanics: critical analysis of the

Abstract = {{Accelerated degenerative changes at intervertebral levels adjacent to a
   spinal fusion, the so-called adjacent segment degeneration (ASD), have
   been reported in many clinical studies. Even though the pathogenesis of
   ASD is still widely unknown, biomechanical in vitro approaches have
   often been used to investigate the impact of spinal instrumentation on
   the adjacent segments. The goal of this review is (1) to summarize the
   results of these studies with respect to the applied protocol and loads
   and (2) to discuss if the assumptions made for the different protocols
   match the patients' postoperative situation.
   A systematic MEDLINE search was performed using the keywords
   ``adjacent{''}, ``in vitro{''} and ``spine{''} in combination. This
   revealed a total of 247 articles of which 33 met the inclusion criteria.
   In addition, a mechanical model was developed to evaluate the effects of
   the current in vitro biomechanical test protocols on the changes in the
   adjacent segments resulting from different stiffnesses of the
   ``treated{''} segment.
   The surgical treatments reported in biomechanical in vitro studies
   investigating ASD can be categorized into fusion procedures, total disc
   replacement (TDR), and dynamic implants. Three different test protocols
   (i.e. flexibility, stiffness, hybrid) with different loading scenarios
   (e.g. pure moment or eccentric load) are used in current biomechanical
   in vitro studies investigating ASD. According to the findings with the
   mechanical model, we found that the results for fusion procedures highly
   depend on the test protocol and method of load application, whereas for
   TDR and dynamic implants, most studies did not find significant changes
   in the adjacent segments, independent of which test protocol was used.
   The three test protocols mainly differ in the assumption on the
   postoperative motion behavior of the patients, which is the main reason
   for the conflicting findings. However, the protocols have never been
   validated using in vivo kinematic data. In a parallel review on in vivo
   kinematics by Malakoutian et al., it was found that the assumption that
   the patients move exactly the same after fusion implemented with the
   stiffness- and hybrid protocol does not match the patients' behavior.
   They showed that the motion of the whole lumbar spine rather tends to
   decrease in most studies, which could be predicted by the flexibility
   protocol. However, when the flexibility protocol is used with the ``gold
   standard{''} pure moment, the difference in the kinematic changes
   between the cranial and caudal adjacent segment cannot be reproduced,
   putting the validity of current in vitro protocols into question.}},

Abstract = {{Optical wireless communication (OWC) systems provide many advantages
   over radio frequency (RF) wireless technologies in some scenarios,
   including significantly higher data rates and a large amount of
   available license-free frequency spectrum. Recently, OWC has also been

   due to RF spectrum crunching challenges. Various forms of OWC can be
   used to augment RF capacity at both access and backhaul/fronthaul
   levels. Despite the major advantages and various application areas, the
   widespread deployment of OWC is delayed by several challenges, such as
   the demand to maintain strict line-of-sight alignment between
   transmitter and receiver in long range outdoor applications; the need to
   combat attenuation due to adverse weather conditions such as fog, cloud,
   and turbulence; to modulate light emitting diodes at high frequencies
   without distortion at indoor visible light communication (VLC)
   applications and retaining power levels within the eye safety limits for

Abstract = {{This paper considers improving the confidentiality of visible light
   communication (VLC) links within the framework of physical-layer
   security. We study a VLC scenario with one transmitter, one legitimate
   receiver, and one eavesdropper. The transmitter has multiple light
   sources, while the legitimate and unauthorized receivers have a single
   photodetector, each. We characterize secrecy rates achievable via
   transmit beamforming over the multiple-input, single-output (MISO) VLC
   wiretap channel. For VLC systems, intensitymodulation (IM) via
   light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is the most practical transmission scheme.
   Because of the limited dynamic range of typical LEDs, the modulating
   signal must satisfy certain amplitude constraints. Hence, we begin with
   deriving lower and upper bounds on the secrecy capacity of the scalar
   Gaussian wiretap channel subject to amplitude constraints. Then, we
   utilize beamforming to obtain a closed-form secrecy rate expression for
   the MISO wiretap channel. Finally, we propose a robust beamforming
   scheme to consider the scenario wherein information about the
   eavesdropper's channel is imperfect due to location uncertainty. A
   typical application of the proposed scheme is to secure the
   communication link when the eavesdropper is expected to exist within a
   specified area. The performance is measured in terms of the worst-case
   secrecy rate guaranteed under all admissible realizations of the
   eavesdropper's channel.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a shift from CMOS lithography to nanoelectronics chemical
   assembly has been under investigation. Nanoscale components are
   assembled into arrays of low-power and high-density nanofabrics, which
   can be integrated with conventional CMOS systems. The inability to
   achieve inexpensive defect-free mass manufacturing of nanoelectronics is
   the largest impediment of their adoption. Limited nanowire lengths and
   defect-prone nanodevices pose significant challenges for design
   automation tools. In this work, we propose a design phase for cell
   mapping and reconfiguration in novel hybrid CMOS/nanoelectronics
   architecture called CMOL. Reconfiguration consists of finding new
   suitable physical location for each gate such that the circuit becomes
   defect free. The novelty of this work is to engineer non-deterministic
   iterative search heuristics, namely simulated evolution (SimE) and Tabu
   search (TS), to find cell assignment around defective nano-components.
   Circuits of various sizes from ISCAS'89 benchmarks are used to evaluate
   the designed heuristics. Results show that SimE and TS yield successful
   reconfigurations in reasonable computation time when nanodevice defect
   rate is as high as 50 \% and nanowire cut rate up to 70 \%.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional shake tables employ linear controllers such as
   proportional-integral-derivative or loop shaping to regulate the
   movement. However, it is difficult to tune a linear controller to
   achieve accurate and robust tracking of different reference signals
   under payloads. The challenges are mainly due to the nonlinearity in
   hydraulic actuator dynamics and specimen behavior. Moreover, tracking a
   high-frequency reference signal using a linear controller tends to cause
   actuator saturation and instability. In this paper, a hierarchical
   control strategy is proposed to develop a high-performance shake table.
   A unidirectional shake table is constructed at the University of British
   Columbia to implement and evaluate the proposed control framework, which
   consists of a high-level controller and one or multiple low-level
   controller(s). The high-level controller utilizes the sliding mode
   control (SMC) technique to provide robustness to compensate for model

   network based data fusion}},

Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{159-169}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Due to incomplete and partial information, data/information from
   multiple sources with different credibility or confidence, and the
   involvement of human (expert) judgment for the interpretation and
   integration of data/information, uncertainties become a major concern
   for the development of water main failure prediction model. To reduce
   these uncertainties, a new Bayesian belief network based data fusion
   model is developed for the failure prediction of water mains. To
   accredit the proposed framework, it is implemented to predict the
   failure of CI and DI pipes of the water distribution network of the City
   of Calgary. Analysis results indicate that similar to 6.16\% and 8.20\%
   of the total 18,762 CI and DI pipes are at high and very high failure
   rates, respectively. The proposed model can be integrated with the
   geographic information system of the utilities and capable of
   identifying the most `vulnerable' and `sensitive' pipes within the
   distribution network as well as estimate the total number of pipes that
   need maintenance/rehabilita tion/replacement (M/R/R) actions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Water distribution networks (WDNs) are among the most important and
   expensive municipal infrastructure assets that are vital to public
   health. Municipal authorities strive for implementing preventive (or
   proactive) programs rather than corrective (or reactive) programs. The
   ability to predict the failure of pipes in WDNs is vital in the
   proactive investment planning of replacement and rehabilitation
   strategies. However, due to inherent uncertainties in data and modeling,
   WDN failure prediction is challenging. To improve understanding of water
   main failure processes, accurate quantification of uncertainty is
   necessary. The research reported in this paper presents a comparative
   evaluation of the prediction accuracy of normal multiple linear
   regression and Bayesian regression models using water mains failure
   data/information from the City of Calgary. Results indicate that
   Bayesian regression models provide better predicted response and handle
   the uncertainty more accurately than normal regression model. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A novel technology involving radiofrequency heating and hydrogen
   peroxide (RF/H2O2) was used for the treatment of dairy manure. RF/H2O2
   process efficacy was affected by power intensity, hydrogen peroxide
   dosage and holding time. The optimal conditions for nutrient release and
   solids disintegration were determined: for orthophosphate release, power
   intensity of 3 kW/L (kW/L substrate treated), holding time of 65 min and
   H2O2 dose of 1\%; and power intensity of 1.9 kW/L, holding time of 53
   min and H2O2 dose of 1.2\% for soluble chemical oxygen demand
   concentration. The results indicated that the treatment efficacy of
   radiofrequency process was comparable to microwave process. However, the
   radiofrequency process required a longer holding time than microwave
   process. Nevertheless, energy required by the radiofrequency was lower
   than microwave as the radiofrequency system was capable of handling
   higher volumes of manure with higher solids content at a given time. (C)

Abstract = {{Locked nucleic acids (LNAs) can greatly enhance duplex DNA stability,

   set of diverse duplexes containing LNAs in one or both strands are

   can stabilize a duplex not only through direct interaction with their
   base-pair partner, but also through nonlocal hyperstablization effects
   created by LNA:LNA base pairs and/or specific patterns of oppositely
   oriented LNA:DNA base pairs. The data are, therefore, used to extend a

Abstract = {{When five axis CNC machine tools follow series linear toolpath segments,
   the drives experience velocity, acceleration and jerk discontinuities at

   orientation splines to achieve C-3 continuity at the junctions while
   respecting user-defined tolerance limits. The geometrically smoothed

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{155-166}},

Abstract = {{Through the use of post-tensioned (PT) elements in steel beam-column
   connections, steel buildings under seismic excitations can return to
   their plumb position, displaying negligible permanent deformation. The
   cyclic behavior of a PT connection is affected by several design
   parameters. This paper aims at identifying the significant factors which
   affect the cyclic response of steel PT connections with top-and-seat
   angles. A sequential fractional factorial design-of-experiment
   methodology is used to statistically evaluate the effects of different
   design factors as well as their interactions on the cyclic response of
   PT connections. To this end, 3D finite element models are first
   developed to accurately simulate the cyclic behavior of the connections.
   After validating the finite element results with the past experimental
   data, a two-stage (sequential) sensitivity analysis is conducted. Eight
   potential factors, including the material and geometric properties of
   steel angles, reinforcing plates, and bolts, are considered. The cyclic
   response of connections is examined in terms of stiffness, strength,
   energy dissipation capacity, and residual displacement. From this
   parametric study, the significance of the design factors is determined
   with respect to each response. Additionally, regression models are
   presented to estimate the response quantities for other PT connection
   configurations with the same beam and column sections. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   uniform liquid film was obtained in the two-stage reheating process. The
   semi-solid microstructure obtained via this two-stage reheating process
   had a number of features beneficial for semi-solid metal processing,
   including smaller equivalent diameters, a higher degree of sphericity, a
   lower coarsening rate constant of solid grains and a reduced amount of
   entrapped liquid compared with that produced by the traditional

Abstract = {{The effect of growth conditions on the electronic properties of
   GaAs1-xBix grown on GaAs by molecular beam epitaxy has been investigated
   by means of temperature dependent photoluminescence (PL). When the

   300 degrees C and all other growth conditions were fixed, the Bi
   concentration in the deposited films increased from 1\% to 5\% and the
   PL intensity decreased by more than a factor of 1000. Two samples were
   grown at different temperatures (330 degrees C and 375 degrees C) with
   approximately the same Bi concentration (similar to 2\%) at a
   stoichiometric As: Ga flux ratio. The temperature dependence of the PL
   shows that the sample grown at high temperature has less PL emission
   from sub-bandgap states and a stronger temperature dependence of the

Title = {{Gold losses and mercury recovery in artisanal gold mining on the Madeira
   River, Brazil}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{370-377}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{For the last 40 years artisanal mining has been playing a key role in
   the economy of the Madeira River, State of Rondonia, in the Brazilian
   Amazon. The main process through which artisanal miners in the region
   recover gold is by river dredging. The dredges are floating platforms
   that excavate the bottom of the river and, after a sorting phase,
   separate the gold (Au) from the sediment by means of mercury (Hg)
   amalgamation. The objectives of this paper are to map the process,
   demonstrate the inability to completely recover the Au from the
   excavated sediments, and reveal the actual impact of Hg. Several dredges
   were visited and all the unit operations involved in the mining and
   processing circuit were analyzed. Significant losses of Au are
   associated with inefficient sorting techniques. The Au grade of the
   sediments rejected during the sorting phase ranges from 0.1 to 7.8 ppm,
   reaching values higher than the world average Au grade of the producing
   mines. Analyzing the amalgamation process, it was possible to quantify
   the Hg released into and recovered from the environment. The results
   show that, contrary to common belief, Hg is recovered from the bottom of
   the river instead of being released into it. The total Hg-mass balance
   is actually closed with a positive recovery and with an emission factor
   (Hg:Au ratio) lower than the average (0.1-0.2). Despite this result, Hg
   continues to be volatilized into the atmosphere in the form of vapors.
   In the region of the Madeira River a campaign must be developed to
   encourage the use of more efficient and Hg-free technologies for Au
   recovery. Responsible and Hg-free AGM operations can contribute
   effectively to rehabilitate the entire area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   with a modified Fernelius model which Lakes into account multiple
   reflections within the GaAsBi layer and GaAs substrate. Three undoped
   samples and two samples that are degenerately doped with silicon are
   studied. The undoped samples show a clear Urbach absorption edge with a
   composition dependent bandgap that decreases by 56 rneV/\% Bi and a
   composition independent Urbach slope parameter of 25 meV due to
   absorption by Bi cluster states near the valence band. The doped samples
   show a long absorption tail possibly due to absorption by gap states and
   free carriers in addition to a Burstein-Moss bandgap shift. PL of the
   undoped samples shows a lower energy emission peak due to defects not
   observed in Lhe usually available thin samples (50 nm or less) grown
   under similar conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An important parameter involved in characterizing the electrical

   threshold. In this study, a 3D percolation model was developed and used
   to predict the critical fiber volume fractions corresponding to the
   percolation zone in carbon fiber (CF)-reinforced cement-based materials,
   generally used as sensors. This model can eliminate or reduce the
   necessity for performing meticulous experiments to estimate the
   percolation threshold. Results from the model were found to be
   comparable with experimental and theoretical predictions in the
   literature. Established trends with respect to fiber aspect ratios were
   also confirmed. The effect of fiber breakage was found to be
   particularly important due to the brittle nature of CFs; an effective
   length should, therefore, be used in predicting the percolation

Abstract = {{VUV/UV is a chemical-free and straightforward solution for the
   degradation of emerging contaminants from water sources. The objective
   of this work was to investigate the feasibility of VUV/UV advanced
   oxidation process for the effective degradation of a target
   micropollutant, atrazine, under continuous flow operation of 0.5-6.5
   L/min. To provide an in-depth understanding of process, a comprehensive
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, incorporating flow
   hydrodynamics, 185 nm VUV and 254 nm UV radiation propagation along with
   a complete kinetic scheme, was developed and validated experimentally.
   The experimental degradation rates and CFD predicted values showed great
   consistency with less than 2.9\% average absolute relative deviation
   (AARD). Utilizing the verified model, energy-efficiency of the VUV/UV
   process under a wide range of reactor configurations was assessed in
   terms of electrical energy-per-order (EEO), (OH)-O-center dot
   concentration as well as delivered UV and VUV dose distributions.
   Thereby, the extent of mixing and circulation zones was found as key
   parameter controlling the treatment economy and energy-efficiency of the
   VUV/UV process. Utilizing a CFD-driven baffle design strategy, an
   improved VUV/UV process with up to 72\% reduction in the total
   electrical energy requirement of atrazine degradation was introduced and
   verified experimentally. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   charge density and the bubble rise velocity deduced from the probes were
   found to be of similar order of magnitudes and changed consistently with

Abstract = {{An experimental study is performed for polymer concentration field
   measurements during the drying of an aqueous poly(vinyl alcohol)
   solution inside a shallow cavity near a vertical side wall. The
   measurements are based on optical techniques such as 3D confocal
   microscopy for laser-induced fluorescence analysis. The results reveal a
   significant concentration heterogeneity across the film near the
   meniscus during the drying process. The concentration at the solution
   air interface remains higher compared to the bulk, and it increases
   toward the pinned contact line and also over time. A skin layer starts
   forming as the surface concentration reaches the glass-transition
   concentration, after which the evaporation rate starts decreasing.
   Regardless of the cavity depth and the initial polymer concentration,
   the drying film undergoes a similar concentration evolution during the
   evaporation process, although minor differences can be recognized. For
   instance, a low local capillary number at the surface is associated with
   a wavy surface concentration profile while at higher capillary numbers
   disturbances are damped and a much more uniform concentration profile is
   observed.}},

Abstract = {{TiO2 nanoparticles modified by Pt2+ ions and Pt nanoparticles (Pt2+
   Pe/TiO2) were synthesized through a simple sol gel method. The
   physical-chemical characteristics of the catalysts were characterized by
   X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission
   electron microscope, UV Vis absorbance spectroscopy, and
   photoluminescence spectroscopy. Pt2+ ions were doped into the lattice of
   TiO2 and Pt nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of TiO2.
   Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with water vapor under ultraviolet (UV)
   and visible light irradiation was conducted in a continuousflow reactor.
   Loading of Pe+ and Pt with appropriate ratio effectively enhanced the
   yields of H-2 and CH4 but showed no significant effect on the production
   of CO. The highest yield of CH4 reached 264.5 and 138.6 timol g-cari
   after UV and visible light irradiation for 7 h, respectively. The
   enhanced activity of Pt2+ Pe/TiO2 catalyst may be due to the low
   recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs caused by Pt
   nanoparticles and the strong visible light absorption, as well as the
   high surface area induced by Pt2+ ions. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen

Abstract = {{The flow behavior and particle motion in a pulsed gas-solid spouted bed
   was investigated using the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. The
   computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) was used
   to evaluate the gas flow field and particle trajectories. The model was
   four-way coupled to account for fluid-particle, particle-fluid, and
   particle-particle interactions. A column of 150 x 15 mm cross-section
   and height 750 mm containing 24500 particles of diameter 2.5 mm was
   investigated. Gas entered through a 10 X 15 mm slot at the base of the
   bed. Steady spouting was compared with pulsed spouting at frequencies of
   1, 4, and 10 Hz, with superficial velocity amplitude of 0.5 and 1 m/s
   and a mean superficial spouting velocity of 2 m/s. In addition to
   comparing the bed pressure drop versus time and its Fourier
   decomposition, the hydrodynamics in the spout and annulus regions were
   examined. A new procedure was introduced to assess spouted bed mixing
   and homogeneity. Flow pulsation was shown to provide stronger upward air
   momentum, less horizontal gas percolation, better circulation, higher
   downward particle flux near the sidewalls, better mixing, and greater
   homogeneity.}},

   pollutants in stormwater}},

Abstract = {{Conventional stormwater treatment techniques such as sedimentation and
   filtration are inefficient for removing the dissolved and colloidal
   phases of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) present in stormwater.
   Adsorption could be a promising technique for removing colloidal and
   dissolved pollutants. Five low-cost sorbent materials were investigated
   in this project, including two minerals - vermiculite and perlite - and
   three waste products - two pine barks and a sawdust - as potential
   adsorbents for removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
   alkylphenols and phthalates; HOCs commonly found in stormwater.
   Adsorption capacity and kinetics were studied through batch adsorption
   tests using synthetic stormwater spiked with a mixture of HOCs.
   Vermiculite and perlite exhibited insignificant removal of the organic
   contaminants. The three wood-based materials retained >80\% of the
   initial HOC concentration (10-300 mu g/L). The two barks exhibited
   slightly higher adsorption capacities of HOCs than the sawdust. For all
   compounds tested, maximum adsorption onto the wood-based media was
   reached in <10 min. The highest adsorption capacity was found for PAHs
   (up to 45 mu g/g), followed by alkylphenols and phthalates. No
   correlation was found between adsorption capacity and physical-chemical
   parameters such as solubility and partition coefficients (log K-ow).
   Agreement between empirical data and the pseudo-second order kinetic
   model suggest chemisorption of HOCs onto a monolayer on wood-based
   media. This could lead to early saturation of the materials and should
   be investigated in future studies through repeated adsorption of HOCs,
   for example in column studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{The coupling effect of gas-phase chemistry and surface reactions on
   oxygen permeation and fuel conversion in ITM reactors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{488}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{The effect or the coupling between heterogeneous catalytic reactions
   supported by an ion transport membrane (ITIVI) and gas-phase chemistry
   on fuel conversion and oxygen permeation in ITM reactors is examined. In
   ITM reactors, thermochemical reactions take place in the gas-phase and
   On the membrane surface, both of which interact with oxygen permeation.
   However, this coupling between gas-phase and surface chemistry has not
   been examined in detail. In this study, a parametric analysis using
   numerical simulations is conducted to investigate this coupling and its
   impact on fuel conversion and oxygen permeation rates. A thermochemical
   model that incorporates heterogeneous chemistry on the membrane surface
   and detailed chemical kinetics in the gas-phase is used. Results show
   that fuel conversion and oxygen permeation are strongly influenced by
   the simultaneous action of both chemistries. It is shown that the
   coupling somewhat suppresses the gas-phase kinetics and reduces fuel
   conversion, both attributed to extensive thermal energy transfer towards
   the membrane which conducts it to the air side and radiates to the
   reactor walls. The reaction pathway and products, in the form of syngas
   and C2 hydrocarbons, are also affected. In addition, the operating
   regimes of ITM reactors in which heterogeneous- or/and homogeneous-phase
   reactions predominantly contribute to fuel conversion and oxygen
   permeation are elucidated. (C) 2015 Elsevier By. All rights reserved,}},

Abstract = {{The particulate matter (PM) emitted from a single-cylinder
   compression-ignition, natural-gas engine fitted with a High-Pressure
   Direct-Injection (HPDI) system distinctly different from a duel fuel
   engine was investigated, and characterized by size distribution,
   morphology, mass-mobility exponent, effective density, volatility,
   mixing state, and primary particle size using transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), and tandem measurements from differential mobility
   analyzers (DMA) and a centrifugal particle mass analyzer (CPMA). Six
   engine conditions were selected with varying load, speed, exhaust gas
   recirculation (EGR) fraction, and fuel delivery strategy. An increase in
   engine load increased both the number concentration and the geometric
   mean diameter of the particulate. The fraction of the number of purely
   volatile particles to total number of particles (number volatile
   fraction, NVF) was found to decrease as load increased, although at the
   lower speed, partially premixed mode, the lowest NVF. All size
   distributions were also found to be unimodal. The size-segregated ratio
   of the mass of internally mixed volatile material to total particle mass
   (mass volatile fraction, MVF) decreased with load and with particle
   mobility-equivalent diameter. A roughly constant amount of volatile
   material is likely produced at each engine mode, and the decrease in MVF
   is due to the increase in PM number with load. Effective density and
   mass-mobility exponent of the non-volatile soot at the different engine
   loads were the same or slightly higher than soot from traditional diesel
   engines. Denuded effective density trends were observed to collapse to
   approximately the same line, although engine modes with higher MVFs had
   slightly higher effective densities suggesting that the soot structures
   have collapsed into more dense shapes-a suspicion that is confirmed with
   TEM images. TEM results also indicated that primary particle size first
   decreases from low to medium load, then increases from medium to high
   load. An increase in EGR was also seen to increase primary particle
   size. Coefficients were determined for a relation that gives primary
   particle diameter as a function of projected area equivalent diameter. A
   decrease in load or speed results in a stronger correlation.

Abstract = {{Trust-based collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS) methods are
   particularly vulnerable to secondary user (SU) misbehaviors in the
   initial stage of the CSS process. It is therefore important to analyze
   the transient performance of CSS. Expressions for the steady-state
   average trust values and number of sensing reports transmitted by honest
   SUs (HSUs) and malicious SUs (MSUs) in a two-phase trust-based energy
   efficient CSS (EE-CSS) strategy were derived in an earlier paper. In
   this paper, we derive closed-form expressions for the transient
   probability distributions and averages of the trust values for HSUs and
   MSUs in EE-CSS. We also obtain expressions for the transient average
   number of sensing reports transmitted by HSUs and MSUs to the FC in each
   phase. The results, verified by simulations, show that these expressions
   can be used to efficiently evaluate the average number of reports
   transmitted for a large number of SUs and time slots.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, Internet privacy becomes more and more important and
   sensitive, and has been one of the latest buzz words to hit the Internet
   world. In response to protect the privacy of Internet users, a variety
   of privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) have emerged. As one of privacy
   enhancing technologies, anonymous communication has been extensively
   studied from various aspects by researchers. Node churn is frequent in
   anonymous network, which make it difficult to maintain a stable network
   topology, therefore it is necessary to get more insight into the overall
   anonymous network topology. In this work, in order to better grasp the
   present situation of research, we investigate existing organizations and
   universities which study anonymous communication from the perspective of
   network topology, and related projects. Then we survey related papers to
   anonymous communication published in recent years, which focus on the
   analysis of node selection ( especially in the Tor). In addition, we
   present a framework of anonymous communication network topology, and a
   visual illustration of this analysis that shows the progression of the
   research of network topology and node discovery in anonymous
   communication. Finally, some related problems and follow-up study are
   presented to be studied deeply in future.}},

Abstract = {{Gasification of four biomass chars and anthracite char were investigated
   under a CO2 atmosphere using a thermo-gravimetric analyzer. Reactivity
   differences of chars were considered in terms of pyrolysis temperature,
   char types, crystallinity, and inherent minerals. The results show that
   the gasification reactivity of char decreased with the increase of
   pyrolysis temperature. Char gasification reactivity followed the order
   of anthracite coal char (AC-char) < pine sawdust char (PS-char) < peanut
   hull char (PH-char) < wheat straw char (WS-char) < corncob char
   (CB-char) under the same pyrolysis temperature. Two repesentative
   gas-solid models, the random pore model (RPM) and the modified random
   pore model (MRPM), were applied to describe the reactive behaviour of
   chars. The results indicate RPM performs well to describe gasification
   rates of chars but cannot predict the phenomenon that there appears to
   exist a peak conversion for biomass chars at a high conversion rate,
   where the MRPM performs better.}},

Abstract = {{In an attempt to reduce permanent displacement and damage, a hybrid
   reinforced concrete (RC) bridge pier configuration is considered in the
   present study. The plastic hinge region of the bridge pier is reinforced
   with superelastic shape memory alloy (SMA) and the remaining portion
   with regular steel. This paper focuses on fragility-based seismic
   vulnerability assessment for a SMA-RC bridge pier considering residual
   displacement, displacement ductility, and performance criteria as the
   demand parameters. Fragility curves are developed to assess the relative
   vulnerability of a SMA-RC bridge pier and a conventional steel-RC bridge
   pier using probabilistic seismic demand model (PSDM). The fragility
   curves are developed with a suite of 20 near-fault ground motions using
   incremental dynamic analysis. The fragility curves provide insight into
   the failure probability of the bridge piers and aid in expressing the
   impact of SMA on the bridge pier vulnerability.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the common use of epidural anesthesia in obstetrics and surgery,
   the procedure can be challenging, especially for obese patients. We
   propose the use of an ultrasound guidance system employing a
   transducer-mounted camera to create 3-D panorama ultrasound volumes of
   the spine, thereby allowing identification of vertebrae and selection of
   puncture site, needle trajectory and depth of insertion. The camera
   achieves absolute position estimation of the transducer with respect to
   the patient using a specialized marker strip attached to the skin
   surface. The guidance system is validated first on a phantom against a
   commercial optical tracking system and then in vivo by comparing
   panorama images from human subjects against independent measurements by
   an experienced sonographer. The results for measuring depth to the
   epidural space, intervertebral spacing and registration of interspinous
   gaps to the skin prove the potential of the system for improving
   guidance of epidural anesthesia. The tracking and visualization are
   implemented in real time using the 3D Slicer software package. (E-mail:

Abstract = {{Recent advances in self-interference cancelation techniques enable
   full-duplex relaying (FDR) systems, which transmit and receive
   simultaneously in the same frequency band with high spectrum efficiency.
   Unlike most existing works, we study the problem of energy-efficient
   resource allocation in FDR networks. We consider a shared FDR deployment
   scenario, where an FDR relay is deployed at the intersection of several
   adjacent cell sectors. First, a simple but practical transmission
   strategy is proposed to deal with the involved interference, i.e.,
   multiaccess interference, multiuser interference, and self-interference.
   Then, the problem of joint power and subcarrier allocation is formulated
   to maximize the network-level energy efficiency while taking the
   residual self-interference into account. Since the formulated problem is
   a mixed combinatorial and nonconvex optimization problem with high
   computation complexity, we use Dinkelbach and discrete stochastic
   optimization methods to solve the energy-efficient resource-allocation
   problem efficiently. Simulation results are presented to show the
   effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Control of oxygen over cell cultures in vitro is a topic of considerable
   interest, as chronic and cyclic hypoxia can alter cell behaviour. Both
   static and transient hypoxic levels have been found to affect tumour
   cell behaviour; it is potentially valuable to include these effects in
   early, in vitro stages of drug screening. A barrier to their inclusion
   is that rates of transient hypoxia can be a few cycles/hour, which is
   difficult to reproduce in traditional in vitro cell culture environments
   due to long diffusion distances from control gases to the cells. We use
   a gas-permeable three-layer microfluidic device to achieve spatial and
   temporal oxygen control with biologically-relevant switching times. We
   measure the oxygen profiles with integrated, ratiometric optical oxygen
   sensors, demonstrate sensor and system stability over multi-day
   experiments, and characterize a pre-bleaching process to improve sensor
   stability. We show, with both finite-element modelling and experimental
   data, excellent control over the oxygen levels by the device,
   independent of fluid flow rate and oxygenation for the operating flow
   regime. We measure equilibration times of approximately 10 min, generate
   complex, time-varying oxygen profiles, and study the effects of
   oxygenated media flow rates on the measured oxygen levels. This device
   could form a useful tool for future long-term studies of cell behaviour
   under hypoxia.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{All-optical switching is the foundation of emerging all-optical
   (terabit-per-second) networks and processors. All-optical switching has
   attracted considerable attention, but it must ultimately support
   operation with femtojoule switching energies and femtosecond switching
   times to be effective. Here we introduce an all-optical switch
   architecture in the form of a dielectric sphere that focuses a
   high-intensity photonic nanojet into a peripheral coating of
   semiconductor nanoparticles. Milli-scale spheres coated with Si and SiC
   nanoparticles yield switching energies of 200 and 100 fJ with switching
   times of 10 ps and 350 fs, respectively. Micro-scale spheres coated with
   Si and SiC nanoparticles yield switching energies of 1 pJ and 20 fJ with
   switching times of 2 ps and 270 fs, respectively. We show that
   femtojoule switching energies are enabled by localized photoinjection
   from the photonic nanojets and that femtosecond switching times are
   enabled by localized recombination within the semiconductor
   nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{A novel microreactor that allows for mixed, slurry-phase batch
   experiments to be conducted at temperatures to 445 degrees C and
   pressures of 13.8 MPa is reported. The reactor uses a glass insert to
   isolate the reaction mixture from the catalytically active reactor walls
   and a vortex mixer to promote gas liquid solid mixing and requires only
   150 mu L of reaction mixture to operate. The rapid heating and cooling
   (to 445 degrees C and back to room temperature in under 30 min) afforded
   by the small size makes this reactor ideal for fast catalyst-screening
   studies. The utility of the reactor is demonstrated through a study of
   the hydro conversion of diphenylmethane (DPM) at 445 degrees C and 13.8
   MPa and the hydrodeoxygenation of 4-methylphenol (4-MP) at 375 degrees C
   and 4.8 MPa, both conducted using an unsupported MoS2 catalyst. A
   high-speed video is used to identify 2000 rpm as the optimum mixing
   speed for the microreactor. Conversion data for DPM and 4-MP in the
   microreactor is used to determine rate constants for the reactions and,
   hence, quantify MoS2 catalytic activity and thermal/reactor wall
   activity. The MoS2 activity is found to be in good agreement with
   published stirred batch reactor results using the same catalyst.}},

Abstract = {{Given a set of positions for wireless nodes, the interference
   minimization problem is to assign a transmission radius (i.e., a power
   level) to each node such that the resulting communication graph is
   connected while minimizing the maximum (respectively, average)
   interference. We consider the model introduced by von Rickenbach et al.
   (2005), in which each wireless node is represented by a point in
   Euclidean space on which is centered a transmission range represented by
   a ball, and edges in the corresponding graph are symmetric. The problem
   is NP-complete in two or more dimensions (Buchin 2008), and no
   polynomial-time approximation algorithm is known. We show how to solve
   the problem efficiently in settings typical for wireless ad hoc
   networks. If nodes are represented by a set P of n points selected
   uniformly and independently at random over a d-dimensional rectangular
   region, then the topology given by the closure of the Euclidean minimum
   spanning tree of P has O(log n) maximum interference with high
   probability and O(1) expected interference. We extend the first bound to
   a general class of communication graphs over a broad set of probability
   distributions. We present a local algorithm that constructs a graph from
   this class; this is the first local algorithm to provide an upper bound
   on expected maximum interference. Finally, we disprove a conjecture of
   Devroye and Morin (2012) relating the maximum interference of the
   Euclidean minimum spanning tree to the optimal maximum interference
   attainable.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports phase equilibrium measuretnents and crystal structure
   analysis on the ionic clathrate hydrate for-fed from
   tetra-n-butylphosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH). Phase equilibrium
   temperatures were measured in the mole fraction range of TBPOH in
   aqueous solution from 0.0072 to 00416: The highest ionic clathrate
   hydrate-solution equilibrium temperature was determined to be 290.2 K at
   a TBPOH mole fraction of 0.0340, which corresponds to the congruent
   composition. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements were
   performed on the crystal formed at 288.7 K, and the chemical composition
   of the TBPON hydrate crystal was determined to be TBPOH center dot 29
   center dot 6H(2)O, which is consistent with the congruent composition
   obtained by the phase equilibrium measurement. The crystal structure of
   the TBPOH hydrate has a superstructure identical with Jeffrey's type I
   cubic structure, with an I (4) over bar 3d space group with a lattice
   constant of 24.5191(13) angstrom. The TBPOH hydrate structure is
   compared with the same hydrate structure formed by the
   tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride. We provide a comprehensive overview of
   the dissociation temperature, the counteranion, and the hydrate
   structure regarding TB? and TBA salt hydrates. The dissociation
   temperatures decrease linearly with the increase in the partial molal
   volume of anions for TBA and TBP salt hydrates, changing the hydrate
   structures from the primitive cubic One that has the minimum hydration
   number.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, we study throughput-optimal scheduling policies in
   single-path buffer-aided relay networks, where the packets of a user
   travel one fixed path from the source to the destination and do not
   require routing. We modify the well-known Max-Weight (MW) policy and
   propose a version of throughput-optimal algorithms, which we refer to as
   Modified MW (MMW). In MMW, by defining a suitably large threshold, a
   link's weight is proportional to just the corresponding local queue size
   either in the base station or the relay station, in most of the time
   slots. Moreover, a parameter can be adjusted for improving delay
   fairness between the relayed and direct users. MMW is suitable for use
   in both shared and independent channel scenarios and facilitates
   decentralized network implementations. Numerical results confirm that
   MMW is better able to provide similar performance for direct and relayed
   users in terms of queueing delay, compared with the existing algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Relaying is an emerging technique for 3G/4G high bandwidth networks in
   order to improve the capacity of edge nodes. As the deployment cost is
   high, there might be a few number of relay nodes in the cell which can
   help the edge nodes to transmit their data. From this perspective, one
   of the key problems in a relay equipped node is to make decision which
   edge nodes to be helped and how much power need to be disseminated among
   them in order to maximize the system capacity. This problem is
   formulated as an optimization problem given individual node and total
   available power constraints. The objective function of the formulated
   problem is non-convex, and we solve this using geometric programming
   (GP)-based method. Since the solution of this problem is computationally
   expensive, we propose a low complexity suboptimal solution. Having
   noticed the selfless nature of the sources in the centralized solution,
   we also provide a game theoretical solution. Two separate Stackelberg
   games are required to solve this power allocation problem. Moreover,
   given the total power constraint, a centralized entity is necessary to
   connect these two games. For assigning power among the sources, the
   centralized entity plays the buyer level game, whereas the sources act
   as power sellers. On the other hand, to disseminate relay power among
   the sources, roles of the players are just interchanged. Besides, before
   staring the game, the centralized entity determines, of total power, how
   much is for the transmit operation of the sources and how much is for
   their relay operation. We show that there is a unique Stackelberg
   Equilibrium (SE) for both games under certain convergence condition.
   Finally, the proposed game theoretical solution can achieve comparable
   performance in terms of resource allocation with the centralized optimal
   one.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of sensorless freehand 3-D ultrasound imaging is to
   eliminate the need for additional tracking hardware and reduce cost and
   complexity. However, the accuracy of current out-of-plane pose
   estimation is main obstacle for full 6-degree-of-freedom (DoF) tracking.
   We propose a new filter-based speckle tracking framework to increase the
   accuracy of out-of-plane displacement estimation. In this framework, we
   use the displacement estimation not only for the specific speckle
   pattern, but for the entire image. We develop a nonlocal means (NLM)
   filter based on a probabilistic normal variance mixture model of
   ultrasound, known as Rician-inverse Gaussian (RiIG). To aggregate the
   local displacement estimations, Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) is
   used as a quality measure of the estimations. We derive an explicit
   analytical form of SURE for the RiIG model and use it as a weight
   factor. The proposed filter-based speckle tracking framework is
   formulated and evaluated for three commonly used noise models, including
   the RiIG model. The out-of-plane estimations are compared with our
   previously proposed model-based algorithm in a set of ex vivo
   experiments for different tissue types. We show that the proposed RiIG
   filter-based method is more accurate and less tissue-dependent than the
   other methods. The proposed method is also evaluated in vivo on the
   spines of five different subjects to assess the feasibility of a
   clinical application. The 6-DoF transform parameters are estimated and
   compared with the electromagnetic tracker measurements. The results show
   higher tracking accuracy for typical small lateral displacements and
   tilt rotations between image pairs.}},

Abstract = {{In the half-duplex single relay selection network, comprised of a
   source, M half-duplex relays, and a destination, only one relay is
   active at any given time, i.e., only one relay receives or transmits,
   and the other relays are inactive, i.e., they do not receive nor
   transmit. The capacity of this network, when all links are affected by
   independent slow time-continuous fading and additive white Gaussian
   noise (AWGN), is still unknown, and only achievable average rates have
   been reported in the literature so far. In this paper, we present new
   achievable average rates for this network, which are larger than the
   best known average rates. These new average rates are achieved with a
   buffer-aided relaying protocol. Since the developed buffer-aided
   protocol introduces unbounded delay, we also devise a buffer-aided
   protocol which limits the delay at the expense of a decrease in rate.
   Moreover, we discuss the practical implementation of the proposed
   buffer-aided relaying protocols and show that they do not require more
   resources for channel state information acquisition than the existing
   relay selection protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The present study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial
   effect of the combined use of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and root canal
   sealers on Enterococcus faecalis biofilms using a dentin infection
   model. Methods: Cells of E. faecalis were introduced into the dentinal
   tubules by centrifugation and incubated in brain-heart infusion for 3
   weeks. The biofilms in dentin were first subjected to 5\% NaOCl or
   sterile water for 10 minutes followed by an equal thickness of AH Plus
   (Dentsply International Inc, York, PA), Endosequence BC Sealer
   (Brasseler USA, Savannah, GA), or MTA Fillapex (Angelus Industria de
   Produtos Odontologicos S/A, Londrina, Brazil) placed on the root canal
   wall of the dentin specimens for 7, 30, and 60 days. Gutta-percha and
   water were used in a similar manner as controls. The proportions of dead
   and live bacteria inside the dentinal tubules were assessed by confocal
   laser scanning microscopy and viability staining. Results: The combined
   use of NaOCl and sealers (30 and 60 days) killed significantly more
   bacteria than NaOCl or sealers alone (P < .05). NaOCl + MTA Fillapex was
   the most effective antibacterial combination by killing 83\% bacteria in
   dentin tubules in 60 days. Thirty and 60 days of exposure to the sealers
   resulted in significantly more dead bacteria in dentin biofilms than
   7-day exposures (P < .05). Conclusions: The placement of root canal
   sealer after NaOCl treatment enhanced antibacterial effects against E.
   faecalis in the dentinal tubules. Little additional effect was obtained
   after 30 days of exposure to sealers.}},

Abstract = {{Certain organisms survive low temperatures using a range of
   physiological changes including the production of antifreeze proteins
   (AFPs), which have evolved to adsorb to ice crystals. Several of these
   proteins have been purified and shown to also inhibit the
   crystallization of clathrate hydrates. They have been found to be
   effective against structure II (sII) hydrates formed from the liquid
   tetrahydrofuran, sI and sII gas hydrates formed from single gases, as
   well as sII natural gas hydrates using a mixture of three gases, as
   assessed using a variety of instrumentation including stirred reactors,
   differential scanning calorimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance, Raman
   spectroscopy, and X-ray powder diffraction. For the most part, AFPs are
   equal to or more effective than the commercial kinetic hydrate inhibitor
   (KHI) polyvinylpyrolidone, even under field conditions where saline and
   liquid hydrocarbons are present. Enclathrated gas analysis has revealed
   that the adsorption of AFPs to the hydrate surface is distinct from
   tested commercial KHIs and results in properties that should make these
   proteins more valuable in some field applications. Efforts to overcome
   the difficulties of recombinant protein production are ongoing, but in
   silico models of AFP adsorption to hydrates may offer the opportunity to
   design commercial KHIs for hydrocarbon recovery and transport with all
   the attributes of these AFP ``green inhibitors{''}, including their
   benefits for human and environmental safety.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath as
   measured by electronic nose (e-nose) have utility as biomarkers to
   detect subjects at risk of having lung cancer in a screening setting. We
   hypothesize that breath analysis using an e-nose chemo-resistive sensor
   array could be used as a screening tool to discriminate patients
   diagnosed with lung cancer from high-risk smokers. Methods: Breath
   samples from 191 subjects-25 lung cancer patients and 166 high-risk
   smoker control subjects without cancer-were analyzed. For clinical
   relevancy, subjects in both groups were matched for age, sex, and
   smoking histories. Classification and regression trees and discriminant
   functions classifiers were used to recognize VOC patterns in e-nose
   data. Cross-validated results were used to assess classification
   accuracy. Repeatability and reproducibility of e-nose data were assessed
   by measuring subject-exhaled breath in parallel across two e-nose
   devices. Results: e-Nose measurements could distinguish lung cancer
   patients from high-risk control subjects, with a better than 80\%
   classification accuracy. Subject sex and smoking status impacted
   classification as area under the curve results (ex-smoker males 0.846,
   ex-smoker female 0.816, current smokermale 0.745, and current smoker
   female 0.725) demonstrated. Two e-nose systems could be calibrated to
   give equivalent readings across subject-exhaled breath measured in
   parallel. Conclusions: e-Nose technology may have significant utility as
   a noninvasive screening tool for detecting individuals at increased risk
   for lung cancer. Significance: The results presented further the case
   that VOC patterns could have real clinical utility to screen for lung
   cancer in the important growing ex-smoker population.}},

Abstract = {{3D ultrasound (US) imaging has the potential to become a powerful
   alternative imaging modality in orthopaedic surgery as it is
   radiation-free and can produce 3D images (in contrast to fluoroscopy) in
   near-real time. Conventional B-mode US images, however, are
   characterized by high levels of noise and reverberation artifacts, image
   quality is user-dependent, and bone surfaces are blurred, which makes it
   difficult to both interpret images and to use them as a basis for
   navigated interventions. 3D US has great potential to assist orthopaedic
   care, possibly assisting during surgery if the anatomical structures of
   interest could be localized and visualized with sufficient accuracy and
   clarity and in a highly automated rapid manner.
   In this paper, we present clinical results for a novel 3D US
   segmentation technique we have recently developed based on
   multi-resolution analysis to localize bone surfaces in 3D US volumes.
   Our method is validated on scans obtained from 29 trauma patients with
   distal radius and pelvic ring fractures.
   Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate remarkably clear
   segmentations of bone surfaces with an average surface fitting error of
   0.62 mm (standard deviation (SD) of 0.42 mm) for pelvic patients and
   0.21 mm (SD 0.14 mm) for distal radius patients.
   These results suggest that our technique is sufficiently accurate for
   potential use in orthopaedic trauma applications.}},

Abstract = {{An optimization methodology has been developed for the aluminum alloy
   wheel casting process. The methodology is focused on improving the
   timing of cooling processes in a die to achieve improved casting
   quality. This methodology utilizes (1) a casting process model, which
   was developed within the commercial finite element package,
   ABAQUS(TM)-ABAQUS is a trademark of Dassault Systems; (2) a Python-based
   results extraction procedure; and (3) a numerical optimization module
   from the open-source Python library, Scipy. To achieve optimal casting
   quality, a set of constraints have been defined to ensure directional
   solidification, and an objective function, based on the solidification
   cooling rates, has been defined to either maximize, or target a
   specific, cooling rate. The methodology has been applied to a series of
   casting and die geometries with different cooling system configurations,
   including a 2-D axisymmetric wheel and die assembly generated from a
   full-scale prototype wheel. The results show that, with properly defined
   constraint and objective functions, solidification conditions can be
   improved and optimal cooling conditions can be achieved leading to
   process productivity and product quality improvements. (C) The Minerals,

Abstract = {{Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) is a promising thermal insulating
   ceramic for high temperature applications due to its stability and
   chemical inertness. As was demonstrated with other technical ceramics
   (e.g., Alumina), addition of Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) to a
   ceramic matrix may significantly enhance its mechanical properties. In
   this work, 8 mol pct YSZ with 0.2, 0.5, and 1 wt pct CNT composites were
   fabricated via the spark plasma sintering process. The densification,
   Vicker's microhardness, specific gravity, and microstructure evolution
   of the composites were investigated. The results suggest that the
   addition of CNTs to YSZ hindered densification and grain growth during
   SPS processing leading to inhomogeneous grain size distribution.
   However, the CNTs had a profound impact on the hardness of the composite
   ceramics, with an increase from 697 HV (YSZ) to 1195 HV (1 wt
   pctCNT-YSZ). (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials Society and ASM

Abstract = {{Formation of hot cracks is strongly affected by the transient force
   field acting on the semisolid weld-base metal interface. This paper
   presents a model that numerically simulates such a transient force field
   as a function of welding parameters. The model consists of two modules:
   (1) By means of a granular model of solidification, the microstructure
   of the semisolid area within the weld is reconstructed in three
   dimensions; (2) Since the transient force field is developed through the
   mechanical interaction between the semisolid weld and its base metal,
   the mechanical response of the base metal to the solidification of the
   weld is then simulated through finite element analysis. The results show
   that changing welding parameters and welding constraints varies the
   transient force field. Based on the obtained force fields, a qualitative
   study is also conducted to predict the susceptibility of various welds
   to hot cracking. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials Society and ASM

Abstract = {{This paper aims at investigating the over-prediction of public transit
   ridership by traditional mode choice models estimated using revealed
   preference data. Five different types of models are estimated and
   analysed, namely a traditional Revealed Preference (RP) data-based mode
   choice model, a hybrid mode choice model with a latent variable, a
   Stated Preference (SP) data-based mode switching model, a joint RP/SP
   mode switching model, and a hybrid mode switching model with a latent
   variable. A comparison of the RP data-based mode choice model with the
   mode choice models including a latent variable showed that the inclusion
   of behavioural factors (especially habit formation) significantly
   improved the models. The SP data-based mode switching models elucidated
   the reasons why traditional models tend to over-predict transit
   ridership by revealing the role played by different transit
   level-of-service attributes and their relative importance to mode
   switching decisions. The results showed that traditional attributes
   (e.g. travel cost and time) are of lower importance to mode switching
   behaviour than behavioural factors (e.g. habit formation towards car
   driving) and other transit service design attributes (e.g. crowding
   level, number of transfers, and schedule delays). The findings of this
   study provide general guidelines for developing a variety of transit
   ridership forecasting models depending on the availability of data and
   the experience of the planner. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A comprehensive investigation into processing-microstructure-property
   relations for optimization of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of
   friction stir welded aluminum 6061 plates is presented. A customized
   experimental setup has been employed to measure temperature at multiple
   points of welded plates as well as the friction stir welding (FSW) tool
   axial force, transverse force, torque, and temperature under various
   combinations of process parameters. After performing a set of FSW tests
   based on a full factorial design, X-ray and ultrasonic tests were
   employed to detect process-induced failure in test samples. Using design
   of experiments, the main effects and percentage contributions of the
   process parameters on the maximum UTS were then identified. During the
   latter analysis, a new methodology is proposed to cope with the effect
   of ``variable{''} axial force, as it is often uncontrollable during FSW
   tests. Samples with the highest and lowest UTS were selected and
   examined in more detail by comparing their fracture surfaces using
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as their grain size
   distributions using electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) and
   microhardness experiments. Finally, through the observed microstructure,
   temperature distribution, and welding force, it could be explained why
   the UTS and microhardness are found to notably vary between sample sof
   different RPM and weld speeds.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric materials are used extensively in a number of sensing
   applications ranging from aerospace industries to medical diagnostics.
   Piezoelectric materials generate charge when they are subjected to
   strain. However, since measuring charge is difficult at low frequencies,
   traditional piezoelectric sensors are limited to dynamic applications.
   In this research an alternative technique is proposed to determine
   static strain that relies upon the measurement of piezoelectric
   capacitance and resistance using piezoelectric sensors. To demonstrate
   the validity of this approach, the capacitance and resistance of a
   piezoelectric patch sensor was characterized for a wide range of strain
   and temperature. The study shows that the piezoelectric capacitance is
   sensitive to both strain and temperature while the resistance is mostly
   dependent on the temperature variation. The findings can be implemented
   to obtain thermally compensated static strain from piezoelectric
   sensors, which does not require an additional temperature sensor.}},

   demonstrated that the surface hardness of the untreated aluminium was
   increased from 52 HV for the untreated aluminium alloy to as high as

Abstract = {{To take full advantage of hyperspectral information, to avoid data
   redundancy and to address the curse of dimensionality concern,
   dimensionality reduction (DR) becomes particularly important to analyze
   hyperspectral data. Exploring the tensor characteristic of hyperspectral
   data, a DR algorithm based on class-aware tensor neighborhood graph and
   patch alignment is proposed here. First, hyperspectral data are
   represented in the tensor form through a window field to keep the
   spatial information of each pixel. Second, using a tensor distance
   criterion, a class-aware tensor neighborhood graph containing
   discriminating information is obtained. In the third step, employing the
   patch alignment framework extended to the tensor space, we can obtain
   global optimal spectral-spatial information. Finally, the solution of
   the tensor subspace is calculated using an iterative method and
   low-dimensional projection matrixes for hyperspectral data are obtained
   accordingly. The proposed method effectively explores the spectral and
   spatial information in hyperspectral data simultaneously. Experimental
   results on 3 real hyperspectral datasets show that, compared with some
   popular vector-and tensor-based DR algorithms, the proposed method can
   yield better performance with less tensor training samples required.}},

Abstract = {{A 3-D axisymmetric model is developed to predict pressure wave
   propagation processes during gelled waxy oil pipeline restart
   operations. A finite volume method is implemented on a staggered grid.
   An iterative predictor-corrector algorithm provides solutions to the
   combined parabolic-hyperbolic set of governing equations. A new
   shear-history-dependent thixotropic rheology model is proposed for
   pressure wave propagation computations. Moderate Reynolds number flows
   within the laminar regime are computed, demonstrating the impact of
   inertial effects. The results clearly illustrate the important
   mechanisms of pipeline restart. The nature of pressure wave propagation
   is governed by gel strength as well as overall fluid compressibility.
   Three sequential pressure wave propagation regimes are dominated by
   inertial, viscous, and gel degradation phenomena, respectively. The
   viscous and gel degradation regimes are effectively coupled by imposed
   deformation conditions. For initially homogenous thixotropic gels,
   strain tends to localize near the pipeline wall, playing a central role
   in assuring the pipeline restart. (c) 2015 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Position independent geometric errors (PIGEs), which are caused by
   imperfect assembly of five-axis machine tools, need to be identified and
   compensated to improve the accuracy of machined parts. This paper
   presents the identification and correction of serial five-axis machine
   tools based on screw theory. The proposed identification model is based
   on a generalized Jacobian function for a variety of five-axis machine
   configurations as opposed to the models based on homogeneous
   transformation matrices (HTMs). The screw theory allows a global
   description of rigid body motion without constructing the local frames
   on each drive module as required by the HTMs method. An explicit inverse
   kinematics model is proposed to compensate the geometric errors directly
   as opposed to the existing approximate linearized or iterative methods.
   The proposed identification and correction of PIGEs methods are verified
   through simulations and experiments with ball-bar tests on a five-axis
   machine tool. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1392-1402}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Yield stress measurements were carried out on slurries prepared from
   five different ore samples of varying contents of bitumen and fines in
   the sand fraction. The rheological measurements were performed using the
   vane, slump, and relaxation methods, as well as by extrapolation of
   equilibrium flow curves to zero shear rate. In the case of the vane
   tests, it was found that the yield stress values agreed better with the
   results obtained from the other techniques when the yield stresses were
   calculated using a torque value at the point of departure from linearity
   on the initial section of experimental torque-time curves. It was found
   that the yield stress values of oil sand slurries increased with an
   increase in bitumen content in the ores. High-bitumen ores tended to
   yield within a volume of the slurry extending well beyond the geometry
   of the vane. In contrast, low-bitumen ores yielded much closer to the
   vane edges. As a result, the torque value at the point of departure from
   linearity on the torque-time curve was recommended for calculating the
   yield stress of high-bitumen ore slurries with the use of the vane
   technique. On the other hand, the maximum torque value on the
   torque-time curve can be used for determining the yield stress of low
   bitumen ores.}},

Title = {{Implications of the Minamata Convention on Mercury for informal gold
   mining in Sub-Saharan Africa: from global policy debates to grassroots
   implementation?}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In October 2013, after years of negotiation, governments from 92
   countries signed a historic agreement called the Minamata Convention on
   Mercury, establishing mandatory measures to curb mercury use and
   pollution. Article 7 of the Convention stipulates that governments must
   create National Action Plans to reduce and where feasible eliminate
   mercury use in artisanal gold mining, a rapidly growing informal sector
   in much of Africa, with strategies to be monitored by the Convention
   Secretariat. The purpose of this study is to critically analyze the
   implications of the Minamata Convention for the artisanal mining sector
   in Sub-Saharan Africa, which currently depends upon mercury amalgamation
   for gold extraction. Our analysis draws on examples from Zimbabwe and
   Tanzania, countries with divergent political challenges but both with
   expanding artisanal mining sectors. We argue that a paradigm shift is
   needed to address intertwined technological, political and
   socio-economic challenges facing marginalized populations in mining
   communities. We highlight why meeting the Convention targets requires
   that international donors and national policymakers proactively
   engage-rather than vilify-artisanal miners who use mercury, prioritizing
   local knowledge and collaborative community-based decision making to
   develop effective pollution abatement initiatives in gold mining
   regions. We further argue that gender-sensitive grassroots empowerment
   initiatives including microfinance programs are vital to facilitate
   adopting cleaner technology, as required by Article 7. Finally, the
   analysis underscores the need for fundamentally reforming national
   mining policy priorities, recognizing marginalized mining communities'
   resource rights and tackling livelihood insecurity as part of efforts to
   implement the Minamata Convention. In considering what `grassroots'
   implementation could mean, the article contributes to a growing body of
   scholarship calling attention to fairness and equity concerns in order
   to achieve the aims of global environmental agreements.}},

Abstract = {{Underground mine fire disasters are one of the major types of disasters
   that occur in the mining industry. This paper examines a method for
   simulating underground fire disasters based on Cellular Automata. Cells
   are used to describe the mass energy units produced in underground mine
   fires. The combustible and combustion status, the physical and life
   attributes, and the rules of the fire cells evolution were described. An
   underground fire source ignition model that highlights the expression of
   cell temperature was established from an analysis of factors including
   the types and throw-in density of combustible matters, the underground
   ventilation system and the slope of the tunnels. An underground fire
   fume spread model that focused on illustrating cell density was then
   created from an analysis of factors including the double diffusion
   effect, underground ventilation, buoyancy function, and throttle action.
   On this basis, the status and attributes of fire cells were described
   according to a sequence of time by means of visualization. This model
   intuitively describes the spatial temporal development process of the
   fire source ignition and smoke spread in an underground mine fire
   disaster. The feasibility of the Cellar Automata model for underground
   mine fire disasters, and its visualization effects were tested and
   verified through a case study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Current technologies for aptamer discovery typically leverage the
   systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX)
   concept by recursively panning semi-combinatorial ssDNA or RNA libraries
   against a molecular target. The expectation is that this iterative
   selection process will be sufficiently stringent to identify a candidate
   pool of specific high-affinity aptamers. However, failure of this
   process to yield promising aptamers is common, due in part to (i)
   limitations in library designs, (ii) retention of non-specific aptamers
   during screening rounds, (iii) excessive accumulation of amplification
   artifacts, and (iv) the use of screening criteria (binding affinity)
   that does not reflect therapeutic activity. We report a new selection
   platform, High-Fidelity (Hi-Fi) SELEX, that introduces fixed-region
   blocking elements to safeguard the functional diversity of the library.
   The chemistry of the target-display surface and the composition of the
   equilibration solvent are engineered to strongly inhibit non-specific
   retention of aptamers. Partition efficiencies approaching 10(6) are
   thereby realized. Retained members are amplified in Hi-Fi SELEX by
   digital PCR in a manner that ensures both elimination of amplification
   artifacts and stoichiometric conversion of amplicons into the
   single-stranded library required for the next selection round.
   Improvements to aptamer selections are first demonstrated using human
   -thrombin as the target. Three clinical targets (human factors IXa, X,
   and D) are then subjected to Hi-Fi SELEX. For each, rapid enrichment of
   ssDNA aptamers offering an order-nM mean equilibrium dissociation
   constant (K-d) is achieved within three selection rounds, as quantified
   by a new label-free qPCR assay reported here. Therapeutic candidates
   against factor D are identified. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2015;112:

   fluidized beds. In this paper, a dual-material probe was tested in a
   gas-solid fluidized bed for measuring the charge density of fluidized
   particles. The experiments were conducted in a two-dimensional fluidized
   bed with both single bubble injection and freely bubbling, at various
   particle charge densities and superficial gas velocities. Uniformly
   sized glass beads were used to eliminate complicating factors at this
   early stage of probe development. Peak currents, extracted from dynamic
   signals, were decoupled to determine charge densities of bed particles,
   which were found to be qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with
   charge densities directly measured by Faraday cup from the freely
   bubbling fluidized bed. The current signals were also decoupled to
   estimate bubble rise velocities, which were found to be in reasonable
   agreement with those obtained directly by analyzing video images. (C)

Abstract = {{Electric vehicles make use of energy storage systems, such as batteries
   and/or ultracapacitors to power the electric power drive train, as well
   as auxiliary automotive system for control, safety, and comfort. This
   relatively complex power structure can be described as a distributed
   multiconverter system. The constant power behavior of tight-speed
   controllers in the vehicle's traction system and tightly regulated dc-dc
   converters connected to the HV-DC bus produces instability effects. This
   paper proposes a simple and practical geometric control, using circular
   switching surfaces, to address constant power load instability in
   electric vehicle's power systems. The proposed switching surfaces
   provide a solution in the geometrical domain to constant power loading
   conditions, while achieving outstanding dynamic response compared to
   state-of-the-art controllers. The controller is implemented in a
   bidirectional Buck + Boost cascade converter as a battery
   charge/discharge unit and ensures reliable system operation. The
   predictable and consistent behavior of the converter with constant power
   load is presented by analyzing the system curves in the normalized state
   plane with the switching surfaces employed. Simulation and experimental
   results on a scaled 1-kW Buck + Boost cascade converter validate the
   proposed switching surfaces and predictions regarding the converter's
   behavior under constant power loading conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Fixation failure is a relatively common sequela of surgical
   management of proximal humerus fractures (PHF). The purpose of this
   study is to understand the current state of the literature with regard
   to the biomechanical testing of proximal humerus fracture implants.
   Methods: A scoping review of the proximal humerus fracture literature
   was performed, and studies testing the mechanical properties of a PHF
   treatment were included in this review. Descriptive statistics were used
   to summarize the characteristics and methods of the included studies.
   Results: 1,051 proximal humerus fracture studies were reviewed; 67
   studies met our inclusion criteria. The most common specimen used was
   cadaver bone (87 \%), followed by sawbones (7 \%) and animal bones (4
   \%). A two-part fracture pattern was tested most frequently (68 \%),
   followed by three-part (23 \%), and four-part (8 \%). Implants tested
   included locking plates (52 \%), intramedullary devices (25 \%), and
   non-locking plates (25 \%). Hemiarthroplasty was tested in 5 studies (7
   \%), with no studies using reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA)
   implants. Torque was the most common mode of force applied (51 \%),
   followed by axial loading (45 \%), and cantilever bending (34 \%).
   Substantial testing diversity was observed across all studies.
   Conclusions: The biomechanical literature was found to be both diverse
   and heterogeneous. More complex fracture patterns and RTSA implants have
   not been adequately tested. These gaps in the current literature will
   need to be addressed to ensure that future biomechanical research is
   clinically relevant and capable of improving the outcomes of challenging
   proximal humerus fracture patterns.}},

Journal = {{OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{347}},
Pages = {{92-97}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an analytical solution is proposed to solve the general
   problems of three-wave mixing with pump depletion. The so-called
   quasi-phase-matching (UM) for chi((2)) nonlinearities, including sum
   frequency generation (SFG), second harmonic generation (SHG) and
   difference frequency generation (DFG), is amended when the depletion of
   the pumping light power is considered. The optimum domain width and the
   corresponding conversion efficiency are discussed. The optimum domain
   widths deviate from the coherence length I-c = pi/Delta k, but the
   deviation is so small that it can be ignored according to the actual
   situation. The applicable scope of undepleted pump approximation (UPA)
   is estimated by a proposed relative tolerance. Analysis indicates that
   the relative tolerance showing the difference of conversion efficiency
   between the UPA and the exact solution is solely determined by the
   conversion efficiency. Based on the relative tolerance curves for SFG,
   SHG, and DFG, two models are developed: one can be used to describe the
   SFG and SHG processes, whereas the other can be used for the DFG
   process. These findings can be used to provide direct guidance for
   practical application, and can also make the estimation of practical
   samples more convenient. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave-oxidation treatment of sewage sludge using various oxidants
   was studied. Two treatment schemes with a combination of hydrogen
   peroxide and ozone were examined: hydrogen peroxide and ozone were
   introduced into the sludge simultaneously, followed by microwave
   heating. The other involved the ozonation first, and then the resulting
   solution was subjected to microwave and hydrogen peroxide treatment. The
   set with ozonation followed by hydrogen peroxide plus microwave heating
   yielded higher soluble materials than those of the set with hydrogen
   peroxide plus ozone first and then microwave treatment. No settling was
   observed for all treatments in the batch operation, except
   ozone/microwave plus hydrogen peroxide set at 120 degrees C. The
   pilot-scale continuous-flow 915MHz microwave study has demonstrated that
   microwave-oxidation process is feasible for real-time industrial
   application. It would help in providing key data for the design of a
   full-scale system for treating sewage sludge and the formulation of
   operational protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Construction and building industry is in dire need for developing
   sustainability assessment frameworks that can evaluate and integrate
   related environmental and socioeconomic impacts. This paper discusses an
   analytic hierarchy process (AHP) based sustainability evaluation
   framework for mid-rise residential buildings based on a broad range of
   environmental and socioeconomic criteria. A cradle to grave life cycle
   assessment technique was applied to identify, classify, and assess
   triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability performance indicators of
   buildings. Then, the AHP was applied to aggregate the impacts into a
   unified sustainability index. The framework is demonstrated through a
   case study to investigate two six storey structural systems (i.e.
   concrete and wood) in Vancouver, Canada. The results of this paper show
   that the environmental performance of a building in Canada, even in
   regions with milder weather such as Vancouver, is highly dependent on
   service life energy, rather than structural materials.}},

Abstract = {{Large-magnitude earthquakes can damage high-voltage transformers,
   trigger power flow disruption and impact the economy and society.
   However, methods that enable large transformer vulnerability assessment
   in a practical and rigorous way are scarce. This paper proposes a
   probabilistic framework using Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to predict
   the damage of high-voltage transformers subjected to seismic events.
   This framework incorporates major causes of transformer vulnerability at
   once, such as liquefaction, rocking response of the transformer, and
   interactions with interconnected equipment, which are otherwise commonly
   studied in isolation. To demonstrate the application of the framework,
   the paper elaborates on each step of the BBN framework, which is then
   validated with historical empirical data. Furthermore, the value of the
   proposed method is illustrated with high-voltage transformers in
   substations of the electric value BC Hydro in British Columbia, Canada.
   The paper also offers a sensitivity analysis that evaluates the effects
   of input variables on transformer damage. The proposed framework is
   simple to perform in practice, and the results are expected to support
   decisions on mitigation measures, seismic risk management, and to
   provide a step towards modelling the vulnerability of entire electrical
   substations.}},

Title = {{On the seismic response of deep-seated rock slope instabilities -
   Insights from numerical modeling}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{193}},
Pages = {{1-18}},
Month = {{JUL 2}},
Abstract = {{Earthquake-induced landslides constitute a critical component of seismic
   hazard in mountainous regions, While many seismic slope stability
   analysis methods exist with varying degrees of complexity, details of
   interactions between seismic waves and incipient landslides are not well
   understood and rarely incorporated, in particular for deep-seated slope
   instabilities. We present a series of 2D distinct-element numerical
   models aimed at clarifying interactions between earthquakes and large
   rock lope instabilities. The study has two main goals: 1) to explore the
   role of amplification in enhancing co-seismic slope deformation - a
   relationship widely discussed in literature but rarely tested
   quantitatively; and 2) to compare our numerical results with the
   well-established Newmark-method, which is commonly used in seismic slope
   stability analysis. We focus on three amplification phenomena: 1)
   geometric (topographic) amplification, 2) amplification related to
   material contrasts, and 3) amplification related to compliant fractures.
   Slope height, topography, seismic velocity contrasts, and internal
   strength and damage history were varied systematically in a series of
   models with a relatively simple, scalable geometry. For each model, we
   compute the spatial amplification patterns and displacement induced by
   real earthquake ground motions. We find that material contrasts and
   internal fracturing create both the largest amplification factors and
   induced displacements, while the effect of geometry is comparably small.
   Newmark-type sliding block methods underestimate displacements by not
   accounting for material contrasts and internal fracturing within the
   landslide body both common phenomena in deep-seated slope instabilities.
   Although larger amplification factors tend to be associated with greater
   displacements, we did not identify a clear link between ground motion
   frequency content, spectral amplification, and induced displacement
   Nevertheless, observation of amplification patterns can play an
   important role in seismic slope stability analyses, as: 1) strong
   amplification (related to material contrasts or compliant fractures) is
   an indicator of potentially large co-seismic displacements; and 2)
   amplification patterns can be used to constrain geological and numerical
   models used for seismic stability analysis. The complexity of wave-slope
   interactions, as well as the potential to severely underestimate hazard
   using Newmark-type methods, motivates use of rigorous numerical modeling
   for quantitative seismic hazard and risk assessment of large landslides.

Abstract = {{A novel experimental technique has been used to measure particle
   concentration distributions in agitated tanks. This approach consisted
   in using pyrite (FeS2) particles and a Pt electrode connected to a

   order to discern collisions between the particles and the Pt electrode
   from random variations in electrode potential, a time and a frequency
   domain method of analysis were used. The latter showed no periodicity in
   the collision rate indicating that the process was stochastic. The
   presented method is convenient because of its simplicity and it can
   provide important information regarding the hydrodynamic behaviour of
   solids in agitated tanks, particularly when non-intrusive techniques are

Abstract = {{Background There are limited studies on the automatic detection of T
   waves in arrhythmic electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. This is perhaps
   because there is no available arrhythmia dataset with annotated T waves.
   There is a growing need to develop numerically-efficient algorithms that
   can accommodate the new trend of battery-driven ECG devices. Moreover,
   there is also a need to analyze long-term recorded signals in a reliable
   and time-efficient manner, therefore improving the diagnostic ability of
   mobile devices and point-of-care technologies.
   Methods Here, the T wave annotation of the well-known MIT-BIH arrhythmia
   database is discussed and provided. Moreover, a simple fast method for
   detecting T waves is introduced. A typical T wave detection method has
   been reduced to a basic approach consisting of two moving averages and
   dynamic thresholds. The dynamic thresholds were calibrated using four
   clinically known types of sinus node response to atrial premature
   depolarization (compensation, reset, interpolation, and reentry).
   Results The determination of T wave peaks is performed and the proposed
   algorithm is evaluated on two well-known databases, the QT and MIT-BIH
   Arrhythmia databases. The detector obtained a sensitivity of 97.14\% and
   a positive predictivity of 99.29\% over the first lead of the validation
   databases (total of 221,186 beats).
   Conclusions We present a simple yet very reliable T wave detection
   algorithm that can be potentially implemented on mobile battery-driven
   devices. In contrast to complex methods, it can be easily implemented in
   a digital filter design.}},

Abstract = {{With the green economy being promoted as a path to sustainable
   development and food security within the African continent, the influx
   of agricultural land is proliferating at a rapid pace often replacing
   natural savannah forests. Where agriculture is primarily rainfed, the
   possible adverse impacts of agricultural land influx on rainfall
   occurrences in water-limited areas such as West Africa warrant
   attention. Using field observations complemented by model calculations
   in southeastern Burkina Faso, the main causes of a 10-30\% suppressed
   daytime rainfall recorded over agricultural fields when referenced to
   natural savannah forests are examined. Measurements and model runs
   reveal that the crossing of the mixed layer height and lifting
   condensation levels, a necessary condition for cloud formation and
   subsequent rainfall occurrence, was 30\% more frequent above the natural
   savannah forest. This increase in crossing statistics was primarily
   explained by increases in measured sensible heat flux above the savannah
   forest rather than differences in lifting condensation heights.}},
