Abstract = {{This paper reports polymer solar cells with a 7\% power conversion
   efficiency (PCE) based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) composites of the
   alternating co-polymer, poly{[}N-9 `'-hepta-decanyl-
   2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4',(,)7'-di-2-thienyl-2',1',3'-benzothiadiazole)
   (PCDTBT), and the fullerene derivative {[}6,6]-phenyl C-71-butyric acid
   methyl ester (PC71BM). As confirmed by transmission electron microscopy,
   solvent-vapor annealing (SVA) of the thin (70 nm) BHJ photoactive layer
   by exposure to chloroform vapor, for a short period of time (30 s) after
   deposition, leads to reconstructed nanoscale morphology of
   donor/acceptor domains, well-dispersed fullerene phase and effective
   photo-absorption of BHJ. Consequently, SVA-reconstructed devices with a
   PCDTBT: PC71BM blend ratio of 1:5 (wt\%) exhibit similar to 50\%
   improvement in PCE, with short-circuit current J(sc) = 15.65 mA/cm(2),
   open-circuit voltage V-oc = 0.87 V, and PCE = 7.03\%, in comparison to
   those of the 1:4 (wt\%) blends with SVA treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new set of reliability sensitivity measures. The
   purpose is to identify the optimal manner in which to mitigate risk to
   civil infrastructure, and reduce model uncertainty in order to improve
   risk estimates. Three measures are presented. One identifies the
   infrastructure components that should be prioritized for retrofit.
   Another measure identifies the infrastructure that should be prioritized
   for more refined modeling. The third measure identifies the models that
   should be prioritized in research to improve models, for example by
   gathering new data. The developments are presented in the context of a
   region with 622 buildings that are subjected to seismicity from several
   sources. A comprehensive seismic risk analysis of this region is
   conducted, with over 300 random variables, 30 model types, and 4000
   model instances. All models are probabilistic and emphasis is placed on
   the explicit characterization of epistemic uncertainty. For the
   considered region, the buildings that should first be retrofitted are
   found to be pre-code unreinforced masonry buildings. Conversely,
   concrete shear wall buildings rank highest on the list of buildings that
   should be subjected to more detailed modeling. The ground shaking
   intensity model for shallow crustal earthquakes and the concrete shear
   wall structural response model rank highest on the list of models that
   should be prioritized by research to improve engineering analysis
   models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Large digital chips use a significant amount of energy to broadcast a
   low-skew, multigigahertz clock to millions of latches located throughout
   the chip. Every clock cycle, the large aggregate capacitance of the
   clock network is charged from the supply and then discharged to ground.
   Instead of wasting this stored energy, it is possible to recycle the
   energy by controlling its delivery to another part of the chip using an
   on-chip dc-dc converter. The clock driver and switching converter
   circuits share many compatible characteristics that allow them to be
   merged into a single design and fully integrated on-chip. Our buck
   converter prototype, manufactured in 90-nm CMOS, provides a
   proof-of-concept that clock network energy can be recycled to other
   parts of the chip, thus lowering overall energy consumption. It also
   confirms that monolithic multigigahertz switching converters utilizing
   zero-voltage switching can be implemented in deep-submicrometer CMOS.
   With multigigahertz operation, fully integrated inductors and capacitors
   use a small amount of chip area with low losses. Combining the clock
   driver with the power converter can share the large MOSFET drivers
   necessary as well as being energy and space efficient. We present an
   analysis of the losses which we confirm by experimentally comparing the
   merged circuit with a conventional clock driver.}},

Abstract = {{A model equation was developed to predict the superficial liquid

   three-phase fluidized beds are fully supported by the liquid, the
   presence of gas bubbles in a bed reducing the available cross-sectional
   area and thereby increasing the interstitial liquid velocity. The
   superficial liquid velocity at layer inversion for the binary solids
   system selected was determined at superficial gas velocities up to 21.5
   mm/s using a mixing index. The resulting layer inversion velocity
   decreased with increasing superficial gas velocity. The experimental
   data are consistent with our model. Predicted layer inversion velocities
   are compared with experimental data obtained in this study. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper presents experimental results and a successful model for zinc
   removal from Acid Rock Drainage by adsorption on clinoptilolite. The
   experiments were conducted in a slurry bubble column of 0.09 m inner
   diameter and 1.4 m height, loaded with 100 g of clinoptilolite particles
   of diameter 0.3-1.4 mm/kg liquid. Aqueous zinc ion concentrations were
   determined before and during the adsorption tests. Zeolite was then
   regenerated by a sodium chloride solution, whose zinc concentration was
   determined against time. The Langmuir isotherm model was fitted to the
   experimental results under batch conditions to characterize the
   adsorption capacity of the solid surfaces. A global kinetic model with
   mass transfer to the particles and uptake on adsorption sites
   facilitates interpretation of the ARD slurry bubble column
   adsorption-desorption results. Due to air injection, perfect mixing
   could be assumed. The effect of particle size on the forward rate
   constant k(f) of the adsorption process is important. The model is also
   applied to the sorbent regeneration by zinc desorption to provide a
   complete description. Consistent with the model, external mass transfer
   is not rate-limiting in this adsorption-desorption process. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Water management is a major issue in the operation of PEM fuel cells.
   Two-phase flow has been commonly observed in PEM fuel cell channels from
   experiments. One of the two-phase flow patterns, the slug flow, has
   great negative impacts on the fuel cell performance. In this work, the
   impact of two-phase flow patterns, especially the slug flow, on the fuel
   cell performance was simulated using a 3D volume fluid model (VOF)
   coupling with a 1D membrane electrode assembly (MEA) model. The proposed
   model is capable of describing the two-phase flow patterns, especially
   the slug flow in the cathode side gas flow channels. The comparison of
   fuel cell performance between single phase flow and two-phase flow shows
   that the presence of slug flow decreases the cell voltage output in the
   mass transport region, but has little effect in the kinetic and ohmic
   region. However, the slug flow causes great increase of overall pressure
   drop, which should be avoided during the PEM fuel cell operation.
   Effects of gas stoichiometric flow ratios on the fuel cell performance
   were then simulated. Increasing the gas flow rate significantly broadens
   the ohmic region, enabling the fuel cell to be operated at higher
   current densities. However, given a fixed current density during fuel
   cell operation, too high a gas flow rate will result in high pressure
   drops with little improvement in the fuel cell performance. Changing
   channel wall or MEA surface wettability also has great impact on the PEM
   fuel cell performance and two-phase flow pattern in the channel. Using a
   more hydrophobic MEA surface is helpful to extend the ohmic region and
   increase PEM fuel cell performance. Using too hydrophilic or too
   hydrophobic channel wall is not recommended, since either reduces the
   cell output voltage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ergodic capacity is investigated for the optical wireless communications
   employing subcarrier intensity modulation with direct detection, and
   coherent systems with and without polarization multiplexing over the
   Gamma-Gamma turbulence channels. We consider three different adaptive
   transmission schemes: (i) variable-power, variable-rate adaptive
   transmission, (ii) complete channel inversion with fixed rate, and (iii)
   truncated channel inversion with fixed rate. For the considered systems,
   highly accurate series expressions for ergodic capacity are derived
   using a series expansion of the modified Bessel function and the Mellin
   transformation of the Gamma-Gamma random variable. Our asymptotic
   analysis reveals that the high SNR ergodic capacities of coherent,
   subcarrier intensity modulated, and polarization multiplexing systems
   gain 0.33 bits/s/Hz, 0.66 bits/s/Hz, and 0.66 bits/s/Hz respectively
   with 1 dB increase of average transmitted optical power. Numerical
   results indicate that a polarization control error less than 10 degrees
   has little influence on the capacity performance of polarization
   multiplexing systems. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{We performed quantitative analysis of the binding kinetics and affinity
   of carbohydrate-lectin binding and correlated them directly with the
   molecular and structural features of ligands presented at the nanoscale
   within the glycocalyx mimicking layers on surfaces. The surface plasmon
   resonance analysis identified that the mode of binding changed from
   multivalent to monovalent, which resulted in a near 1000-fold change in
   the equilibrium association constant, by varying the spatial
   distribution of carbohydrate ligands within the surface-grafted polymer
   layer. We identified, for the first time, that the manner in which the
   ligands presented on the surface has great influence on the binding at
   the first stage of bivalent chelating, not on the binding at the second
   stage. The rupture forces measured by atomic force microscope force
   spectroscopy also indicated that the mode of binding between lectin and
   ligands changed from multiple to single with variation in the ligand
   presentation. The dependence of lectin binding on the glycopolymer
   composition and grafting density is directly correlated with the
   nanoscale presentation of ligands on a surface, which is a determining
   factor in controlling the clustering and statistical effects
   contributing to the enhanced binding}},

Abstract = {{Tectorigenin is a major isoflavone found in the flowers of Pueraria
   thomsonii Benth. and the rhizomes of Belamcanda chinensis (L) DC. It
   possesses hepatoprotective, estrogenic, hypoglycemic and
   anti-inflammatory activities. In the present study, the plasma
   pharmacokinetic profile of tectorigenin in rats was evaluated. We
   developed a selective and accurate U-HPLC/Q-TOFMS method for the
   simultaneous characterization of nine tectorigenin metabolites, and
   quantitation of six major metabolites in rat plasma, including
   tectorigenin-7-O-glucuronide-4'-O-sulfate (Te-7G-4'S),
   tectorigenin-di-O-sulfate (Te-diS), tectorigenin-7-O-glucuronide
   (Te-7G), tectorigenin-4'-O-glucuronide (Te-4'G),
   tectorigenin-7-O-sulfate (Te-7S) and tectorigenin after oral
   administration of tectorigenin (130 mg/kg). The plasma concentrations
   reached maximal values of 6.20 +/- 2.05 mu mol/L at 0.96 +/- 0.68 h for
   Te-7G-4'S, 4.42 +/- 1.36 mu mol/L at 1.92 +/- 2.15 h for Te-diS, 33.50
   +/- 4.89 mu mol/L at 0.75 +/- 0.67 h for Te-7G, 3.28 +/- 1.01 mu mol/L
   at 0.75 +/- 0.67 h for Te-4'G, 12.80 +/- 2.80 mu mol/L at 0.85 +/- 1.54
   h for Te-7S, and 12.0 +/- 0.63 mu mol/L at 0.23 +/- 0.15 h for
   tectorigenin, respectively. Enterohepatic recirculation resulted in
   double or triple peaks concentration curve/time profiles of the
   metabolites. Since the total plasma concentrations of tectorigenin
   conjugated metabolites were much higher than that of the tectorigenin
   aglycone, an extensive phase II metabolism plays an important role in
   the pharmacokinetics of tectorigenin in vivo. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We propose a design of a novel optical metamaterial absorber that is
   broadband and independent to polarization. The absorber consists of
   opposite-handedness metallic triple-helix array. Simulated by the
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, an average absorbance of
   89.10\% is observed in the region of 0.33-1.22 mu m as well as an
   absorption peak of 97.57\% at 0.43 mu m. Compared with many existing
   planar metamaterial absorbers, this helical metamaterial absorber shows
   advantages of broadband and polarization independence. In addition, we
   systematically study the dependence of the absorptive property on its
   geometric parameters and materials. It is expected that the superior
   absorptive properties of this helical MM absorber can also be realized
   in other region of spectrum by appropriately scaling the sub-wavelength
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{An advanced version of Jones matrix optical coherence tomography (JMT)
   is demonstrated for Doppler and polarization sensitive imaging of the
   posterior eye. JMT is capable of providing localized flow tomography by
   Doppler detection and investigating the birefringence property of tissue
   through a three-dimensional (3-D) Jones matrix measurement. Owing to an
   incident polarization multiplexing scheme based on passive optical
   components, this system is stable, safe in a clinical environment, and
   cost effective. Since the properties of this version of JMT provide
   intrinsic compensation for system imperfection, the system is easy to
   calibrate. Compared with the previous version of JMT, this advanced JMT
   achieves a sufficiently long depth measurement range for clinical cases
   of posterior eye disease. Furthermore, a fine spectral shift
   compensation method based on the cross-correlation of calibration
   signals was devised for stabilizing the phase of OCT, which enables a
   high sensitivity Doppler OCT measurement. In addition, a new theory of
   JMT which integrates the Jones matrix measurement, Doppler measurement,
   and scattering measurement is presented. This theory enables a
   sensitivity-enhanced scattering OCT and high-sensitivity Doppler OCT.
   These new features enable the application of this system to clinical
   cases. A healthy subject and a geographic atrophy patient were measured
   in vivo, and simultaneous imaging of choroidal vasculature and
   birefringence structures are demonstrated. (c) 2013 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Recent density functional calculations by Kalesaki et al. {[}Appl. Phys.
   Lett. 98, 072103 (2011)] and by Takei and Nakayama {[}J. Cryst. Growth
   311, 2767 (2009)] have shown that the 5/7-atom dislocation core
   structure possesses a donor character within intrinsic wurtzite InN. In
   the present work, we relax the assumption that wurtzite InN is intrinsic
   and obtain the occupation statistics of the different possible
   ionization states of the 5/7-atom dislocation defect sites as a function
   of the bulk doping concentration. An underlying Gibbs factor formalism,
   similar to that applied earlier to the problem of obtaining the
   occupation statistics of the dislocation defect sites within n-type
   gallium nitride, has been employed for the purposes of the present
   analysis. The occupation statistics results of this analysis suggest
   that dislocation line densities below 10(10) cm(-2) are necessary in
   order to achieve bulk free electron concentrations lower than 10(17)
   cm(-3) within wurtzite InN. Our occupation statistics results are shown
   to be consistent with existing electron mobility measurements from the
   literature. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Photochemical metal organic deposition (PMOD) was used to prepare
   amorphous metal oxide films containing specific concentrations of iron,
   cobalt, and nickel to study how metal composition affects heterogeneous
   electrocatalytic water oxidation. Characterization of the films by
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy confirmed excellent stoichiometric control of each of the
   21 complex metal oxide films investigated. In studying the
   electrochemical oxidation of water catalyzed by the respective films, it
   was found that small concentrations of iron produced a significant
   improvement in Tafel slopes and that cobalt or nickel were critical in
   lowering the voltage at which catalysis commences. The best catalytic
   parameters of the series were obtained for the film of composition
   a-Fe20Ni80. An extrapolation of the electrochemical and XPS data
   indicates the optimal behavior of this binary film to be a manifestation
   of iron stabilizing nickel in a higher oxidation level. This work
   represents the first mechanistic study of amorphous phases of binary and
   ternary metal oxides for use as water oxidation catalysts, and provides
   the foundation for the broad exploration of other mixed-metal oxide
   combinations.}},

Abstract = {{Salt-tolerant perchlorate-reducing bacteria can be used to regenerate
   ion-exchange brines or resins exhausted with perchlorate. A
   salt-tolerant perchlorate-reducing Marinobacter vinifirmus strain P4B1
   was recently purified. This study determined the effects of Na+ and Mg2+
   concentrations on the perchlorate reduction rate of P4B1. The results
   showed that strain P4B1 could utilize perchlorate and grow in the
   presence of 1.8\% to 10.2\% NaCl. Lower NaCl concentrations allowed
   faster perchlorate reduction. The addition of Mg2+ to the culture showed
   significant effects on perchlorate reduction when perchlorate was the
   sole electron acceptor. A molar Mg2+/Na+ ratio of similar to 0.11
   optimized perchlorate degradation and cell growth. When perchlorate and
   nitrate were both present, nitrate reduction did not start significantly
   until perchlorate was below 100 mg/L. Tests with washed cell suspensions
   indicated that strain P4B1 had both perchlorate and nitrate reduction
   enzymes. When the culture was exposed to both perchlorate and nitrate,
   the nitrate reduction enzyme activity was low. The maximum specific
   substrate utilization rate (V-m) and the half saturation coefficient
   (K-s) for P4B1 (30 g/L NaCl) determined in this study were 0.049 +/-
   0.003 mg ClO4-/mg VSS-h and 18 +/- 4 mg ClO4-/L, respectively.}},

Title = {{An Evaluation of an Expert System for Detecting Critical Events During
   Anesthesia in a Human Patient Simulator: A Prospective Randomized
   Controlled Study}},
Journal = {{ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{117}},

Pages = {{380-391}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Perioperative monitoring systems produce a large amount of
   uninterpreted data, use threshold alarms prone to artifacts, and rely on
   the clinician to continuously visually track changes in physiological
   data. To address these deficiencies, we developed an expert system that
   provides real-time clinical decisions for the identification of critical
   events. We evaluated the efficacy of the expert system for enhancing
   critical event detection in a simulated environment. We hypothesized
   that anesthesiologists would identify critical ventilatory events more
   rapidly and accurately with the expert system.
   METHODS: We used a high-fidelity human patient simulator to simulate an
   operating room environment. Participants managed 4 scenarios (Anesthetic
   Vapor Overdose, Tension Pneumothorax, Anaphylaxis, and Endotracheal Tube
   Cuff Leak) in random order. In 2 of their 4 scenarios, participants were
   randomly assigned to the expert system, which provided trend-based
   alerts and potential differential diagnoses. Time to detection and time
   to treatment were measured. Workload questionnaires and structured
   debriefings were completed after each scenario, and a usability
   questionnaire at the conclusion of the session. Data were analyzed using
   a mixed-effects linear regression model; Fisher exact test was used for
   workload scores.
   RESULTS: Twenty anesthesiology trainees and 15 staff anesthesiologists
   with a combined median (range) of 36 (29-66) years of age and 6 (1-38)
   years of anesthesia experience participated. For the Endotracheal Tube
   Cuff Leak, the expert system caused mean reductions of 128 (99\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 54-202) seconds in time to detection and 140
   (99\% CI, 79-200) seconds in time to treatment. In the other 3
   scenarios, a best-case decrease of 97 seconds (lower 99\% CI) in time to
   diagnosis for Anaphylaxis and a worst-case increase of 63 seconds (upper
   99\% CI) in time to treatment for Anesthetic Vapor Overdose were found.
   Participants were highly satisfied with the expert system (median score,
   2 on a scale of 1-7). Based on participant debriefings, we identified
   avoidance of task fixation, reassurance to initiate invasive treatment,
   and confirmation of a suspected diagnosis as 3 safety-critical areas.
   CONCLUSION: When using the expert system, clinically important and
   statistically significant decreases in time to detection and time to
   treatment were observed for the Endotracheal Tube Cuff Leak scenario.
   The observed differences in the other 3 scenarios were much smaller and
   not statistically significant. Further evaluation is required to confirm
   the clinical utility of real-time expert systems for anesthesia.}},

Abstract = {{Bloch waves in viscously damped periodic material and structural systems
   are analyzed using a perturbation method originally developed by
   Rayleigh for vibration analysis of finite structures. The extended
   method, called the Bloch-Rayleigh perturbation method here, utilizes the
   Bloch waves of an undamped unit cell as basis functions to provide
   approximate closed-form expressions for the complex eigenvalues and
   eigenvectors of the damped unit cell. In doing so, we circumvent the
   solution of a quadratic Bloch eigenvalue problem and subsequent
   computationally intensive transformation to first order/state-space
   form. Dispersion curves of a one-dimensional damped spring-mass chain
   and a two-dimensional phononic crystal with square inclusions are
   calculated using the state-space method and the proposed method. They
   are compared and found to be in excellent quantitative agreement for
   both proportional and nonproportional viscous damping models. The
   perturbation method is able to capture anomalous dispersion
   phenomena-branch overtaking, branch cut-on/cut-off, and frequency
   contour transformation-in parametric ranges where state-space
   formulations encounter numerical issues. Generalization to other linear
   nonviscous damping models is permissible.}},

Abstract = {{Clinoptilolite is shown to be capable of removing zinc from ARD, while
   the zinc in loaded clinoptilolite is displaced by NaCl as regenerant.
   Repeated capture-regeneration cycles were tested, showing the evolution
   of uptake capacity over multiple cycles. Fresh and reused NaCl as
   regenerant were compared to explore a possible means of minimizing the
   waste volume. The results prove that uptake/removal cycles can be
   repeated several times while maintaining reasonable uptake and removal
   capacities. Three removal-only cycles after 10 full cycles continuously
   decreased the accumulated zinc in clinoptilolite, allowing the uptake
   capacity for further upcoming cycles to be recovered. When 10 full
   cycles were tested after the three removal stages, results were similar
   to those for the first 10 cycles. By reusing NaCl as regenerant, only
   one-quarter of the regenerant volume was required to achieve a similar
   total zinc uptake from ARD compared with fresh NaCl. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Distributed massive MIMO systems, which have high bandwidth efficiency
   and can accommodate a tremendous amount of traffic using algorithms such
   as zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF), may be deployed in large public
   venues with the antennas mounted under-floor. In this case the channel
   gain matrix H can be modeled as a multi-banded matrix, in which
   off-diagonal entries decay both exponentially due to heavy human
   penetration loss and polynomially due to free space propagation loss. To
   enable practical implementation of such systems, we present a
   multi-banded matrix inversion algorithm that substantially reduces the
   complexity of ZFBF by keeping the most significant entries in H and the
   precoding matrix W. We introduce a parameter p to control the sparsity
   of H and W and thus achieve the tradeoff between the computational
   complexity and the system throughput. The proposed algorithm includes
   dense and sparse precoding versions, providing quadratic and linear
   complexity, respectively, relative to the number of antennas. We present
   analysis and numerical evaluations to show that the
   signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) increases linearly with p in dense
   precoding. In sparse precoding, we demonstrate the necessity of using
   directional antennas by both analysis and simulations. When the
   directional antenna gain increases, the resulting SIR increment in
   sparse precoding increases linearly with p, while the SIR of dense
   precoding is much less sensitive to changes in p.}},

Title = {{A Joint Multimodal Group Analysis Framework for Modeling Corticomuscular

Abstract = {{Corticomuscular coupling analysis based on multiple data sets such as
   electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals provides
   a useful tool for understanding human motor control systems. Two
   probably most popular methods are the pair-wise magnitude-squared
   coherence (MSC) between EEG and simultaneously-recorded EMG signals, and
   partial least square (PLS). Unfortunately, MSC and PLS generally deal
   with only two types of data sets at the same time, while we may need to
   analyze more than two types of data sets. Moreover, it is not
   straightforward to extend MSC to the group level for combining results
   across subjects. Also, PLS can have the information mixing problem since
   only the variations in one data set are used to predict the other data
   set. To address these concerns, we propose a joint multimodal analysis
   framework for corticomuscular coupling analysis. The proposed framework
   models multiple data spaces simultaneously in a multidirectional
   fashion. Furthermore, to address the inter-subject variability concern
   in real-world medical applications, we extend the proposed framework
   from the individual subject level to the group level to obtain common
   corticomuscular coupling patterns across subjects. We apply the proposed
   framework to concurrent EEG, EMG and behavior data collected in a
   Parkinson's disease (PD) study. The results reveal several highly
   correlated temporal patterns among the three types of signals and their
   corresponding spatial activation patterns. In PD subjects, there are
   enhanced connections between occipital region and other regions, which
   is consistent with the previous medical finding. The proposed framework
   is a promising technique for performing multi-subject and multi-modal
   data analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Artisanal miners sell their gold to shops that are usually located in
   the urban core, where the mercury-gold amalgam is burned to evaporate
   the mercury that was added during ore processing. People living and
   working near these gold shops are exposed to intermittent and extreme
   concentrations of mercury vapour. In the urban centres of Segovia,
   Colombia, and Andacollo, Chile, the average concentrations measured by
   mobile mercury vapour analyzer transects taken repeatedly over several
   weeks were 1.26 and 0.338 mu g m(-3), respectively. By World Health
   Organization standards, these towns are exposed to significant health
   hazard, and globally, the millions of miners, as well as non-miners who
   live near gold shops, are at serious risk of neurological and renal
   deficits. Measurements taken in Suriname, Ecuador and Peru reveal this
   to be a widespread phenomenon with unique regional variations and myriad
   attempts at remediation. Maps of average mercury concentrations show the
   spatial distribution of the hazard in relation to residential buildings
   and schools. Measurements from towers show the temporal variability of
   mercury concentrations, and suggest that large quantities of mercury are
   available for long-range atmospheric transport. Mercury mapping in
   Segovia in 2011 suggest a 10\% reduction in airborne mercury
   concentrations over 2010, despite a 30\% increase in gold production.
   This is attributable to the adoption of retorts by miners and
   regulations banning new processing centres to the rural periphery. This
   is the first full description of artisanal mining gold shop practices
   and of the character, quantity, and remediation of mercury emissions
   within urban mining centres. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Transmit beamforming (Tx-BF) for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)

   inter-symbol interference. In this paper, we consider the optimal design
   of the Tx-BF matrix for a MIMO SC-FDE system employing a linear minimum
   mean square error (MSE) receiver. We formulate the Tx-BF optimization
   problem as the minimization of a general function of the stream MSEs,
   subject to a transmit power constraint. The optimal structure of the
   Tx-BF matrix is obtained in closed form and an efficient algorithm is
   proposed for computing the optimal power allocation. Our simulation
   results validate the excellent performance of the proposed scheme in
   terms of uncoded bit-error rate and achievable bit rate.}},

   A Contract-Theory Based Approach}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{3824-3837}},

Abstract = {{User cooperation although improves performance of wireless systems, it
   requires incentives for the potential cooperating nodes to spend their
   energy acting as relays. Moreover, these potential relays are better
   informed than the source about their transmission costs, which depend on
   the exact channel conditions on their relay-destination links. This
   results in asymmetry of available information between the source and the
   relays. In this paper, we use contract theory to tackle the problem of
   relay selection under asymmetric information in OFDM-based cooperative
   wireless system that employs decode-and-forward (DF) relaying. We first
   design incentive compatible offers/contracts, consisting of a menu of
   payments and desired signal-to-noise-ratios (SNR)s at the destination.
   The source then broadcasts this menu to nearby mobile nodes. The nearby
   mobile nodes which are willing to relay, notify back the source with the
   contracts they agree to accept in each subcarrier. We show that when the
   source is under a budget constraint, the problem of relay selection in
   each subcarrier with the goal of maximizing capacity is a nonlinear
   non-separable knapsack problem. We propose a heuristic relay selection
   scheme to solve this problem. We compare the performance of our overall
   mechanism and the heuristic solution with a simple relay selection
   scheme. Selected numerical results show that our solution performs
   better and is close to optimal. The benefits of the overall mechanism
   introduced in this thesis is that it is simple to implement, needs
   limited interaction with potential relays and hence it requires minimal
   signalling overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Second-phase particles are used extensively in design of polycrystalline
   materials to control the grain size. According to Zener's theory, a
   distribution of particles creates a pinning pressure on a moving grain
   boundary. As a result, a limiting grain size is observed, but the effect
   of pinning on the detail of grain growth kinetics is less known. The
   influence of the particles on the microstructure occurs in multiple
   length scales, established by particle radius and the grain size. In
   this article, we use a meso-scale phase-field model that simulates grain
   growth in the presence of a uniform pinning pressure. The curvature of
   the grain boundary network is measured to determine the driving pressure
   of grain growth in 2D and 3D systems. It was observed that the grain
   growth continues, even under conditions where the average driving
   pressure is smaller than the pinning pressure. The limiting grain size
   is reached when the maximum of driving pressure distribution in the
   structure is equal to the pinning pressure. This results in a limiting
   grain size, larger than the one predicted by conventional models, and
   further analysis shows consistency with experimental observations. A
   physical model is proposed for the kinetics of grain growth using
   parameters based on the curvature analysis of the grain boundaries. This
   model can describe the simulated grain growth kinetics.}},

   unifying the major steady-state analysis tools for distribution systems.
   The proposed DSSE algorithm is tested on the IEEE 8500-Node Test Feeder,

Abstract = {{Dentin is a mineralized collagen tissue with robust mechanical
   performance. Understanding the mechanical behavior of dentin and its
   relations to the dentinal structure can provides insight into the design
   strategies to achieve tooth functions. This study focuses on the
   inelastic deformation of human dentin and its underlying mechanisms. By
   combining four-point bending tests with fluorescent staining and laser
   scanning confocal microscopy, it was found that human dentin, especially
   root dentin, exhibited significant inelastic deformation and developed
   extensive microdamage in the form of microcracks prior to fracture.
   Dense and wavy microcracks spread uniformly across the tensile surface
   of root dentin, while compressive microcracks formed cross-hatched
   patterns. The presence of peritubular dentin in coronal dentin
   dramatically decreased the extent of microcracking, reducing
   inelasticity. Dentinal tubules were found to be initiation sites of both
   tensile and compressive microcracks. A unique crack propagation process
   was observed in root dentin under tension: numerous ring-shaped cracks
   formed at each dentinal tubule ahead of a growing crack tip. The advance
   of the tensile microcracks occurred by the merging of those ring-shaped
   cracks. The current findings on the microcracking process associated
   with inelastic deformation helps to understand the nature of strength
   and toughness in dentin, as well as the mechanical significance for
   structural variations across the whole tooth. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Microfluidic analysis of blood has potential clinical value for
   determining normal and abnormal erythrocyte deformability. To determine
   if a microfluidic device could reliably measure intra- and
   inter-personal variations of normal and oxidized human red blood cell
   (RBC), venous blood samples were collected from repeat donors over time.
   RBC deformability was defined by the cortical tension (pN/mu m), as
   determined from the threshold pressure required to deform RBC through
   2-2.5 m funnel-shaped constrictions. Oxidized RBC were prepared by
   treatment with phenazine methosulphate (PMS; 50 mu M). Analysis of the
   control and oxidized RBC demonstrated that the microfluidic device could
   clearly differentiate between normal and mildly oxidized (20.13 +/- 1.47
   versus 27.51 +/- 3.64 pN/mu m) RBC. In vivo murine studies further
   established that the PMS-mediated loss of deformability correlated with
   premature clearance. Deformability variation within an individual over
   three independent samplings (over 21 days) demonstrated minimal changes
   in the mean pN/mu m. Moreover, inter-individual variation in mean
   control RBC deformability was similarly small (range: 19.37-21.40 pN/mu
   m). In contrast, PMS-oxidized cells demonstrated a greater
   inter-individual range (range: 25.97-29.90 pN/mu m) reflecting the
   differential oxidant sensitivity of an individual's RBC. Importantly,
   similar deformability profiles (mean and distribution width; 20.49 +/-
   1.67 pN/mu m) were obtained from whole blood via finger prick sampling.
   These studies demonstrated that a low cost microfluidic device could be
   used to reproducibly discriminate between normal and oxidized RBC.
   Advanced microfluidic devices could be of clinical value in analyzing
   populations for hemoglobinopathies or in evaluating donor RBC products
   post-storage to assess transfusion suitability. Am. J. Hematol.

Title = {{The fate of lignin during hydrothermal pretreatment}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Effective enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass
   benefits from lignin removal, relocation, and/or modification during
   hydrothermal pretreatment. Phase transition,
   depolymerization/repolymerization, and solubility effects may all
   influence these lignin changes. To better understand how lignin is
   altered, Populus trichocarpa x P. deltoides wood samples and
   cellulolytic enzyme lignin (CEL) isolated from P. trichocarpa x P.
   deltoides were subjected to batch and flowthrough pretreatments. The
   residual solids and liquid hydrolysate were characterized by gel
   permeation chromatography, heteronuclear single quantum coherence NMR,
   compositional analysis, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
   Results: Changes in the structure of the solids recovered after the
   pretreatment of CEL and the production of aromatic monomers point
   strongly to depolymerization and condensation being primary mechanisms
   for lignin extraction and redeposition. The differences in lignin
   removal and phenolic compound production from native P. trichocarpa x P.
   deltoides and CEL suggested that lignin-carbohydrate interactions
   increased lignin extraction and the extractability of syringyl groups
   relative to guaiacyl groups.
   Conclusions: These insights into delignification during hydrothermal
   pretreatment point to desirable pretreatment strategies and plant
   modifications. Because depolymerization followed by repolymerization
   appears to be the dominant mode of lignin modification, limiting the
   residence time of depolymerized lignin moieties in the bulk liquid phase
   should reduce lignin content in pretreated biomass. In addition, the
   increase in lignin removal in the presence of polysaccharides suggests
   that increasing lignin-carbohydrate cross-links in biomass would
   increase delignification during pretreatment.}},

Abstract = {{A review of debris and mud flows occurring over the past 100 years in
   the Okanagan region of British Columbia, Canada, reveals that most
   events have been associated with late spring snowmelt, spring rains
   occurring on the snowpack or intense localized convective rain storms in
   the summer. A troubling finding is that many of the most destructive
   debris and mud flows were triggered by failure of earth dams located
   high above the valley floor. The dam failures were caused by either
   seepage-related piping or water flowing over the top of the dam. Dam
   breaches can occur on hot sunny days in the spring, when snowmelt and
   saturated ground conditions occur in the headwaters of creeks flowing
   into the Okanagan valley. The record shows that there is a risk not only
   of property damage, but also of loss of life associated with these
   events. Comparison is made to similar mud flow events in western USA.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, the separation of CH4 from low-concentration coal
   mine methane gas (30 mol \% CH4/N-2) through hydrate crystallization was
   investigated in a fixed bed of silica sand particles. The influence of
   the additive tetrahydrofuran (THF) on hydrate equilibrium conditions and
   kinetics of CH4 separation was studied as well. The incipient hydrate
   equilibrium conditions at 1 mol \% THF were determined using the
   isothermal pressure search method. It was found that the presence of THF
   significantly reduced the hydrate equilibrium conditions as compared to
   those obtained in liquid water with the same gas mixture. CH4 recovery
   in the water-saturated silica sand bed was considerably low (similar to
   12.0\%) because N-2 molecules might compete with CH4 molecules to enter
   the hydrate crystals under high pressure conditions. The addition of THF
   to the bed of silica sand particles reduced the nucleation time of gas
   hydrate formed from the 30 mol \% CH4/N-2 gas and increased the CH4
   recovery (similar to 21.4\%) significantly. The comparison of CH4
   separation between the silica sand bed and the stirred reactor in the
   presence of THF indicated that CH4 recovery was approximately the same,
   but the conversion of water to hydrate in the THF solution-saturated
   silica sand bed was largely increased.}},

Abstract = {{Several unconventional intersection designs have been proposed as an
   innovative approach to mitigate congestion at heavily congested at-grade
   signalized intersections. Many of these unconventional designs were
   shown to outperform conventional intersections in terms of the average
   control delay and the overall intersection capacity. Little research has
   been conducted to compare the performance of these unconventional
   intersections to each other under different volume conditions. This
   study evaluated and compared the operational performance of four
   unconventional intersection schemes: the crossover displaced left-turn
   (XDL), the upstream signalized crossover (USC), the double crossover
   intersection (DXI) (i.e., half USC), and the median U-turn (MUT). The
   micro-simulation software vissim (PTV Planung Transport Verkehr AG,
   Karlsruhe, Germany) was used to model and analyze the four
   unconventional intersections as well as a counterpart conventional one.
   The results showed that the XDL intersection constantly exhibited the
   lowest delays at nearly all tested balanced and unbalanced volume
   levels. The operational performance of both the USC and the DXI was
   similar in most volume conditions. The MUT design, on the other hand,
   was unable to accommodate high approach volumes and heavy left-turn
   traffic. The capacity of the XDL intersection was found to be 99\%
   higher than that of the conventional intersection, whereas the capacity
   of the USC and the DXI intersections was about 50\% higher than that of
   the conventional intersection. The results of this study can provide
   guidance on choosing among alternative unconventional designs according
   to the prevailing traffic conditions at an intersection. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Numerous thin concrete walls failed in compression during the 2010 Chile
   earthquake. Experiments on small wall elements indicate that thin
   concrete walls without tied vertical reinforcement may fail very
   suddenly at uniform compression strains as low as 0.001 due to the thin
   layer of concrete between two layers of reinforcement becoming unstable.
   A test on a wall subjected to axial compression and strong-axis bending
   demonstrated that unlike a tied column, a thin concrete wall can
   suddenly lose all axial load-carrying capacity. Nonlinear response
   history analysis of a typical Chilean high-rise shear wall building
   indicates small global drift demands and correspondingly small curvature
   and compression strain demands when subjected to the ground motions
   measured in Santiago, which explains why most buildings were not
   damaged. Nonlinear finite element analysis of a typical wall step-back
   irregularity indicates the increase in maximum compression strains due
   to a reduction in wall length is much larger than predicted by a
   sectional analysis. Based on all the results of the current study, a
   number of significant changes are proposed for the 2014 edition of CSA
   A23.3 to avoid compression failures of thin concrete walls, including
   limiting the axial compression force applied to thin bearing walls,
   accounting for unexpected strong-axis bending of thin bearing walls, and
   limiting the compression strain demands on thin concrete shear walls.}},

   Structural steel buildings are not common in Chile, due to the
   relatively high cost of material. The majority of damage to steel
   structures was observed in industrial facilities. In general, the
   structural steel buildings performed well. Limited damage was observed
   in some of the older buildings. Extensive damage was sustained by
   nonstructural elements, including masonry infill walls, suspended
   ceilings, partition walls, and architectural features. Brick masonry
   partition walls, commonly used in Chilean buildings, suffered damage
   when used in frame buildings with little drift control. The paper
   presents a summary of observed damage and a comparison of Chilean and

Abstract = {{At 12:51 pm local time on 22 February 2011, a M 6.2 aftershock of the 4
   September 2010, Darfield earthquake shook the city of Christchurch, New
   Zealand. The aftershock occurred on an unmapped fault less than 10 km
   from the city centre resulting in significant damage, particularly in
   the Central Business District (CBD). The earthquake resulted in the
   collapse of two reinforced concrete office buildings, one parking
   garage, and numerous unreinforced masonry buildings, including many
   heritage structures, leading to 185 deaths. Liquefaction was wide spread
   in the CBD and the eastern suburbs, resulting in foundation movement for
   housing and office buildings alike. Many buildings in the CBD
   experienced severe damage, some requiring demolition, necessitating
   careful controlled access to the CBD in the months following the
   earthquake. This paper summarizes the recorded earthquake shaking and
   observed damage to concrete buildings in CBD, with a specific focus on
   identifying future research and possible changes for seismic design
   practice and codes in Canada to address the Christchurch observations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a simple network consisting of a source, a
   half-duplex decode-and-forward relay, and a destination. We propose a
   new relaying protocol employing adaptive link selection, i.e., in any
   given time slot, based on the channel state information of the
   source-relay and the relay-destination link a decision is made whether
   the source or the relay transmits. In order to avoid data loss at the
   relay, adaptive link selection requires the relay to be equipped with a
   buffer such that data can be queued until the relay-destination link is
   selected for transmission. We study both delay-constrained and
   delay-unconstrained transmission. For the delay-unconstrained case, we
   characterize the optimal link selection policy, derive the corresponding
   throughput, and develop an optimal power allocation scheme. For the
   delay-constrained case, we propose to starve the buffer of the relay by
   choosing the decision threshold of the link selection policy smaller
   than the optimal one and derive a corresponding upper bound on the
   average delay. Furthermore, we propose a modified link selection
   protocol which avoids buffer overflow by limiting the queue size. Our
   analytical and numerical results show that buffer-aided relaying with
   adaptive link selection achieves significant throughput gains compared
   to conventional relaying protocols with and without buffers where the
   relay employs a fixed schedule for reception and transmission.}},

Abstract = {{Hydroxyapatite/alginate nanocomposite fibrous scaffolds were fabricated
   via electrospinning and a novel in situ synthesis of hydroxyapatite
   (HAp) that mimics mineralized collagen fibrils in bone tissue. Poorly
   crystalline HAp nanocrystals, as confirmed by X-ray diffractometer peak
   approximately at 2 theta = 32A degrees and Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy spectrum with double split bands of PO4(v (4)) at 564 and
   602 cm(-1), were induced to nucleate and grow at the
   {[}-COO-]-Ca2+-{[}-COO-] linkage sites on electrospun alginate
   nanofibers impregnated with PO4 (3-) ions. This novel process resulted
   in a uniform deposition of HAp nanocrystals on the nanofibers,
   overcoming the severe agglomeration of HAp nanoparticles processed by
   the conventional mechanical blending/electrospinning method. Preliminary
   in vitro cell study showed that rat calvarial osteoblasts attached more
   stably on the surface of the HAp/alginate scaffolds than on the pure
   alginate scaffold. In general, the osteoblasts were stretched and
   elongated into a spindle-shape on the HAp/alginate scaffolds, whereas
   the cells had a round-shaped morphology on the alginate scaffold. The
   unique nanofibrous topography combined with the hybridization of HAp and
   alginate can be advantageous in bone tissue regenerative medicine

Abstract = {{Transdermal drug delivery using microneedles is a technique to
   potentially replace hypodermic needles for injection of many vaccines
   and drugs. Fabrication of hollow metallic microneedles so far has been
   associated with time-consuming steps that restrict batch production of

   metallic microneedles with any desired height, spacing, and lumen size.
   In our process, we use solvent casting to coat a mold, which contains an
   array of pillars, with a conductive polymer composite layer. The
   conductive layer is then used as a seed layer in a metal
   electrodeposition process. To characterize the process, the conductivity
   of the polymer composite with respect to different filler concentrations
   was investigated. In addition, plasma etching of the polymer was
   characterized. The electroplating process was also studied further to
   control the thickness of the microneedle array plate. The strength of
   the microneedle devices was evaluated through a series of compression
   tests, while their performance for transdermal drug delivery was tested
   by injection of 2.28 mu m fluorescent microspheres into animal skin. The
   fabricated metallic microneedles seem appropriate for subcutaneous

Abstract = {{Spinal cord injuries are frequently accompanied by persisting residual
   compression of the spinal cord; however, it remains controversial as to
   what effect the sustained compression has on neurological damage. The
   objective of this study was to determine the influence of post-traumatic
   residual spinal cord compression on the extent and progression of tissue
   damage within a dynamic thoracic contusion rat model. Twenty-nine male
   Wistar rats were distributed into one of four groups: spinal cord
   contusion only, contusion with 40\% residual compression, contusion with
   90\% residual compression, and a surgical control group. A moderate
   injury was performed (1 mm, 700 mm/sec) with our custom University of
   British Columbia (UBC) multimechanism apparatus, and the residual
   compression groups had the impactor tip maintained at 40\% or 90\% of
   the initial impact depth (1.0 mm) for 60 min post-injury. All animals
   were killed at 3 h post-injury, when the spinal cord was harvested and
   stained for hemorrhage, neuronal damage in the gray matter, and axonal
   disruption in the white matter. The initial contusion injury immediately
   damaged tissue beneath the impactor as evidenced by rapid relaxation of
   the reaction force on the spinal cord during the subsequent compression.
   Importantly, the rostral-caudal extent of intramedullary hemorrhage was
   66\% larger after 90\% residual spinal cord compression compared to the
   40\% group (p = 0.016). Similarly, the extent of neuronal nuclei lost in
   different gray matter regions was 60-86\% greater after 90\% residual
   compression compared with 40\% (p < 0.001). Thus, a high level of
   residual compression of the spinal cord following a moderate contusion
   injury has the potential to adversely increase the extent of tissue
   damage, whereas a lower level of residual compression may have little to
   no effect.}},

Abstract = {{Slow flows of Bingham fluids through wavy-walled channels have
   stationary fouling layers if the amplitude of the wall perturbation h
   exceeds some critical value h(f). We have characterised the occurrence
   of fouling and the main characteristics of fouling layers, using Stokes
   flow computations performed extensively over the parameter space (h,
   delta, B). Fouling can occur over a range of channel aspect ratios delta
   and progressively at larger Bingham number, B. Fouling begins at a value
   of h delta that varies mainly with B: both necessary and sufficient
   conditions are given. The limit of large B appears to plateau to
   constant values of h delta. At moderate B, for h > h(f) the fluid
   appears to self-select the flowing region, i.e. the shape of the fouling
   layer, which can be partly understood via selection of a new
   length-scale for the flow in the widest part of the channel. Fouling at
   small B coincides with the onset of recirculation in Newtonian fluid
   flows. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Development of Daily Adjustment Factors for Bicycle Traffic}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{859-871}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Daily and monthly adjustment factors have traditionally been used to
   expand the estimation of daily traffic volumes into average monthly and
   average annual traffic. However, research efforts that are devoted to
   developing and evaluating these factors for nonmotorized traffic,
   especially for cycling, are currently rare. This is attributed mainly to
   the lack of extensive data that can enable reliable calibration and
   testing of such factors. This paper explores some issues related to the
   development and application of daily adjustment factors for bicycle
   traffic. Examples include the impact of grouping daily factors by
   weekday/weekend and developing weather-specific factors and factors for
   different road classes. The analysis made use of a large data set of 500
   months of daily bicycle volume data that covered 74 links in the city of
   Vancouver, Canada, for the years 2010 and 2011. Monthly average daily
   cycling volumes were estimated using different sets of factors, and the
   estimation accuracy was assessed and compared. It was found that
   developing factors for each day of the week provided similar estimation
   errors to grouping the factors for weekdays and weekends. In general,
   the best estimation results of the monthly average cycling volumes were
   achieved when using daily factors that are disaggregated by weather
   conditions. The temporal transferability of the factors was also
   evaluated by applying the factors from 2010 and 2011 to data from 2009.
   Compared to the daily factors from 2011, it was shown that the factors
   from 2010 provided slightly better estimation accuracies of the monthly
   average of daily bicycle traffic for different months in 2009. This
   demonstrates the degradation in the reliability of the daily adjustment
   factors over time, which calls for an update of these factors every few
   years. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to determine how grinding conditions
   affect the breakage rate with respect to the sample mass, major
   elements, and minerals present in siliceous goethitic (SG) nickel
   laterite. This information is helpful in determining the optimal
   grinding conditions for selective comminution and nickel upgrade. The
   kinetics of batch wet grinding of nickel laterites with feed sizes of
   2.38-1.68, 1.68-1.18, 1.18-0.85, 0.85-0.6, 0.6-0.42, 0.42-0.3, 0.3-0.21,
   and 0.21-0.15 mm were determined using a Netzsch LME4 stirred mill under
   the following conditions: 1000 rpm, 50\% charge volume, 150.0 g of
   solid. The grinding behaviour of the majority of the feed samples was
   non-first-order due to the fast breakage rate of soft minerals and the
   low breakage rate of hard minerals in the feed. Therefore, an enrichment
   of the soft mineral was obtained in the underscreen product by selective
   grinding. The effect of selective grinding on Ni upgrade was evaluated
   by looking at grinding time, feed size, and product size. Optimum
   grinding time with respect to Ni upgrade was 0.25 mm for SG nickel
   laterite samples. Generally, grinding larger particles and/or collecting
   finer product size yielded better Ni upgrade results. The effect of
   selective grinding was evaluated by the changes of the major soft and
   hard minerals for the selected samples. Selective grinding was also
   examined with respect to the major element weight ratio (e.g. Si/Ni for
   SG nickel laterite). With respect to Ni upgrade, the best result was
   achieved from the 1.18-0.85 mm feed on the -400 mesh product after
   grinding for 0.25 min. The Ni grade increased from 0.73\% to 1.30\%
   (upgrade 76.8\%), with 14.4\% Ni recovery; the Mg grade increased from
   1.30\% to 3.96\% (upgrade 205.6\%); the Si grade decreased from 28.7\%
   to 16.2\%. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{SI}},

Abstract = {{New urban planning concepts are being redefined to emphasize active
   modes of transportation such as walking and cycling. In this
   environment, a disparate mix of road users shares the same road. In
   order to address road-safety and level of service requirements for the
   different types of road-users, traffic information needs to be collected
   with high degree accuracy. The reliability and accuracy of the data
   collected can significantly affect the quality of analysis. In recent
   years, automated video analysis was established as a robust tool for
   data collection. Road-user trajectories obtained through automated
   computer vision are rich in information. They hold features that reveal
   the structure of the traffic scene and provide clues to the movement
   characteristics of the road-users. The objective of this paper is to
   present and evaluate a road-user classification procedure. The
   classification relies on the motion pattern attributes associated with
   the trajectories of each road-user type, namely, vehicles, pedestrians
   and cyclists. A novel approach for features selection is proposed where
   singular spectrum analysis (SSA) identifies the basic harmonics (speed
   variation patterns) characterizing the movement behaviors. Constrained
   based classification and spectral clustering are then applied on the
   selected features to categorize the road-users. Several case studies are
   used for the evaluation of the proposed classification. The case studies
   use real world data sets collected at a roundabout and a conventional
   four-legged intersection in Greater Vancouver, British Columbia. Very
   promising results were demonstrated and evaluated through several
   performance measures. The main benefit of this research is to apply
   classification as a first step in the activity and behavior recognition
   of road-users in traffic scenes. The proposed approach is useful as a
   complement to vision based classification, where road-users classes can
   be difficult due to partial occlusion or when the extraction of physical
   characteristics (descriptive features) of road-users does not provide
   enough details to reveal the correct type of a road-user. (C) 2013

   reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by vector-valued functions, we
   propose a domain adaptive input-output kernel learning (DA-IOKL)
   algorithm, which simultaneously learns both the input and output kernels
   with a discriminative vector-valued decision function by reducing the
   data mismatch and minimizing the structural error. We also extend the
   proposed method to the cases of having multiple source domains. We

Abstract = {{Massively multicore processors, such as graphics processing units
   (GPUs), provide, at a comparable price, a one order of magnitude higher
   peak performance than traditional CPUs. This drop in the cost of
   computation, as any order-of-magnitude drop in the cost per unit of
   performance for a class of system components, triggers the opportunity
   to redesign systems and to explore new ways to engineer them to
   recalibrate the cost-to-performance relation. This project explores the
   feasibility of harnessing GPUs' computational power to improve the
   performance, reliability, or security of distributed storage systems. In
   this context, we present the design of a storage system prototype that
   uses GPU offloading to accelerate a number of computationally intensive
   primitives based on hashing, and introduce techniques to efficiently
   leverage the processing power of GPUs. We evaluate the performance of
   this prototype under two configurations: as a content addressable
   storage system that facilitates online similarity detection between
   successive versions of the same file and as a traditional system that
   uses hashing to preserve data integrity. Further, we evaluate the impact
   of offloading to the GPU on competing applications' performance. Our
   results show that this technique can bring tangible performance gains
   without negatively impacting the performance of concurrently running

Title = {{Evaluation of the effect of information integration in displays for ICU
   nurses on situation awareness and task completion time: A prospective
   randomized controlled study}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The study measured whether nurses' situation awareness would
   increase and task completion time decrease when they used an integrated
   information display compared to traditional displays for medication
   management, patient awareness and team communication.
   Setting: The Burn Trauma Intensive Care Unit (BTICU) at the University
   Hospital, University of Utah Health Science Center, Salt Lake City,
   Utah, USA.
   Participants: 12 experienced BTICU nurses.
   Measures: Situation awareness (accuracy of the participants' answer) and
   task completion time (response time from seeing the question to
   submitting the answer) were measured using paper prototypes of both
   displays.
   Study Design: Counter-balanced (on display order), repeated-measures
   design.
   Main Results: Nurses had a higher situation awareness when using the
   integrated display, with an overall accuracy of 85.3\% compared to
   61.8\% with the traditional displays (odds ratio 3.61, P < .001, 95\%
   CI=2.34 ... 5.57). Task completion times were nearly half with
   integrated displays compared to traditional displays (median 26.0 and
   42.1s, hazard ratio 2.31, P < .001, CI = 1.83 ... 2.93).
   Conclusion: An integrated ICU information display increased nurses'
   situation awareness and decreased task completion time. Information
   integration has the potential to decrease errors, increase nurses'
   productivity and may allow nurses to react faster to a patient's
   clinical needs. Bidirectional device communication is needed for these
   displays to achieve full potential in improving patient safety. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In wireless local area networks (WLANs) made up of Extended Service
   Sets, access point (AP) selection is a key issue to improve the network
   performance and balance the traffic load. WLANs operating in the shared
   Industrial, Scientific and Medical band can benefit from the use of
   cognitive radio (CR) techniques to enable dynamic access to spectrum
   holes that are free from interference. In this paper, we propose an
   optimal Green AP Selection (GAPS) scheme, in which AP selection is
   optimized to maximize the system throughput while minimizing the energy
   consumption, for multi-rate WLANs enhanced by CRs. Different from most
   existing AP selection schemes, GAPS takes into account of the state
   transition tendency of APs and the influence of Automatic Rate Fallback
   mechanism in the Distributed Coordination Function. The AP selection
   problem is formulated as a restless bandit problem and solved by the
   primal-dual index heuristic algorithm based on first order relaxation to
   yield the GAPS scheme with the ``indexability{''} property and hence a
   low complexity. GAPS is further divided into offline computation, which
   accounts for the bulk of the computations, and online selection, with a
   low complexity to facilitate implementation. Extensive simulation
   results illustrate the significant performance improvements of GAPS
   compared with existing AP selection schemes in different scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructure evolution during the homogenization heat treatment of
   Al-Mn-Fe-Si, or AA3xxx, alloys has been investigated using a combination
   of modeling and experimental studies. The model is fully coupled to
   CALculation PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) software and has explicitly taken
   into account the two different length scales for diffusion encountered
   in modeling the homogenization process. The model is able to predict the
   evolution of all the important microstructural features during
   homogenization, including the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of
   dispersoids and alloying elements in solution, the dispersoid number
   density and the size distribution, and the type and fraction of
   intergranular constituent particles. Experiments were conducted using
   four direct chill (DC) cast AA3xxx alloys subjected to various
   homogenization treatments. The resulting microstructures were then
   characterized using a range of characterization techniques, including
   optical and electron microscopy, electron micro probe analysis, field
   emission gun scanning electron microscopy, and electrical resistivity
   measurements. The model predictions have been compared with the
   experimental measurements to validate the model. Further, it has been
   demonstrated that the validated model is able to predict the effects of
   alloying elements (e.g. Si and Mn) on microstructure evolution. It is
   concluded that the model provides a time and cost effective tool in
   optimizing and designing industrial AA3xxx alloy chemistries and
   homogenization heat treatments. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{Different water quality management alternatives, including conventional
   wastewater treatment, transportation of wastewater, flow augmentation,
   low-cost treatment with reuse, and wetlands, are evaluated by using a
   verified dissolved oxygen (DO) model for the Ravi River. Biokinetic rate
   coefficients of the Ravi River for both the carbonaceous and nitrogenous
   oxygen-demanding wastes are adjusted, keeping in view the type and level
   of wastewater treatment. The conventional activated sludge process with
   nitrification comes out to be the most expansive alternative to meet the
   DO standard of 4 mg/L. Additional treatment cost is required to maintain
   un-ionized ammonia levels < 0.02 mg/L, which corresponds to achieving
   treatment levels of 5 mg/L of DO in the river. Under critical low-flow
   conditions (i.e., minimum average seven consecutive days) of 9.2 m(3)/s,
   a flow augmentation of 10 m(3)/s can reduce 30 \% of the cost with
   conventional wastewater treatment. Transportation of wastewater from the
   city of Lahore is a cost-effective alternative with 2.5 times less cost
   than the conventional process. Waste stabilization ponds (WSP)
   technology is a low-cost solution with 3.5 times less cost as compared
   to the conventional process. Further reduction in pollution loads to the
   Ravi River can be achieved by reusing WSP effluents for irrigation in
   the near proximity of Lahore along the Ravi River. The study results
   show that, for highly polluted rivers with such extreme flow variations
   as in case of the Ravi River, meeting un-ionized ammonia standards can
   reduce the efforts required to develop carbonaceous biochemical oxygen
   demand-based waste load allocations.}},

Abstract = {{Background During closed-loop control, a drug infusion is continually
   adjusted according to a measure of clinical effect (e.g., an
   electroencephalographic depth of hypnosis (DoH) index). Inconsistency in
   population-derived pediatric pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models and
   the large interpatient variability observed in children suggest a role
   for closed-loop control in optimizing the administration of intravenous
   anesthesia.
   Objective To clinically evaluate a robustly tuned system for closed-loop
   control of the induction and maintenance of propofol anesthesia in
   children undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy.
   Methods One hundred and eight children, aged 6-17, ASA I-II, were
   enrolled. Prior to induction of anesthesia, NeuroSENSE (TM) sensors were
   applied to obtain the WAV(CNS) DoH index. An intravenous cannula was
   inserted and lidocaine (0.5 mg.kg(-1)) administered. Remifentanil was
   administered as a bolus (0.5 mu g.kg(-1)), followed by continuous
   infusion (0.03 mu g.kg(-1)min(-1)). The propofol infusion was
   closed-loop controlled throughout induction and maintenance of
   anesthesia, using WAV(CNS) as feedback.
   Results Anesthesia was closed-loop controlled in 102 cases. The system
   achieved and maintained an adequate DoH without manual adjustment in
   87/102 (85\%) cases. Induction of anesthesia (to WAV(CNS) <= 60) was
   completed in median 3.8 min (interquartile range (IQR) 3.1-5.0),
   culminating in a propofol effect-site concentration (C-e) of median 3.5
   mu g.ml(-1) (IQR 2.7-4.5). During maintenance of anesthesia, WAV(CNS)
   was measured within 10 units of the target for median 89\% (IQR 79-96)
   of the time. Spontaneous breathing required no manual intervention in
   91/102 (89\%) cases.
   Conclusions A robust closed-loop system can provide effective propofol
   administration during induction and maintenance of anesthesia in
   children. Wide variation in the calculated C-e highlights the limitation
   of open-loop regimes based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models.}},

Abstract = {{The high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) technology can produce
   therapeutic benefits in deep-seated tissues of interest, selectively and
   noninvasively. In order to control the treatment process, it is
   important to recognize the heat generation in biological tissue and the
   parameters that have an effect on temperature rising. This study
   investigates the influence of frequency and source intensity on
   temperature distribution during high-intensity focused ultrasound
   (HIFU). A nonlinear full wave equation model is simulated to compute the
   pressure field. Additionally, the absorbed coefficient of tissue is
   added to the nonlinear equations to simulate accurately the wave
   propagation in tissue with high absorbed coefficient. In addition,
   temperature distribution was solved by the Pennes bio-heat equation.
   Conclusively, frequencies in the range of 1-1.5 MHz are prescribed to
   have maximum heat absorption in the focal region. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The effects of initial microstructure and thermal cycle on
   recrystallization, austenite formation, and their interaction were
   studied for intercritical annealing of a low-carbon steel that is
   suitable for industrial production of DP600 grade. The initial
   microstructures included 50 pct cold-rolled ferrite-pearlite,
   ferrite-bainite-pearlite and martensite. The latter two materials
   recrystallized at similar rates, while slower recrystallization was
   observed for ferrite-pearlite. If heating to an intercritical
   temperature was sufficiently slow, then recrystallization was completed
   before austenite formation, otherwise austenite formed in a partially
   recrystallized microstructure. The same trends as for recrystallization
   were found for the effect of initial microstructure on kinetics of
   austenite formation. The recrystallization-austenite formation
   interaction accelerated austenization in all the three starting
   microstructures by providing additional nucleation sites and enhancing

   using the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov approach.}},

Abstract = {{Prevention of bacterial colonization and formation of a bacterial
   biofilm on implant surfaces has been a challenge in orthopaedic surgery.
   The treatment of implant-associated infections with conventional
   antibiotics has become more complicated by the emergence of multi-drug
   resistant bacteria. Antimicrobial eluting coatings on implants is one of
   the most promising strategies that have been attempted. This study
   reports a controlled release of an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) from
   titanium surface through a non-cytotoxic multilayered coating. Three
   layers of vertically oriented TiO2 nanotubes, a thin layer of calcium
   phosphate coating and a phospholipid (POPC) film were impregnated with a
   potent broad-spectrum AMP (HHC-36). The coating with controlled and
   sustained release of AMP was highly effective against both Gram-positive
   (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa)
   bacteria. No cytotoxicity to osteoblast-like cells (MG-63) was observed.
   Moderate platelet activation and adhesion on the implant surface with no
   observable activation in solution, and very low red blood cell lysis was
   observed on the implant. This multi-layer assembly can be a potential
   approach to locally deliver AMPs to prevent pen-implant infection in
   orthopaedics without being toxic to host cells. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Second harmonic generation (SHG) from the aperiodic optical superlattice
   (AOS) in considering the pump depletion is investigated. It is found the
   domain configuration designed in undepleted pump approximation (UPA) can
   also be used to achieve multiple wavelength SHGs with high enough
   conversion efficiency for an exact solution. The applicable scope of UPA
   was estimated by a relative tolerance based on the related SHG
   conversion efficiency calculated in UPA and an exact solution. Results
   reveal that the relative tolerance is solely determined by the
   conversion efficiency, and unrelated to the sample configuration, pump
   intensity, incidental wavelength and nonlinear media. A model to
   evaluate an exact solution is proposed, and it is suggested that the SHG
   conversion efficiency can be easily assessed by the developed model.
   These results can be used to provide direct guidance for practical
   application, and can also make the estimation of practical samples more

Abstract = {{Our aim was to investigate how circadian adaptation to night shift work
   affects psychomotor performance, sleep, subjective alertness and mood,
   melatonin levels, and heart rate variability (HRV). Fifteen healthy
   police officers on patrol working rotating shifts participated to a
   bright light intervention study with 2 participants studied under two
   conditions. The participants entered the laboratory for 48 h before and
   after a series of 7 consecutive night shifts in the field. The nighttime
   and daytime sleep periods were scheduled during the first and second
   laboratory visit, respectively. The subjects were considered
   ``adapted{''} to night shifts if their peak salivary melatonin occurred
   during their daytime sleep period during the second visit. The sleep
   duration and quality were comparable between laboratory visits in the
   adapted group, whereas they were reduced during visit 2 in the
   non-adapted group. Reaction speed was higher at the end of the waking
   period during the second laboratory visit in the adapted compared to the
   non-adapted group. Sleep onset latency (SOL) and subjective mood levels
   were significantly reduced and the LF:HF ratio during daytime sleep was
   significantly increased in the non-adapted group compared to the adapted
   group. Circadian adaptation to night shift work led to better
   performance, alertness and mood levels, longer daytime sleep, and lower
   sympathetic dominance during daytime sleep. These results suggest that
   the degree of circadian adaptation to night shift work is associated to
   different health indices. Longitudinal studies are required to
   investigate long-term clinical implications of circadian misalignment to
   atypical work schedules.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{Online social media is widespread, easily accessible and attracts a
   global audience with a widening demographic. As a large proportion of
   adults now seek health information online and through social media
   applications, communication about health has become increasingly
   interactive and dynamic. Online health information has the potential to
   significantly impact public health, especially as the population gets
   older and the prevalence of dementia increases. However, little is known
   about how information pertaining to age-associated diseases is
   disseminated on popular social media platforms. To fill this knowledge
   gap, we examined empirically: (i) who is using social media to share
   information about dementia, (ii) what sources of information about
   dementia are promoted, and (iii) which dementia themes dominate the
   discussion. We datamined the microblogging platform Twitter for content
   containing dementia-related keywords for a period of 24 hours and
   retrieved over 9,200 tweets. A coding guide was developed and content
   analysis conducted on a random sample (10\%), and on a subsample from
   top users' tweets to assess impact. We found that a majority of tweets
   contained a link to a third party site rather than personal information,
   and these links redirected mainly to news sites and health information
   sites. As well, a large number of tweets discussed recent research
   findings related to the prediction and risk management of Alzheimer's
   disease. The results highlight the need for the dementia research
   community to harness the reach of this medium and its potential as a
   tool for multidirectional engagement.}},

Title = {{Noisy Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation Modulates the Amplitude of EEG
   Synchrony Patterns}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 18}},
Abstract = {{Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation has been associated with numerous
   cognitive and behavioural effects, such as enhancement of visual memory
   in healthy individuals, improvement of visual deficits in stroke
   patients, as well as possibly improvement of motor function in
   Parkinson's disease; yet, the mechanism of action is unclear. Since
   Parkinson's and other neuropsychiatric diseases are characterized by
   maladaptive dynamics of brain rhythms, we investigated whether noisy
   galvanic vestibular stimulation was associated with measurable changes
   in EEG oscillatory rhythms within theta (4-7.5 Hz), low alpha (8-10 Hz),
   high alpha (10.5-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (31-50 Hz) bands. We
   recorded the EEG while simultaneously delivering noisy bilateral,
   bipolar stimulation at varying intensities of imperceptible currents -
   at 10, 26, 42, 58, 74 and 90\% of sensory threshold - to ten
   neurologically healthy subjects. Using standard spectral analysis, we
   investigated the transient aftereffects of noisy stimulation on rhythms.
   Subsequently, using robust artifact rejection techniques and the Least
   Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator regression and cross-validation,
   we assessed the combinations of channels and power spectral features
   within each EEG frequency band that were linearly related with stimulus
   intensity. We show that noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation
   predominantly leads to a mild suppression of gamma power in lateral
   regions immediately after stimulation, followed by delayed increase in
   beta and gamma power in frontal regions approximately 20-25 s after
   stimulation ceased. Ongoing changes in the power of each oscillatory
   band throughout frontal, central/parietal, occipital and bilateral
   electrodes predicted the intensity of galvanic vestibular stimulation in
   a stimulus-dependent manner, demonstrating linear effects of stimulation
   on brain rhythms. We propose that modulation of neural oscillations is a
   potential mechanism for the previously-described cognitive and motor
   effects of vestibular stimulation, and noisy galvanic vestibular
   stimulation may provide an additional non-invasive means for
   neuromodulation of functional brain networks.}},

   the Vernier effect have many attractive features as compared to the

   tunability. Here we present experimental results of a thermally tunable
   quadruple series-coupled silicon racetrack resonator exhibiting the
   Vernier effect. We thermally tune two of the four racetrack resonators
   to enable discrete switching of the major peak by 15.54 nm. Also, our
   device has an interstitial peak suppression of 35.4 dB, a 3 dB bandwidth
   of 0.45 nm, and an extended FSR of 37.66 nm. (C) 2013 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{This paper addresses on the influence of temperature, elucidated with a
   number of electrochemical methods and immersion tests, on the corrosion
   behavior of API-X100 steel in CO2-saturated bicarbonate solutions.
   Investigated by cyclic potentiodynamic polarization, the corrosion
   rates, which showed a sensible increase with 10 g L-1 (0.16 mol L-1), 30
   g L-1 (0.5 mol L-1) and 50 g L-1 (0.82 mol L-1) bicarbonate
   concentrations, increased from about 500, to 1500 and 1800 mu A cm(-2)
   at 20, 50 and 90 degrees C, respectively. Passivation at 50 and 90
   degrees C showed resistance to deteriorate against 100 ppm chloride
   ions, of which anodic 0.5 V vs. SCE peaks exclusively appeared.
   Moreover, transpassivation occurred at 0.9 and 0.7 V vs. SCE,
   respectively, unlike with the 20 degrees C cases whose
   chloride-induced-pitting-vulnerable, gradually-forming passive films
   transpassivated at 1 V vs. SCE. At different potentials, the
   potentiostatic currents increased with temperature, but their profiles
   suggested more effective passivation, accordingly. The charge transfer
   resistance, calculated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,
   decreased with temperature at the open circuit potentials and 0.6 V vs.
   SCE, where the interfacial interactions were governed by adsorption, and
   diffusion-limited processes, respectively. Crown Copyright (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A rapid technique was adopted and customized to assess the assimilable
   organic carbon (AOC) content of water for UV/H2O2 treatment
   applications. Indigenous consortium was used as inoculum and cells grown
   were counted using flow cytometry. Residual H2O2 after UV/H2O2 treatment
   was found to inhibit microorganisms' regrowth, leading to incorrect AOC
   measurement. Therefore, Catalase immobilized on a polymeric support was
   used to eliminate the residual H2O2 prior to the AOC bioassay without
   affecting the water quality and the AOC. The choice of microbial
   consortium was found to influence the result of the AOC bioassay,
   suggesting that indigenous inoculum should be used for each individual
   sample set. Three days of incubation at 30 degrees C were enough for the
   microorganisms to reach their stationary phase. Addition of minerals was
   found to be necessary, affecting the outcome of the AOC test. The method
   presented in this article will be valuable for monitoring AOC levels at
   different stages of water treatment train, especially when UV/H2O2 is
   used as one of treatment steps.}},

Title = {{An enhancement in the low-field electron mobility associated with a

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{114}},

Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{We determine the role that a two-dimensional electron gas, formed at a
   ZnMgO/ZnO heterojunction, plays in shaping the corresponding temperature
   dependence of the low-field electron Hall mobility. This analysis is
   cast within the framework of the model of Shur et al. {[}M. Shur et al.,
   J. Electron. Mater. 25, 777 (1996)], and the contributions to the
   mobility related to the ionized impurity, polar optical phonon,
   piezoelectric, and acoustic deformation potential scattering processes
   are considered, the overall mobility being determined through the
   application of Mathiessen's rule. The best fit to the ZnMgO/ZnO
   experimental results of Makino et al. {[}T. Makino et al., Appl. Phys.
   Lett. 87, 022101 (2005)] is obtained by setting the free electron
   concentration to 3 x 10(18) cm(-3) and the ionized impurity
   concentration to 10(17) cm(-3), i.e., within the two-dimensional
   electron gas formed at the heterojunction, the free electron gas
   concentration is a factor of 30 times the corresponding ionized impurity
   concentration. How this enhanced free electron concentration influences
   the contributions to the low-field electron mobility corresponding to
   these different scattering processes is also examined. It is found that
   the enhanced free electron concentration found within the
   two-dimensional electron gas dramatically decreases the ionized impurity
   and piezoelectric scattering rates and this is found to increase the
   overall low-field electron Hall mobility. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid crystals (LCs) have good load-bearing properties and the ability
   to lower friction, wear and temperature between rubbing surfaces. The
   steady flow of thermotropic flow-aligning nematic liquid crystalline
   materials was studied numerically between two concentric cylinders with
   small gap sizes. The rheological behaviour and flow characterisation of
   LCs for different inner cylinder rotational velocities and anchoring
   angles at the boundaries were also investigated. The Leslie-Ericksen
   theory was implemented to model the LC microstructures. Continuity and
   momentum equations were simultaneously solved with the microstructure
   equation. Considering the nature of the governing equations for LCs, the
   relaxation method was selected to solve this set of nonlinear ordinary
   differential equations (ODEs). The orientation angle distribution and
   apparent viscosity were presented as a function of the rotational
   velocity and shear rate. Rheological characterisation of
   N-(4-Methoxybenzylidene)-4-butylaniline (MBBA) was performed using a
   rotary rheometer and the results were compared with those of numerical
   simulations. Furthermore, it was shown that the preferred orientation of
   the molecules of liquid crystalline materials in vicinity of solid
   surfaces gives them an advantage over isotropic Newtonian fluids by
   reducing the amount of resistance torque on the inner cylinder.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a robust image watermarking based on the quantisation
   index modulation (QIM) method is proposed. Conventional QIM methods
   employ a fixed quantisation step-size that results in poor robustness of
   the algorithm. Here, the quantisation step-size in the QIM method is
   adaptively selected using a power-law function and with the aid of the
   side information, the proposed method is invariant to gain and rotation
   attack. To keep the watermark imperceptible and increase its robustness,
   the low-frequency components of high-entropy image blocks are used for
   data hiding. The analytical error probability and embedding distortion
   are derived and assessed by simulations on artificial signals. The
   optimum parameter in the power-law function is obtained based on
   minimising the error probability. Experimental results confirm the
   superiority of the proposed technique against common attacks in

Abstract = {{The chemistry and kinetics of the removal of selenium from copper
   sulfate-sulfuric acid solution by cuprous ion reduction and
   precipitation were studied. Continuous measurement of {[}Cu+) was
   carried out by potentiometric monitoring. The stoichiometry of the
   overall reaction was found to be: HSeO4- + 9.96 Cu+ aq + 7H(+) =
   Cu1.98Se + 4H(2)O + 7.98Cu(+2) at 95.1 degrees C. The reaction mechanism
   appears to be based on an initial one electron transfer to form
   intermediate Se(V). The kinetics fit the rate law: -d{[}Se-VI]/dt =
   k(1){[}Cu ](2){[}Se-VI]/k(-1)/k(2){[}Cu (2)] + {[}Cu (+)] at constant
   acidity. The values of k(1) and k\_(1)/k(2) were 0.0055 M-1 s(-1) and
   1.5 x 10(-4) at {[}H2SO4] = 100 g/L, {[}Cu+2] = 50 g/L at 95.1 degrees
   C. Rate constants are almost independent of cupric concentration at
   constant ionic strength but decrease slightly with increasing cupric
   concentration and increasing ionic strength. Activation energy of 85.5
   kJ/mol for k(1) was calculated by varying the temperature from 86.1 to
   98.6 degrees C. Cuprous selenide precipitates react with cupric ion and
   generate cuprous ion and non-stoichiometric CuxSe precipitate (1.88 < x
   < 1.94). Increasing solution acidity significantly increases the
   biselenate reduction reaction rate. An empirical correlation of k(1) =
   0.0058 {[}H2SO4](1.25) was found between the sulfuric acid
   concentrations in the range of 10 to 200 g/L and k(1). The biselenate
   reduction reaction was also investigated in the non-complexing
   perchlorate medium to study the effects of acidity and ionic strength
   without the complication of weak dissociation of HSO4- and ion pairing
   effects. Cuprous is oxidized slowly by perchlorate species. The rate of
   cuprous oxidation was first order with respect to cuprous concentration
   ({[}Cu+] = {[}Cu-0(+)] x e(-kt)). This rate equation was used to modify
   the rate of biselenate reduction reaction in perchlorate medium. An
   empirical correlation of k(1) = 0.0159 {[}H+] (0.9) was found between
   the H+ concentrations in the range of 10 to 150 g/L HClO4 and I = 4.35 m
   at 95.1 degrees C. Biselenate removal rate increases significantly by
   increasing the ionic strength of the solution. k(1) values vary from
   0.0075 to 0.0412 M-1 s(-1) in solutions containing 0 to 3 M NaClO4 at
   95.1 degrees C and {[}HClO4] = 100 g/L, {[}Cu(ClO4)(2)] = 50 g/L. Linear
   correlation between log k(1) and solution nominal ionic strength was
   obtained as log k(1) = -9.135 + 10.800 x {[}1(1/2)/(1 + I-1/2)] in
   perchlorate medium at 95.1 degrees C. Despite the results achieved in
   the perchlorate medium, biselenate removal rate decreases in sulfate
   bearing solutions by addition of sulfate based salts. This almost
   certainly has to do with decreasing free acid levels due to formation of
   bisulfate anion. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Computer simulations of the flow around a pair of two-dimensional,
   tandem circular cylinders in a flow, for Reynolds numbers in the range
   1-40, are described. Cylinder surface-to-surface separations in the
   range 0: 1 < s/D < 400 (D cylinder diameter) were considered. The
   computed wake of a single cylinder at these low to moderate Reynolds
   numbers was in surprisingly good agreement with the laminar wake
   approximation, and a simple theory is presented to explain this
   agreement. With tandem cylinders, the drag on the downstream cylinder is
   a monotonic function of the cylinder separation. The laminar wake
   approximation can be used to explain reasonably well the variation in
   drag. The drag on the upstream cylinder is also a monotonic function of
   separation distance provided that the Reynolds number is less than about
   10. For Reynolds numbers between 10 and 40, the upstream cylinder drag
   first decreases as separation increases up to a few diameters and then
   increases monotonically with separation distance.}},

   vessels and cysts}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A new approach is proposed for edge detection in ultrasound. The
   technique examines the image intensity profile for unit roots based on
   the Dickey-Fuller statistical test of stationarity. The existence of the
   unit root is a sign of nonstationarity and a possible edge. A simple
   algorithm to build a segmentation method based on this edge detection
   approach is also proposed, which is capable of delineating the perimeter
   of hollow structures such as blood vessels and cysts. In this approach,
   the radial edge profiles originating from the center of the object of
   interest are scanned for the change from stationary to nonstationary
   status. The algorithm treats the radial intensity profiles as a time
   series and uses the Dickey-Fuller statistical test along the radii to
   find the location at which the profile becomes nonstationary. A priori
   criteria for edge continuity, shape, and size of the object of interest
   are applied to enhance the stability of the algorithm. The accuracy is
   demonstrated on simulated ultrasound. Further, the method is examined on
   two different image sets of blood vessels and validated based on
   contours marked by experts. The worst case distance from expert contours
   is 1.8 +/- 0.3 mm. The average area difference between the expert and
   the extracted contours is similar to 6\% and similar to 4\% of the
   vessel area in the two datasets. The proposed segmentation method is
   also compared to segmentation using active contours on ultrasound images
   of breast and ovarian cysts and shown to be accurate and stable. (C)

   Passage and blockage}},
Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Malaria-infected red blood cells (iRBCs) become less deformable with the
   progression of infection and tend to occlude microcapillaries. This
   process has been investigated in vitro using microfluidic channels. The
   objective of this paper is to provide a quantitative basis for
   interpreting the experimental observations of iRBC occlusion of
   microfluidic channels. Using a particle-based model for the iRBC, we
   simulate the traverse of iRBCs through a converging microfluidic channel
   and explore the progressive loss of cell deformability due to three
   factors: the stiffening of the membrane, the reduction of the cell's
   surface-volume ratio, and the growing solid parasites inside the cell.
   When examined individually, each factor tends to hinder the passage of
   the iRBC and lengthen the transit time. Moreover, at sufficient
   magnitude, each may lead to obstruction of narrow microfluidic channels.
   We then integrate the three factors into a series of simulations that
   mimic the development of malaria infection through the ring,
   trophozoite, and schizont stages. These simulations successfully
   reproduce the experimental observation that with progression of
   infection, the iRBC transitions from passage to blockage in larger and
   larger channels. The numerical results suggest a scheme for quantifying
   iRBC rigidification through microfluidic measurements of the critical
   pressure required for passage. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Field data and a forced, modal-based, two-layer, variable-cross-section
   model (TLVC) were used to examine the baroclinic response to wind in a
   large multibasin reservoir, Nechako Reservoir (British Columbia,
   Canada). The TLVC showed that most of the thermocline deflections at the
   dam could be accounted for by considering the first two basins upstream
   of the dam, Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes, and that the thermocline
   deflections were dominated by the first (H1) and second (H2) horizontal
   baroclinic modes of the combined basins. Calibration of the TLVC against
   the field data showed that the H1 and H2 modes were strongly damped,
   with effectively no free thermocline oscillations. This strong damping
   had two effects: high coherence between the wind and thermocline
   deflections and phase lags between thermocline deflections at different
   locations. The damping in Nechako Reservoir is stronger than in many
   lakes, and results from both high velocities within the geometric
   constriction between Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes and drag due to
   submerged trees, which cover 30\% of the bed. Our study provides a
   picture of overdamped baroclinic response and shows how useful
   information about the baroclinic response in complex bathymetries can be
   obtained using relatively simple tools such as the TLVC.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Wireless sensor nodes are usually densely deployed to completely cover
   (monitor) a set of targets. Consequently, redundant sensor nodes that
   are not currently needed in the covering task can be powered off to
   conserve energy. These sensors can take over the covering task later to
   prolong network lifetime. The coverage problem, concerns picking up a
   set of working sensors that collectively meet the coverage requirements.
   The problem is complicated by the possibility that targets may have
   different coverage requirements while sensor nodes may have different
   amounts of energy. This article proposes a game-theoretic approach to
   the coverage problem, where each sensor autonomously decides its state
   with a simple rule based on local information. We give rigorous proofs
   to show stability, correctness, and efficiency of the proposed game.
   Implementation variants of the game consider specific issues, such as
   game convergence time and different amounts of sensor energy. Simulation
   results show significant improvement in network lifetime by the proposed
   approach when compared with representative alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate a variable-rate, constant-power adaptive subcarrier
   intensity modulation employing M-ary phase shift keying and rectangular
   quadrature amplitude modulation for optical wireless communication over

   efficient utilization of optical wireless communication channel capacity
   by adapting the modulation order according to the received

   requirement. Novel closed-form series solutions are presented for the
   achievable spectral efficiency, average bit-error rate, and outage
   probability using a series expansion approach of the modified Bessel
   function. In addition, asymptotic bit-error rate and outage probability
   analyses are presented. Our asymptotic bit-error rate analysis shows
   that the diversity order of both non-adaptive and adaptive systems
   depends only on the smaller channel parameter of the Gamma-Gamma
   turbulence. Numerical results demonstrate high accuracy of our series
   solutions with finite number of terms and improved spectral efficiency
   achieved by the adaptive systems without increasing the transmitter
   power or sacrificing bit-error rate requirements.}},

Abstract = {{A technique for implementing monolithic resistors with a desired
   temperature coefficient (TC) over a wide temperature range is
   introduced. A typical monolithic resistor consists of a core resistive
   layer terminated with contact layers on each end. In a typical process,
   there are core resistive layers that have TCs with opposite sign of that
   of the contacts. The authors propose to take advantage of this property
   and distribute a certain number of contacts across the core resistor to
   achieve a desired overall TC for monolithic resistors. This TC can be
   negative, zero or positive. The methodologies for designing such
   resistors are presented. As a proof-of-concept, several resistor
   structures have been designed and implemented in a 0.13 mu m
   complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology. The simulation and
   measurement results over the temperature range of 25-200 degrees C
   confirm the validity of the proposed technique.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of process conditions on fibrillation and mechanical
   properties of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) paste extrudates have been
   studied using capillary rheometers having barrels of different diameter
   and equipped with capillary dies of various designs. The tensile
   strength of PTFE extrudates is measured as a function of apparent shear
   rate (flow rate), reduction ratio (cross sectional area of barrel to
   that of die), contraction angle, and diameter of the barrel. To describe
   the effects of die design on the quality of the final product, a basic
   phenomenological mathematical model has been developed. The model
   consists of a simple equation that explains fibril formation, due to the
   compression of PTFE resins, plus a kinetic equation, which is coupled
   with the ``radial-flow{''} hypothesis to predict the structure and the
   tensile strength of extrudates. The model predictions are found to be
   consistent with tensile strength measurements and SEM micrographs of the
   PTFE extrudates.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents newly obtained mechanical response data for AISI
   304L stainless steel at high temperatures. These data are necessary for
   performing thermo-structural analysis of heating processes. Applications
   include manufacturing processes such as welding where previously

   compression tests using a Gleeble 3500 test machine at temperatures
   ranging from 293K (20 degrees C) to 1,500K (1,227 degrees C) with low
   strain rates. Elevated temperature true stress-strain curves are
   provided with proposed coinciding bilinear response models. Dynamic
   recrystallisation at high temperatures was observed but is expected to
   have negligible effects on the mechanical behaviour for small

Abstract = {{We present an analytical model relating FPGA architectural parameters to
   the routability of the FPGA. The inputs to the model include the channel
   width and the connection and the switch block flexibilities. The output
   is an estimate of the proportion of nets in a large circuit that can be
   expected to be successfully routed on the FPGA. We assume that the
   circuit is routed to the FPGA using a single-step combined
   global/detailed router. We show that the model correctly predicts
   routability trends. We also present an example application to
   demonstrate that this model may be a valuable tool for FPGA architects.
   When combined with the earlier works on analytical modeling, our model
   can be used to quickly predict the routability without going through any
   stage of an expensive CAD flow. We envisage that this model will benefit
   FPGA architecture designers and vendors to quickly evaluate FPGA routing

Abstract = {{Reliable high-temperature CMOS oscillators are required for clock or
   time-base generation in several applications including data acquisition
   for aerospace, automotive control, oil field instrumentation, and pulp
   and paper digesters. In this paper, we present low-complexity resistive
   and capacitive temperature-compensation techniques for CMOS relaxation
   oscillators. In such oscillators, the frequency of oscillation is a
   function of a resistor-capacitor product. The resistive compensation
   technique employs a recently proposed monolithic resistor with a given
   temperature coefficient (TC) that uses contacts to adjust the TC of the
   resistor. The capacitive compensation technique is based on using a
   varactor to adjust the value of the timing capacitance over temperature
   to compensate for the high-temperature junction leakage current and to
   keep the oscillation frequency relatively constant. A prototype
   oscillator based on the proposed techniques is implemented in a standard
   0.13-mu m CMOS process and reliably operates over 25 to 180 degrees C.
   Measured results show that over the temperature range of interest the
   compensated oscillator achieves a temperature coefficient of 108
   ppm/degrees C. The oscillator along with its output drivers occupies
   7200 mu m(2) (2.3 x to 114 x smaller than state-of-the-art designs) and
   consumes 428 mu W from a 2.5 V supply. For supply variations between 2
   and 3 V, the frequency variation is +/- 1.09\%/V.}},

   solid substrate}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{We report direct numerical simulations of liquid filaments breaking up
   into droplets on partially wetting substrates. It is motivated by recent
   experiments, linear stability analyses, and lubrication-based
   calculations. The fluid flow is governed by the Stokes equations and the
   contact line motion is handled by a phase-field model, which also serves
   to capture the interfacial motion. The coupled Stokes and Cahn-Hilliard
   equations are solved using a finite-element algorithm in three
   dimensions. This avoids additional approximations of the fluid flow or
   contact line motion, and allows us to compute arbitrary contact angles
   on the substrate. We simulate both the breakup of infinite liquid
   filaments via growing capillary waves and that of finite liquid
   filaments with drops pinching off from the ends, with a focus on the
   effect of the wetting angle. In both cases, substrate hydrophobicity
   promotes breakup of the thread, and decreases the spacing of the
   daughter drops. The results show the differences in the two processes
   and in the final drop size and spacing. The development of capillary
   waves agrees well with prior linear analysis and the end-pinching
   results offer new insights into this poorly understood phenomenon. (C)

Abstract = {{In most existing handshake-based collision avoidance (CA) protocols,
   nodes in the communication range of the transmitter or the receiver are

   throughput and long transmission delay. In this paper, we utilize the
   long propagation delay in the underwater acoustic channel and the
   (possible) sparsity of the network topology, and formalize conditions
   for which a node can transmit even when it is located within the
   communication range of a node participating in a CS. We consider these
   conditions as design constraints and present a distributed CA
   handshake-based protocol, which, by jointly applying spatial and time
   reuse techniques, greatly improves channel utilization. Our simulation
   results show that our protocol outperforms existing handshake-based
   protocols in terms of throughput and transmission delay. These gains

Abstract = {{Accurate cutting force prediction is essential to precision machining
   operations as cutting force is a process variable that directly relates
   to machining quality and efficiency. This paper presents an improved
   mechanistic cutting force model for multi-axis ball-end milling.
   Multi-axis ball-end milling is mainly used for sculptured surface
   machining where non-horizontal (upward and downward) and rotational
   cutting tool motions are common. Unlike the existing research studies,
   the present work attempts to explicitly consider the effect of the 3D
   cutting motions of the ball-end mill on the cutting forces. The main
   feature of the present work is thus the proposed generalized concept of
   characterizing the undeformed chip thickness for 3D cutter movements.
   The proposed concept evaluates the undeformed chip thickness of an
   engaged cutting element in the principal normal direction of its 3D
   trochoidal trajectory. This concept is unique and it leads to the first
   cutting force model that specifically applies to non-horizontal and
   rotational cutting tool motions. The resulting cutting force model has
   been validated experimentally with extensive verification test cuts
   consisting of horizontal, non-horizontal, and rotational cutting motions

Abstract = {{Gasification process has become more attractive around the globe due to
   the energy crisis and environmental issues. An equilibrium model based
   on minimization of Gibbs energy is developed to predict the product gas
   composition of an air-blown coal gasifier. This paper further proposes a
   method for modifying the thermodynamic equilibrium model. The presented
   method includes the introduction of an approach temperature which
   corresponds to the deviation from equilibrium condition. The major
   components in produced gas, H-2, H2O, CH4, CO, CO2, and N-2 have been
   determined and compared with the pure equilibrium modelling as well as
   the experimental data. Comparison with experimental measurements
   revealed that the modification of the equilibrium model has
   significantly reduced the error in predicting the product gas
   composition. In situ CO2 capture using sorbent (CaO) is also
   investigated in order to enhance the hydrogen production and also to
   address the environmental regulations on Green House Gas (GHG)
   emissions. The effect of important process parameters on the product gas
   composition is studied and the temperature of 1200K, pressure of 1 bar,
   air ratio of 0.4, and sorbent to feed ratio of 2.2 have been predicted
   as the optimum operating conditions for the purpose of maximum hydrogen
   production. (C) 2013 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by

Abstract = {{A decision maker records measurements of a finite-state Markov chain
   corrupted by noise. The goal is to decide when the Markov chain hits a
   specific target state. The decision maker can choose from a finite set
   of sampling intervals to pick the next time to look at the Markov chain.
   The aim is to optimize an objective comprising of false alarm, delay
   cost, and cumulative measurement sampling cost. Taking more frequent
   measurements yields accurate estimates but incurs a higher measurement
   cost. Making an erroneous decision too soon incurs a false alarm
   penalty. Waiting too long to declare the target state incurs a delay
   penalty. What is the optimal sequential strategy for the decision maker?
   This paper shows that under reasonable conditions, the optimal strategy
   has the following intuitive structure: when the Bayesian estimate
   (posterior distribution) of the Markov chain is away from the target
   state, look less frequently; while if the posterior is close to the
   target state, look more frequently. Bounds are derived for the optimal
   strategy. Also the achievable optimal cost of the sequential detector as
   a function of transition dynamics and observation distribution is
   analyzed. The sensitivity of the optimal achievable cost to parameter
   and strategy variations is bounded in terms of the Kullback divergence.
   Also structural results are obtained for joint optimal sampling and
   measurement control (active sensing).}},

Abstract = {{The use of multiple relays can increase the performance of a cooperative
   communication system. A well-designed multiple-relay-assignment and
   power-allocation scheme can be helpful in reducing interference induced
   to primary users (PUs) in a cognitive radio system (CRS). In this
   correspondence, we propose a joint multiple-relay-assignment and
   power-allocation (JRAPA) scheme in shared-band nonregenerative relaying
   in CRSs. The main aim of JRAPA in CRSs is to maximize sum capacity under
   the constraint that the interference to the PUs is below their specified
   levels. The proposed JRAPA is an NP-hard nonconvex mixed-integer
   nonlinear optimization problem (NC-MINLP). We propose a greedy iterative
   JRAPA (IJRAPA) scheme for CRSs. The complexity of the proposed IJRAPA is
   quadratic with the number of relays. The effectiveness of IJRAPA is
   verified through simulation results satisfactorily.}},

Abstract = {{The potential effectiveness for long-term closure of a desulphurized
   tailings cover placed on reactive tailings at the Detour Lake Mine was
   assessed. The single-layer cover was aimed at reducing oxygen ingress
   using high water saturation to limit oxygen diffusion and consumption of
   oxygen in the cover by residual sulphide minerals. The cover was 1.0 to
   1.5 m thick and met desulphurization targets, but was coarser grained
   than the design. One-dimensional unsaturated flow and oxygen diffusion
   modelling was used to predict water content profiles, depth of oxygen
   penetration, and diffusive oxygen fluxes. Effective diffusion and
   reaction rate coefficients estimated from field data matched laboratory
   measurements. Depth to water table was identified as the most important
   factor for reducing tailings oxidation. The deeper (4 m) water tables
   measured at the cover edges led to a lower degree of saturation and
   higher oxygen flux. Finer grain size and higher air-entry values in the
   cover materials helped maintain saturation, and a capillary break (fine
   over coarse) cover reduced oxygen fluxes to <5\% of fluxes to uncovered
   tailings. The as-built cover (coarse over fine) reduced oxygen influx by
   at most 50\% and as low as <1\% of uncovered tailings.}},

Abstract = {{Registration of histopathology to in vivo magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) of the prostate is an important task that can be used to optimize
   in vivo imaging for cancer detection. Such registration is challenging
   due to the change in volume and deformation of the prostate during
   excision and fixation. One approach towards this problem involves the
   use of an ex vivo MRI of the excised prostate specimen, followed by in
   vivo to ex vivo MRI registration of the prostate. We propose a novel
   registration method that uses a patient-specific biomechanical model
   acquired using magnetic resonance elastography to deform the in vivo
   volume and match it to the surface of the ex vivo specimen. The forces
   that drive the deformations are derived from a region-based energy, with
   the elastic potential used for regularization. The incorporation of
   elastography data into the registration framework allows inhomogeneous
   elasticity to be assigned to the in vivo volume. We show that such
   inhomogeneity improves the registration results by providing a physical
   regularization of the deformation map. The method is demonstrated and
   evaluated on six clinical cases.}},

Abstract = {{The detailed switch-level models of front-end diode rectifier loads can
   be readily implemented using a number of transient simulation programs,
   such as PSCAD/EMTDC, and the toolboxes in Matlab/Simulink. To improve
   the simulation efficiency for the system-level studies, the so-called
   dynamic average models have been widely used by researchers and
   engineers. Recently, several average-value modeling methodologies for
   the conventional three-phase (six-pulse) front-end rectifier loads have
   been discussed, and the dynamic performance of several developed models
   has been demonstrated in discontinuous and continuous modes. In this
   paper, the effects of topological variations of the ac-side filters on
   the system performance are investigated. Also, the steady-state and
   dynamic impedances predicted by the average models under balanced and
   unbalanced operation are compared. The studies and analyses presented
   here extend and complement those set forth in the preceding companion
   publication.}},

Abstract = {{The power-flow (PF) solution is a fundamental tool in power system
   analysis. Standard PF formulations are based on the solution of a system
   of nonlinear equations which are computationally expensive due to the
   iterations needed. On the other hand, distribution-system (DS)
   automation algorithms should be fast enough to meet real-time
   performance. The conventional load representation, as constant P-Q,
   becomes less accurate as we get closer to the actual load's level. In
   this paper, a new load model is proposed which represents the loads'
   voltage dependency. A simple curve-fitting technique is used to derive a
   voltage-dependent load model which splits the load as a combination of
   an impedance and a current source. With this representation and some
   numerical approximations on the imaginary part of the nodal voltages, it
   is possible to formulate the load-flow problem as a linear power-flow
   (LPF) solution which does not require iterations. The approximation has
   been tested in systems up to 3000 nodes with excellent results. The LPF
   formulation is particularly important in the context of optimization
   algorithms for automated smart distribution systems. The extension of
   the technique to unbalanced distribution systems will be presented in
   future work.}},

   13-18years) undergoing primary, idiopathic scoliosis repair were
   recruited. The cardiac index and mean arterial blood pressure (median
   (IQR {[}range])) were 2.7 (2.3-3.1 {[}1.4-3.7])l.min-1.m-2 and 73 (66-80
   {[}54-91])mmHg, respectively, at baseline; 2.9 (2.5-3.2
   {[}1.7-4.4])l.min-1.m-2 and 73 (63-81 {[}51-96])mmHg following a
   5-ml.kg-1 fluid bolus; and 2.5 (2.2-2.7 {[}1.4-4.8])l.min-1.m-2 and 69
   (62-73 {[}46-85])mmHg immediately after turning prone. Turning prone
   resulted in a median reduction in cardiac index of 0.5l.min-1.m-2 (95\%
   CI 0.3-0.7l.min-1.m-2, p=0.001), or 18.5\%, with a large degree of
   inter-subject variability (+10.3\% to -40.9\%). The changes in mean
   arterial blood pressure were not significant. Strategies to predict,
   prevent and treat decreases in cardiac index need to be developed.}},

Abstract = {{Time-dependent isochoric formation of methane hydrate was investigated
   in the presence of low-dose poly(ethylene oxides) (PEOs). The effect of
   different molecular weights of PEO on methane hydrate nucleation time
   and storage capacity was studied and compared. Kinetic measurements
   revealed a dual effect of PEO, including inhibition and stabilization
   effects, on methane hydrate formation. The nature and type of the effect
   arises from the difference in molecular weights and concentration ranges
   of PEOs. These parameters directly affect the nucleation time and
   storage capacity of methane hydrate. Generally, in comparison with pure
   water, PEO improved the storage capacity of methane hydrate. PEO
   (1000kD) at a concentration of 0.5wt\% exhibits a significant kinetic
   inhibitory performance. However, it was an efficient low-dosage hydrate
   stabilizer at a concentration of 0.25wt\%, along with producing gas-rich
   methane hydrate suitable for gas fuel storage and transportation.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel method for estimating respiratory rate in real time
   from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) obtained from pulse oximetry. Three
   respiratory-induced variations (frequency, intensity, and amplitude) are
   extracted from the PPG using the Incremental-Merge Segmentation
   algorithm. Frequency content of each respiratory-induced variation is
   analyzed using fast Fourier transforms. The proposed Smart Fusion method
   then combines the results of the three respiratory-induced variations
   using a transparent mean calculation. It automatically eliminates
   estimations considered to be unreliable because of detected presence of
   artifacts in the PPG or disagreement between the different individual
   respiratory rate estimations. The algorithm has been tested on data
   obtained from 29 children and 13 adults. Results show that it is
   important to combine the three respiratory-induced variations for robust
   estimation of respiratory rate. The Smart Fusion showed trends of
   improved estimation (mean root mean square error 3.0 breaths/min)
   compared to the individual estimation methods (5.8, 6.2, and 3.9
   breaths/min). The Smart Fusion algorithm is being implemented in a
   mobile phone pulse oximeter device to facilitate the diagnosis of severe
   childhood pneumonia in remote areas.}},

Abstract = {{Corticomuscular coupling analysis, i.e., examining the relations between
   simultaneously recorded brain (e. g., electroencephalography-EEG) and
   muscle (e. g., electromyography-EMG) signals, is a useful tool for
   understanding aspects of human motor control. Traditionally, the most
   popular method to assess corticomuscular coupling has been the pairwise
   magnitude-squared coherence (MSC) between EEG and concomitant EMG
   recordings. In this paper, we propose assessing corticomuscular coupling
   by combining partial least squares (PLS) and independent component
   analysis (ICA), which addresses many of the limitations of MSC, such as
   difficulty in robustly assessing group inference and relying on the
   biologically implausible assumption of pairwise interaction between
   brain and muscle recordings. In the proposed framework, response
   relevance and statistical independence are jointly incorporated into a
   multiobjective optimization function to meaningfully combine the goals
   of PLS and ICA under the same mathematical umbrella. Simulations,
   performed under realistic assumptions, illustrated the utility of such
   an approach. The method was extended to address intersubject variability
   to robustly discover common corticomuscular coupling patterns across
   subjects. We then applied the proposed framework to concurrent EEG and
   EMG data collected in a Parkinson's disease (PD) study. The results from
   applying the proposed technique revealed temporal components in the EEG
   and EMG that were significantly correlated with one another. In addition
   to the expected motor areas, the corresponding spatial activation
   patterns demonstrated enhanced occipital connectivity in PD subjects,
   consistent with previous studies suggesting that PD subjects rely
   excessively on visual information to counteract the deficiency in being
   able to generate internal commands from their affected basal ganglia.}},

Abstract = {{This study reviewed evidence regarding the effect of motivational
   rehabilitation interventions on outcomes in children with cerebral

   2012. Included studies measured the purported motivating effects of
   motor-based rehabilitation interventions and the measured impact on
   outcomes. The American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental
   Medicine (AACPDM) systematic review methodology was used as a framework.
   Eight studies evaluated outcomes of studies using virtual reality
   interventions and one in a functional therapy context. Conflicting
   evidence from three (level II and level III) studies exists about the
   impact of these motivating interventions on motor outcomes measured in
   body functions. No statistical evidence regarding activity and
   participation outcomes exists. A single level II study found no
   significant difference in participants' motivation between motivational
   and conventional interventions. This review revealed a paucity of
   research on the effects of motivational interventions. Weaknesses
   include a lack of consistency in the examination of motivational
   interventions, limited use of definitions or theories to ground the
   concept of motivation, and reliance on non-validated methodological
   tools. This body of evidence would be strengthened by the use and
   development of robust outcome measures of motivation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an automated classification approach to road users.
   The main motivation behind road-user classification in the context of
   safety stems from the necessity to learn traffic scenarios and
   understand patterns within each road-user class. The end goal in the
   analysis is to identify and learn scenarios that may contribute to
   hazards in traffic conditions. The classification relies on video data
   (movement trajectories) collected in urban intersections. The approach
   is based on the discrimination of the shapes of the speed profiles of
   each road-user type, more precisely, the discrimination between the
   speed movement patterns of vehicles and the ambulatory characteristics
   of pedestrians. The collected movement-trajectory data are represented
   as time series. The classification is performed using singular value
   decomposition and reconstruction of the time series. Two complementary
   methods are proposed based on the quality evaluation (correlation score)
   of the reconstructed trajectories. In the first method, a
   threshold-based decision procedure is applied. This approach is
   complemented in the second method by a semisupervised classification
   procedure guided by movement prototypes. The approach is validated on
   real-world data collected in Oakland, California. A correct
   classification of around 90\% was achieved using both methods.}},

Abstract = {{The multiaxial deformation of magnesium alloys is important for
   developing reliable, robust models for both the forming of components
   and also analysis of in-service performance of structures, for example,
   in the case of crash worthiness. The current study presents a
   combination of unique biaxial experimental tests and biaxial crystal
   plasticity simulations using a visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC)
   formulation conducted on a relatively weak AZ80 cast texture. The
   experiments were conducted on tubular samples which are loaded in axial
   tension or compression along the tube and with internal pressure to
   generate hoop stresses orthogonal to the axial direction. The results
   were analyzed in stress and strain space and also in terms of the
   evolution of crystallographic texture. In general, it was found that the
   VPSC simulations matched well with the experiments. However, some
   differences were observed for cases where basal aOE (c) a > slip and
   extension twinning were in close competition such as in the biaxial
   tension quadrant of the plastic potential. The evolution of texture
   measured experimentally and predicted from the VPSC simulations was
   qualitatively in good agreement. Finally, experiments and VPSC
   simulations were conducted on a second AZ80 material which had a
   stronger initial texture and a higher level of mechanical anisotropy. In

Abstract = {{Underwater acoustic localization (UWAL) is a key element in most
   underwater communication applications. The absence of GPS as well as the
   signal propagation environment makes UWAL similar to indoor
   localization. However, UWAL poses additional challenges. The propagation
   speed varies with depth, temperature, and salinity, anchor and
   unlocalized (UL) nodes cannot be assumed time-synchronized, and nodes
   are constantly moving due to ocean currents or self-motion. Taking these
   specific features of UWAL into account, in this paper, we describe a new
   sequential algorithm for joint time-synchronization and localization for
   underwater networks. The algorithm is based on packet exchanges between
   anchor and UL nodes, makes use of directional navigation systems
   employed in nodes to obtain accurate short-term motion estimates, and
   exploits the permanent motion of nodes. Our solution also allows
   self-evaluation of the localization accuracy. Using simulations, we
   compare our algorithm to two benchmark localization methods as well as
   to the Cramer-Rao bound (CBR). The results demonstrate that our
   algorithm achieves accurate localization using only two anchor nodes and
   outperforms the benchmark schemes when node synchronization and
   knowledge of propagation speed are not available. Moreover, we report
   results of a sea trial where we validated our algorithm in open sea.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are aimed at combining the physical system
   with the cyber ones to provide a better control and improve the
   management of physical systems around us. Recently, the CPS and its
   applications, e.g., health-care and smart grid, have gained attention of
   the research community. In this paper, we consider the privacy aspect of
   users in a CPS, particularly in smart grid system as our use-case, and
   provide a mechanism that utilizes the advances in network coding to
   maintain data privacy. We address privacy issues associated with
   gathering metering information of clients in a smart grid system. In
   smart grid systems, wireless multi-hop communications are mainly used to
   gather metering information through exchanging data and control messages
   between smart meters and the utility. We argue that any communication
   paradigm used in a smart grid should support all aspects of privacy such
   as anonymity, unlinkability, unobservablity, and undetectablity. We
   propose innovative schemes for traffic routing and encryption that
   benefit from the enhanced network coding technology. Our analysis shows
   that our schemes maintain privacy of users despite the possibility of
   detecting metering data by an adversary. In addition, our scheme has
   extra favorable features such as less computation complexity, reliable,
   and robust communication.}},

   changed to the nickel crystal, nickel phosphide (Ni3P) and silicide
   compounds (NixSiy) with heat treatment. Addition of the SiC
   concentration in the coating bath affected both composition and
   morphology of the coating. Presence of SiC nanoparticles in the Ni-P
   coating enhanced the corrosion resistance of the coating. Higher SiC
   contents, however, negatively affected the corrosion behavior of the
   coatings. Heat treatment also improved the corrosion resistance of the
   Ni-P-SiC coating. Annealing at 400 degrees C decreased the corrosion

Abstract = {{Three exhaust brakes (ductile iron) were sampled and characterized; new
   never used (as received), working and failed. The results of optical
   microscopy indicated that the surface microstructure of the failed
   sample was different from the working and as-received samples whereas
   bulk microstructures were similar. Elements such as Ca, Mn, Fe, Si, S,
   and 0 were detected on the surface of the failed sample using
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental analysis. X-ray
   maps of the base metal/corrosion product interface showed that a thin
   layer rich in Si existed underneath the bulk product layer. The X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) pattern revealed that the amount of oxide formed on
   the shaft of the failed sample was much more than that of the working
   sample, which was indicative of higher temperatures experienced by the
   failed sample. In addition, the XRD results showed that the corrosion
   product that formed on the surface of the housing for the working sample
   was mostly Si-containing products, whereas the housing surface of the
   failed sample was covered with iron oxide. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{97-103}},

Abstract = {{Hydrate crystallization technology is one of the novel approaches for
   capturing carbon dioxide from flue gases. The presence of impurities
   such as SO2, NO2, H2S can influence the CO2 hydrate formation process.
   In the present work the impact of SO2 on hydrate equilibrium was
   investigated using the isothermal pressure search method. The hydrate
   equilibrium shifted to low pressures and high temperatures in the
   presence of small amount SO2. For example the hydrate formation pressure
   shifted from 7.7 MPa to 7.25 MPa at 273.75 K. In addition, the presence
   of SO2 enhanced the initial hydrate formation rate and final moles of
   gas consumed 16 h after the hydrate nucleation. The CO2 and SO2 gases
   were preferentially incorporated into the hydrate phase. The presence of
   SO2 helps the thermodynamics and kinetics of the hydrate formation
   process. Therefore complete removal of this SO2 impurity is not
   necessary; in fact it aids both thermodynamically and kinetically for
   hydrate formation, which indeed is a positive factor for the capture and
   geological sequestration of CO2 in the form of hydrates. The addition of
   THF reduces the CO2/N-2/SO2 hydrate formation conditions (from 7.25 MPa
   to 0.15 MPa at 273.75 K), which is practically important for reducing
   high compression costs. Moreover, the presence of THF decreases the
   hydrate nucleation time but reduces the hydrate formation rate
   significantly. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this work, Cu-Co-gadolinia doped ceria (GDC) anode coatings were

   Based on screening tests, optimized plasma energy conditions were

   mixing ratios were determined to produce anode coatings with Cu-Co
   weight ratios of Cu(100)-Co(0), Cu(90)-Co(10), Cu(70) -Co(30), and
   Cu(50)-Co(50), with 40 vol\% of metal phases in the coating and 60 vol\%
   of GDC. After reduction of the coatings, porosity and gas permeability
   were determined. Finally, carbon deposition behavior was examined by
   measuring the weight gain of the coatings after exposure to CH4 at 700

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Infrastructure risk management practices enable decision-makers to
   effectively monitor and assess structural condition for
   repairing/replacing elements before major damage or collapse state is
   reached. Improved techniques have enhanced inspection and monitoring of
   infrastructure, but assessment and interpretation of the collected data
   remains a challenge. In this article, a hierarchical evidential
   reasoning (HER) framework is proposed for the condition assessment of
   bridges. The approach involves using a HER framework for classifying
   bridge data into primary, secondary, tertiary and life safety-critical
   elements. The proposed HER framework combines different distress
   indicators (bodies of evidence) at different hierarchical levels. The
   information is aggregated using DempsterShafer (DS) and Yager rule of
   combination to propagate both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties
   throughout the model. Furthermore, importance and reliability factors
   (collectively termed credibility factor') are introduced for discounting
   evidence based on importance of bridge element and reliability of the

   sedimentation plays an important role in materials integrity and water
   chemistry of heat exchangers, particularly in the nuclear industry.
   Fouling detection and monitoring is a key strategy for both water
   chemistry and corrosion control. A new experimental method for the
   detection of magnetite particles at temperatures up to 473 K is
   presented here. An electromagnetic glassy carbon (GC) electrode was
   employed to collect the magnetite particles (0.25-10 mg dm(-3)) from the
   suspension solution. It was observed that by applying a magnetic field
   of 0.75 T perpendicular to the GC surface and tracking the variation of
   the electrical double layer (EDL) capacitance one can estimate the mass
   load on the surface of the electrode. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Study Design. A biomechanical human cadaveric study.
   Objective. To create a biomechanical model of low-grade degenerative
   lumbar spondylolisthesis (DLS), defined by anterior listhesis, for
   future testing of spinal instrumentation.
   Summary of Background Data. Current spinal implants are used to treat a
   multitude of conditions that range from herniated discs to degenerative
   diseases. The optimal stiffness of these instrumentation systems for
   each specific spinal condition is unknown. Ex vivo models representing
   degenerative spinal conditions are scarce in the literature. A model of
   DLS for implant testing will enhance our understanding of implant-spine
   behavior for specific populations of patients.
   Methods. Four incremental surgical destabilizations were performed on 8
   lumbar functional spinal units. The facet complex and intervertebral
   disc were targeted to represent the tissue changes associated with DLS.
   After each destabilization, the specimen was tested with: (1) applied
   shear force (-50 to 250 N) with a constant axial compression force (300
   N) and (2) applied pure moments in flexion-extension, lateral bending
   and axial rotation (+/- 5 Nm). Relative motion between the 2 vertebrae
   was tracked with a motion capture system. The effect of specimen
   condition on intervertebral motion was assessed for shear and
   flexibility testing.
   Results. Shear translation increased, specimen stiffness decreased and
   range of motion increased with specimen destabilization P < 0.0002). A
   mean anterior translation of 3.1 mm (SD 1.1 mm) was achieved only after
   destabilization of both the facet complex and disc. Of the 5 specimen
   conditions, 3 were required to achieve grade 1 DLS: (1) intact, (3) a
   4-mm facet gap, and (5) a combined nucleus and annulus injury.
   Conclusion. Destabilization of both the facet complex and disc was
   required to achieve anterior listhesis of 3.1 mm consistent with a grade
   1 DLS under an applied shear force of 250 N. Sufficient listhesis was
   measured without radical specimen resection. Important anatomical
   structures for supporting spinal instrumentation were preserved such
   that this model can be used in future to characterize behavior of novel
   instrumentation prior to clinical trials.}},

Journal = {{SURFACE \& COATINGS TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{224}},

Abstract = {{Alumina coatings were applied to Pb(Zr,Ti)O-3 plates using the sol-gel
   technique, to explore the possibilities of decreasing the H-2 damage to
   PZT. The coating process development cycle included dip coating in 10
   wt.\% boehmite sol and firing at 450 degrees C in air for 5 h. The
   functionality of the coatings against hydrogen damage was evaluated
   using water electrolysis in 0.1 M NaOH solution, with a constant current
   density of 100 mA/cm(2) and 7-10 V. Significant reduction of the
   hydrogen damage was observed even though the coatings were highly
   porous. The mechanism by which the porous alumina coating decreases the
   hydrogen damage is tentatively proposed as prevention of the access of
   atomic hydrogen to the surface of PZT. Through this mechanism the porous
   coatings promote recombination of hydrogen atoms into hydrogen molecules
   on the electrode surface and within the pores of the coating, which
   prevents the access of the damaging atomic hydrogen to the surface of
   PZT. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   isotherms were obtained separately from the fixed bed adsorption

   performance in fluidized beds could be improved by reducing particle
   size and the superficial gas velocity. The model was also applied to

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric actuators are often modeled as a lumped mass system in the
   mechanical domain and as a capacitive element in the electrical domain.
   Based on a real-time capacitance measurement, it is observed that the
   piezoelectric capacitance is a function of voltage. This leads to a
   modification of the traditional piezoelectric actuator model where the
   capacitance is usually considered constant. A voltage-dependent
   capacitance term is introduced in the constitutive equations in the
   electrical domain, and it is demonstrated that this term satisfies a
   power balance. Then, a novel parameter identification technique is
   proposed for the modified constitutive equations. The advantage of this
   identification technique lies in its simplicity that requires only a
   single experiment to identify all pertinent model parameters. In
   addition, the hysteresis voltage is conveniently extracted from the
   applied voltage for a large frequency range. In comparison to the
   traditional parameter identification procedure and electromechanical

Abstract = {{In this study, the effect of presence and distribution of masonry infill
   walls on the mid-rise steel frame structures having soft ground storey
   was evaluated by implementing finite element (FE) methods. Masonry
   infill walls were distributed randomly in the upper storey keeping the
   ground storey open without any infill walls, thus generating the worst
   case scenario for seismic events. It was observed from the analysis that
   there was an increase in the seismic design forces, moments and base
   shear in presence of randomly distributed masonry infill walls which
   underlines that these design values need to be amplified when designing
   a mid-rise soft ground storey steel frame with randomly distributed
   masonry infill. In addition, it was found that the overstrength related
   force modification factor increased and the ductility related force
   modification factor decreased with the increase in the amount of masonry
   infilled bays and panels. These must be accounted for in the design of
   mid-rise steel frames. Based on the FE analysis results on two mid-rise
   steel frames, design equations were proposed for determining the over
   strength and the ductility related force modification factors. However,
   it was recommended that these equations to be generalized for other
   steel frame structure systems based on an extensive analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-based real-time
   residential load management algorithm that takes into account load
   uncertainty in order to minimize the energy payment for each user.
   Unlike most existing demand side management algorithms that assume
   perfect knowledge of users' energy needs, our design only requires
   knowing some statistical estimates of the future load demand. Moreover,
   we consider real-time pricing combined with inclining block rate
   tariffs. In our problem formulation, we take into account different
   types of constraints on the operation of different appliances such as
   must-run appliances, controllable appliances that are interruptible, and
   controllable appliances that are not interruptible. Our design is
   multi-stage. As the demand information of the appliances is gradually
   revealed over time, the operation schedule of controllable appliances is
   updated accordingly. Simulation results confirm that the proposed energy
   consumption scheduling algorithm can benefit both users, by reducing
   their energy expenses, and utility companies, by improving the
   peak-to-average ratio of the aggregate load demand.}},

Abstract = {{The tensile fracture of heterogeneous earth materials such as snow, ice,
   and rocks can be characterized by two fracture parametersthe fracture
   toughness and the fracture process zone length. The latter length scale
   characterizes the zone of microcracking surrounding a crack tip in a
   heterogeneous material. For alpine snow, these two fracture parameters
   influence the release dimensions and thus destructive potential of slab
   avalanches. In general, it is difficult to determine these parameters
   concurrently, and most experimental methods are based on first-order
   scaling laws that have considerable errors unless very large test
   specimens are used. Here we introduce a simple experimental method based
   on a higher-order quasi-brittle scaling law that has never been applied
   to snow nor any other geophysical material. We conducted hundreds of
   beam bending experiments using natural cohesive snow samples to produce
   the most comprehensive measurements to date of the tensile fracture
   toughness and effective process zone length of snow. We also adopt a new
   penetration resistance gauge to index the fracture toughness data,
   addressing a longstanding need for better proxy measurements to
   characterize snow structure. The peak penetration resistance met by a
   thin blade proved better than the bulk snow density for predicting
   fracture toughness, a finding that will improve field predictions and
   facilitate comparisons of results across studies. The tensile fracture
   process zone, previously a highly uncertain length scale related to
   avalanche fractures, is shown to be about 5-10 times the snow grain
   size, implying nonlinear fracture scaling for the majority of
   avalanches.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted as part of the development of a novel process
   for copper recovery from copper sulfide concentrates by chloride
   leaching, simultaneous cuprous oxidation and cupric solvent extraction
   to transfer copper to a conventional sulfate electrowinning circuit, and
   hematite precipitation to reject iron. Copper chloride leaching from
   chalcopyrite and bornite concentrates containing high levels of
   impurities and minor elements has been studied using a two-stage
   countercurrent leach circuit at 95 degrees C to maintain a high copper
   extraction and a low cupric concentration in the pregnant leach solution
   for subsequent copper solvent extraction. A high calcium chloride
   concentration (165 g/L or higher) was used to maintain a high cuprous
   solubility and enhance copper leaching. With 3 h of leaching time for
   each stage, at a particle size of P80 of 14 mu m, the copper extractions
   were 99.1 and 98.5 \% for chalcopyrite and bornite concentrates
   respectively while the iron extractions were 73.3 and 99\% respectively.
   The extractions of copper and iron from chalcopyrite concentrate
   decreased very slightly with increasing particle size to P80 of 30 pm
   while the extractions of copper and iron from bornite concentrate
   decreased by similar to 3.6\% with increasing particle size to P80 of 40
   pin. The concentration of Cu(II) + Fe(III) in the pregnant leach
   solution was 0.1 to 0.2 M, indicating the pregnant leach solution was
   suitable for subsequent copper solvent extraction. Sulfur oxidation to
   sulfate was 1.2-1.7\% for chalcopyrite concentrate, and 2.1\% for
   bornite concentrate. The extractions of Bi, Cr, Pb, Ag and Zn were very
   high. The extractions of Sb. As and Ni were high for chalcopyrite
   concentrate while they were low for bornite concentrate. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This study was conducted as part of the development of a novel process
   for copper recovery from copper sulfide concentrates by chloride
   leaching, simultaneous cuprous oxidation and cupric solvent extraction
   to transfer copper to a conventional sulfate electrowinning circuit, and
   hematite precipitation to reject iron. The kinetics of cuprous and
   ferrous oxidation by oxygen and cupric solvent extraction were studied
   as a function of reaction time, stirring rate, oxygen pressure and
   extractants. The concentration of Cu(I) + Fe(II) decreased linearly with
   reaction time while the copper extraction increased with reaction time.
   The rate of cuprous and ferrous oxidation increased with increasing
   stirring rate and it was proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen.
   The cuprous and ferrous oxidation by oxygen was enhanced with the
   addition of organic solution. During the simultaneous cuprous oxidation
   and cupric solvent extraction, the aqueous solution pH first decreased
   sharply with time, then remained constant and finally increased, which
   was determined by the generation of H+ ions (cupric and ferric solvent
   extraction) and consumption of H+ ions (cuprous and ferrous oxidation by
   oxygen). The iron extraction increased as the oxidation reaction
   generated more ferric ions and raised the pH to a higher value.
   Simultaneous cuprous oxidation and cupric solvent extraction is feasible

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a new Markovian model for p-persistent carrier
   sense multiple access (CSMA) systems with a finite population of
   unsaturated single-buffered terminals. Focused on the distribution of
   the number of backlogged terminals in the steady state, our model allows
   the optimal persistent probability p from the number of backlogged
   terminals, which enables us to determine the throughput upper-bound (or
   mean access delay lower-bound) of slotted CSMA systems. We compare the
   performance of slotted CSMA systems with binary exponential backoff
   (BEB) algorithm and with p-persistent protocol against the throughput
   upper-bound and examine the stability of these systems. We show how
   closely slotted CSMA systems with BEB algorithm or p-persistent protocol
   approaches the throughput upper-bound in accordance with the minimum
   contention window size or the persistent probability p. Further, we
   propose a generalized Bertsekas' (backoff) algorithm (GBA) based on
   backlog size estimation, which is a generalization of the existing
   algorithm proposed by Bertsekas, in order to achieve the throughout
   upper-bound. Our study shows that in slotted CSMA systems, the access
   fairness of BEB algorithm is worse than those of p-persistent protocol
   and GBA algorithm, while the BEB and GBA algorithms show throughput

Abstract = {{We study the displacement flow of two Newtonian fluids in an inclined
   pipe. The fluids have the same viscosity but different densities. The
   displacing fluid is denser than the displaced fluid and is placed above
   the displaced fluid (i.e., a density-unstable configuration). Three
   dimensionless groups describe these flows: a densimetric Froude number
   Fr, a Reynolds number Re, and the pipe inclination beta. Our experiments
   cover fairly broad ranges of these parameters: 0 <= Fr <= 9; 0 <= Re
   (sic) 2400; 0 <= beta <= 85 degrees. Phenomenologically, our
   experimental flow observations vary from well mixed fully diffusive
   regimes, through buoyancy-dominated inertial exchange regimes, to
   laminar viscous flows, all with varying degrees of stability. We
   characterize the different flow regimes observed in terms of the three
   dimensionless groups and provide leading order approximations to the
   velocity of the displacement front and the macroscopic diffusion in each
   regime. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Inclusion of magnetic saturation in low-order qd models of induction and
   synchronous machines improves the accuracy of system studies. Over the
   years, numerous explicit and implicit methods of representing magnetic
   saturation have been proposed in the literature, some of which find
   their use in commonly used transient simulation packages. This paper
   presents a straightforward and improved flux correction method of
   modeling saturation explicitly in classical qd state variable ac machine
   models. The approach requires limited additional information and avoids
   the need for a dynamic inductance, which is present in many other
   approaches. The method is first developed for induction machines and
   then extended to salient-pole synchronous machines as a more general
   case. Computer studies demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method
   for predicting the dynamic and steady-state cross-saturation phenomena,
   as well as its computational advantages.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed analysis and comparison is carried out for optical wireless
   communications (OWCs) with coherent and
   subcarrier-intensity-modulation-based systems, which are the two major
   implementations for detection-threshold-free operation without
   irreducible error floors. Error rate performance is studied for
   communications with binary phase-shift keying, differential phase-shift
   keying, and noncoherent frequency-shift keying over weak-to-strong
   (gamma-gamma distributed) turbulence conditions. Series-form error rate
   expressions are also derived for diversity reception schemes, including
   maximum ratio combining, equal gain combining, and selection combining.
   Based on our analysis, it is found that coherent OWC systems typically
   outperform subcarrier intensity modulation systems, with 24-30 dB
   improvements in sensitivity, mainly due to their elimination of thermal
   and background noise effects. The performance improvements of coherent
   systems are confirmed through numerical studies. The findings can offer
   significant benefits for future OWC systems that are subject to
   transmitted power limitations.}},

   utilizes an open-loop quadrature clock generator for wideband 90 degrees

   the vicinity of the nominal data rate. The quadrature data phases are
   employed for the detection of clock phase misalignment in a mixer-based
   phase detector. A proof-of-concept prototype chip that integrates the
   critical building blocks of the proposed CDR is fabricated in a 90-nm
   CMOS technology. The CDR achieves a bit error rate of < 10(-12) in

Abstract = {{The mechanical behavior of partially solidified Al-Cu alloys is
   investigated to assess the influence of mushy zone deformation on hot
   tearing. For this purpose, the results of a semi-solid tensile test
   conducted in situ using X-ray microtomography are compared with the
   predictions of a coupled hydromechanical granular model in order to both
   validate the predictions of the model and explain the experimental
   observations. It is shown that hot tears initiate in the widest liquid
   channels connected to the free (oxidized) surfaces as long as there is
   contact between the intergranular liquid and the ambient air. The
   necking behavior is associated with the deformation-induced liquid
   pressure drop. Overall, the stresses predicted by the granular model
   under tensile and shear deformations agree well with the experimental
   data. Thus, the granular model achieves an important step in predicting
   hot tearing formation. (c) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

   role of Zn solute in solution on the rate of dynamic recovery is
   discussed. TEM was also used to examine the precipitate dislocation

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel actuator called Magnetostrictive Torsional
   Resonant Transducer (MTRT) is introduced. The transducer is composed of
   a magnetostrictive horn, a stainless steel backing and a housing. In
   this transducer a spiral magnetic field, made up of longitudinal and
   circumferential components, is applied to the magnetostrictive horn. As
   a result, the magnetostrictive horn oscillates torsionally based on the
   Wiedemann effect. The magnetostrictive horn is made up of ``2V
   permendur{''}, which has isotropic magnetic properties. The
   magnetomechanical differential equation of the MTRT is derived, and a
   transducer is designed for a resonant frequency of 12,075 Hz. Natural
   frequency and mode shape of the transducer are considered theoretically,
   numerically, and experimentally. The effects of axial and
   circumferential magnetic fields on torsional displacement of the MTRT
   are investigated experimentally. The experimental results show that this
   transducer resonates at the frequency of 12,325 Hz, while the maximum
   torsional displacement of the tip of the transducer is 1.2 mrad. These
   are promising features for industrial applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   situ tissue samples, RF ultrasound signals are acquired prior to, and
   following, high-intensity ultrasound ablation. Spatial and temporal
   features of these signals are used to characterize ablated and
   nonablated tissue in a supervised-learning framework. In
   cross-validation evaluation, a subset of four features extracted from RF
   time series produce a classification accuracy of 84.5\%, an area under
   ROC curve of 0.91 for ex vivo data, and an accuracy of 85\% for in situ
   data. Ultrasound RF time series is a promising approach for
   characterizing ablated tissue.}},

Abstract = {{For many laparoscopic surgical procedures, the preoperative images are
   taken with the patient in a different position than that in which the
   surgery is performed. The organ shift between positions can affect
   surgical image guidance, as the organ shifts can complicate image
   registration. In particular, for partial nephrectomy, the standard
   clinical approach requires supine preoperative computed tomography,
   while the surgery is performed in the flank position. We studied ten
   subjects in both supine and flank positions. Rigid registration was used
   to determine the relative motion of the kidneys, using the spine as a
   pose-independent landmark. Our results showed that the kidney can move
   as much as 46.5 mm as a result of a supine-to-flank change in patient
   position, and rotate as much as 25 degrees. From the results,
   significant kidney motion occurs due to the change of patient position
   from supine to flank. These changes warrant further study to understand
   and model the patient specific motion.}},

Abstract = {{As modern integrated circuits increase in size and complexity, more and
   more verification effort is necessary to ensure their error-free
   operation. This has motivated designers to apply post-silicon debugging
   techniques to their designs, such as by embedding trace instrumentation
   within. However, a key drawback to this approach is that only a small
   subset of a chip's internal signals can be traced, but selecting the
   most effective signals to observe must be determined before fabrication
   and before the nature of any errors is known. This paper explores the
   tradeoff between the scalability of automated signal selection
   algorithms, and the amount of circuit observability that they offer.
   Three selection methods are presented: a technique that optimizes for
   observability directly; a method based on the graph-centrality of the
   circuit's connectivity; and a hybrid technique that combines both
   algorithms through exploiting the circuit hierarchy. To quantify the
   observability of each technique, we define the debug difficulty metric
   to measure how accurately the traced data can be used to resolve a
   circuit's state behavior. Although we find that the graph-based method
   offers the least observability of the three algorithms, it was the only
   method that could be applied to our largest benchmark of over 50 000
   flip-flops, computing a selection in less than 90 s. Last, we present a
   novel application that can only be enabled by these scalable
   algorithms-speculative debug insertion for field-programmable gate
   arrays.}},

Abstract = {{A semi-analytical model for the interaction of twin circular jets is

   hypothesis, the three-dimensional velocity field of dual-hole circular
   jets can be predicted. The model is used to predict the interaction of
   converging, diverging, parallel and non-equal jets. The results show
   encouraging agreement with k-epsilon numerical simulations and
   experimental results from the literature. The position of the maximum
   velocity is predicted to within 5\%, and the model can predict the
   velocity field as well as the k-epsilon model. The current model can be
   useful in phenomenological engine simulation of multi-hole injectors.}},

Abstract = {{Registration of histopathology to in vivo magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) of the prostate is an important task that can be used to optimize
   in vivo imaging for cancer detection. Such registration is challenging
   due to the change in volume and deformation of the prostate during
   excision and fixation. One approach towards this problem involves the
   use of an ex vivo MRI of the excised prostate specimen, followed by in
   vivo to ex vivo MRI registration of the prostate. We propose a novel
   registration method that uses a patient-specific biomechanical model
   acquired using magnetic resonance elastography to deform the in vivo
   volume and match it to the surface of the ex vivo specimen. The forces
   that drive the deformations are derived from a region-based energy, with
   the elastic potential used for regularization. The incorporation of
   elastography data into the registration framework allows inhomogeneous
   elasticity to be assigned to the in vivo volume. We show that such
   inhomogeneity improves the registration results by providing a physical
   regularization of the deformation map. The method is demonstrated and
   evaluated on six clinical cases.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Stents are artificial implants that provide scaffolding to a cavity
   inside the body. This paper presents a new luminal device for reducing
   the mechanical failure of stents due to recoil, which is one of the most
   important issues in stenting. This device, which we call a
   recoil-resilient ring (RRR), is utilized standalone or potentially
   integrated with existing stents to address the problem of recoil. The
   proposed structure aims to minimize the need for high-pressure
   overexpansion that can induce intra-luminal trauma and excess growth of
   vascular tissue causing later restenosis. The RRR is an overlapped open
   ring with asymmetrical sawtooth structures that are intermeshed. These
   teeth can slide on top of each other, while the ring is radially
   expanded, but interlock step-by-step so as to keep the final expanded
   state against compressional forces that normally cause recoil. The RRRs
   thus deliver balloon expandability and, when integrated with a stent,
   bring both radial rigidity and longitudinal flexibility to the stent.
   The design of the RRR is investigated through finite element analysis
   (FEA), and then the devices are fabricated using micro-electro-discharge
   machining of 200-mu m-thick Nitinol sheet. The standalone RRR is balloon
   expandable in vitro by 5-7 Atm in pressure, which is well within the
   recommended in vivo pressure ranges for stenting procedures. FEA
   compression tests indicate 13 x less reduction of the cross-sectional
   area of the RRR compared with a typical stainless steel stent. These
   results also show perfect elastic recovery of the RRR after removal of
   the pressure compared to the remaining plastic deformations of the
   stainless steel stent. On the other hand, experimental loading tests
   show that the fabricated RRRs have 2.8 x radial stiffness compared to a
   two-column section of a commercial stent while exhibiting comparable
   elastic recovery. Furthermore, testing of in vitro expansion in a mock
   artery tube shows around 2.9\% recoil, approximately 5-11 x smaller than
   the recoil reported for commercial stents. These experimental results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the device design for the targeted
   luminal support and stenting applications.}},

Abstract = {{While demands on video traffic over mobile networks have been souring,
   the wireless link capacity cannot keep up with the traffic demand. The
   gap between the traffic demand and the link capacity, along with
   time-varying link conditions, results in poor service quality of video
   streaming over mobile networks such as long buffering time and
   intermittent disruptions. Leveraging the cloud computing technology, we
   propose a new mobile video streaming framework, dubbed AMES-Cloud, which
   has two main parts: adaptive mobile video streaming (AMoV) and efficient
   social video sharing (ESoV). AMoV and ESoV construct a private agent to
   provide video streaming services efficiently for each mobile user. For a
   given user, AMoV lets her private agent adaptively adjust her streaming
   flow with a scalable video coding technique based on the feedback of
   link quality. Likewise, ESoV monitors the social network interactions
   among mobile users, and their private agents try to prefetch video
   content in advance. We implement a prototype of the AMES-Cloud framework
   to demonstrate its performance. It is shown that the private agents in
   the clouds can effectively provide the adaptive streaming, and perform
   video sharing (i.e., prefetching) based on the social network analysis.}},

Abstract = {{MR-based methods provide low risk, noninvasive assessment of joint
   kinematics; however, these methods often use static positions or require
   many identical cycles of movement. The study objective was to compare
   the 3D kinematic results approximated from a series of sequential static
   poses of the knee with the 3D kinematic results obtained from continuous
   dynamic movement of the knee. To accomplish this objective, we compared
   kinematic data from a validated static MR method to a fast static MR
   method, and compared kinematic data from both static methods to a newly
   developed dynamic MR method. Ten normal volunteers were imaged using the
   three kinematic methods (dynamic, static standard, and static fast).
   Results showed that the two sets of static results were in agreement,
   indicating that the sequences (standard and fast) may be used
   interchangeably. Dynamic kinematic results were significantly different
   from both static results in eight of 11 kinematic parameters: patellar
   flexion, patellar tilt, patellar proximal translation, patellar lateral
   translation, patellar anterior translation, tibial abduction, tibial
   internal rotation, and tibial anterior translation. Three-dimensional MR
   kinematics measured from dynamic knee motion are often different from
   those measured in a static knee at several positions, indicating that
   dynamic-based kinematics provides information that is not obtainable
   from static scans. Magn Reson Med, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

   transducer}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel hybrid longitudinal-torsional magnetostrictive
   ultrasonic transducer (HL-TMUT) is introduced. The transducer is
   composed of a magnetostrictive exponential horn and a stainless steel
   tail mass. In this transducer a spiral magnetic field made up of
   longitudinal and circumferential magnetic fields is applied to the
   magnetostrictive horn. As a result, the magnetostrictive horn oscillates
   simultaneously both longitudinally and torsionally in accordance with
   the Joule and Wiedemann effects. The magnetostrictive exponential horn
   is designed in such a manner that it has the same longitudinal and
   torsional resonant frequency. It is made up of `2V Permendur', which has
   isotropic magnetic properties. The differential equations of the
   torsional and longitudinal vibration of the horn are derived, and a
   HL-TMUT is designed with a resonant frequency of 20 573 Hz. The natural
   frequency and mode shapes of the transducer are considered theoretically
   and numerically. The experimental results show that this transducer
   resonates torsionally and longitudinally with frequencies of 20 610 Hz
   and 20 830 Hz respectively. The maximum torsional displacement is 1.5
   mrad m(-1) and the maximum longitudinal displacement is 0.6 mu m. These
   are promising features for industrial applications.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic and holistic watershed model comparison and selection
   process, integrating a full range of relevant criteria, is illustrated
   here. The process consists of screening for a set of candidate models on
   the basis of prerequisite model attributes; assessing hydrologic
   simulation performance using various conventional statistical metrics;
   assessing operational logistics performance, reflecting somewhat
   subjective but centrally important issues around relative feasibility
   and suitability of candidate models in the intended context of use; and
   integrating the hydrologic and operational performance results, which
   are each evaluated using a weighted-matrix approach, into a single
   coherent and comprehensive ranking system. The process was applied to
   evaluation of watershed models for operational hydroelectric inflow
   forecasting in British Columbia, Canada. An important feature of the
   study was its horse-race project management approach, involving a
   supervised competition between expert teams using different models but
   the same data sets. Four models passed the prescreening phase, and these
   were evaluated for three test basins representing contrasting
   geophysical regimes. The model selection process presented here is
   believed to be potentially very broadly useful. DOI:

Abstract = {{The multicast lifetime maximization (MLM) problem has been extensively
   studied due to its significance to applications in energy-constrained

   reconsider the MLM problem in lossy wireless networks with AWGN channel
   and Rayleigh fading channel. We find that MLM problem using network
   coding can be formulated as a min-max tree problem, in which the link
   weight of the tree only relates to the initial battery capacity,
   transmission distance and environment noise. Such finding leads to an
   optimal solution to the MLM problem with polynomial time complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Relay selection schemes for cooperative communications to achieve full
   cooperative diversity gains while maintaining spectral and energy
   efficiency have been extensively studied in a recent research. These
   schemes select only the best relay from multiple relaying candidates to
   cooperate with a communication link. In the present paper, we reviewed
   recently proposed cooperative communication protocols that integrate
   with relay selection mechanisms. The key design issues for relay
   selection mechanisms, for example, relaying candidate selection, optimal
   relay assignment, and cooperative transmission, were identified. We
   further discussed the challenges of optimal relay assignment in
   multi-hop wireless sensor networks and presented the potential
   applications of cooperative communications with a relay selection in
   such networks. Future research directions were outlined, for example,
   the issues of service differentiation and system fairness in cooperative
   communication systems and the joint use of game theory and adaptive
   learning techniques in relaying candidate selection and optimal-relay
   assignment mechanisms for efficient allocation of network resources.

Abstract = {{In this paper, the viscoelastic behaviour of bitumen is studied and an
   appropriate and suitable constitutive equation is identified to describe
   its rheological behaviour. First, the generalised Maxwell model has been
   utilized to represent the relaxation modulus of bitumen and found to be
   in excellent agreement with experimental data over a wide range of
   temperatures (-30 degrees C to 90 degrees C). Furthermore, the
   time-temperature superposition principle was found to be applicable over
   this temperature range. The K-BKZ constitutive equation has been shown
   to represent accurately the rheological properties of bitumen. Analysis
   of experimental results revealed that either the Papanastasiou or the
   Marucci form of the damping function can be used in the K-BKZ
   constitutive equation. Moreover, the damping function was found to be
   independent of temperature (0-50 degrees C). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Underground mine water inrush accidents are currently one of the most
   frequent forms of disaster in the mining industry. In order to develop
   and implement and effective rescue and avoidance plan for water inrush
   accidents in underground mining projects, this paper proposes a
   spatiotemporal dynamic three-dimensional (3D) model for the real
   simulation of the flow spreading process. A spatiotemporal dynamic model
   framework was developed through an analysis of the factors influencing
   temporal changes of water inrush spreading in roadways. The basis of the
   model is the generation of a roadway space network system, the core of
   the model involves the paths resolving for the water inrush spread
   processes, and the key of the model consists of the velocity and time
   resolving for water inrush spread processes. A roadway space network
   system was generated from roadway data modeling, regularization, arc
   drift straightening and 3D networking. The result is the spatial
   illustration of model. A spatial dynamic demonstration model was created
   With the information gleaned from the resolution of the paths of water
   spread down as well as water level rising in the roadway space network.
   A temporal dynamic expression of the model was then created from an
   examination of the hydraulic characteristics of the water inrush
   current, and the calculation of the velocity and time of water inrush
   spread. The feasibility and validity of the spatiotemporal dynamic model
   for water inrush spread processes was tested and verified through a case
   study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{35-45}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations utilizing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with
   a volume of fluid (VOF) method has been employed to investigate
   two-phase flow distribution in inter-connected parallel flow channels.
   The interconnections resemble gas and liquid communications in fuel cell
   flow fields due to the inherent or artificial structures of gas
   diffusion layers (GDLs). The simulation results showed that
   communication between parallel channels could have a great impact on the
   two-phase flow pattern, gas and water distribution and flow
   maldistribution. Wide communication channels provide a pathway for gas
   to short-circuit the liquid, leading to a worsened gas flow
   distribution. However, when the communication channels are narrow
   enough, they are helpful for mitigating the flow maldistribution by

Journal = {{CATALYSIS TODAY}},

Volume = {{207}},

Abstract = {{Biochar, a by-product of fast pyrolysis of woody biomass, was developed
   as a renewable catalyst for simultaneous transesterification and
   esterification of canola oil and fatty acid (oleic acid) mixture at 150
   degrees C under 1.52 MPa. Surface area and porosity of biochar were
   increased significantly from negligible to 990 m(2)/g, and 0.9 cm(3)/g
   through chemical activation method with KOH. The resultant biochar was
   sulfonated with fuming sulfuric acid to produce the biochar-based
   catalyst with high surface area and porosity (949 m(2)/g and 0.85
   cm(3)/g). The ester formation yield was investigated based on the molar
   ratios of alcohol to canola oil (A:O), alcohol to oleic acid (A:FFA), or
   at constant mass ratio of alcohol to the mixture of oil and oleic acid.
   Increasing the FFA concentration from 15, 30 to 50 wt.\% (at constant A:
   O molar ratio) resulted in slight increase of reaction yields from 27.9,
   35.1, to 36.7\%, respectively. Results also revealed a continuous
   increase in reaction yield from 38.0 to 48.1\% as increasing A: FFA
   molar ratio (from 10: 1 to 30: 1) at constant A: O. However, increasing
   A: O ratio (from 10: 1 to 30: 1) at constant A: FFA resulted in an
   unexpected decrease in the reaction yield from 48.1 to 28.8\%. The
   biochar based catalyst showed promising catalytic activity (48\% yield
   in 3 h) for the combination of transesterification and esterification
   reactions in a mixture of canola oil and oleic acid for biodiesel
   production. Reaction yield decreased by similar to 8\% upon reusing the
   catalyst. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{191-201}},
Month = {{MAY 30}},
Abstract = {{Source water protection (SWP) is an important step in the implementation
   of a multi-barrier approach that ensures the delivery of safe drinking
   water. Available decision-making models for SWP primarily use complex
   mathematical formulations that require large data sets to perform
   analysis, which limit their use. Moreover, most of them cannot handle
   interconnection and redundancy among the parameters, or missing
   information. A fuzzy-based model is proposed in this study to overcome
   the above limitations. This model can estimate a reduction in the
   pollutant loads based on selected SWP strategies (e.g., storm water
   management ponds, vegetated filter strips). The proposed model employs
   an export coefficient approach and account for the number of animals to
   estimate the pollutant loads generated by different land usages (e.g.,
   agriculture, forests, highways, livestock, and pasture land). Water
   quality index is used for the assessment of water quality once these
   pollutant loads are discharged into the receiving waters. To demonstrate
   the application of the proposed model, a case study of Page Creek was
   performed in the Claybum watershed (British Columbia, Canada). The
   results show that increasing urban development and poorly managed
   agricultural areas have the most adverse effects on source water
   quality. The proposed model can help decision makers to make informed
   decisions related to the land use and resource allocation. (C) 2013

   previously reported to be highly active for the living ring-opening
   polymerization of cyclic esters lactide (LA) and beta-butyrolactone

   poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB). Copolymers
   PLLA-PDLLA-PLLA and PLLA-PDLLA-PDLA, synthesized via sequential monomer
   addition, showed low molecular weight distributions and excellent
   correlation between the calculated and experiment molecular weights.
   Significantly, triblock copolymers of the type PLA PHB PLA were also
   synthesized for the first time through a sequential addition technique.
   Analysis of polymers after each addition of monomer showed that although
   only 85\% conversion was achieved after addition of BBL, the remaining
   chain ends were active and addition of more lactide yielded a triblock.
   Rheological studies of PLLA-PHB-PDLA indicated solid like behavior even
   well above the temperature at which stereocomplex formation was observed
   These elastomeric triblocks exhibited elongations at break 5-10 times

Abstract = {{Time-responses of concentration of a saline tracer were determined
   during fluidization by water at 15 degrees C in a column of 191 mm
   diameter. Mono-component beds contained 1.85 mm glass beads (density
   2500 kg/m(3)) or 0.550 mm ceramic spheres (density 3800 kg/m(3)). A
   binary fluidized bed, containing equal volumes of these two solids,
   displayed layer-inversion at superficial liquid velocities of 40.5 and
   43.5 mm/s at 10 and 20 degrees C, respectively. Saline tracer pulses
   were injected just above the distributor, at the column centre. The salt
   concentration at the bed surface was measured at three radial positions
   for superficial water velocities up to 127 mm/s. Concentration profiles,
   simulated by computational particle-fluid dynamics (CPFD) with
   Eulerian-Lagrangian methodology, showed reasonable agreement with the
   experimental data. An axial/radial dispersion model was also applied for
   the mono-component and binary fluidized beds.. The axial dispersion
   coefficients for the glass beads exceed those for the ceramic spheres.
   Those for the binary bed are less than expected based on the
   mono-component data, though a maximum appears at the inversion velocity
   when closed-closed boundary conditions are employed. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Decades ago, Veselago(1) predicted that a material with simultaneously
   negative electric and magnetic polarization responses would yield a
   `left-handed' medium in which light propagates with opposite phase and
   energy velocities-a condition described by a negative refractive index.
   He proposed that a flat slab of left-handed material possessing an
   isotropic refractive index of 21 could act like an imaging lens in free
   space. Left-handed materials do not occur naturally, and it has only
   recently become possible to achieve a left-handed response using
   metamaterials, that is, electromagnetic structures engineered on
   subwavelength scales to elicit tailored polarization responses. So far,
   left-handed responses have typically been implemented using resonant
   metamaterials composed of periodic arrays of unit cells containing
   inductive-capacitive resonators and conductive wires. Negative
   refractive indices that are isotropic in two(2) or three(3) dimensions
   at microwave frequencies have been achieved in resonant metamaterials
   with centimetre-scale features. Scaling the left-handed response to
   higher frequencies, such as infrared or visible, has been done by
   shrinking critical dimensions to submicrometre scales by means of
   top-down nanofabrication(4). This miniaturization has, however, so far
   been achieved at the cost of reduced unit-cell symmetry, yielding a
   refractive index that is negative along only one axis. Moreover,
   lithographic scaling limits have so far precluded the fabrication of
   resonant metamaterials with left-handed responses at frequencies beyond
   the visible(5). Here we report the experimental implementation of a bulk
   metamaterial with a left-handed response to ultraviolet light. The
   structure, based on stacked plasmonic waveguides(6), yields an
   omnidirectional left-handed response for transverse magnetic
   polarization characterized by a negative refractive index. By
   engineering the structure to have a refractive index close to -1 over a
   broad angular range, we achieve Veselago flat lensing, in free space, of
   arbitrarily shaped, two-dimensional objects beyond the near field. We
   further demonstrate active, all-optical modulation of the image
   transferred by the flat lens.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors consider the application of a system
   architecture called cognitive radio (CR) with fibre-connected
   distributed antennas in IEEE 802.22 wireless regional area networks
   (WRANs) as it could bring the benefits of much shorter wireless
   transmission distances, lower transmission power and the possibility of
   utilising multi-antenna transmission techniques. In this architecture,
   the authors study the secondary user (SU) access problem in uplink,
   where the SU to primary user (PU) link estimation is subject to random
   errors because PU could not assist link estimation of SU. This SU access
   problem is divided into two parts: antenna selection and access control.
   Thus, first antenna selection problem is modelled as a restless bandit
   problem, which is solved by the primal-dual index heuristic algorithm
   based on first order relaxation. In addition, the access control problem
   is modelled as a stochastic knapsack (SASK) problem with random weight,
   and then relaxed to be a deterministic second order cone programming
   problem. With the deduced upper bound, the access control problem is
   solved by the branch and bound algorithm, which yields the SU access
   based on SASK scheme. Simulation results illustrate the significant
   performance improvement of SASK scheme, compared with existing SU access
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted as part of the development of a novel process
   for copper recovery from chalcopyrite by chloride leaching, simultaneous
   cuprous oxidation and cupric solvent extraction to transfer copper to a
   conventional sulfate electrowinning circuit, and hematite precipitation
   to reject iron. Copper solvent extraction from chloride solution has
   been studied using four LIX (R) extractants (LIX84-I, LIX612N-LV,
   XI-04003 and LIX984N) from BASF with respect to copper extraction as a
   function of pH and A/O ratio, and behavior of the impurities. At a pH
   below 0.5, the copper extraction increased quickly with increasing pH
   while at a pH above 0.5, it increased only slightly with pH. The copper
   extraction in organic solution was virtually not affected by the
   impurities. The iron extraction in organic solution increased with
   decreasing A/O ratio from 2:1 to 1:8 as the copper extraction decreased.
   Conversely, the Cu/Fe ratio in organic solution increased as copper
   extraction increased. The extractions of silver and lead were 1 mg/L or
   lower under all conditions tested. The other impurities (Zn, Ni, Cd, Cr,
   Hg, As and Sb) were virtually not loaded into the organic solution. The
   optimum copper solvent extraction conditions in chloride solution were
   proposed. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Thiosulfate is a promising alternative for the hydrometallurgical
   treatment of silver sulfide ores. In this study, the copper-ammonia
   catalyzed thiosulfate leaching of a silver sulfide rotating disk is
   investigated. The leaching of silver sulfide by a copper-ammonia
   thiosulfate solution occurs either by the substitution of cupric or
   cuprous for silver. The cupric reaction is favored due to a
   thermodynamic barrier to the cuprous reaction. At 1 mM copper, there is
   evidence of partial chemical control for copper-ammonia leaching with a
   maximum silver dissolution rate achieved when cupric is stabilized in
   solution with ammonia and for solutions with high thiosulfate
   availability. The addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid decreased
   the leaching rate of the silver sulfide disk due to decreased cupric
   reactivity, although this comes with the benefit of increased cupric
   stability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The separation of cells based on their biomechanical properties, such as
   size and deformability, is important in applications such as the
   identification of circulating tumor cells, where morphological
   differences can be used to distinguish target cancer cells from
   contaminant leukocytes. Existing filtration-based separation processes
   are limited in their selectivity and their ability to extract the
   separated cells because of clogging in the filter microstructures. We
   present a cell separation device consisting of a hydrodynamic
   concentrator and a microfluidic ratchet mechanism operating in tandem.
   The hydrodynamic concentrator removes the majority of the fluid and a
   fraction of leukocytes based on size, while the microfluidic ratchet
   mechanism separates cancer cells from leukocytes based on a combination
   of size and deformability. The irreversible ratcheting process enables
   highly selective separation and robust extraction of separated cells.
   Using cancer cells spiked into leukocyte suspensions, the complete
   system demonstrated a yield of 97\%, while enriching the concentration
   of target cancer cells 3000 fold relative to the concentration of
   leukocytes. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2292-2301}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the problem of random access with interference
   pricing in wireless ad hoc networks using non-cooperative game theory.
   While most of the previous works in random access games are based on the
   protocol model, we analyze the game under the more accurate
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) model. First, under the
   setting with fixed interference linear pricing, we characterize the
   existence of the Nash equilibrium (NE) in the random access game. In
   particular, when the utility functions of all the players satisfy a risk
   aversion condition, we show that the game is a S-modular game and
   characterize the convergence of the strategy profile to the NE. Then,
   under the setting with adaptive interference linear pricing, we propose
   an iterative algorithm that aims to solve the network utility
   maximization (NUM) problem. Convergence of the solution to a
   Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the NUM problem is studied. It can be
   shown that the solution obtained under the protocol model may result in
   starvation for some users due to the inaccurate interference pricing.
   Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm based on the SINR
   model achieves a higher average utility than the algorithm based on the
   protocol model and a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) scheme
   implemented in a slotted time system.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{WB37-WB48}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{We examine uncertainty in predicted linear 1D site amplification due to
   uncertainty in shear-wave velocity (V-S) structure quantified from
   Bayesian (probabilistic) inversion of microtremor array dispersion data.
   Based on a sample of V-S profiles drawn from the posterior probability
   density of the microtremor inversion, probability distributions are
   computed for common predictors of site amplification including V-SZ
   (traveltime average V-S to a depth z) and amplification spectra based on
   seismic impedance variations and full transverse shear-wave effects.
   These methods are applicable for any site, but the resulting
   probabilistic site amplification analyses are specific to the two
   sediment sites studied here with strongly contrasting geology in high
   population centers of British Columbia, Canada. The site amplification
   probability distributions for the two sites are shown to be more
   informative than amplification estimated for a single best-fit V-S
   profile by characterizing the uncertainty and therefore level of
   confidence in the predictions. The shear-wave amplification probability
   spectra are evaluated by comparison to empirical earthquake and
   microtremor spectral ratios, with generally good agreement in resonant
   peak frequencies and amplification levels, providing confidence that the
   primary influence of site-specific structure is accounted for
   appropriately. The wider implication here is that proper
   characterization of the V-S(z) profile uncertainty distribution from
   inversion of cost-effective surface wave dispersion data is beneficial
   in the application of said profiles to the prediction of earthquake site
   response and its uncertainty, as required for probabilistic seismic
   hazard assessment.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new scheme to automatically identify the locations of
   wearable sensor nodes in a wireless body area network (WBAN).
   Instantaneous atmospheric air pressure readings are compared to map
   nodes in physical space. This enhancement enables unassisted sensor node
   placement, providing a practical solution to obtain and continuously
   monitor node locations without anchor nodes or beacons. To validate this
   localization scheme, a statistical analysis is conducted on a set of air
   pressure sensors and a prototype WBAN to examine the performance and
   limitations. Based on a 60 cm separation between nodes, indicative of
   the expected separation between limbs and placement positions along a
   patient's body, the measurements consistently exceeded p-value
   reliability within a 95\% confidence interval. We also present and
   experimentally demonstrate an enhancement aiming to reduce
   false-positive (Type I) errors in conventional accelerometer-based
   on-body fall detection schemes. Our statistical analysis has shown that
   by continuously monitoring the patient's limb positions, the WBAN would
   be better able to discriminate ``fall-like{''} motions from actual

Abstract = {{Energy-aware power allocation in cooperative communication systems
   depends on the availability of channel state information (CSI), which is
   often imperfect in practice. This paper proposes energy-aware, optimal
   power allocation schemes for an amplify-and-forward cooperative
   communication system in the presence of imperfect CSI, to i) minimize
   the total transmit power; ii) maximize the end-to-end signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR). Energy awareness is incorporated in the schemes either by
   avoiding over-provisioning of quality-of-service (QoS) or, by preventing
   unsuccessful transmissions, depending on the application. In both the
   schemes, the source and relay nodes share a fixed total transmit power
   budget, and transmission is allowed only if the minimum required
   end-to-end SNR can be achieved with the available power budget.
   Closed-form expressions for the source and relay optimal transmit powers
   are derived for both these schemes. Performance of the systems under the
   proposed schemes are investigated through simulations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose robust power allocation and admission control
   schemes for providing probabilistically constrained quality of service
   (QoS) in selective relaying based decode-and-forward (DF) cooperative
   cellular systems. The proposed schemes are robust against imperfect
   channel state information (CSI) in slow fading while optimizing the
   total uplink transmit power in these cooperative wireless networks. At
   first, we derive novel closed-form solutions for the optimization
   problem, where the objective is to minimize total uplink transmit power
   while meeting the probabilistic QoS guarantees for a given number of
   admitted users. This is achieved by approximating the probabilistic
   optimization problem into a convex deterministic form and then by
   deriving closed form analytical solutions for power allocation using
   Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The closed-form property of these
   solutions allows us later to develop a very low-complexity suboptimal
   algorithm for joint admission control and power allocation in presence
   of imperfect CSI and selective relaying. We also conduct comprehensive
   simulation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
   schemes and to highlight the benefits gained from considering channel
   estimation errors in resource allocation for cooperative cellular

Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We propose a novel algorithm to efficiently transmit multiple
   Variable-Bit-Rate (VBR) video streams from a base station to mobile
   receivers in wide-area wireless networks. The algorithm multicasts video
   streams in bursts to save the energy of mobile devices. In addition, the
   algorithm adaptively controls the buffer levels of mobile devices
   receiving different video streams according to the bit rate of the video
   stream being received by each device. Compared to previous algorithms,
   the new algorithm enables dynamic control of the wireless channel and
   allows the base station to transmit more video data on time to mobile
   receivers. This is done by providing finer control over the bandwidth
   allocation of the wireless channel. The problem of optimizing energy
   saving has been shown to be NP-Complete. We prove that our algorithm
   finds a feasible schedule if one exists and always produces a correct
   schedule even when dropped frames are unavoidable. We analytically bound
   the gap between the energy saving resulting from our algorithm and the
   optimal energy saving and show that our results are close to optimal. We
   analyze the tradeoff between the fine control over bandwidth allocation
   and energy saving and demonstrate that in practical situations, flexible
   and finer control of bandwidth allocation will result in significantly
   lower frame loss rates while achieving higher energy saving. We have
   implemented the proposed algorithm as well as two other recent
   algorithms in a mobile video streaming testbed. Our extensive analysis
   and results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the
   other two algorithms; it results in higher energy saving for mobile
   devices and fewer dropped video frames.}},

   bubbles: A potash ore flotation mechanism}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{170-179}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Recent investigations summarized in this review have been conveniently
   grouped into (i) those dealing with the mechanism of action of the
   reagents applied in the flotation of potash ores, and (ii) those focused
   on the flotation properties of salt-type minerals and explanation of the
   remarkable selectivity between floatable sylvite, and non-floatable
   halite. This paper is confined to the first group. It is argued that in
   discussing the mode of action of long-chain primary amines in the
   flotation of potash ores account must be taken of the way in which these
   amines are applied by industry. Because they are water insoluble they
   are melted by heating up to 70-90 degrees C and then they are dispersed
   in acidified aqueous solution. Once added to the flotation pulp, the hot
   amine dispersion rapidly cools down to a temperature far below the
   Krafft point. The rapid conversion from a hot emulsion to a cold
   precipitate is a very severe transformation. Since nothing is known
   about the kinetics of these changes and phase instability only the lab
   tests in which the adopted reagent preparation procedures closely follow
   the industrial practice have been considered in this review. (C) 2013

Title = {{Copper leaching from chalcopyrite concentrate in Cu(II)/Fe(III) chloride
   system}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{185-190}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to develop a novel process for copper recovery
   from chalcopyrite by chloride leaching, simultaneous cuprous oxidation
   and cupric solvent extraction to transfer copper to a conventional
   sulfate electrowinning circuit, and hematite precipitation to reject
   iron. Copper leaching from chalcopyrite concentrate in ferric and cupric
   chloride system was investigated using a two-stage countercurrent leach
   circuit under a nitrogen atmosphere at 97 degrees C to minimize the
   concentrations of cupric and ferric ions in pregnant leach solution for
   subsequent copper solvent extraction while maintaining a maximum copper
   extraction. A high calcium chloride concentration (110-165 g/L) was used
   to maintain a high cuprous solubility and enhance copper leaching. With
   3-4 h of leaching time for each stage, the copper extraction reached
   99\% or higher while that of iron was around 90\%. With decreasing
   concentrate particle size from p80 of 26 to 15 mu m, the copper
   extraction increased by about 0.2\% while the iron extraction increased
   by about 2.0\%. The concentration of Cu(II) + Fe(III) in the pregnant
   leach solution was able to be reduced to 0.04 M. When the cupric
   concentration fell below the above limiting value, the elemental sulfur
   present was reduced by cuprous ions to form copper sulfide, eventually
   stopping the leaching of copper. Under this condition, only iron was
   leached. A very small amount of sulfur (1.2-1.4\%) was oxidized to
   sulfate, resulting in an increase from 3 to 9 g/L in HCl concentration.
   The extractions of trace metals (Cr, Pb, Ni, Ag and Zn) were 96-100\%.

Title = {{Bidding to drive: Car license auction policy in Shanghai and its public
   acceptance}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORT POLICY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{39-52}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Increased automobile ownership and use in China over the last two
   decades has increased energy consumption, worsened air pollution, and
   exacerbated congestion. However, the countrywide growth in car ownership
   conceals great variation among cities. For example, Shanghai and Beijing
   each had about 2 million motor vehicles in 2004, but by 2010, Beijing
   had 4.8 million motor vehicles whereas Shanghai had only 3.1 million.
   Among the factors contributing to this divergence is Shanghai's vehicle
   control policy, which uses monthly license auctions to limit the number
   of new cars. The policy appears to be effective: in addition to
   dampening growth in car ownership, it generates annual revenues up to 5
   billion CNY (800 million USD). But, despite these apparent successes,
   the degree to which the public accepts this policy is unknown.
   This study surveys 524 employees at nine Shanghai companies to
   investigate the policy acceptance of Shanghai's license auction by the
   working population, and the factors that contribute to that acceptance:
   Perceived policy effectiveness, affordability, equity concerns, and
   implementation. Respondents perceive the policy to be effective, but are
   moderately negative towards the policy nonetheless. However, they expect
   that others accept the policy more than they do. Respondents also hold
   consistently negative perceptions about the affordability of the
   license, the effects on equity, and the implementation process. Revenue
   usage is not seen as transparent, which is exacerbated by a perception
   that government vehicles enjoy advantages in obtaining a license, issues
   with the bidding process and technology, and difficulties in obtaining
   information about the auction policy. Nevertheless, respondents believe
   that license auctions and congestion charges are more effective and
   acceptable than parking charges and fuel taxes. To improve public
   acceptability of the policy, we make five recommendations: Transparency
   in revenue usage; transparency in government vehicle licensing and use,
   categorising licenses by vehicle type, implementation and technology
   improvements to increase bidding convenience, and policies that restrict
   vehicle usage in congested locations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The majority of clinical spinal cord injuries (SCIs) are contusive and
   occur at the cervical level of the spinal cord. Most scientists and
   clinicians agree that the preclinical evaluation of novel candidate
   treatments should include testing in a cervical SCI contusion model.
   Because mice are increasingly used because of the availability of
   genetically engineered lines, we characterized a novel cervical
   hemicontusion injury in mice using the Infinite Horizon Spinal Cord
   Impactor (Precisions Systems \& Instrumentation, Lexington, KY). In the
   current study, C57BL/6 mice received a hemicontusion injury of 75
   kilodynes with or without dwell time in an attempt to elicit a sustained
   moderate-to-severe motor deficit. Hemicontusion injuries without dwell
   time resulted in sustained deficits of the affected forepaw, as revealed
   by a 3-fold decrease in usage during rearing, a similar to 50\%
   reduction in grooming scores, and retrieval of significantly fewer
   pellets on the Montoya staircase test. Only minor transient deficits
   were observed in grasping force. CatWalk analysis revealed reduced
   paw-print size and swing speed of the affected forelimb. Added dwell
   time of 15 or 30 sec significantly worsened behavioral outcome, and mice
   demonstrated minimal ability of grasping, paw usage, and overground
   locomotion. Besides worsening of behavioral deficits, added dwell time
   also reduced residual white and gray matter at the epicenter and
   rostralcaudal to the injury, including on the contralateral side of the
   spinal cord. Taken together, we developed and characterized a new
   hemicontusion SCI model in mice that produces sufficient and sustained
   impairments in gross and skilled forelimb function and produced
   primarily unilateral functional deficits.}},

Abstract = {{A coherent multiple-input multiple-output architecture is proposed for
   optical wireless communications (OWCs) to mitigate atmospheric
   turbulence effects. Transmitter optical signals operate at distinct
   carrier frequencies to allow the received optical signals to be
   separately processed. The accumulated phase noise in each transmission
   branch can then be independently and electrically compensated. Based on
   the proposed architecture, several diversity combining techniques are
   used at the receiver end for system performance evaluation. Three
   different turbulence models are considered in this paper for different
   scintillation level ranges, including gamma-gamma turbulence,
   K-distributed turbulence, and negative exponential turbulence.
   Closed-form error rate expressions are derived using a series expansion
   approach. The diversity order in the gamma-gamma turbulence channel is
   found to depend only on the smaller channel parameter, while the
   K-distributed and negative exponential turbulence channels are found to
   have the same diversity order. The presented numerical results
   demonstrate substantial system performance improvement over single-link
   coherent OWC.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of initial particle fabric on the one-dimensional compression
   response of Fraser River sand was investigated. One-dimensional
   compression with lateral stress measurement was carried out on
   reconstituted Fraser River sand specimens using an instrumented
   oedometer. Laboratory specimens were reconstituted by air pluviation,
   tamping, and vibration and were prepared with an initial relative
   density ranging from medium loose to very dense. For Fraser River sand
   in one-dimensional compression, air-pluviated specimens yielded the
   highest values for the coefficient of lateral earth pressure at rest
   (K-o), tamped specimens produced the lowest K-o values, and vibrated
   specimens produced intermediate K-o values. The results from the present
   study demonstrate that specimens resulting from different laboratory
   reconstitution methods (i.e., different initial particle fabrics)
   exhibit different one-dimensional compression responses and produce
   different K-o values. A ``fabric factor{''} was introduced to account
   for the effect of the initial particle fabric on the measured
   coefficient of lateral earth pressure at rest. Using the fabric factor,
   the constant volume friction angle, and the specimen relative density, a
   new empirical equation defining the coefficient of lateral earth
   pressure at rest during normally consolidated loading is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that the major drawback of orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is its high peak-to-mean envelope
   power ratio (PMEPR). One of the promising schemes proposed for
   alleviating the high PMEPR of OFDM signals is tone injection (TI). In
   this paper, we propose a novel low-complexity algorithm for PMEPR
   reduction using TI. This algorithm first formulates the TI scheme as a
   combinatorial optimization problem and then finds a near-optimal
   solution to this problem via parametric minimum cross-entropy (PMCE)
   method. We also demonstrate that by effectively exploiting TI schemes in
   conjunction with cross constellations, it is possible to reduce the peak
   power of the system by more than 2 dB compared with sign selection
   schemes over conventional quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM)
   constellations. Simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms
   similar existing algorithms, including the cross-entropy (CE) TI
   algorithm, the greedy sign selection algorithm, and the derandomization
   sign selection algorithm, in terms of PMEPR. We also present a
   threshold-based PMCE algorithm for TI that results in significant
   complexity reduction. Numerical results show that to achieve a
   prescribed PMEPR threshold, this threshold-based PMCE algorithm requires
   less computational complexity than the CE TI algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental decision-making in offshore oil and gas (OOG) operations
   can be extremely complex due to conflicting objectives or criteria,
   availability of vague and uncertain information, and interdependency
   among multiple decision-makers. Most existing studies ignore conflicting
   preferences and strategic interactions among decision-makers. This paper
   presents a game theoretical approach to solve multi-criteria conflict
   resolution problem under constrained and uncertain environments.
   Uncertainties in the quantification of imprecise data are expressed
   using rough numbers. A multi-criteria game is developed to model a
   decision problem in which three groups of decision-makers (i.e.,
   operators, regulators and service engineers) are involved. This game is
   solved using the generalized maximin solution concept. With the solution
   (i.e., optimal weights of the criteria), the rough numbers can be
   aggregated to an expected payoff for each alternative. Finally, the
   weights of upper and lower limits of a rough number are employed to
   transform the expected payoff into a crisp score, based on which all
   alternatives are ranked to identify the best one. A numerical example is
   outlined to demonstrate the application of the proposed method to the
   selection of management scenarios of drilling wastes. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {{Eliminating the expensive and failure-prone proton exchange membrane
   (PEM) together with the platinum-based anode and cathode catalysts would
   significantly reduce the high capital and operating costs of
   low-temperature (<373K) fuel cells. We recently introduced the
   Swiss-roll mixed-reactant fuel cell (SR-MRFC) concept for
   borohydrideoxygen alkaline fuel cells. We now present advances in anode
   electrocatalysis for borohydride electrooxidation through the
   development of osmium nanoparticulate catalysts supported on porous
   monolithic carbon fiber materials (referred to as an osmium 3D anode).
   The borohydrideoxygen SR-MRFC operates at 323K and near atmospheric
   pressure, generating a peak power density of 1880Wm2 in a single-cell
   configuration by using an osmium-based anode (with an osmium loading of
   0.32mgcm2) and a manganese dioxide gas-diffusion cathode. To the best of
   our knowledge, 1880Wm2 is the highest power density ever reported for a
   mixed-reactant fuel cell operating under similar conditions.
   Furthermore, the performance matches the highest reported power
   densities for conventional dual chamber PEM direct borohydride fuel
   cells.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of estimating time varying phase noise
   caused by imperfect oscillators in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
   systems. The estimation problem is parameterized in detail and based on
   an equivalent signal model its dimensionality is reduced to minimize the
   overhead associated with phase noise estimation. New exact and
   closed-form expressions for the Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bounds
   (BCRLBs) and soft-input maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators for
   online, i.e., filtering, and offline, i.e., smoothing, estimation of
   phase noise over the length of a frame are derived. Simulations
   demonstrate that the proposed MAP estimators' mean-square error (MSE)
   performances are very close to the derived BCRLBs at moderate-to-high
   signal-to-noise ratios. To reduce the overhead and complexity associated
   with tracking the phase noise processes over the length of a frame, a
   novel soft-input extended Kalman filter (EKF) and extended Kalman
   smoother (EKS) that use soft statistics of the transmitted symbols given
   the current observations are proposed. Numerical results indicate that
   by employing the proposed phase tracking approach, the bit-error rate
   performance of a MIMO system affected by phase noise can be
   significantly improved. In addition, simulation results indicate that
   the proposed phase noise estimation scheme allows for application of
   higher order modulations and larger numbers of antennas in MIMO systems
   that employ imperfect oscillators.}},

Abstract = {{A novel patient-specific seizure prediction method based on the analysis
   of positive zero-crossing intervals in scalp electroencephalogram (EEG)
   is proposed. In a moving-window analysis, the histogram of these
   intervals for the current EEG epoch is computed, and the values
   corresponding to specific bins are selected as an observation. Then, the
   set of observations from the last 5 min is compared with two reference
   sets of data points (preictal and interictal) through novel measures of
   similarity and dissimilarity based on a variational Bayesian Gaussian
   mixture model of the data. A combined index is then computed and
   compared with a patient-specific threshold, resulting in a cumulative
   measure which is utilized to form an alarm sequence for each channel.
   Finally, this channel-based information is used to generate a seizure
   prediction alarm. The proposed method was evaluated using similar to 561
   h of scalp EEG including a total of 86 seizures in 20 patients. A high
   sensitivity of 88.34\% was achieved with a false prediction rate of
   0.155 h(-1) and an average prediction time of 22.5 min for the test
   dataset. The proposed method was also tested against a Poisson-based
   random predictor.}},

Title = {{Buffer-Aided Relaying With Adaptive Link Selection-Fixed and Mixed Rate
   Transmission}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2816-2840}},

Abstract = {{We consider a simple network consisting of a source, a half-duplex
   decode-and-forward relay with a buffer, and a destination. We assume
   that the direct source-destination link is not available and all links
   undergo fading. We propose two new buffer-aided relaying schemes with
   different requirements regarding the availability of channel state
   information at the transmitter (CSIT). In the first scheme, neither the
   source nor the relay has full CSIT, and consequently, both nodes are
   forced to transmit with fixed rates. In contrast, in the second scheme,
   the source does not have full CSIT and transmits with fixed rate but the
   relay has full CSIT and adapts its transmission rate accordingly. In the
   absence of delay constraints, for both fixed rate and mixed rate
   transmission, we derive the throughput-optimal buffer-aided relaying
   protocols which select either the source or the relay for transmission
   based on the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the
   source-relay and relay-destination links. In addition, for the delay
   constrained case, we develop buffer-aided relaying protocols that
   achieve a predefined average delay. Compared to conventional relaying
   protocols, which select the transmitting node according to a predefined
   schedule independent of the instantaneous link SNRs, the proposed
   buffer-aided protocols with adaptive link selection achieve large
   performance gains. In particular, for fixed rate transmission, we show
   that the proposed protocol achieves a diversity gain of two as long as
   an average delay of more than three time slots can be afforded.
   Furthermore, for mixed rate transmission with an average delay of E\{T\}
   time slots, a multiplexing gain of r = 1 - 1/(2E\{t\}) is achieved. As a
   by-product of the considered link-adaptive protocols, we also develop a
   novel conventional relaying protocol for mixed rate transmission, which
   yields the same multiplexing gain as the protocol with adaptive link
   selection. Hence, for mixed rate transmission, for sufficiently large
   average delays, buffer-aided half-duplex relaying with and without
   adaptive link selection does not suffer from a multiplexing gain loss
   compared to full-duplex relaying.}},

Abstract = {{In the fossil-fuel-based economies, current remedies for the CO2
   reduction from large-scale energy consumers (e.g. power stations and
   cement works) mainly rely on carbon capture and storage, having three
   proposed generic solutions: post-combustion capture, pre-combustion
   capture, and oxy fuel combustion. All the aforementioned approaches are
   based on various physical and chemical phenomena including absorption,
   adsorption, and cryogenic capture of CO2. The purified carbon dioxide is
   sent for the physical storage options afterwards, using the earth as a
   gigantic reservoir with unknown long-term environmental impacts as well
   as possible hazards associated with that. Consequently, the ultimate
   solution for the CO2 sequestration is the chemical transformation of
   this stable molecule to useful products such as fuels (through, for
   example, FischerTropsch chemistry) or polymers (through successive
   copolymerization and chain growth). This sustainably reduces carbon
   emissions, taking full advantage of CO2-derived chemical commodities,
   so-called carbon capture and conversion. Nevertheless, the surface
   chemistry of CO2 reduction is a challenge due to the presence of large
   energy barriers, requiring noticeable catalysis. This work aims to
   review the most recent advances in this concept selectively (CO2
   conversion to fuels and CO2 copolymerization) with chemical engineering
   approach in terms of both materials and process design. Some of the most
   promising studies are expanded in detail, concluding with the necessity
   of subsidizing more research on CO2 conversion technologies considering
   the growing global concerns on carbon management. Copyright (c) 2013

Abstract = {{We critically examine the applicability of the semi-analytical approach
   of Shur (M. Shur, Electron Lett 12, 615 (1976)) in evaluating the
   transient electron transport response of gallium arsenide, gallium
   nitride, and zinc oxide. In particular, we contrast results obtained
   using this semi-analytical approach of Shur with those obtained using
   Monte Carlo simulations of the electron transport. Our approach will be
   to examine the response of an ensemble of electrons to the application
   of a constant and uniform applied electric field. For the purposes of
   this analysis, three aspects of the transient electron transport
   response will be considered: (1) the dependence of the electron drift
   velocity on the time elapsed since the onset of the applied electric
   field, (2) the dependence of the average electron energy on the time
   elapsed since the onset of the applied electric field, and (3) the
   dependence of the average electron displacement on the time elapsed
   since the onset of the applied electric field. The results obtained show
   that this semi-analytical approach of Shur produces results that are
   very similar to those produced using Monte Carlo simulations. Thus, this
   semi-analytical approach of Shur should be applicable for the treatment
   of non-uniform and time-varying electric fields, making it a useful tool
   for the treatment of the transient electron transport response within
   electron device configurations.}},

Abstract = {{The slip behavior of several high-density polyethylenes (HDPEs) is
   studied as a function of molecular weight (M-w) and its distribution for
   broad molecular weight distribution metallocene and Ziegler-Natta
   catalyst resins. It is found that slip depends strongly on M-w and its
   distribution. First, the slip velocity increases with decrease of
   molecular weight, which is expected to decay to zero as the M-w
   approaches a value with characteristic molecular dimension similar to
   surface asperities. For HDPEs that exhibit stick-slip transition, the
   slip velocity has been found to increase with increase of
   polydispersity. The opposite dependence is shown for HDPEs of wider
   molecular weight distribution that do not exhibit stick-slip transition.
   A criterion is also discussed as to the occurrence or not of the
   stick-slip transition which is found to depend strongly on M-w and its
   distribution. (C) 2013 The Society of Rheology.

Abstract = {{The goal of a water distribution system (WDS) is to deliver safe water
   with desirable quality, quantity and continuity to the consumers. In
   some cases, a WDS fails to deliver safe water due to the compromise/
   failure of water quality which may have devastating consequences. The
   frequency and consequence of a water quality failure (WQF) can be
   reduced if prognostic analysis and necessary remedial measures are taken
   on time. This study developed a prognostic model to predict WQF
   potential in a WDS. The study identifies important factors (parameters)
   which can directly and/or indirectly linked to WQFs. These factors are
   classified into two groups-the causes of WQF such as lack of free
   residual chlorine, or excess of total organic carbon, and the symptoms
   of WQF such as taste \& odor, color which are in fact the effects of
   certain causes of WQF. The interrelationships among the symptoms and the
   causes have been established based on extensive literature review and
   elicited expert opinion. A fuzzy-TOPSIS-OWA-based model has been
   developed to identify the impacts of different influencing parameters on
   the overall WQF potential. The developed model has been implemented for
   a WDS in Quebec City (Canada). To study the impacts of uncertainties of
   the influencing factors, a Monte Carlo simulation-based sensitivity
   analysis has been carried out. It is anticipated that the developed
   model can help water utilities to understand the role of different
   factors on WQF.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS \& MANUFACTURE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{81-90}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Machine tool's productivity is a function of the dynamic response
   between the spindle nose and table, which varies as a function of drive
   positions within the machine work volume. The position-dependent
   structural dynamics results in varying stability of the machine. This
   paper presents a computationally efficient methodology to evaluate and
   improve dynamic performance of a machine tool at the design stage. An
   efficient position-dependent multibody dynamic model of a machine tool
   is developed based on reduced model substructural synthesis. The
   experimentally validated reduced machine model simulates
   position-dependent behavior with significantly less computational effort
   than commonly used full order Finite Element models. The proposed
   modeling strategy is used to identify weak components of an experimental
   machine, which limit the productivity due to chatter. The identified
   weak machine component is modified and the complete dynamics are rapidly
   analyzed by virtually re-assembling the machine using reduced order
   models. Optimal design modifications are shown to increase productivity
   by similar to 25\%. The proposed method can be used for efficient
   simulation of structural dynamics, stability assessment as well as
   interactions of the CNC and cutting process with the machine tool
   structure in a virtual environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The particle size distribution and packing (loose bulk and tapped
   density) of a mixture of ground biomass from Douglas fir wood particles
   was characterized by different practical methods: sieving, digital
   imaging and scanning electron microscopy. The ground mixture was
   analyzed using a set of 14 wire mesh sieves. The calculated mean
   diameter of mixture was 251 mu m. The mixture was divided into four size
   fractions of mean size ranging from 74 to 781 mu m. Particle length
   measured by imaging technique were 34 times larger than the mean
   diameter determined by sieve analysis. Similarly, particle width was
   1.02.5 times larger than mean particle diameter. The sphericity of
   particles in each of the four fractions increased with decreasing size
   of the sieve indicating that smaller particles also have a smaller
   aspect ratio. Empirical power law equations were developed to correlate
   the packing and flow ability of ground particles (HR) to the mean
   diameter, with R-2 values of 0.88 and 0.91, respectively. The HR values
   indicated good flow ability for the large particles and poor flow
   ability for the smallest particles and the entire mixture. HR and
   porosity ratio reached an asymptote for particles larger than 400 mu m.}},

Abstract = {{A dissolved oxygen (DO) model is calibrated and verified for a highly
   polluted River Ravi with large flow variations. The model calibration is
   done under medium flow conditions (431.5 m(3)/s), whereas the model
   verification is done using the data collected during low flow conditions
   (52.6 m(3)/s). Biokinetic rate coefficients for carbonaceous biochemical
   oxygen demand (CBOD) and nitrogenous biochemical oxygen demand (NBOD)
   (i.e, K (cr) and K (n) ) are determined through the measured CBOD and
   ammonia river profiles. The calculated values of K (cr) and K (n) are
   0.36 day(-1) and 0.34 day(-1), respectively. The close agreement between
   the DO model results and the field values shows that the verified model
   can be used to develop DO management strategies for the River Ravi. The
   biokinetic coefficients are known to vary with degree of treatment (DOT)
   and therefore need to be adjusted for a rational water quality
   management model. The effect of this variation on level of treatment has
   been evaluated by using the verified model to attain a DO standard of 4
   mg/L in the river using the biokinetic rate coefficients as determined
   during the model calibration and verification process. The required DOT
   in this case is found to be 96 \%, whereas the DOT is 86 \% if adjusted
   biokinetic rate coefficients are used to reflect the effect of
   wastewater treatment. The cost of wastewater treatment is known to
   increase exponentially as the removal efficiency increases; therefore,
   the use of appropriate biokinetic coefficients to manage the water
   quality in rivers is important.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a fast and efficient algorithm for the calculation
   of electromagnetic fields radiated from lightning return-stroke channel
   as well as lightning-induced voltages in frequency-dependent
   transmission lines. The algorithm developed in this paper employs a
   mixed time-frequency macro-model that is based on tracing the poles and
   residues of the transfer function of the lightning-transmission-line
   system. Accurate and fast calculation of electromagnetic field data
   along the excited transmission line is critical to obtain the source
   terms (or forcing functions) in field-to-transmission-line coupling
   equations. Using the proposed method, we are able to obtain a closed
   form solution for the lumped sources required for the analysis of a
   two-conductor transmission line exposed to nonuniform electromagnetic
   fields. The algorithm provides high accuracy as well as significant
   speed gain for multiconductor transmission lines (MTL) as well. To
   demonstrate the application of the proposed method, we will compare our
   results with those obtained using other methods or measurements. (C)

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common neurodegenerative movement
   disorder, has traditionally been considered a ``classic{''} basal
   ganglia disease, as the most obvious pathology is seen in the
   dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Nevertheless
   recent discoveries in anatomical connections linking the basal ganglia
   and the cerebellum have led to a re-examination of the role of the
   cerebellum in the pathophysiology of PD. This review summarizes the role
   of the cerebellum in explaining many curious features of PD: the
   significant variation in disease progression between individuals; why
   severity of dopaminergic deficit correlates with many features of PD
   such as bradykinesia, but not tremor; and why PD subjects with a
   tremor-predominant presentation tend to have a more benign prognosis. it
   is clear that the cerebellum participates in compensatory mechanisms
   associated with the disease and must be considered an essential
   contributor to the overall pathophysiology of PD.}},

Abstract = {{Within the framework of the model of Read {[}Philos. Mag. 45, 775 (
   1954)], we examine the occupancy of the dislocation lines within n-type
   wurtzite gallium nitride. In particular, we examine the transition that
   occurs as the bulk doping concentration is increased, from the depletion
   limit to the non-depletion limit. We note that an abrupt transitional
   bulk doping concentration can be defined. The dependence of this
   transitional bulk doping concentration on the dislocation line density
   is then determined. We note that existing theoretical results on the
   occupation statistics of the threading dislocation lines within wurtzite
   gallium nitride also exhibit such a transition. Since these theoretical
   results assume different structures for the core of the threading
   dislocation lines, we conclude that this transition between the
   depletion and non-depletion domains should be a universal feature,
   holding true irrespective of the particular structure being assumed for
   the core of the threading dislocation lines. Conditions under which this
   abrupt transition smoothens are also discussed. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing

Pages = {{1231-1236}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{Finite element (FE) analysis based on quantitative computed tomography
   (QCT) images is an emerging tool to estimate bone strength in a specific
   patient or specimen; however, it is limited by the computational power
   required and the associated time required to generate and solve the
   models. Thus, our objective was to develop a fast, validated method to
   estimate whole bone structural stiffness and failure load in addition to
   a sensitivity analysis of varying boundary conditions. We performed QCT
   scans on twenty fresh-frozen proximal femurs (age: 77 +/- 13 years) and
   mechanically tested the femurs in a configuration that simulated a
   sideways fall on the hip. We used custom software to generate the FE
   models with boundary conditions corresponding to the mechanical tests
   and solved the linear models to estimate bone structural stiffness and
   estimated failure load. For the sensitivity analysis, we varied the
   internal rotation angle of the femoral neck from -30 degrees to 45
   degrees at 15 degrees intervals and estimated structural stiffness at
   each angle. We found both the FE estimates of structural stiffness
   (R-2=0.89, p<0.01) and failure load (R-2=0.81, p<0.01) to be in high
   agreement with the values found by mechanical testing. An important
   advantage of these methods was that the models of approximately 500,000
   elements took less than 11 min to solve using a standard desktop
   workstation. In this study we developed and validated a method to
   quickly and accurately estimate proximal femur structural stiffness and
   failure load using QCT-driven FE methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   mechanical mixer}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{22-31}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{Dispersion of gas in pulp suspensions was investigated downstream of an
   in-line mechanical mixer for fibre mass concentrations from 0\% to
   3.0\%, superficial liquid/pulp velocities from 0.5 to 3.0 m/s,
   superficial gas velocities from 0.11 to 0.44 m/s and impeller speeds
   from 0 to 800 rpm, based on electrical resistance tomography (ERT) and a
   gas mixing index, derived from the standard deviation of local gas
   holdup. When buoyancy was less significant, bubbles dispersed uniformly
   in the high-shear zone just downstream of the impeller, with
   considerably better mixing than without the impeller. Reflocculation
   then likely occurred downstream, accelerating bubble coalescence and
   demixing, especially for higher suspension concentrations. For
   buoyancy-dominated flow, however, the impeller disrupted the fibre
   networks, and buoyancy caused the gas to segregate to the top of the
   pipe, resulting in worse mixing than for no impeller. Gas dispersion
   improved downstream at higher fibre mass concentrations, likely due to
   re-forming of fibre networks causing liquid/pulp slugs and elongated
   bubble flow at the top of the pipe, whereas stratified flow occurred at
   lower concentrations. Mixing improved with decreasing impeller speed,
   likely because fibre networks re-established more rapidly. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Hydrate formation experiments were conducted for a methane/propane
   (90.5/9.5 mol\%) gas mixture employing a new contact mode by dispersing
   water between silica sand to evaluate the performance of poly-N-vinyl
   pyrrolidone (PVP) as a kinetic hydrate inhibitor. Experiments were
   performed in the presence of water and different concentrations of PVP
   solutions (0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 wt\%, respectively). Induction time before
   heterogeneous nucleation and subsequent hydrate growth was assessed by
   dispersing the water in the interstitial pores of the silica sand. The
   experiments were conducted at a starting pressure of 4.25 MPa and at a
   constant temperature of 4.0 degrees C. It was found that the induction
   times for 0.1\% PVP solutions were about the same of pure water. For the
   0.5 wt\% PVP solutions, induction times were ten times higher and for
   1.0 wt\% PVP it was five times higher than pure water. Hydrate formation
   reached a plateau in one hour for the experiments conducted with pure
   water while it took longer time (3 h or more) for the experiments
   conducted in the presence of 1 wt\% PVP solutions. This was due to the
   fact that hydrate growth rate was found to decrease with the increase in
   the concentration of the PVP solutions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Selection of remedial alternatives for mine sites: A multicriteria
   decision analysis approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{36-46}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{The selection of remedial alternatives for mine sites is a complex task
   because it involves multiple criteria and often with conflicting
   objectives. However, an existing framework used to select remedial
   alternatives lacks multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) aids and does
   not consider uncertainty in the selection of alternatives. The objective
   of this paper is to improve the existing framework by introducing
   deterministic and probabilistic MCDA methods. The Preference Ranking
   Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) methods have
   been implemented in this study. The MCDA analysis involves processing
   inputs to the PROMETHEE methods that are identifying the alternatives,
   defining the criteria, defining the criteria weights using analytical
   hierarchical process (AHP), defining the probability distribution of
   criteria weights, and conducting Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS); running
   the PROMETHEE methods using these inputs; and conducting a sensitivity
   analysis. A case study was presented to demonstrate the improved
   framework at a mine site. The results showed that the improved framework
   provides a reliable way of selecting remedial alternatives as well as
   quantifying the impact of different criteria on selecting alternatives.

Abstract = {{Amorphous Os films (thickness up to 140 nm) were electrodeposited onto
   Pt/quartz crystal resonator-electrodes by differential potential pulse
   voltammetry (DPV). The morphological features of the Os films and the
   associated electrocatalytic activity for BH4- oxidation in 2 M NaOH were
   investigated by surface analysis techniques (XPS, SIMS, SEM and XRD) and
   electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance. The thin films, composed of
   both metallic Os and OsO2, morphologically are comprised of
   interconnected agglomerates of 100 nm diameter (or lower). The surface
   roughness and specific surface area of the Os film can be varied by the
   number of potential deposition pulses applied, which affects the
   electrocatalytic activity. These amorphous films demonstrated
   outstanding electrocatalytic activity for BH4- oxidation. The Os
   electrode synthesized with 15 DPV (specific surface area 3.6 m(2) g(-1))
   generated a BH4- oxidation onset potential of -0.87 V vs. SHE, mass
   activity of 1240 A g(-1) and an electrochemical surface area (ESA) based
   specific activity of 347 A m(-2). The mass activity of the amorphous Os
   thin film was over an order of magnitude higher than previously reported
   mass activities for carbon-supported polycrystalline Pt or Os catalysts.
   The high catalytic activity can be partly attributed to the enhanced
   adsorption of BH4- on the Os thin film electrode over a wide potential
   range between -0.9 V and -0.2 V. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Life-cycle cost (LCC) analysis entails consideration of building
   performance throughout the structures' life. The impact and interaction
   of topology irregularities and construction quality (CQ) on LCC,
   however, are often ignored and require a more detailed evaluation. In
   this article, different levels and interaction of soft story (SS) and CQ
   are analytically modeled to quantify corresponding fragility curves and
   LCC (by considering hazard level, limit state cost, and probability of
   being in different damage states). The proposed method is illustrated
   with a three-, six-, and nine-story reinforced concrete building located
   in Vancouver (located in west coast of Canada).}},

Abstract = {{Biomass combustion in cookstoves has a substantial impact on human
   health, affects CO2 levels in the atmosphere, and black carbon (BC) and
   organic carbon (OC) affect the earth's radiative balance. Various
   initiatives propose to replace traditional fires with ``improved{''}
   (nontraditional) cookstoves to offset negative local and global effects.
   In this laboratory study, we compared the size, composition, and
   morphology of ultrafine particulate emissions from a ``three-stone{''}
   traditional fire to those from two improved stove designs (one
   ``rocket{''}, one ``gasifier{''}). Measurement tools included a scanning
   mobility particle sizer, PTFE and quartz filter samples, and
   transmission electron microscopy. In the improved stoves, particulate
   mass (PM) emissions factors were much lower although median particle
   size was also lower: 35 and 24 nm for the rocket and gasifier,
   respectively, vs 61 nm for the three-stone fire. Particles from improved
   stoves formed clearly defined chain agglomerates and independent spheres
   with little evidence of volatile matter and had a higher proportion of
   BC to total PM, although overall BC emissions factors were fairly
   uniform. The 3-fold increase in quantities of sub-30 nm particles from
   improved cookstoves warrants further consideration by health scientists,
   with due consideration to the higher combustion efficiencies of improved
   cookstoves.}},

   ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic response of a machine tool structure varies along the tool path
   depending on the changes in its structural configurations. The
   productivity of the machine tool varies as a function of its frequency
   response function (FRF) which determines its chatter stability and
   productivity. This paper presents a computationally efficient reduced
   order model to obtain the FRF at the tool center point of a machine tool
   at any desired position within its work volume. The machine tool is
   represented by its position invariant substructures. These substructures
   are assembled at the contacting interfaces by using novel adaptations of
   constraint formulations. As the tool moves to a new position, these
   constraint equations are updated to predict the FRFs efficiently without
   having to use computationally costly full order finite element or modal
   models. To facilitate dynamic substructuring, an improved variant of
   standard component mode synthesis method is developed which automates
   reduced order determination by retaining only the important modes of the
   subsystems. Position-dependent dynamic behavior and chatter stability
   charts are successfully simulated for a virtual three axis milling
   machine, using the substructurally synthesized reduced order model.
   Stability lobes obtained using the reduced order model agree well with
   the corresponding full-order system.}},

Abstract = {{Erosion-corrosion is common in oil and gas processing plants and

   corrosive media and aluminum oxide as the erodent. The total material
   loss rate and the components of erosion, corrosion and their synergistic
   interactions have been determined. A test setup was designed to mitigate
   the limitations of the in situ method (to avoid the fluctuation in
   electrochemical data due to bubble formation and turbulence). The flow
   velocity was varied from 36 to 81 m s(-1), while angle of incidence was
   kept constant at 90 degrees. The experimental results show that there is
   an immense correlation exists between erosion and corrosion. It was
   observed that erosion enhances corrosion and corrosion enhances erosion
   with each contributing to significant synergism. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Particle mass, mobility, volatile mass fraction, effective density, mass
   concentration, mass-mobility exponent, and particle morphology were
   measured from soot generated from a premixed flame (McKenna burner) and
   an inverted diffusion flame over a range of equivalence ratios. It was
   found that the mass fraction of volatile material on the soot from the
   McKenna burner could be up to 0.83 at a high equivalence ratio, but
   there was no measurable volatile material on the soot from the inverted
   burner. The inverted burner can produce soot at different mass-mobility
   exponents, ranging from 2.23 to 2.54, over a range of global equivalence
   ratios of 0.53-0.67, while the mass-mobility exponent ranges from 2.19
   to 2.99 for fresh soot and 2.19 to 2.81 for denuded soot for the McKenna
   burner at equivalence ratios of 2.0-3.75. Transmission electron
   microscopy analysis of inverted burner soot shows that a range of
   particle morphologies is present at a given global equivalence ratio,
   likely due to different local equivalence ratios and flame conditions in
   the diffusion flame. Primary particle diameter tends to increase with
   aggregate size, which could contribute to the mass-mobility exponent
   being well above 2. Copyright 2013 American Association for Aerosol

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an approach to the control of linear
   teleoperation systems under time delays. Unlike traditional delay-robust
   control systems that guarantee passive communication channel through the
   transmission of wave variables, the new approach uses the concept of
   absolute stability for the physically expressive Lawrence's four-channel
   structure for transmitting the standard power variables, i.e., force and
   position. By incorporating kinesthetic performance requirements, we
   derive an absolutely stable four-channel controller that is transparent
   when time delay is negligible. Experimentally, the study evaluates and
   compares the performance of the proposed controller with that of a
   benchmark wave variable-based controller. The results indicate contact
   stability for large delays, a lack of position drift, and improved
   position and force tracking in both the free motion and rigid contact
   regimes for small delays.}},

Abstract = {{Mixing effectiveness was determined experimentally for side jet

   measured in cross-sectional planes along the pipe using electrical

   strongly on the flow regime and jet penetration. For turbulent flow, the
   criteria for in-line jet mixing in water are applicable to the mixing in
   suspensions, with small differences likely due to differences in fiber
   network strength and influences of fiber-turbulence interactions in
   modifying turbulent structures in the bulk. When a suspension flows as a
   plug, however, the mixing differs greatly from that in water, depending

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{396-407}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Seismic performance analysis is conducted for an isolated three-span
   continuous highway bridge, which is subjected to moderate to strong
   earthquake ground accelerations in the longitudinal direction. Two types
   of isolation bearings are used in the analysis: high damping rubber
   bearing (HDRB) and combined isolation bearing consisting of shape memory
   alloy (SMA) wires and natural rubber bearing (NRB) entitled as SMA-based
   rubber bearing (SRB). Two types of SMA wires, such as Ni-Ti and
   Cu-Al-Be, are used in fabricating the combined isolation bearings. In
   the first step of the work, analytical models for HDRB. NRB and SRB are
   introduced. Then, a three-span continuous highway bridge is modeled in a
   simplified form, using 2-DOF bridge pier-bearing system isolated by
   either HDRBs or SRBs. The hysteretic behavior of HDRB is evaluated using
   a strain-rate dependent constitutive model (i.e. visco-elasto-plastic
   model), while in the case of SRBs the hysteretic behavior is modeled by
   a nonlinear elasto-plastic model for NRB and a simplified visco-elastic
   model for SMAs. A standard bilinear force-displacement relationship is
   employed in the analytical model of the bridge pier to consider its
   nonlinear characteristic behavior. Nonlinear dynamic analysis of the
   bridge, based on the direct time integration approach, is conducted to
   evaluate the seismic responses of the bridge. This study shows that the
   seismic responses of the bridge are affected by the use of different
   types of isolation bearings; more specifically, residual displacement of
   the deck are noticeably reduced after earthquakes in the case of SRBs
   compared to HDRB for moderate and strong earthquakes; however, pier
   displacements are smaller in the cases of SRBs for moderate earthquakes
   and higher for strong earthquakes. Other response parameters of the
   system, such as deck displacement, bearing displacement and deck
   acceleration, are significantly larger in the cases of SRBs compared to
   those of HDRB. This study also depicts the effect of modeling of

Abstract = {{Elastomeric base isolators minimize the structural damage in moderate
   seismic events and prevent structural collapse in extreme conditions
   like earthquakes. They considerably decrease the earthquake force
   transmitted to the structure by providing a flexible damping mechanism
   between the substructure and the superstructure, thanks to their very
   low horizontal-to-vertical stiffness ratio. This paper presents a
   multi-criteria optimization process for fiber-reinforced elastomeric
   isolators (FREIs) used in bridges. FREI is made of high damping rubber
   and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composite plates. Here, a
   numerical material model is proposed for high damping rubber using
   finite element (FE) simulation to capture its highly nonlinear behavior.
   After validating this material model with experimental results, the
   effect of different parameters on the efficiency of the elastomeric
   bearing will be investigated through a sensitivity analysis performed by
   proposing regression models. The performance of FREI is optimized by
   assigning different weights to its operational specifications which are
   the effective horizontal and vertical stiffnesses and the equivalent
   viscous damping. Results show that the effective horizontal stiffness
   and viscous damping are highly dependent on the shear modulus of the
   elastomer layers. Also, the number of rubber layers and thickness of FRP
   composite plates have large effects on the vertical stiffness. Finally,
   an isolated three-span continuous steel girder reinforced concrete pier
   supported bridge is fitted with the optimized FREI in order to
   analytically study the performance of the rubber bearing on the seismic
   behavior of the bridge structure through dynamic time history analyses.

Abstract = {{This paper reports a bulk-micromachined shape-memory-alloy (SMA)
   actuator in the form of a spiral coil that constitutes an
   inductor-capacitor resonant circuit. The out-of-plane actuation of the
   SMA spiral-coil inductor is wirelessly controlled using external radio
   frequency (RF) magnetic fields. The resonant circuit is used as a
   frequency-selective wireless heater in which the SMA inductor produces
   heat to activate its own actuation when resonated with the RF magnetic
   field. The direct integration of bulk-micromachined nitinol SMA with a
   threshold temperature of 65 degrees C into a planar microfabrication
   process is enabled to build the 3-D spiral-coil SMA actuator in a
   self-assembled manner using a SiO2 reset layer patterned on the SMA
   coil. The fabricated SMA structure yields an out-of-plane displacement
   of 466 mu m in the cold state. The full actuation to the flat state is
   reached at 70 degrees C upon tuning the field frequency to similar to
   230 MHz with an RF output power of 0.7 W. The developed actuator is
   demonstrated to provide a maximum force of 30 mN. The temporal response
   of the actuator is revealed to be two to three times faster than that of
   previously reported wireless SMA actuators with separate heat sources.}},

Abstract = {{On-line estimation plays an important role in process control and
   monitoring. Obtaining a theoretical solution to the simultaneous
   state-parameter estimation problem for non-linear stochastic systems
   involves solving complex multi-dimensional integrals that are not
   amenable to analytical solution. While basic sequential Monte-Carlo
   (SMC) or particle filtering (PF) algorithms for simultaneous estimation
   exist, it is well recognized that there is a need for making these
   on-line algorithms non-degenerate, fast and applicable to processes with
   missing measurements. To overcome the deficiencies in traditional
   algorithms, this work proposes a Bayesian approach to on-line state and
   parameter estimation. Its extension to handle missing data in real-time
   is also provided. The simultaneous estimation is performed by filtering
   an extended vector of states and parameters using an adaptive
   sequential-importance-resampling (SIR) filter with a kernel density
   estimation method. The approach uses an on-line optimization algorithm
   based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to allow adaptation of the SIR
   filter for combined state-parameter estimation. An optimal tuning rule
   to control the width of the kernel and the variance of the artificial
   noise added to the parameters is also proposed. The approach is
   illustrated through numerical examples. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{Raman spectra often contain undesirable, randomly positioned, intense,
   narrow-bandwidth, positive, unidirectional spectral features generated
   when cosmic rays strike charge-coupled device cameras. These must be
   removed prior to analysis, but doing so manually is not feasible for
   large data sets. We developed a quick, simple, effective, semi-automated
   procedure to remove cosmic ray spikes from spectral data sets that
   contain large numbers of relatively homogenous spectra. Although some
   inhomogeneous spectral data sets can be accommodated-it requires
   replacing excessively modified spectra with the originals and removing
   their spikes with a median filter instead-caution is advised when
   processing such data sets. In addition, the technique is suitable for
   interpolating missing spectra or replacing aberrant spectra with good
   spectral estimates. The method is applied to baseline-flattened spectra
   and relies on fitting a third-order (or higher) polynomial through all
   the spectra at every wavenumber. Pixel intensities in excess of a
   threshold of 3 x the noise standard deviation above the fit are reduced
   to the threshold level. Because only two parameters (with readily
   specified default values) might require further adjustment, the method
   is easily implemented for semi-automated processing of large spectral
   sets.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a micropatterned variable inductor that utilizes
   ferrofluid as the movable magnetic core. Ferrofluid is displaced over
   the planar inductor using the magnetic field provided by another

   bias field on the varying magnetic field uniquely enables repelling of
   the fluid from the inductor, as well as switching between repelling and
   attracting motions simply by changing the direction of the driving
   current to the actuation coil. Microfabricated devices are tested to
   reveal that the repelling-mode operation provides 6.1 x larger inductive
   changes than those available with the attracting mode. The continuous
   modulation of inductance is demonstrated with a tuning range of 16\%
   using input currents up to 1.2 A. Frequency tuning using a resonant tank

   demonstrated. The results indicate that a combination of the CNT-based
   contact and the SMA actuator may be a promising path to realizing
   reliable MEMS contact switches for high-power applications.}},

Title = {{Recovery of CH4 from coal mine model gas mixture (CH4/N-2) by hydrate
   crystallization in the presence of cyclopentane}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{425-430}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This work presents how water containing cyclopentane (CP) can facilitate
   the recovery of methane from the CH4/N-2 coal mine gas mixture through
   hydrate crystallization. Gas hydrate formed in the CH4/N-2/CP/H2O system
   has more favorable equilibrium conditions than that formed in pure water
   with the same gas mixture. The incipient equilibrium conditions at 4.0
   and 13.0 wt\% CP were measured and are reported. The dynamics of hydrate
   formation using a 30 mol\% CH4/N-2 gas mixture were studied at 283.4 K,
   two CP concentrations (4.0 and 13.0 wt\%) and at 2.6 and 3.8 MPa. These
   hydrate formation pressures correspond to 2.3 and 3.5 MPa overpressures
   (driving forces) respectively. It was found that CH4 is preferentially
   incorporated into the hydrate crystal compared to N-2. However, N-2
   competes with CH4 to enter the hydrate crystal at the higher driving
   force. The CH4 recovery substantially increases as the CP concentration
   is increased from 4.0 to 13.0 wt\%. The experimental condition of 283.4
   K, 2.6 MPa, and 13.0 wt\% CP is preferred for the separation of CH4 from
   the 30 mol\% CH4/N-2 gas mixture. The CH4 recovery obtained at this
   condition is approximately 46.1\% and the corresponding CH4 content in
   the hydrate is 47.2 mol\%. A methane-rich stream (72 mol\% CH4/N-2) is
   obtained after two stages of gas hydrate formation in the presence of
   cyclopentane. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel computer-based virtual training system for
   prostate brachytherapy is presented. This system incorporates, in a
   novel way, prior methodologies of ultrasound image synthesis and haptic
   transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) transducer interaction in a complete
   simulator that allows a trainee to maneuver the needle and the TRUS, to
   see the resulting patient-specific images and feel the interaction
   forces. The simulated TRUS images reflect the volumetric tissue
   deformation and comprise validated appearance models for the needle and
   implanted seeds. Rendered haptic forces use validated models for needle
   shaft flexure and friction, tip cutting, and deflection due to bevel.
   This paper also presents additional new features that make the simulator
   complete, in the sense that all aspects of the brachytherapy procedure
   as practiced at many cancer centers are simulated, including simulations
   of seed unloading, fluoroscopy imaging, and transversal/sagittal TRUS
   plane switching. For real-time rendering, methods for fast
   TRUS-needle-seed image formation are presented. In addition, the
   simulator computes real-time dosimetry, allowing a trainee to
   immediately see the consequence of planning changes. The simulation is
   also patient specific, as it allows the user to import the treatment
   plan for a patient together with the imaging data in order for a
   physician to practice an upcoming procedure or for a medical resident to
   train using typical implant scenarios or rarely encountered cases.}},

Abstract = {{We present a multimodal in vivo skin imaging instrument that is capable
   of simultaneously acquiring multiphoton and reflectance confocal images
   at up to 27 frames per second with 256 x 256 pixel resolution without
   the use of exogenous contrast agents. A single femtosecond laser
   excitation source is used for all channels ensuring perfect image
   registration between the two-photon fluorescence (TPF), second harmonic
   generation (SHG), and reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) images.
   Images and videos acquired with the system show that the three imaging
   channels provide complementary information in in vivo human skin
   measurements. In the epidermis, cell boundaries are clearly seen in the
   RCM channel, while cytoplasm is better seen in the TPF imaging channel,
   whereas in the dermis, SHG and TPF channels show collagen bundles and
   elastin fibers, respectively. The demonstrated fast imaging speed and
   multimodal imaging capabilities of this MPM/RCM instrument are essential
   features for future clinical application of this technique. ((c) 2013

Abstract = {{In this work we exploit two assumed properties of dynamic MRI in order

   assumptions lead to an optimization problem that requires minimizing a
   combined l(p)-norm and Schatten-p norm. We propose a novel FOCUSS based
   approach to solve the optimization problem. Our proposed method is
   compared with state-of-the-art techniques in dynamic MRI reconstruction.
   Experimental evaluation carried out on three real datasets shows that
   for all these datasets, our method yields better reconstruction both in

Abstract = {{Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have emerged as a promising technology
   that provides low-cost broadband access to the Internet for fixed and
   mobile wireless end users. An orthogonal evolution in computer
   networking has been the rise of peer-to-peer (P2P) applications such as
   P2P data sharing. It is of interest to enable effective P2P data sharing
   in this type of networks. Conventional P2P data sharing systems are not
   cognizant of the underlying network topology and therefore suffer from
   inefficiency. We argue for dual-layer mesh network architecture with
   support from wireless mesh routers for P2P applications. The main
   contribution of this paper is P2PMesh: a topology-aware system that
   provides combined architecture and efficient schemes for enabling
   efficient P2P data sharing in WMNs. The P2PMesh architecture utilizes
   three schemes: (i) an efficient content lookup that mitigates traffic
   load imbalance at mesh routers; (ii) an efficient establishment of
   download paths; and (iii) a data transfer protocol for multi-hop
   wireless networks with limited capacity. We note here that the path
   establishment and data transfer schemes are specific to P2P traffic and
   that other traffic would use routes determined by the default routing
   protocol in the WMN. Simulation results suggest that P2PMesh has the
   potential to improve the performance of P2P applications in a wireless
   multi-hop setting; specifically, we focused on data sharing, but other
   P2P applications can also be supported by this approach. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Field data and two linear layered models were used to examine the
   baroclinic response to wind in a small elongated two-basin lake, Amisk
   Lake (Alberta, Canada). For the first vertical baroclinic mode,
   wind-forced horizontal modes were simulated using a dynamic two-layer
   variable cross-section (TVC) model. The first horizontal mode, H1, was
   found to dominate the exchange between the two basins of Amisk Lake. The
   highest velocities associated with H1 occurred in the constricted
   channel connecting the two basins. This high velocity led to strong
   damping which brought H1 in near-resonance with the diurnal wind despite
   a difference in periods. Along with H1, the second horizontal mode, H2,
   was detected at a thermistor mooring. The TVC showed that H2 resulted
   from the coupling between along-thalweg wind distribution and the
   bathymetry of Amisk Lake. The damping for H2 was found to be weaker than
   for H1, likely because of weaker bottom drag in the connecting channel.
   The evolution of vertical H1 modes were simulated using a multi-layered
   box model. In response to wind pulses, the first vertical mode V1H1
   initially dominated over higher vertical modes causing two-layer
   exchange. Following the faster decay of V1H1, higher vertical modes
   shifted the exchange to three and more layers. Our study shows the
   importance of the coupling between wind stress distribution and lake
   bathymetry in exciting horizontal modes, reveals the effect of damping
   on resonance with wind, and explains the evolution of exchange
   associated with vertical modes.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reports the spatial distribution and contamination level of
   heavy metals (Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn and V) in urban topsoil from
   the interior area of the second ringroad of Xi'an city, China, based on
   X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy measurements. Geostatistical analysis
   shows that Co, Cu, and Pb have similar spatial distribution patterns.
   Heavy traffic density mainly contributed to the high concentrations of
   Co, Cu and Pb. The spatial distribution of Cr coincides with the
   industrial activity, whereas the spatial distribution of Zn differs from
   other heavy metals. The high concentrations of Zn coincide with heavy
   traffic and high population density. For Mn, Ni and V, natural factors
   are important in controlling their distribution. The calculated
   geoaccumulation indices indicate that urban topsoil inside the Xi'an
   second ringroad was uncontaminated by Cr, V, Mn and Ni, while Pb, Cu, Co
   and Zn are classified as uncontaminated to moderately contaminated with
   means of 0.64, 0.46, 0.26 and 0.21, respectively. The Nemero synthesis
   pollution index of these heavy metals revealed that the topsoil inside
   Xi'an second ringroad has been heavily contaminated due to anthropogenic

Abstract = {{One-shot recognition has attracted increasing attention recently,
   inspired by the fact that human cognitive systems could perform
   recognition tasks well provided only one or a few labeled training
   samples, in contrast to the conventional object recognition systems that
   require a large number of labeled training images. One-shot recognition
   is a visual classification task, where only one training sample is
   available for each object category in the target test domain, with the
   help of prior-knowledge data from the source domain. In this paper, we
   tackle this challenging one-shot recognition problem under a more
   exciting setting by using only unlabeled images as prior knowledge,
   which requires less labeling effort than previous works which adopt
   fully labeled data and/or a sophisticated attribute table designed by
   human experts. We propose a novel unsupervised hierarchical feature
   learning framework to learn a feature pyramid from the prior-knowledge
   domain. The proposed feature learning method also could be applied
   across multiple feature spaces. Furthermore, we propose using
   pyramid-matching kernels to combine multilevel features. Examining the
   ``Animals with Attributes{''} and Caltech-4 data sets in our one-shot
   recognition setting, we show that the proposed unsupervised feature
   learning approach with very limited information could achieve comparable
   performance to that of supervised ones.}},

Abstract = {{We present Speculative Authorization (SPAN), a prediction technique that
   reduces authorization latency in enterprise systems. SPAN predicts
   requests that a system client might make in the near future, based on
   its past behavior. SPAN allows authorization decisions for the predicted
   requests to be made before the requests are issued, thus virtually
   reducing the authorization latency to zero. We developed SPAN
   algorithms, implemented a prototype, and evaluated it using two
   real-world data traces and one synthetic data trace. The results of our
   evaluation suggest that systems employing SPAN are able to achieve a
   reduced authorization latency for almost 60 percent of the requests. We
   analyze the tradeoffs between the hit rate and the precision of SPAN
   predictions, which directly affect the corresponding computational
   overhead. We also compare the benefits of deploying both caching and
   SPAN together, and find that SPAN can effectively improve the
   performance of those systems which have caches of a smaller size.}},

Abstract = {{With the introduction of low-powered pico/femto-base stations and relay
   nodes into the macro-cell, recent heterogeneous networks provide an
   attractive approach for future wireless communication. Although it may
   achieve better coverage and higher capacity, several problems remain
   unsolved before practical deployment. For example, how to select the
   proper cell from neighbor low-powered cells and then occupy the radio
   resource without interference on macro-users is both important and
   challenging, especially for rigorous multimedia applications. The
   traditional cell access algorithms and quality-control parameters such
   as delay or throughput no longer suit well in this complex environment.
   An effective approach should be pursued. In this paper, we investigate
   this interesting cell association problem and propose a complete green
   resolution on the basis of thorough discussions about the multimedia
   transmission under these concerns. Cognitive radio is introduced to
   share spectrum between macro-cell and low-powered cells while securing
   the transmission of authorized macro-users. We also bring forth the
   concept of interference balance' to better manage the overall
   interference and energy consumption in the network. Restless bandit
   model is formulated on the basis of channel state, data rate,
   interference control, and the carefully chosen intra-refreshing rate for
   multimedia traffic. Then the cell association scheme is designed to be
   efficient and practical because of the simple index property of our
   model output. Simulation results have proven the performance of our
   proposed resolution compared with existing algorithms on interference
   constraint, multimedia distortion, and overall network energy
   consumption balance. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, microdroplet evaporation in the closed digital
   microfluidic systems is studied for hydrophobic and hydrophilic
   surfaces. The contact angle and contact radius are measured by an
   enhanced automated polynomial fitting approach. It is observed that the
   contact angle for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces remains
   constant during the evaporation process. However, a higher evaporation
   rate is observed for hydrophilic droplets compared to the hydrophobic
   droplets. Since no contact line pinning is observed, first, an
   analytical model based on the uniform vapor mass flux along the
   liquid-vapor interface is proposed. Interestingly, it is observed that
   in the hydrophobic case, the analytical model gives a higher evaporation
   rate, whereas for the hydrophilic case, the analytical model gives a
   lower evaporation rate. The discrepancy between the results of the
   analytical modeling and the experimental values is hypothesized to be
   due the constant flux assumption. To verify the hypothesis, a finite
   volume-based numerical model is developed to find the local flux along
   the liquid-vapor interface. The numerical modeling results confirm that
   for hydrophilic droplets, the evaporation flux increases very close to
   the three-phase contact line. In the case of the hydrophobic droplets,
   on the other hand, the flux decreases close to the contact line due to
   vapor saturation; as a result the uniform flux assumption overestimates
   the mass loss.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this study, two types of smart elastomeric bearings are presented
   using shape memory alloy (SMA) wires. Due to the unique characteristics
   of SMAs, such as the superelastic effect and the recentering capability,
   the residual deformation in SMA-based natural rubber bearings (SMA-NRBs)
   is significantly reduced whereas the energy dissipation capacity is
   increased. Two different configurations of SMA wires incorporated in
   elastomeric bearings are considered. The effect of several parameters,
   including the shear strain amplitude, the type of SMA, the aspect ratio
   of the base isolator, the thickness of SMA wire, and the amount of
   pre-strain in the wires on the performance of SMA-NRBs is investigated.
   Rubber bearings are composed of natural rubber layers bonded to steel
   shims as reinforcement. Results show that ferrous SMA wire, FeNiCuAlTaB,
   with 13.5\% superelastic strain and a very low austenite finish
   temperature (-62 degrees C), is the best candidate to be used in
   SMA-NRBs subjected to high shear strain amplitudes. In terms of the
   lateral flexibility and wire strain level, the smart rubber bearing with
   a cross configuration of SMA wires is more efficient. Moreover, the
   cross configuration can be implemented in high-aspect-ratio elastomeric
   bearings since the strain induced in the wire does not exceed the
   superelastic range. When cross SMA wires with 2\% pre-strain are used in
   a smart NRB, the dissipated energy is increased by 74\% and the residual
   deformation is decreased by 15\%.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effect of along-thalweg depth variability on the
   baroclinic response to wind in elongated narrow basins with a sharp
   thermocline. The effect of depth variability was examined by deriving a
   modal-based forced model with two density layers and applying the model
   to a symmetric curved-bottom basin (CB), an asymmetric wedge-shaped
   basin (with a sloping bottom towards a vertical wall, WB), and a
   flat-bottom basin (FB). The baroclinic responses of CB, WB, and FB to
   uniform wind were found to differ in time-scale, number and energy of
   excited modes, and temporal pattern and along-thalweg structure of
   baroclinic flow and thermocline deflection. For all bottom profiles that
   were examined, the fundamental mode was found to dominate the response
   to spatially-uniform wind. Compared to FB, the asymmetric depth
   variability in WB increased the number and energy of excited higher
   modes and localized the interface shear, while the symmetric deviation
   from flat bottom in CB caused the opposite effects. Linear deviation
   from uniform wind was found to feed energy into higher baroclinic modes
   for the symmetric CB, but was found to reduce the energy of higher
   baroclinic modes for WB when the deviation from uniform wind is
   comparable to the spatial-average magnitude. Our results can explain the
   observation of the second baroclinic mode and irregular wave patterns in
   some lakes and reservoirs. Further, our results suggest that
   one-dimensional vertical mixed-layer models provide better results for
   shear entrainment in curved-bottom basins than in wedge-shaped basins.}},

Abstract = {{Wrought magnesium alloys have been extensively used in the aerospace,
   electronics and automotive industries, where component weight is of
   concern and ambient temperatures remain below 100 A degrees C.
   Undesirable creep relaxation of the wrought alloys above this
   temperature has been generally attributed to grain boundary sliding and
   plastic deformation leading to intergranular failure. The objective of
   this study was to investigate the compressive creep performance and
   microstructure of two wrought magnesium alloys (AE42 and ZE10) developed
   for high temperature applications. The total deformation of the AE42 and
   ZE10 alloys was 2.4 and 0.2 \%, respectively, after 24 h creep test at
   175 A degrees C and 50 MPa. The poor creep performance of the AE42 alloy
   was explained via neutron diffraction studies which revealed that the
   elastic compressive response of planes was significantly more
   anisotropic in the AE42 than in the ZE10 alloy. Further, microstructural
   analysis revealed similar to 10 \% increase in grain size due to creep,
   with additional and twinning in the AE42 alloy. Precipitation of
   beta-Mg17Al12 phase in the AE42 alloy possibly contributed to grain
   boundary sliding and high plastic strain during creep testing.}},

Title = {{Emergy accounting for regional studies: Case study of Canada and its

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{118}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable regional management (development) requires an understanding
   of interactions between the social, economic, and ecological systems
   within the boundaries of a region. In this paper, application of emergy
   (an environmental accounting method) for regional planning is discussed
   through a case study. Emergy (spelled with an ``m{''}) methodology is an
   environmental accounting technique that evaluates the energy system for
   the thermodynamics of an open system. Major renewable and non-renewable
   resource fluxes to a region, including energy, matter, human activities,
   and money can be converted to emergy by using corresponding transformity
   functions.
   As a case study, this paper discusses the emergy accounting of Canada
   and its provinces with various emergy-based indicators. Moreover, emergy
   maps were generated in a form of emergy geography. These maps are
   multi-dimensional illustrations that show resource consumption, emergy
   per person, and emergy density across Canada under two parameters: (1)
   the quantities of resources consumed and (2) the location of
   consumption. Emergy analysis also highlights concentrations of renewable
   and natural resources in Canada and distinguishes the provinces with the
   highest resource consumption. Analysis of emergy indicator for Canadian
   provinces shows that Alberta with the highest EYR (7.35) provides energy
   to the economy of Canada. However, ELR value of Alberta (8.5) indicates
   that the province's current economic approach is not sustainable as it
   relies mainly on non-renewable emergy inputs (mainly from fossil fuels).
   ELR of British Columbia and Manitoba indicates that these two provinces
   created a firm balance between emergy use of renewable and non-renewable
   resources. The characterizations of regions provided in this paper can
   be used for future land planning and management both in federal and
   provincial levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Steady-state and transient electron transport within wurtzite and
   zinc-blende indium nitride}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{We study the steady-state and transient electron transport that occurs
   within wurtzite and zinc-blende indium nitride using a three-valley
   Monte Carlo simulation approach. For our steady-state results, we find
   that, for both cases, initially the electron drift velocity
   monotonically increases with the applied electric field strength,
   reaching a peak value followed by a region of negative differential
   mobility, and then a region of saturation. The peak fields are found to
   be around 30 kV/cm for the case of wurtzite indium nitride and about 50
   kV/cm for the case of zinc-blende indium nitride, the corresponding peak
   and saturation electron drift velocities being around 5.6 x 10(7) and
   1.2 x 10(7) cm/s for the case of wurtzite indium nitride and about 3.3 x
   10(7) and 1.0 x 10(7) cm/s for the case of zinc-blende indium nitride.
   For the purposes of our transient electron transport analysis, we follow
   the approach of O'Leary et al. {[}Appl. Phys. Lett. 87, 222103 (2005)],
   and examine how an ensemble of electrons responds to the sudden
   application of a constant electric field. We find that the electrons
   within wurtzite indium nitride exhibit higher electron drift velocities
   and longer relaxation times than those within zinc-blende indium
   nitride. The device implications of these results are then discussed.

Abstract = {{In the finish machining of a pocket corner, varying radial depth of cut
   is generally encountered by the end milling tool during the entry into
   and exit from the corner. This leads to substantial variability of the
   machining process. This paper presents the generation and application of
   a multiple looping tool path for corner machining with the objective to
   reduce the machining variability and improve the machining efficiency.
   Material removal rate is selected as the measure for the machining
   variability. To reduce the material removal rate for a straightforward
   corner machining tool path, feed rate needs to be decreased as the end
   mill approaches the corner apex and increased as it exits the corner.
   Instantaneous changes of feed rate are not possible in practice due to
   practical limitations on the servo drive system of common machine tools.
   A tool path of constant feed rate is thus preferred for effective corner
   machining. The looping tool path proposed in this work is composed of a
   series of smoothly connected linear and circular segments to ensure its
   applicability for all machine tools. For a given corner geometry, a
   single-cutter as well as a double-cutter strategy have been introduced
   to maximise the machining efficiency. Various case studies were carried
   out to examine the resulting material removal rate and total machining
   time for different machining operations.}},

Abstract = {{The potential-controlled incorporation of DOPC liposomes (100 nm
   diameter) into an adsorbed octadecanol layer on Au(111) was studied
   using electrochemical and in situ fluorescence microscopy. The adsorbed
   layer of octadecanol included a small amount of a lipophilic
   fluorophore-octadecanol modified with BODIPY-to enable fluorescence
   imaging. The deposited octadecanol layer was found not to allow
   liposomes to interact unless the potential was less than -0.4 V/SCE,
   which introduces defects into the adsorbed layer. Small increases in the
   capacitance of the adsorbed layer were measured after introducing the
   defects, allowing the liposomes to interact with the defects and then
   annealing the defects at 0 V/SCE. A change in the adsorbed layer was
   also signified by a more positive desorption potential for the
   liposome-modified adsorbed layer as compared to that for an adsorbed
   layer that was porated in a similar fashion but without liposomes
   present in the electrolyte. These subtle changes in capacitance are
   difficult to interpret, so an in situ spectroscopic study was performed
   to provide a more direct measure of the interaction. The incorporation
   of liposomes should result in an increase in the fluorescence measured
   because the fluorophore should become further separated from the gold
   surface, reducing the efficiency of fluorescence quenching. No
   significant increase in the fluorescence of the adsorbed layer was
   observed during the potential pulses used in the poration procedure in
   the absence of liposomes. In the presence of liposomes, the fluorescence
   intensity was found to depend on the potential and time used for
   poration. At 0 V/SCE, no significant change in the fluorescence was
   observed for defect-free adsorbed layers. Changing the poration
   potential to -0.4 V/SCE caused significant increases in the fluorescence
   and the appearance of new structural features in the adsorbed layers
   that were more easily observed during the desorption procedure. The
   extent of fluorescence changes was found to be strongly dependent on the
   nature of the adsorbed layer under investigation, which suggests that
   the poration and liposome interaction are dependent on the quality of
   the adsorbed layer and its ease of poration through changes in the
   electrode potential.}},

Abstract = {{A novel azeotropic distillation for sulfuric acid recovery, which uses
   organic solvents as entrainers, is proposed. This new distillation
   process may provide significant energy savings. Vapor-liquid equilibria
   (VLE) data were determined by the quasi-static ebulliometric method for
   the following systems at (30, 60, and 90) kPa: (1) sulfuric acid + water
   + ethanol; (2) sulfuric acid + water + butyl acetate; and (3) sulfuric
   acid + water + butyl acetate + ethanol. Through the use of the OLI
   software, a chemical model was established via regressing the
   experimental data to obtain the mixed solvent electrolyte (MSE) model
   parameters. The average absolute deviations of boiling points for all
   systems are only 1.34 K. The new model with newly obtained parameters
   was successfully applied to predict the VLE for the sulfuric acid +
   water + butyl acetate ternary system at constant pressure, providing
   important VLE information for the recovery of spent sulfuric acid by
   this new azeotropic distillation technology.}},

Abstract = {{The landuse/cover changes in the Ethiopian highlands have significantly
   increased the variability of runoff and sediment fluxes of the Blue Nile
   River during the last few decades. The objectives of this study were (i)
   to understand the long-term variations of runoff and sediment fluxes
   using statistical models, (ii) to interpret and corroborate the
   statistical results using a physically-based hydrological model, Soil
   and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and (iii) to validate the
   interpretation of SWAT results by assessing changes of landuse maps.
   Firstly, Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests were used to test the trends of
   Blue Nile flow (1970-2009) and sediment load (1980-2009) at the outlet
   of the Upper Blue Nile basin at El Diem station. These tests showed
   statistically significant increasing trends of annual stream flow, wet
   season stream flow and sediment load at 5\% confidence level. The dry
   season flow showed a significant decrease in the trend. However, during
   the same period the annual rainfall over the basin showed no significant
   trends. The results of the statistical tests were sensitive to the time
   domain. Secondly, the SWAT model was used to simulate the runoff and
   sediment fluxes in the early 1970s and at the end of the time series in
   2000s in order to interpret the physical causes of the trends and
   corroborate the statistical results. A comparison of model parameter
   values between the 1970s and 2000s shows significant change, which could
   explain catchment response changes over the 28 years of record. Thirdly,
   a comparison of landuse maps of 1970s against 2000s shows conversion of
   vegetation cover into agriculture and grass lands over wide areas of the
   Upper Blue Nile basin. The combined results of the statistical tests,
   the SWAT model, and landuse change detection are consistent with the
   hypothesis that landuse change has caused a significant change of runoff
   and sediment load from the Upper Blue Nile during the last four decades.
   This is an important finding to inform optimal water resources
   management in the basin, both upstream in the Ethiopian highlands, and
   further downstream in the plains of Sudan and Egypt. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper aims at providing a key agreement protocol for smart grid to
   cope with access control of appliances/devices located inside a Home
   Area Network (HAN) by a set of controllers outside the HAN. The
   commands/packets initiated by the controllers in crisis cases should be
   delivered fast and immune from any interruption. The HAN controller,
   which acts as a gateway, should not cause any delay by decrypting and
   re-encrypting the packets, nor should it has any chance to modify them.
   Considering the required level of security and quality of service, we
   design our protocol with an Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) approach.
   We improve and implement the Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE)
   protocol in two steps. First, we propose an auxiliary mechanism that is
   an ECC version of PAKE, and then extend it to a multilayer consensus
   model. We reduce the number of hash functions to one, and utilize a
   primitive password shared between an appliance and HAN controller to
   construct four valid individual consensus and authenticated symmetric
   keys between the appliance and upstream controllers by exchanging only
   12 packets. Security analysis presents that our protocol is resilient to
   various attacks. Furthermore, performance analysis shows that the delay
   caused by the security process is reduced by more than one half.}},

   validated by measuring the wavelength dependence of SHG signal from a
   BaB2O4 crystal under different focusing conditions and comparing with
   the theoretical calculations. The good agreement between the
   experimental results and theoretical calculations demonstrates that we
   have established a reliable method to validate wavelength-dependent SHG
   measurement over a broad wavelength range. We also investigate the
   wavelength dependence of a 10-mu m thick mouse tendon tissue in both

Abstract = {{Interfacing machine models in either nodal analysis-based (EMTP-like) or
   state variable-based transient simulation programs play an important
   role in numerical accuracy and computational performance of the overall
   simulation. As an advantageous alternative to the traditional qd models,
   a number of advanced phase-domain (PD) and voltage-behind-reactance
   machine models have been recently introduced. However, the
   rotor-position-dependent conductance matrix in the machine-network
   interface complicates the use of such models in EMTP. This paper focuses
   on achieving constant and efficient interfacing circuit for the PD
   synchronous machine model. It is shown that the machine conductance
   matrix can be formulated into a constant submatrix plus a time-variant
   submatrix. Eliminating numerical saliency from the second term results
   in a constant conductance matrix of the proposed PD model, which is a
   very desirable property for the EMTP solution since the refactorization
   of the network conductance matrix at every time step is avoided. Case
   studies demonstrate that the proposed PD model represents a significant
   improvement over other established models used in EMTP while preserving
   the accuracy of the original/classical PD model.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of soot aggregate optical properties is needed for the
   interpretation of optical measurements of soot. A modified
   cluster-cluster aggregation (MCCA) was used to numerically generate
   fractal aggregates containing 15-600 primary particles of d(p) = 30nm
   diameter. For each size, the aggregates with fractal dimension D-f =
   1.78 and 2.1 (with k(f) = 2.24 and 2.26, respectively) were selected,
   and the scattering and absorption cross sections were calculated using
   the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). For uncoated aggregates, the
   optical properties of these numerically generated aggregates were
   compared with the Rayleigh-Debye-Gans (RDG) approximation. It was found
   that the differences in the optical cross sections obtained from the two
   methods were small. In addition, it was also found that the aggregates
   with similar fractal dimension and fractal prefactor exhibit small
   variations in the absorption and scattering cross sections. For
   aggregates with transparent coatings, DDA predicted larger absorption
   than the core-shell Mie model for volume-equivalent spherical particles.
   The coating-induced absorption enhancement increases with coating
   thickness from 10\% for a 5-nm layer to about 50\%-75\% absorption
   enhancement for a coating thickness of 20nm. The presence of the coating

Abstract = {{Thermodenuders (TD) have been used to quantify the volatility of aerosol
   species, frequently with the aid of modeling. Here we present a
   two-dimensional model of flow, heat transfer, and aerosol dynamics that
   is fast, yet includes spatial resolution of the complete aerosol size
   distribution. We first demonstrate the utility of the model by
   interpreting nonequilibrium TD measurement data previously reported in
   the literature. It is shown that the thermogram (temperature vs. mass
   fraction remaining) curve is remarkably insensitive to radial variations
   in temperature and vapor concentration under typical conditions.
   Therefore, the discrepancies among vapor pressure estimates determined
   in TD studies are unlikely to be due to oversimplified flow models, but
   are instead likely due to faulty assumptions concerning evaporation
   kinetics. We then show that the best-fit range for the parameters that
   dictate equilibrium partitioning (saturation vapor pressure at a
   reference temperature and enthalpy of vaporization) can also be obtained
   by fitting nonequilibrium TD data using a three-parameter model that
   accounts for mass transfer limitations (by also fitting the evaporation
   coefficient). The degree of agreement between experiments and model
   simulations are examined for two dicarboxylic acids using the model
   developed in this study. The best-fit parameters were within the
   uncertainty range previously found using an equilibrated TD approach for
   butanedioic acid, whereas significantly better model-experiment
   agreement was obtained for a much lower value of enthalpy of
   vaporization than previously reported for hexanedioic acid. Copyright

Abstract = {{Considering the flexibility and controllability of heat exchanger
   networks (HENs), bypasses are widely used for effective control of

   the bypass is generally difficult to design with the trade-off between
   controllability and capital investments. In this paper, based on the
   steady-state model of heat exchanger networks the optimal bypass
   location was firstly selected by iteratively calculating the non-square
   Relative Gain Array (ns-RGA). To simplify the calculation process, rules
   of bypass selection were also proposed. In order to evaluate this
   method, then, the structural controllability of heat exchanger networks
   was analyzed. With both the consideration of the controllability and
   capital investments, the bypasses locations were finally selected. A
   case study on the HEN in Crude Distillation Unit was presented in which
   the ns-RGA and structural controllability were used to select bypasses

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study network-coded cooperative diversity (NCCD)

   error rates of NCCD systems. The derived error rate expressions are
   valid for arbitrary numbers of sources, arbitrary modulation schemes,
   and arbitrary constellation mappings and provide significant insight
   into the impact of various system and channel parameters on performance.
   Moreover, these expressions can be exploited for optimization of the

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{For the conventional three-node amplify-andforward (AF) relaying setup,
   we investigate the effect of imperfect channel state information (CSI)
   at the relay on the overall performance. In particular, we consider
   variable gain (a.k.a, CSI-assisted) AF relaying and derive expressions
   for the outage and the error probability for the case where the relay
   gain is adjusted based on outdated estimates of the source-relay
   channel, when operating over Nakagami-m fading. For the case of Rayleigh
   fading in the source-relay link, we show that the results can be
   extended to the versatile case of imperfect CSI, where the estimation
   error is caused either by additive white Gaussian noise or by
   quantization noise. The obtained expressions are functions of the
   correlation coefficient between the actual source-relay channel and its
   corresponding estimate. We also optimize the power allocation for
   minimization of the outage probability under a total transmit power
   constraint. Numerical results reveal a considerable degradation of the
   overall performance, when CSI acquisition is not perfect. Moreover, it
   is shown that the average relay transmit power is affected when the CSI
   is outdated, a fact which impacts the design of variable gain relaying
   in practice. Since outdated CSI leads to fluctuations of the relay
   transmit power, we derive expressions for the complementary cumulative
   distribution function (CCDF) of the peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR)
   at the relay. By comparing the error probability and the CCDF of the
   PAPR of variable gain relaying with those of fixed gain relaying, we
   shed some light onto the following question: How reliable has the
   instantaneous CSI at the relay to be for variable gain relaying to be
   preferable over fixed gain relaying, which requires only statistical
   CSI?}},

Abstract = {{In a cognitive relay system, the secondary user is permitted to transmit
   data via a relay when licensed frequency bands are detected to be free.
   Previous studies mainly focus on reducing or limiting the interference
   of the secondary transmission to the primary users. On the other hand,
   however, the primary user traffic also affects the data transmission
   performance of the secondary users. In this paper, we mainly investigate
   the impact of the primary user traffic on the bit error rate (BER) of
   the secondary transmission, when the secondary user adopts adaptive
   transmission with a partially selected relay. In addition, the average
   collision time and the average collision probability have been used to
   measure the interference level caused by the secondary transmission to
   the primary users. Based on some selected numerical results, we can see
   that the primary user traffic seriously degrades the average BER. The
   worse-link partial selection can perform almost as well as the global
   selection when the channel conditions of the source-relay links and the
   relay-destination links are quite different. Although the relay
   selection improves the spectral efficiency of the secondary
   transmission, numerical results show that it only has slight impact on
   the overall average BER, which implies that the robustness of the system
   will not be affected by the relay selection.}},

   compute the average OWRN lifetime for a small number of relays,

   Unfortunately, the computational complexity of this approach becomes
   prohibitive as the number of relays, transmit power levels, and initial
   energy levels increase. A low-complexity method, based on an existing

Abstract = {{A novel method is presented for mixing of two miscible dielectric
   liquids using D.C. electric field where Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) forces
   are used to increase the interface instability and fluids circulations

   were provided for a range of electrical potential (from 0 to 30 kV) and
   a Digital CCD camera is used to record the experimental observations.
   Results are analyzed, processing the images based on color intensities.
   The experimental results show that employing electric field is effective

   storage. Our results show that if the numbers of antennas at source and

Abstract = {{The extrudate (die) swell of a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) melt was
   studied both experimentally and numerically under slip conditions. The
   excess pressure drop due to entry (entrance pressure drop), the effect
   of pressure and temperature on viscosity, and the slip effects on the
   capillary data analysis have been examined. Using a series of capillary
   dies having different diameters, D, and length-to-diameter L/D ratios, a
   full rheological characterization has been carried out and the
   experimental data have been fitted both with a viscous model
   (CarreauYasuda) and a viscoelastic one (the Kaye-Bernstein, Kearsley,
   Zapas/Papanastasiou, Scriven, Macosko or K-BKZ/PSM model). Particular
   emphasis has been placed on the effects of wall slip (significant for
   HDPE). It was found that viscous modeling underestimates the pressures
   drops (especially at the higher apparent shear rates and L/D ratios) and
   predicts virtually no extrudate swell. On the other hand, the
   viscoelastic simulations were capable of reproducing the experimental
   data well, and this was particularly true for the pressure drop. The
   prediction of viscoelastic extrudate swell presented a problem, since
   the simulations grossly overpredict it due to the highly elastic nature
   of the melt. This occurs despite the presence of severe slip at the
   wall, which brings the swell down considerably. At this point it is not
   clear whether this is due to the viscoelastic model used or other
   phenomena, such as sagging and/or cooling, when simply extruding in the
   atmosphere. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 32:

Abstract = {{Assessment of the mobilized friction angle in a soil specimen tested in
   a given shear apparatus requires adequate information to establish the
   stress state at the instance of interest. In the most commonly used
   version of the direct simple shear (DSS) apparatus, where a cylindrical
   soil specimen is confined by wire-reinforced membrane, only the normal
   and shear stresses on the horizontal plane are measured. The knowledge
   of these stresses alone does not provide adequate information to
   construct the Mohr circle defining the state of stress. In this context,
   drained and constant volume (i.e., equivalent to undrained) discrete
   element simulations of a cylindrical DSS specimen were performed and the
   results are presented with emphasis on the DSS mobilized friction angle
   during shearing. It was found that planes of maximum stress obliquity
   rotate with the development of shear strain. This finding implies that
   it is not possible to calculate the friction angle accurately from
   typical DSS laboratory tests with unknown normal stress on the vertical
   plane. However, it seems that at large shear strains, the horizontal
   plane becomes a plane of maximum stress obliquity, and the friction
   angle calculated using the stress state on the horizontal plane is a
   good approximation to the mobilized friction angle at such shear strain
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{Loss of water caused by leakage is a common phenomenon observed in all
   water distribution systems (WDSs). The volume of leakage around the
   world is considerably high, and its control is crucial to meet the
   increasing water demand caused by rapid population growth and
   urbanization. The most important component of a leakage-control strategy
   is target setting in terms of economic level of leakage (ELL). The ELL
   is an economic indication depending on individual network conditions,
   operating system pressures, demands and their patterns, marginal cost of
   water, and operating practices. This paper discusses the economic
   aspects of leakage for a pilot district metered area (DMA) of the WDS of
   the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority (MWA) in Bangkok, Thailand. The
   study developed two nomographs for the quick estimation of ELL and
   active leakage-control cost (ALC) with minimal data analysis. The first
   nomograph shows the relationship between cost of leakage control,
   average operating pressure, and level of leakage in the WDS. The second
   nomograph shows the relationship between ELL, operating-system pressure,
   and marginal cost of water. The nomographs have been developed based on
   leakage volume, cost of water, and hydraulic and operational conditions
   of the WDS. To model different hydraulic and leakage scenarios, the U.S.
   EPA's EPANET simulation engine has been used. The research will help
   utility managers understand different aspects of leakage economics and
   will lead to better management of their WDSs.

Abstract = {{This work addresses the problem of recovering multi-echo T1 or T2
   weighted images from their partial K-space scans. Recent studies have
   shown that the best results are obtained when all the multi-echo images
   are reconstructed by simultaneously exploiting their intra-image spatial
   redundancy and inter-echo correlation. The aforesaid studies either
   stack the vectorised images (formed by row or columns concatenation) as
   columns of a Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) matrix or concatenate
   them as a long vector. Owing to the inter-image correlation, the thus
   formed MMV matrix or the long concatenated vector is row-sparse or
   group-sparse respectively in a transform domain (wavelets). Consequently
   the reconstruction problem was formulated as a row-sparse MMV recovery
   or a group-sparse vector recovery. In this work we show that when the
   multi-echo images are arranged in the MMV form, the thus formed matrix
   is low-rank. We show that better reconstruction accuracy can be obtained
   when the information about rank-deficiency is incorporated into the
   row/group sparse recovery problem. Mathematically, this leads to a
   constrained optimization problem where the objective function promotes
   the signal's groups-sparsity as well as its rank-deficiency; the
   objective function is minimized subject to data fidelity constraints.
   The experiments were carried out on ex vivo and in vivo T2 weighted
   images of a rat's spinal cord. Results show that this method yields
   considerably superior results than state-of-the-art reconstruction
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Using surface electromyography (sEMG) signal for efficient recognition
   of hand gestures has attracted increasing attention during the last
   decade, with most previous work being focused on recognition of upper
   arm and gross hand movements and some work on the classification of
   individual finger movements such as finger typing tasks. However,
   relatively few investigations can be found in the literature for
   automatic classification of multiple finger movements such as finger
   number gestures. This paper focuses on the recognition of number
   gestures based on a 4-channel wireless sEMG system. We investigate the
   effects of three popular feature types (i.e. Hudgins' time-domain
   features (TD), autocorrelation and cross-correlation coefficients (ACCC)
   and spectral power magnitudes (SPM)) and four popular classification
   algorithms (i.e. k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), linear discriminant analysis
   (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and support vector machine
   (SVM)) in offline recognition. Motivated by the good performance of SVM,
   we further propose combining the three features and employing a new
   classification method, multiple kernel learning SVM (MKL-SVM). Real sEMG
   results from six subjects show that all combinations, except k-NN or LDA
   using ACCC features, can achieve above 91\% average recognition
   accuracy, and the highest accuracy is 97.93\% achieved by the proposed
   MKL-SVM method using the three feature combination (3F). Referring to
   the offline recognition results, we also implement a real-time
   recognition system. Our results show that all six subjects can achieve a
   real-time recognition accuracy higher than 90\%. The number gestures are
   therefore promising for practical applications such as human-computer
   interaction (HCI). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Failure of mechanically-stabilized earth (MSE) walls attributed to the
   corrosion of galvanized steel in soil has raised concern on the use of
   an appropriate type of the de-icing salt for the maintenance of the
   roads in the winter. This work presents the effect of commonly used
   de-icing salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium
   chloride, and potassium acetate on the corrosion performance of the
   galvanized steel in sulphate contaminated soil. To achieve this goal,
   different electrochemical testing methods such as potentiodynamic
   polarization, Linear Polarization Resistance, and electrical impedance
   spectroscopy were used to determine the corrosion rate of galvanized
   steel reinforcement in sodium sulphate containing solution. Results
   showed that the presence of sulphate in the soil significantly increased
   the corrosion rates and, thus, it is important to consider the effect of
   sulphate in determining the type of de-icing salt. In sulphate-free
   solution, potassium acetate appeared to be the best option; while in the
   presence of sulphate, MgCl2 and CaCl2 had the lowest corrosion rate. (C)

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{91}},

Pages = {{55-60}},

Abstract = {{A novel systematic approach for reactor design was described for iron
   electrocoagulation (EC) and applied to drinking water treatment.
   Suwannee NOM was used as a model compound; performance was quantified by
   UV-abs-254 and DOC removal. Significant EC design variables were
   identified and examined: current density (i) (2.43-26.8 mA cm(-2)),
   coagulant or charge loading rate (CLR) (100-1000 C L-1 min(-1)), and
   flocculation methodology ({''}fast{''} and ``slow{''}). A correlation
   was found between increased i and decreased current efficiency (phi),
   optimum NOM removal was found at i similar to 10 mA cm(-2). A lower CLR
   showed greater total DOC removal, while a higher CLR led to less reactor
   residence time and required either longer flocculation times or greater
   coagulant dose for similar NOM removal. This paper defines and describes
   the four general EC ``classes{''} of operation that have implications on
   several important measures of success: coagulant dose, electrical
   consumption, process speed, volumetric footprint, and post-EC
   flocculation requirements. Two classes were further examined with or
   without pH adjustment for DOC removal, showing that a ``fast{''} EC mode
   without flocculation is more appropriate for smaller applications, while
   a ``slow{''} EC mode is more effective for large permanent applications,
   where flocculation and settling can reduce coagulant and electrical
   consumption. The effect of pH adjustment showed greater impact with the
   ``fast{''} dosing mode than with the ``slow{''} mode, adjustment to pH 6
   with the ``fast{''} mode gave 13.8\% and 29.1\% greater DOC and
   UV-abs-254 removal, respectively, compared to the baseline without pH
   adjustment. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Highly detailed models of power-electronic converter circuits can be
   slow to simulate due to the wide disparity in transient time scales.
   This paper presents a framework for multi-resolution simulation of
   switching converter circuits by providing an appropriate amount of
   detail based on the time scale and phenomenon being considered. In this
   approach, a detailed full-order model that accounts for the higher-order
   effects of components, parasitics, switching nonlinearity (e. g.,
   saturated inductors), switching event detection, etc., is constructed
   first. Efficient order-reduction techniques are then used to extract
   several lower order models for the desired resolution of the simulation.
   The simulation resolution can be adjusted as needed even during a
   simulation run time. The state continuity across different resolutions
   and switching events is ensured using appropriate similarity transforms.
   The proposed high-fidelity model of converter is verified with hardware
   measurement and is used to verify different simulation resolutions. The
   proposed methodology is demonstrated to achieve orders of magnitudes
   improvement in simulation speed.}},

Abstract = {{In image-guided orthopedic surgery, rigid registration of
   intra-operative ultrasound (US) to a pre-operative plan, developed using
   computed tomography (CT) scans, is an important step for providing real
   time surgical guidance. The ability to perform this registration
   accurately, automatically, and in real time is critical for enabling
   more effective image guidance and anatomic restoration in a number of
   orthopedic procedures. Several surface-based and intensity-based
   registration methods have been proposed before to align the US and CT
   data. Although relatively successful results were reported, both methods
   require accurate segmentation or localization of the bone surface in US
   data, which is a challenging task. Furthermore, typically, only partial
   views of the three-dimensional (3D) bone anatomy are visible in US data,
   and registration would only converge if a good estimation of the initial
   alignment between the US and CT datasets is known.
   We propose a 3D rigid CT to US registration method based on the
   alignment of local phase bone image projections. The registration is
   achieved by transforming the local phase bone features, calculated using
   3D Log-Gabor filters, to a projection space obtained using 3D Radon
   transform. Validation experiments show the capability of the method in
   registering partial view US volumes to full view CT volume.
   Feasibility experiments, carried out on a phantom and ten volunteer
   subjects, show an average surface registration, in the region where the
   US scans were acquired, of 0.42 and 0.78 mm, respectively.
   The proposed US to CT registration method is fully automatic,
   non-iterative and requires no initial alignment between the two
   registering datasets.}},

Abstract = {{The capillary extrusion-forming flow of a fluoropolymer (FEP) melt was
   studied both experimentally and numerically. The excess pressure drop
   due to entry (related to the Bagley correction), the compressibility,
   and the effect of pressure and temperature on viscosity on the capillary
   data analysis have been examined. Using a series of capillary dies
   having different diameters, D, and length-to-diameter L/D ratios, a full
   rheological characterization has been carried out, and the experimental
   data have been fitted both with a viscous model (Cross) and a
   viscoelastic one (the Kaye-Bernstein, Kearsley, Zapas/Papanastasiou,
   Scriven, Macosko or K-BKZ/PSM model). For the viscous model, the
   viscosity is a function of both temperature and pressure. For the
   viscoelastic K-BKZ model, the time-temperature shifting concept has been
   used for the non-isothermal calculations, while the time-pressure
   shifting concept has been used to shift the relaxation moduli for the
   pressure-dependence effect. It was found that the viscous simulations
   gave good results in the range of apparent shear rates studied. The
   viscoelastic simulations gave slightly better results in reproducing the
   experimental data, especially for the entrance pressure losses for L/D =
   0. It is concluded that pressure-dependence of the viscosity and
   viscoelastic effects are small to moderate in flow of the FEP melt,
   which is a linear polymer.}},

Abstract = {{One-stage autothermal thermophilic aerobic digestion (ATAD) is a
   promising process for sewage sludge stabilization. This study
   investigated semicontinuous operation in simulated one-stage ATAD
   digesters and analyzed the effects of hydraulic retention time (HRT) on
   sludge stabilization. During semicontinuous operation, the average
   volatile solids (VS) removals at HRTs of 13 and 16 days were 40.1\% and
   41.8\%, respectively. Because HRTs were 6 and 10 days, the maximum VS
   removal was no more than 33.2\%, less than 38\% required by Class A
   digested sludge, so a suitable HRT level is 13-16 days for a one-stage
   ATAD system. The digesters with 13- and 16-day HRTs maintained
   relatively low soluble chemical oxidation demand (SCOD), total nitrogen,
   NH4+-N, and total phosphate, whereas the digester at HRT 6 days had high
   SCOD concentration (<6,300 mg L-1) and low oxidation reduction potential
   (ORP), ranging between -335 and -245 mV. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs)
   accumulated rapidly at short HRTs, and acetic, propionic, isobutyric,
   and isovaleric acids were the major components of VFAs in the digester
   with a 6-day HRT. Digestion systems at HRTs of 13 and 16 days had lower
   specific capillary suction time than the other two digesters at HRTs of
   6 and 10 days, indicating that extending retention time favors the
   dewaterability of the digested sludge. DOI:

Abstract = {{We consider the linear stability of both Newtonian and Bingham fluids in
   spiral Poiseuille flow in the annular gap between two co-rotating
   cylinders using the method of normal modes. Only axisymmetric
   disturbances are considered. We find that for the Newtonian case, linear
   instability does occur but the margin of stability increases with
   increasing Re-0. For the Bingham fluid case, we find the eigenvalue
   problem to be linearly stable over the range {[}Re-z, Re-0, eta] is an
   element of {[}0, 10000] x {[}0, 5000] x {[}0.75, 0.9], where Rez is
   axial Reynolds number, Re-0 is the tangential Reynolds number and eta is
   the ratio of inner to outer radius of the annular gap and we believe
   that the flow is linearly stable for all B > 0 where B is Bingham
   number. In the limit of B -> 0, we demonstrate that we cannot recover
   the results for the Newtonian fluid. The stability behaviour is singular
   in this limit and we show that this arises from imposition of boundary
   conditions for the Bingham fluid eigenvalue-problem at the unperturbed
   yield surface position, rather than any other effect of the yield
   stress. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a semi-analytical closure approximation to the stratified
   flow of two Herschel-Bulkley fluids flowing along a circular pipe. The
   closure proposed appears to approximate the volumetric fluxes within
   10-15\% over a broad range of rheological parameters and interface
   heights. Accuracy is diminished at more extreme viscosity ratios when
   the less viscous fluid is in a thin layer. We demonstrate that the
   closure is able to give a good prediction of displacement front
   velocities in the viscous regime, comparing well with experimental
   values, and can be used for approximating other design features of a
   displacement process, e.g. the maximal static wall layer (in the case of
   a yield stress fluid) and the minimal flow rate to prevent backflow. (C)

Abstract = {{Partitioning of organic pollutants is essential to their fate, mobility
   and removal from water and soil. To study the partitioning behavior of
   selected alkylphenols, bisphenol A, phthalates and polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs), a method for separating the truly dissolved and
   colloidal phase of organic pollutants was developed, verified and
   applied to samples of landfill leachate and stormwater from urban areas
   and waste-sorting sites. Alkylphenols, bisphenol A, phthalates and PAHs
   were detected in all the untreated samples (total concentrations), most
   of the filtered samples and frequently in the colloid-bound phase.
   Concentrations of alkylphenols and PAHs in urban stormwater were one
   order of magnitude lower than in the landfill leachates and stormwater
   from waste-sorting sites. The difference between total, dissolved and
   colloid-bound concentrations in the water samples was not statistically
   significant for any phenols or phthalates, but for three of the PAHs;
   naphthalene (mostly dissolved), phenanthrene and fluoranthene (mostly
   particulate). These results indicate that in landfill leachates and
   stormwaters, organic pollutants are predominantly attached to colloids
   and/or truly dissolved in contrast to their expected strong sorption to
   particulate matter. Occurrence and concentrations of pollutants in
   dissolved and colloid-bound phases correlated negatively with the K-OW.
   However, even highly hydrophobic compounds were frequently detected in
   filtered samples, i.e. the dissolved phases, and it is suggested that
   the organic content in the colloids decreases the compounds' partition
   to particles. The results confirm that the K-OW values of specific
   organic pollutants well describe the compounds partition-binding process
   to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) colloids. Our findings call for a
   re-assessment of the organic pollutants' mobility and associated risks.
   This knowledge can also serve as a base for selecting efficient
   treatment methods for stormwater and landfill leachates. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Material characterization of woven fabric composites in dry form is one
   of the most crucial steps prior to the design and optimization of
   composite manufacturing processes. High stiffness of yarns under axial
   tension and low stiffness under in-plane shear makes the latter the
   dominant deformation mode during draping of woven fabrics.
   Bias-extension (BE) and shear frame (SF) tests are two widely used
   experimental setups for the characterization of woven fabrics under the
   shear (also called trellising) mode. This article outlines two general
   approaches for the characterization and normalization of data collected
   from the above standard tests. The first approach is based on the total
   energy absorbed by the fabric specimen along with the total work induced
   by the external force on the moving head of the tensile test machine.
   The second approach uses a variational formulation along with the
   principle of virtual work. Using both approaches, it is shown how, in
   the BE test, an auxiliary specimen with a different aspect ratio can be
   used to cope with the problem of nonuniform deformation (formation of
   three different shear regions) in the specimens. To illustrate the
   application of both methods, they are applied to predict in-plane shear
   stiffness of a glass/PP plain weave under SF and BE tests. It is
   suggested that the shear stress can be used as a normalized parameter to
   compare data from different trellising tests. POLYM. COMPOS., 2013. (c)

Abstract = {{Debarked samples from three wood species (Spruce, Douglas-fir and Pine)
   and Douglas-fir bark were treated with saturated steam at 220 degrees C
   for 5 min. The objective was to quantify physical and compositional
   properties of the treated biomass that would affect on the degree of
   carbonization (torrefaction) of softwood particles. The resulting data
   indicated that the calorific value increases as a result of steam
   treatment; the highest increase was 26.0\% for Spruce, from 18.7 MJ/kg
   to 23.6 MJ/kg. The corresponding carbon content of the treated Spruce
   increased from 46.5\% to 57.0\%. The equilibrium moisture content of the
   treated wood, placed in a chamber at 90\% relative humidity and 30
   degrees C air for 180 min, dropped from around 0.103 (decimal dry basis)
   (before treatment) to about 0.045 (decimal dry basis) for Spruce treated
   particles. Bulk density of Spruce particles increased the most from 87
   kg/m(3) to 129 kg/m(3) after steam treatment. The bulk density of
   Douglas-fir bark decreased from 310 kg/m(3) to 275 kg/m(3) upon steam
   treatment. The increased values in calorific values, hydrophobicity,
   carbon content and dark brownish color indicated a mild degree of
   torrefaction of biomass when compared to the corresponding values of
   treated biomass at temperatures of 280 degrees C. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We present a methodological framework for estimating the degree of
   mixing between successive miscible fluids pumped along a near-horizontal
   pipe. Either or both of the fluids can be non-Newtonian, of
   HerschelBulkley type. Overall it is considered that the objective is to
   minimise mixing. In laminar regimes our estimates are based on front
   velocity of the leading displacement front. In turbulent regimes the
   spreading mechanism is dispersion. In addition to the estimates of
   mixing volumes/lengths, we also predict a minimal flow rate necessary in
   order to achieve a successful displacement of the residual fluid. (c)

Abstract = {{A numerical model with detailed gas-phase chemistry and transport was
   used to predict homogeneous fuel conversion processes and to capture the
   important features (e.g., the location, temperature, thickness and
   structure of a flame) of laminar oxy-fuel diffusion flames stabilized on
   the sweep side of an oxygen permeable ion transport membrane (ITM). We
   assume that the membrane surface is not catalytic to hydrocarbon or
   syngas oxidation. It has been demonstrated that an ITM can be used for
   hydrocarbon conversion with enhanced reaction selectivity such as
   oxy-fuel combustion for carbon capture technologies and syngas
   production. Within an ITM unit, the oxidizer flow rate, i.e., the oxygen
   permeation flux, is not a pre-determined quantity, since it depends on
   the oxygen partial pressures on the feed and sweep sides and the
   membrane temperature. Instead, it is influenced by the oxidation
   reactions that are also dependent on the oxygen permeation rate, the
   initial conditions of the sweep gas, i.e., the fuel concentration, flow
   rate and temperature, and the diluent. In oxy-fuel combustion
   applications, the sweep side is fuel-diluted with CO2, and the entire
   unit is preheated to achieve a high oxygen permeation flux. This study
   focuses on the flame structure under these conditions and specifically
   on the chemical effect of CO2 dilution. Results show that, when the fuel
   diluent is CO2, a diffusion flame with a lower temperature and a larger
   thickness is established in the vicinity of the membrane, in comparison
   with the case in which N-2 is used as a diluent. Enhanced OH-driven
   reactions and suppressed H radical chemistry result in the formation of
   products with larger CO and H2O and smaller H-2 concentrations.
   Moreover, radical concentrations are reduced due to the high CO2
   fraction in the sweep gas. CO2 dilution reduces CH3 formation and slows
   down the formation of soot precursors, C2H2 and C2H4. The flame location
   impacts the species diffusion and heat transfer from the reaction zone
   towards the membrane, which affects the oxygen permeation rate and the
   flame temperature. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute. Published by

Title = {{Dimensioning method for bolted, adhesively bonded, and hybrid joints
   involving Fibre-Reinforced-Polymers}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The overall performance and efficiency of any structure depend on the
   connections that join their components; as such they constitute the most
   critical component. This is particularly true for hybrid structures,
   where joining of components, either between Fibre-Reinforced-Polymers
   (FRPs) and/or to other materials is mostly achieved by the means of
   mechanical fasteners or, less commonly, adhesively bonding. Since these
   two joining methods come from radically different backgrounds, the
   resulting design procedures are almost incompatible. This paper aims to
   hand practitioners a unified dimensioning procedure for the two most
   frequent fastening methods in FRP structures, i.e. bolted and adhesively
   bonded joints. Relatively simple double-lap joints connecting flat FRP
   lamellas and complex joints between FRP tubes and lamellas connected by
   the means of aluminium brackets were experimentally tested. The joints
   were numerically investigated using three dimensional finite element
   analyses coupled to a probabilistic post-processing routine for strength
   prediction, which subsequently was validated against the experimental
   data. Good agreement between experimental and predicted strength was
   achieved, which validates the design process and allows generalising for
   dimensioning of the bolted and bonded joints in FRP structures. The
   presented approach opens the door for the practical design of a wide
   variety of joints encountered in FRP structures, thus overcoming a major
   problem limiting the widespread of composite construction. (C) 2012

Volume = {{66}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Simulation of multi-axis ball-end milling of dies, molds and aerospace
   parts with free-form surfaces is highly desirable in order to optimize
   the machining processes in virtual environment ahead of costly trials.
   This paper presents a mechanics model that predicts the cutting forces
   in feed (x), normal (y) and axial (z) directions by modeling the chip
   thickness distribution, and cutting and indentation mechanics. The
   shearing forces are based on commonly known cutting mechanics models.
   The indentation of the cutting edge into the work material is modeled
   analytically by considering elasto-plastic deformation of the work
   material pressed by a rigid cutting tool edge with a positive or
   negative rake angle. The distribution of chip thickness and geometry of
   indentation zone are evaluated by considering five-axis motion of the
   tool along the toolpath. The proposed model has been experimentally
   validated in plunge indentation, as well as in three and five-axis
   ball-end milling of free-form surfaces. The prediction of axial (z)
   cutting forces is shown to be improved significantly when the proposed
   indentation model is integrated into the mechanics of ball-end milling.

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{803-811}},

Abstract = {{Very large quantities of tailings are produced as a result of processing
   oil sands. After the sand particles settle out, a dense stable mixture
   of clay, silt, water with residual bitumen, salts, and organics called
   mature fine tailings (MFT) can remain in suspension for decades.
   Research into developing methods that would allow consolidation and
   sedimentation of the suspended particles is ongoing. We have studied the
   ability of a filamentous bacteriophage (called VP12 bearing the peptide
   DSQKTNPS at the N-terminus of the major coat protein pVIII) to aggregate
   MFT. To understand the biophysical basis of the aggregation,
   phage-induced aggregation of diluted MFT was measured at room
   temperature under varying conditions of pH, salt, detergent. Phage at
   concentrations of 5.0x1011/mL to 1012/mL induced rapid settling of the
   diluted MFT. The addition of sodium chloride (10mM) lowered the
   concentration of phage required to induce aggregation. Since the
   non-ionic detergents Triton-X 100 and Tween-20, and the ionic detergent
   sodium deoxycholate had little effect, hydrophobic interactions do not
   appear to be a major contributor to the phage-induced aggregation of
   MFT. However, aggregation was prevented at pH values higher than 9.0
   suggesting that positively charged amino acid residues are required for
   MFT aggregation by phage. Genetic engineering of the pVIII peptide
   sequence indicated that hydrogen bonding also contributes to
   phage-induced aggregation. In addition, replacing the basic residue
   lysine with an alanine in the recombinant peptide of VP12 completely
   prevented phage-induced aggregation. Three other phage displaying
   different amino acid sequences but all containing a lysine in the same
   position had variable aggregation efficiencies, ranging from no
   aggregation to rapid aggregation. We conclude that not only are the
   functional groups of the amino acids important, but the conformation
   that is adopted by the variable pVIII peptide is also important for
   phage-induced MFT aggregation. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013; 110: 803811.

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{49-57}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Dispersion of gas into pulp-suspension horizontal flow was investigated
   downstream of 900 tees for ranges of fibre mass concentrations
   (0-3.0\%), superficial liquid/pulp velocities (0.5-5.0 m/s) and
   superficial gas velocities (0.11-0.44 m/s) based on a gas mixing index,
   derived from the standard deviation of cross-sectional local gas holdup
   obtained from electrical resistance tomography. Mixing for dilute
   suspensions was similar to that for water, but differed significantly
   for higher suspension concentrations. Mixing worsened with increasing
   fibre mass concentration for the bubble flow regime, likely due to dense
   fibre networks in the core of the pipe causing bubbles to congregate
   near the wall. When buoyancy was significant, gas uniformity improved
   with increasing pulp concentration, since robust fibre networks caused
   liquid/pulp slugs to flow at the top of the pipe, whereas stratified
   flow was approached at lower concentrations. Mixing was less dependent

Abstract = {{The formation kinetics of methane/ethane/propane hydrate in the presence
   of kinetic inhibitors was investigated using H-1 nuclear magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) as well as a more-traditional method using a
   stirred autoclave. These studies were facilitated by fabricating a
   multi-drop insert for H-1 NMR micro-imaging, which allowed the
   comparison of the performance of microliter quantities of several
   inhibitors simultaneously and under the same conditions. Both methods
   showed that hydrate nucleation and growth were delayed significantly in
   the presence of inhibitors, which included two biological inhibitors
   (antifreeze proteins) and a commercial inhibitor. The results
   demonstrate that MRI is a useful tool for the visualization and
   evaluation of the performance of kinetic inhibitors on mixed gas hydrate
   formation. The MRI technique should prove especially valuable in the
   case of analysis of potential inhibitors, pre-commercialization, which
   are available in only limited quantities, such as biological inhibitors.
   This technique may also find utility in the exploration of differences
   in inhibitor performance, which may suggest distinct mechanisms of
   inhibitor action. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A systematic study of electron-beam penetration and backscattering in
   multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) materials for beam energies of
   similar to 0.3 to 30 keV is presented based on event-by-event Monte
   Carlo simulation of electron trajectories using state-of-the-art
   scattering cross sections. The importance of different analytic
   approximations for computing the elastic and inelastic
   electron-scattering cross sections for MWCNTs is emphasized. We offer a
   simple parameterization for the total and differential
   elastic-scattering Mott cross section, using appropriate modifications
   to the Browning formula and the Thomas-Fermi screening parameter. A
   discrete-energy-loss approach to inelastic scattering based on
   dielectric theory is adopted using different descriptions of the
   differential cross section. The sensitivity of electron penetration and
   backscattering parameters to the underlying scattering models is
   examined. Our simulations confirm the recent experimental backscattering
   data on MWCNT forests and, in particular, the steep increase of the
   backscattering yield at sub-keV energies as well as the sidewalls escape
   effect at high-beam energies. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The rheology of non-melt processable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
   pastes has been studied using three capillary rheometers having barrels
   of different diameters equipped with capillary dies of various designs.
   The pressure drop is measured as a function of apparent shear rate (flow
   rate), reduction ratio (cross sectional area of barrel to that of die),
   contraction angle, length-to-diameter ratio, and diameter of the barrel
   (scale-up). To describe the effects of die design for scale-up purposes,
   a simple phenomenological mathematical model has been developed. The
   model takes into account the elastic-plastic (strain hardening) and
   viscous nature of the material in its non-melt state, due to the
   creation of fibrils and the presence of lubricant, respectively. In
   addition, it takes into account the slip condition at the paste/wall
   interface. The model predictions are found to be consistent with
   experimental results obtained from macroscopic pressure drop
   measurements and it can be used for scale-up purposes. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We demonstrate, in both theory and experiment, 4-port, electrically

   The contra-DC devices were fabricated by a CMOS-photonics manufacturing
   foundry and are electrically tunable using free-carrier injection. A
   4-port, grating-based photonic resonator has been obtained using the
   phase-shifted contra-DC, showing a resonant peak with a 3-dB bandwidth
   of 0.2 nm and an extinction ratio of 24 dB. These contra-DC devices
   enable on-chip integration of Bragg-grating-defined functions without

   wavelength-division multiplexing networks and optical signal processing.

Abstract = {{We report experiments on simple shear of a monolayer of bidisperse and
   polydisperse bubbles in a Couette device. The bubbles segregate
   according to their sizes, with larger ones in the middle of the gap and
   smaller ones closer to the walls, when the shear rate and the bubble
   size ratio are each above a threshold. The spatial distribution of the
   larger bubbles becomes flatter across the gap as its area fraction
   increases. To explain these observations, we adapt a model for
   monodisperse emulsions that predicts the spatial distribution of
   droplets as an outcome of the competition between migration away from
   the walls and shear-induced diffusion. The dense packing of bubbles in
   our foam intensifies bubble-bubble interaction, which manifests itself
   both in lateral migration due to wall repulsion and in collision-induced
   diffusion. After accounting for this difference via an effective
   capillary number based on the deformation of the bubbles, the model
   predicts the observed bubble distributions accurately.}},

Abstract = {{Online Social Networks (OSNs) have attracted millions of active users
   and have become an integral part of today's web ecosystem.
   Unfortunately, in the wrong hands, OSNs can be used to harvest private
   user data, distribute malware, control botnets, perform surveillance,
   spread misinformation, and even influence algorithmic trading. Usually,
   an adversary starts off by running an infiltration campaign using
   hijacked or adversary-owned OSN accounts, with an objective to connect
   with a large number of users in the targeted OSN. In this article, we
   evaluate how vulnerable OSNs are to a large-scale infiltration campaign
   run by socialbots: bots that control OSN accounts and mimic the actions
   of real users. We adopted the design of a traditional web-based botnet
   and built a prototype of a Socialbot Network (SbN): a group of
   coordinated programmable socialbots. We operated our prototype on
   Facebook for 8 weeks, and collected data about user behavior in response
   to a large-scale infiltration campaign. Our results show that (1) by
   exploiting known social behaviors of users, OSNs such as Facebook can be
   infiltrated with a success rate of up to 80\%, (2) subject to user
   profile privacy settings, a successful infiltration can result in
   privacy breaches where even more private user data are exposed, (3)
   given the economics of today's underground markets, running a
   large-scale infiltration campaign might be profitable but is still not
   particularly attractive as a sustainable and independent business, (4)
   the security of socially-aware systems that use or integrate OSN
   platforms can be at risk, given the infiltration capability of an
   adversary in OSNs, and (5) defending against malicious socialbots raises
   a set of challenges that relate to web automation, online-offline
   identity binding, and usable security. (c) 2012 Elsevier BM. All rights

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{On meta-level time scales, anomalous trajectories can signify target
   intent through their shape and eventual destination. Such trajectories
   exhibit complex spatial patterns and have well defined destinations with
   long-range dependencies implying that Markov (random-walk) models are
   unsuitable. How can estimated target tracks be used to detect anomalous
   trajectories such as circling a building or going past a sequence of
   checkpoints? This paper develops context-free grammar models and
   reciprocal Markov models (one dimensional Markov random fields) for
   modeling spatial trajectories with a known end point. The intent of a
   target is assumed to be a function of the shape of the trajectory it
   follows and its intended destination. The stochastic grammar models
   developed are concerned with trajectory shape classification while the
   reciprocal Markov models are used for destination prediction. Towards
   this goal, Bayesian signal processing algorithms with polynomial
   complexity are presented. The versatility of such models is illustrated
   with tracking applications in surveillance.}},

Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{188-196}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Biodiesel, an alternative diesel additive made from renewable sources,
   has problems associated with their cloud points when used in colder
   climate. One method of improving the cloud point of biodiesel is
   hydroisomerization which branches the saturated portion of the biodiesel
   and lowers the cloud point of the compound. Palmitic acid methyl ester,
   which is the major saturated fatty acid in vegetable oils, is
   hydroisomerized with a 5 g kg(-1) Pt impregnated beta zeolite catalyst
   at reaction conditions 200-285 degrees C and 1.0-4.0 MPa H-2 pressure.
   FTIR and GC/MS analyses confirmed the branching and the identity of the
   reaction products. The cloud point of the material was lowered from 30
   degrees C to 20 degrees C under reaction conditions of 285 degrees C and
   4.0 MPa H-2 pressure at the yield of 42\% after 16 h. This study reports
   the hydroisomerization reaction being successful in branching the
   starting material in order to lower the cloud points of methyl esters.

Abstract = {{This study integrates risk assessment tools for diagnosis of urban areas
   against seismic disasters (RADIUS) and geographic information system
   (GIS), hence forth denoted as GBR (GIS based RADIUS). The GBR is applied
   for seismic damage estimation of city of Kelowna, in the interior of
   British Columbia, Canada. Ground-shaking intensity in the area was
   developed utilizing the seismic source zones defined by the Geological
   Survey of Canada and opinions from the local experts. Building
   inventories were compiled by aggregating data from municipal databases
   as well as sidewalk surveys and surveys through Google Maps. The GIS
   tool came in to be handy to provide a basis for effective decision
   making and gauge the vulnerable areas. Estimated damage and damage
   distributions were mapped on a block-by-block (535 km) basis. The
   assessment revealed that an earthquake scenario of M8.5 in the Cascadia
   Zone may potentially damage around 58 buildings within the city, causing
   12 injuries. Plus, the study showed some damage assessment for the
   lifelines, for example, road and water pipelines networks. The
   assessment results further revealed that the city of Kelowna downtown
   area was expected to suffer the highest amount of damage, which in turn
   may produce the highest amount of economic loss, because it is the
   concentration of concrete high-rise buildings and clustered economic
   activities. Therefore, for good measure, extra meticulous efforts and
   razor-sharp insight bundled with precise seismic damage estimation (2-3
   2-km grids) were conducted for the downtown area to provide guidelines
   for emergency response. The proposed GBR framework provides a useful
   tool to quickly assess the expected damages in response to a major
   seismic event, which can be updated easily during disaster. DOI:

Abstract = {{Ultrasound (US) radio-frequency (RF) time series is an effective tissue

   procedures and relate these variations to US backscattering. The model
   was used to derive four novel characterization features. These features
   were used to classify three animal tissues, and they obtained accuracies
   as high as 88.01\%. The performance of the proposed features was
   compared with RF time series features proposed in a previous study. The
   results indicated that the US-induced variations in tissue temperature
   and sound speed, which were used to derive the proposed features, were
   important contributors to the tissue typing capabilities of the RF time
   series. Simulations carried out to estimate the heating induced during

Abstract = {{Densification can partially resolve the logistical challenges
   encountered when large volumes of biomass are required for bioconversion
   processes to benefit from economies-of-scale. Despite the higher bulk
   density of pellets, their lower mechanical strength and sensitivity to
   moisture are still recurring issues hindering long term transportation
   and storage. In this study, we have evaluated the potential benefits of
   SO2-catalyzed steam treatment to achieve both the needed size reduction
   prior to pelletization while improving the stability of the produced
   pellets. This pretreatment substantially reduced the particle size of
   the woodchips eliminating any further grinding. The treated pellets had
   a higher density and exhibited a two-time higher mechanical strength
   compared to untreated pellets. Despite a higher moisture adsorption
   capacity, treated pellets remained intact even under highly humid
   conditions. The high heating values, low ash content and good overall
   carbohydrate recovery of treated pellets indicated their potential
   suitability for both biochemical and thermochemical applications. (C)

Abstract = {{We investigate the diversity order of decode-and-forward relay selection
   in Nakagami-m fading, in cases where practical channel estimation
   techniques are applied. In this respect, we introduce a unified model
   for the imperfect channel estimates, where the effects of noise,
   time-varying channels, and feedback delays are jointly considered. Based
   on this model, the correlation between the actual and the estimated
   channel values, rho, is expressed as a function of the signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR), yielding closed-form expressions for the overall outage
   probability as a function of rho. The resulting diversity order and
   power gain reveal a high dependence of the performance of relay
   selection on the high SNR behavior of rho, thus shedding light onto the
   effect of channel estimation on the overall performance. It is shown
   that when the channel estimates are not frequently updated in
   applications involving time-varying channels, or when the amount of
   power allocated for channel estimation is not sufficiently high, the
   diversity potential of relay selection is severely degraded.
   In short, the main contribution of this paper lies in answering the
   following question: How fast should rho tend to one, as the SNR tends to
   infinity, so that relay selection does not experience any diversity
   loss?}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study downlink scheduling with transmission strategy
   selection in multi-cell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.
   Depending on the level of inter-cell interference experienced by a user,
   the scheduler can choose between two MIMO transmission strategies,
   namely, spatial multiplexing and interference alignment. We formulate an
   optimization problem which aims to jointly select a user and the
   corresponding transmission strategy for each base station in order to
   maximize the overall system utility while stabilizing all transmission
   queues. We first develop a centralized dynamic scheduling scheme with
   transmission strategy selection by using a stochastic network
   optimization approach. To reduce the communication overhead, we then
   propose a distributed scheduling algorithm which only requires limited
   message exchange between the base stations. We also consider the impact
   of imperfect channel state information on the scheduling schemes and
   propose an efficient rate adjustment method to improve the performance
   for this case. Simulation results show that the performance of the
   proposed distributed scheduling scheme is close to that of the
   centralized scheduling scheme, and both schemes achieve a better
   performance than schemes employing a single transmission strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Torrefied pellets, a transportable renewable energy source, have a
   higher energy density than the regular wood pellets (control pellets).
   The quality of torrefied pellets is determined mainly by the density,
   hardness, and the hygroscopicity or moisture uptake. In this study, the
   density and the hardness of torrefied pellets were systematically
   examined by using torrefied samples prepared at different conditions in
   a press machine. The hygroscopicity of prepared torrefied pellets was
   evaluated in a humidity chamber by measuring the moisture uptake rate of
   control and torrefied pellets. The results showed that the density and
   the hardness of torrefied pellets mainly depended on the densification
   die temperature and the weight loss of torrefied samples. To make strong
   torrefied pellets of high density and low moisture uptake from 30 wt \%
   weight loss torrefied samples, a die temperature of 230 C or above was
   needed. Preconditioning torrefied samples to a moisture content of
   similar to 10\% can improve the quality of torrefied pellets. The
   moisture uptake of torrefied pellets was more sensitive to the weight
   loss of torrefaction and the relative humidity of the storage
   environment. The saturated moisture uptake of torrefied pellets made
   from 30 wt \% weight loss torrefied samples was at least 40\% lower than
   the control pellets.}},

Abstract = {{Many factors may influence the results of a reliability analysis for a
   water distribution system (WDS). These may include (but not limited to)
   the techniques chosen for reliability assessment, criterion to measure a
   system's reliability, number of components-failure combinations and
   failure probabilities and/or frequencies. Among these factors, the
   maximum number of components-failure scenarios is an important one which
   has not received sufficient attention in the literature. This study
   estimated the accuracy in reliability and damage tolerance analysis when
   an unrealistic and imprecise number of failure scenarios is assumed.
   Exercising a hypothetical WDS, the modified version of EPANET2 was
   applied for the hydraulic analysis. The reliability and redundancy or
   damage tolerance were evaluated based on weighted mean of performance
   indices of the system. The results indicated that incorporation of
   maximum acceptable error allow the engineers to estimate the number of
   failure combinations and ultimately to conduct a more
   computationally-efficient and realistic reliability assessment.
   Application of this methodology prevents redundant and unnecessary
   hydraulic simulations in reliability analysis and reduces computational

Abstract = {{A novel calcium phosphate silicate bone cement (CPSC) was synthesized in
   a process, in which nanocomposite forms in situ between calcium silicate
   hydrate (C-S-H) gel and hydroxyapatite (HAP). The cement powder consists

   During cement setting, C3S hydrates to produce C-S-H and calcium
   hydroxide (CH); CPM reacts with the CH to precipitate HAP in situ within
   C-S-H. This process, largely removing CH from the set cement, enhances
   its biocompatibility and bioactivity. The testing results of cell
   culture confirmed that the biocompatibility of CPSC was improved as
   compared to pure C3S. The results of XRD and SEM characterizations
   showed that CPSC paste induced formation of HAP layer after immersion in
   simulated body fluid for 7 days, suggesting that CPSC was bioactive in
   vitro. CPSC cement, which has good biocompatibility and low/no
   cytotoxicity, could be a promising candidate as biomedical cement.}},

Title = {{Modeling and analysing storage systems in agricultural biomass supply

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{SI}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a combined simulation/optimization model is developed to
   better understand and evaluate the impact of the storage systems on the
   costs incurred by each actor in the agricultural biomass supply chain
   including farmers, hauling contractors and the cellulosic ethanol plant.
   The optimization model prescribes the optimum number and location of
   farms and storages. It also determines the supply radius, the number of
   farms required to secure the annual supply of biomass and also the
   assignment of farms to storage locations. Given the specific design of
   the supply chain determined by the optimization model, the simulation
   model determines the number of required machines for each operation,
   their daily working schedule and utilization rates, along with the
   capacities of storages. To evaluate the impact of the storage systems on
   the delivered costs, three storage systems are molded and compared:
   roadside storage (RS) system and two satellite storage (SS) systems
   including SS with fixed hauling distance (SF) and SS with variable
   hauling distance (SV). In all storage systems, it is assumed the loading
   equipment is dedicated to storage locations. The obtained results from a
   real case study provide detailed cost figures for each storage system
   since the developed model analyses the supply chain on an hourly basis
   and considers time-dependence and stochasticity of the supply chain.
   Comparison of the storage systems shows SV would outperform SF and RS by
   reducing the total delivered cost by 8\% and 6\%, respectively. However,
   RS results in 10\% and 8\% decline in consumed energy and produced CO2
   in logistics operations compared to SV and SF, respectively. Another
   finding is that the dedication of loading equipment to storage locations
   is an expensive option for agricultural biomass supply chain as loading
   operation is utilized 3\%, 6\% and 11\% of its annual working hours in
   RS, SF and SV, respectively. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Composites of calcium hydroxyapatite (HA) powders containing 0-50 vol.\%
   of ZrO2 nanopowder with 3 mol\% Y2O3 (3YSZ) were consolidated very
   rapidly under pressure by high-frequency induction heating sintering
   (HFIHS). The effects of the addition of 3YSZ on the relative density,
   hardness, fracture toughness, wear resistance and grain growth were
   studied. All of the sintered samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) to determine the phase content. The calcium HA with 20 vol.\% 3YSZ
   showed optimal combination of properties in terms of relative density,
   hardness and fracture toughness, which caused superior sliding wear
   performance under the test conditions examined. The degradation of the
   properties of HA with 40 and 50 vol.\% 3YSZ was attributed to a
   combination of some decomposition of HA into tricalcium phosphate (TCP)
   and some residual porosity. On the contrary, the HA composite with 10
   vol.\% 3YSZ content appeared to be weakened little by YSZ as a
   strengthening agent. The results revealed the effectiveness of the HFIHS
   method for achieving near theoretical densities without significant
   grain growth for the geometry of the sample studied. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A full-field, multi-axial computation technique is described for
   determining residual stresses using the hole-drilling method with DIC.
   The computational method takes advantage of the large quantity of data
   available from full-field images to ameliorate the effect of modest
   deformation sensitivity of DIC measurements. It also provides uniform
   residual stress sensitivity in all in-plane directions and accounts for
   artifacts that commonly occur within experimental measurements. These
   artifacts include image shift, stretch and shear. The calculation method
   uses a large fraction of the pixels available within the measured images
   and requires minimal human guidance in its operation. The method is
   demonstrated using measurements where residual stresses are made on a
   microscopic scale with hole drilling done using a Focused Ion Beam -
   Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM). This is a very challenging
   application because SEM images are subject to fluctuations that can
   introduce large artifacts when using DIC. Several series of measurements
   are described to illustrate the operation and effectiveness of the
   proposed residual stress computation technique.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, solvent casting techniques have been used for the
   fabrication of magnetic polymer micropillar structures. These techniques
   provide very limited control over magnetic-particle placement, and
   particle agglomeration limits their use with highly viscous polymers
   such as polydimethylsiloxane. We report a new technique for the
   fabrication of magnetic polymer micropillars to overcome the
   aforementioned limitations. In this technique, magnetic
   micro-/nanoparticles are applied to a mold in their dry particulate
   state, omitting the need for the use of solvents. We demonstrate
   magnetic micropillars with uniform properties using high-viscosity
   polymers and iron nanoparticles. We show that simple modifications to
   the dry-nanoparticle embedding technique allow the embedding of other
   functional (nonmagnetic) particles inside the polymer micropillars, and
   we demonstrate patterning of the device. We present experimental results
   for the material composition, the magnetic properties, and the bending
   performance of our magnetic micropillar arrays. Compared to previously
   fabricated magnetic micropillars of similar dimensions and using lower
   magnitudes of externally applied magnetic fields and magnetic field
   gradients (286 mT, 41.45 mT/mm), our 8-mu m-diameter 18-mu m-high
   pillars produce an estimated maximum horizontal tip force of 0.33 +/-
   0.08 mu N, larger than the values previously reported.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal cord injury (SCI) researchers have predominately utilized rodents
   and mice for in vivo SCI modeling and experimentation. From these small
   animal models have come many insights into the biology of SCI, and a
   growing number of novel treatments that promote behavioral recovery. It
   has, however, been difficult to demonstrate the efficacy of such
   treatments in human clinical trials. A large animal SCI model that is an
   intermediary between rodent and human SCI may be a valuable
   translational research resource for pre-clinically evaluating novel
   therapies, prior to embarking upon lengthy and expensive clinical
   trials. Here, we describe the development of such a large animal model.
   A thoracic spinal cord injury at T10/11 was induced in Yucatan miniature
   pigs (20-25 kg) using a weight drop device. Varying degrees of injury
   severity were induced by altering the height of the weight drop (5, 10,
   20, 30, 40, and 50 cm). Behavioral recovery over 12 weeks was measured
   using a newly developed Porcine Thoracic Injury Behavior Scale (PTIBS).
   This scale distinguished locomotor recovery among animals of different
   injury severities, with strong intra-observer and inter-observer
   reliability. Histological analysis of the spinal cords 12 weeks
   post-injury revealed that animals with the more biomechanically severe
   injuries had less spared white matter and gray matter and less
   neurofilament immunoreactivity. Additionally, the PTIBS scores
   correlated strongly with the extent of tissue sparing through the
   epicenter of injury. This large animal model of SCI may represent a
   useful intermediary in the testing of novel pharmacological treatments
   and cell transplantation strategies.}},

Journal = {{CARBON}},

Abstract = {{The effect of using sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), a
   high-dielectric-strength gas, for dry micro-electro-discharge machining
   (mu EDM) of carbon-nanotube (CNT) forests is investigated. It is found
   that SF6 enables mu EDM of CNTs without O-2, which is known to be
   essential for CNT machining in N-2. The process in the SF6 ambient at a
   discharge voltage of 25 V is found to lead to a smaller discharge gap,
   i.e., tighter tolerance as well as higher machining quality compared
   with the N-2 case at the same voltage. The N-2 environment produces
   smaller discharge gap when 10 V is used; however, both the quality and
   rate of machining are somewhat lower in this case. The mixture with 20\%
   O-2 in SF6 is revealed to be an optimum condition for machining
   tolerance and quality. CNT forests are used as the cathode in the
   process, as opposed to conventional mu EDM where the workpiece forms the
   anode. This configuration in the SF6-O-2 mixture is observed to generate
   higher discharge currents at low voltage, presumably due to effective
   field-emission by the CNTs, leading to finer and cleaner machining.
   Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis reveals that the optimal conditions
   result in less contamination by the electrode element on the processed
   forest surfaces. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The construction and demolition (C\&D) waste generated by the Canadian
   construction industry accounts for 27 \% of the total municipal solid
   waste disposed in landfills. However, it is evident that over 75 \% of
   what the construction industry generates as waste has a residual value,
   and therefore could be recycled, salvaged and/or reused. The need for
   comprehensive and integrated waste management mechanisms, technologies,
   rating systems and policies is widely recognized. Owing to increasing
   C\&D waste volumes, shortage of landfills and long-term adverse
   environmental, economic and social impacts of the disposed C\&D waste,
   sustainable C\&D waste management is becoming increasingly essential to
   protect public health and natural ecosystems. This paper proposes a
   conceptual C\&D waste management framework to maximise the 3R (reduce,
   reuse and recycle) and minimise the disposal of construction waste by
   implementing sustainable and comprehensive strategy throughout the
   lifecycle of construction projects. In addition, a life cycle based C\&D
   waste sustainability index is developed. This approach can be used to
   make decisions related to selection of material, sorting, recycle/reuse
   and treatment or disposal options for C\&D waste.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of sawdust on the rate of limestone carbonation/calcination
   reactions was studied in a thermogravimetric analyzer applying a grain
   model for the calcium-based sorbent, namely Havelock limestone
   (0.50-1.41 mm). Two samples were employed for calcination under N-2 at
   850 degrees C: one containing limestone, and the other a mixture
   containing limestone and sawdust. The resulting limestone samples were
   observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM), while the
   quantitative influence of calcination conditions was examined by BET
   surface areas. The presence of sawdust during calcination caused a
   significant increase in the initial rate of carbonation, which has been
   attributed to the enhancement of CaO surface area. The presence of H-2
   which is emitted from sawdust pyrolysis was assumed to be responsible
   for reduction of limestone sintering. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Mesh Adaptation for Improving Elasticity Reconstruction Using the FEM
   Inverse Problem}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{408-418}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The finite element method is commonly used to model tissue deformation
   in order to solve for unknown parameters in the inverse problem of
   viscoelasticity. Typically, a (regular-grid) structured mesh is used
   since the internal geometry of the domain to be identified is not known
   a priori. In this work, the generation of problem-specific meshes is
   studied and such meshes are shown to significantly improve
   inverse-problem elastic parameter reconstruction. Improved meshes are
   generated from axial strain images, which provide an approximation to
   the underlying structure, using an optimization-based mesh adaptation
   approach. Such strain-based adapted meshes fit the underlying geometry
   even at coarse mesh resolutions, therefore improving the effective
   resolution of the reconstruction at a given mesh size/complexity.
   Elasticity reconstructions are then performed iteratively using the
   reflective trust-region method for optimizing the fit between estimated
   and observed displacements. This approach is studied for Young's modulus
   reconstruction at various mesh resolutions through simulations, yielding
   40\%-72\% decrease in root-mean-square reconstruction error and 4-52
   times improvement in contrast-to-noise ratio in simulations of a
   numerical phantom with a circular inclusion. A noise study indicates
   that conventional structured meshes with no noise perform considerably
   worse than the proposed adapted meshes with noise levels up to 20\% of
   the compression amplitude. A phantom study and preliminary in vivo
   results from a breast tumor case confirm the benefit of the proposed
   technique. Not only conventional axial strain images but also other
   elasticity approximations can be used to adapt meshes. This is
   demonstrated on images generated by combining axial strain and
   axial-shear strain, which enhances lateral image contrast in particular
   settings, consequently further improving mesh-adapted reconstructions.}},

Title = {{Capillary breakup of a liquid torus}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{717}},
Pages = {{281-292}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Capillary instability of a Newtonian liquid torus suspended in an
   immiscible Newtonian medium is computed using a Cahn-Hilliard
   diffuse-interface model. The main differences between the torus and a
   straight thread are the presence of an axial curvature and an external
   flow field caused by the retraction of the torus. We show that the
   capillary wave initially grows linearly as on a straight thread. The
   axial curvature decreases the growth rate of the capillary waves while
   the external flow enhances it. Breakup depends on the competition of two
   time scales: one for torus retraction and the other for neck pinch-off.
   The outcome is determined by the initial amplitude of the disturbance,
   the thickness of the torus relative to its circumference, and the
   torus-to-medium viscosity ratio. The linearly dominant mode may not
   persist till nonlinear growth and breakup. The numerical results are
   generally consistent with experimental observations.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a new approach to magnetic resonance elastography
   of the prostate using transperineal mechanical excitation. This approach
   is validated using a prostate elasticity phantom and in vivo studies of
   healthy volunteers. It is demonstrated that the transperineal approach
   can generate shear wave amplitudes on the order of 630 mu m in the
   mid-gland region. The driver was implemented using an electromagnetic
   actuator with a hydraulic transmission system. The magnetic resonance
   elastography acquisition time has been reduced significantly by using a
   second harmonic approach. Displacement fields are processed using the
   established three-dimensional local frequency estimation algorithm. The
   three-dimensional curl-based direct inversion was used to calculate the
   local wavelength. The traveling wave expansion algorithm was used to
   reconstruct the wave damping image for one case. Using the proposed
   method, it was possible to resolve lesions of 0.5 cc in the phantom
   study. Repeatability experiments were performed and analyzed. The
   results from this study indicate that transperineal magnetic resonance
   elastographywithout an endorectal coilis a suitable candidate for a
   patient study involving multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of
   prostate cancer, where magnetic resonance elastography may provide
   additional information for improved diagnosis and image-based
   surveillance. Magn Reson Med, 2013. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Journal = {{SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{190}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel method is proposed for the first time to obtain
   static pull-in voltages with fringing field effects in electrostatically
   actuated cantilever and clamped-clamped micro-beams where the mid-plane
   stretching and the residual axial load are taken into account for
   clamped-clamped boundary conditions. The non-classical Euler-Bernoulli
   beam model containing one material length scale parameter is adopted to
   effectively capture the size effect. In the solution procedure, the
   governing fourth-order differential equation of variable coefficients is
   converted into a Fredholm integral equation. By adopting the first
   natural mode of the cantilever and clamped-clamped micro-beams as a
   deflection shape function, the resulting equation is solved for the
   static pull-in voltages. The accuracy of the present analytical
   closed-form solution is verified through comparing with the
   experimentally measured and numerical data conducted in the published
   works. From the experimental data available in the literature, the value
   of the material length scale parameter for the (poly)silicon is
   estimated to be in the order of magnitude of 10(-1) mu m. Then, the
   effect of the material length scale parameter on the pull-in voltages of
   the cantilever and clamped-clamped micro-beams is investigated. The
   results indicate that the tensile residual stress can extend the
   validity range of the classical continuum mechanics to lower beam
   thicknesses. It is also found that microcantilever beams are more
   sensitive to the size effect than their corresponding clamped-clamped
   micro-beams. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The entrainment of oxide films into the bulk material has been shown to
   have a detrimental effect on casting integrity. A number of mechanisms
   have been shown to initiate the entrainment of oxide films, including:
   returning waves, plunging jets, bubble trails and fountains. Therefore,
   the assessment of the casting system for these features by the foundry
   engineer is critical in improving casting quality.
   The use of computational fluid dynamics software packages, which are now
   widely available to the foundry engineer, has allowed the foundry
   engineer to improve casting system design by using qualitative
   parameters. Optimization software is now an economically viable option
   for many foundries. However, optimization for casting integrity requires
   a quantitative casting integrity assessment technique, which allows the
   modeling and quantification of defects. Therefore, modeling and
   quantification of defects is becoming an ever more important research
   area to allow the optimization software manufacturers to meet the needs
   of industry.
   The current methods found in published literature for the modeling of
   casting defects have been described and critically reviewed, shedding
   light on the qualities and issues currently associated with the present.
   available methods. However it is clear that further investigations and
   developments are still required to allow the accurate and efficient
   modeling of casting defects. The topics of research relating to the
   modelling of casting defects which require further investigation have
   been highlighted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Irradiation of metallic surfaces using ultra-short pulse laser results
   in a dual-scale structure. While metallic surfaces are superhydrophilic
   immediately after laser irradiation, prolonged exposure to air renders
   surfaces superhydrophobic due to surface reactions and deposition of
   carbonaceous materials onto the surface. In this work, we have
   fabricated a paraboloid microstructure, which is analyzed
   thermodynamically through the use of the Gibbs free energy to obtain the
   equilibrium contact angle and contact angle hysteresis. The effects of

Abstract = {{Out-of-autoclave prepregs require a two-step cure cycle. The first step
   is a low temperature cure to consolidate the laminate and build
   sufficient green strength to proceed to the second step, a free-standing
   post-cure at traditional autoclave temperatures to fully cross-link the
   resin. Process modeling can help design a robust cure cycle to avoid
   scrapping large parts in production. The focus of this article is to
   develop the cure kinetics, viscosity, and glass transition temperature
   models for two commercially available out-of-autoclave epoxy resins.
   Since the cure kinetics model is the basis for all other thermal models,
   the cure kinetics model was validated using a one-dimensional heat
   transfer analysis on thick prepreg laminates. Finally, the
   out-of-autoclave resin models were compared to a traditional autoclave
   resin system to highlight the difference in resin reactivity for
   out-of-autoclave processing.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between oxygen permeation and homogeneous fuel
   oxidation reactions on the sweep side of an ion transport membrane (ITM)
   are examined using a comprehensive model, which couples the dependency
   of the oxygen permeation rate on the membrane surface conditions and
   detailed chemistry and transport in the vicinity of the membrane. We
   assume that the membrane surface is not catalytic to hydrocarbon or
   syngas oxidation. Results show that increasing the sweep gas inlet
   temperature and fuel concentration enhances oxygen permeation
   substantially. This is accomplished through promoting oxidation
   reactions (oxygen consumption) and the transport of the products and
   reaction heat towards the membrane, which lowers the oxygen
   concentration and increases the gas temperature near the membrane.
   Faster reactions at higher fuel concentration and higher inlet gas
   temperature support substantial fuel conversion and lead to a higher
   oxygen permeation flux without the contribution of surface catalytic
   activity. Beyond a certain maximum in the fuel concentration, extensive
   heat loss to the membrane (and feed side) reduces the oxidation kinetic
   rates and limits oxygen permeation as the reaction front reaches the
   membrane. The sweep gas flow rate and channel height have moderate
   impacts on oxygen permeation and fuel conversion due to the residence
   time requirements for the chemical reactions and the location of the
   reaction zone relative to the membrane surface. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the design, fabrication, and electromechanical
   characteristics of inductive stents developed for intelligent stent
   applications. The stents, fabricated out of 316L stainless-steel tubes
   using laser machining, are patterned to have zigzag loops without bridge
   struts, and when expanded, become a helix-like structure. Highly
   conductive metals such as copper and gold are coated on the stents to
   improve their inductive/antenna function. The Q-factor of the stent is
   shown to increase by a factor of 7 at 150 MHz with copper coating. The
   expansion of the stent from 2 to 4 mm diameter results in a 3.2x
   increase in the inductance, obtaining similar to 1 mu H at a similar
   frequency. The stent passivated by Parylene-C film is used to
   characterize its resonance in different media including saline. The
   copper-coated inductive stent exhibits a 2.4x radial stiffness for 1 mm
   strain as well as a 16x bending compliance compared with a commercial
   stent, each of which is potentially beneficial in preventing/mitigating
   stent failures such as recoil as well as enabling easier navigation
   through intricate blood vessels. The mechanical stiffness may be
   tailored by adjusting stent-wire thickness while maintaining necessary
   coating thickness to achieve particular mechanical requirements and high
   inductive performance simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in proximate composition of fish and rice flour coextrudates
   like moisture, protein, and fat content were studied with respect to
   extrusion process variables like barrel temperature, x (1) (100-200 A
   degrees C); screw speed, x (2) (70-110 rpm); fish content of the feed, x
   (3) (5-45\%); and feed moisture content, x (4) (20-60\%). Experiments
   were conducted at five levels of the process variables based on
   rotatable experimental design. Response surface models (RSM) were
   developed that adequately described the changes in moisture, protein,
   and fat content of the extrudates based on the coefficient of
   determination (R (2)) values of 0.95, 0.99, and 0.94. ANOVA analysis
   indicated that extrudate moisture content was influenced by x (4),
   protein content by x (1) and x (3), and fat content by x (3) and x (4)
   at P < 0.001. Trends based on response surface plots indicated that the
   x (1) of about 200 A degrees C, x (2) of about 90 rpm, x (3) of about
   25\%, and x (4) of about 20\% minimized the moisture in the extrudates.
   Protein content was maximized at x (1) of 100 A degrees C, x (2) > 80
   rpm, x (3) of about 45\%, and x (4) > 50\%, and fat content was
   minimized at x (1) of about 200 A degrees C, x (2) of about 85-95 rpm, x
   (3) < 15\%, and x (4) of about > 50\%. Optimized process variables based
   on a genetic algorithm (GA) for minimum moisture and fat content and
   maximum protein content were x (1) = 199.86, x (2) = 109.86, x (3) =
   32.45, x (4) = 20.03; x (1) = 199.71, x (2) = 90.09, x (3) = 15.27, x

   59.54. The predicted values were 17.52\%, 0.57\%, and 46.65\%. Based on

Abstract = {{Upgrading noncode conforming buildings to mitigate seismic induced
   damages is important in moderate to high seismic hazard regions. The
   damage, can be mitigated by using conventional (e.g. FRP wrapping) and
   emerging (e.g. smart structures) retrofit techniques. A model for the
   structure to be retrofitted should include relevant performance
   indicators. This paper proposes a variable stiffness smart structure
   device known as the Smart Spring to be integrated on building structures
   to mitigate seismic induced damage. The variable stiffness capability is
   of importance to structures that exhibit vertical (e.g. soft storey)
   irregularities and to meet different performance levels under seismic
   excitation. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed retrofitting
   technique, a four-storey steel building is modelled in MATLAB and
   appropriate performance indicators are chosen. Various return period
   seismic hazards are generated from past earthquake event records to
   predict the structure's performance. The performance improvement because
   of the retrofitting of building structures using the variable stiffness
   device is presented. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Non-ductile reinforced concrete buildings represent a prevalent
   construction type found in many parts of the world. Due to the seismic
   vulnerability of such buildings, in areas of high seismic activity
   non-ductile reinforced concrete buildings pose a significant threat to
   the safety of the occupants and damage to such structures can result in
   large financial losses. This paper introduces advanced analytical models
   that can be used to simulate the nonlinear dynamic response of these
   structural systems, including collapse. The state-of-the-art loss
   simulation procedure developed for new buildings is extended to estimate
   the expected losses of existing non-ductile concrete buildings
   considering their vulnerability to collapse. Three criteria for
   collapse, namely first component failure, side-sway collapse, and
   gravity-load collapse, are considered in determining the probability of
   collapse and the assessment of financial losses. A detailed example is
   presented using a seven-story non-ductile reinforced concrete frame
   building located in the Los Angeles, California. Copyright (c) 2012 John

Abstract = {{Fractionation of metals in natural sediment and suspended particulate
   matter (SPM) of Tadjan River is investigated. Competitive sorption,
   sorption capacities of sediment and SPM as well as fractionation of
   metal-loaded sediment and SPM are also examined. A risk assessment code
   (RAC) is applied to estimate the risk of heavy metals release into the
   environment during the sorption process. Results revealed that sediments
   and SPM containing more than 25 \% of clay minerals and higher amounts
   of calcite have great capacity of metal sorption, particularly for Cu,
   Ni, and Mn. Assessing the risk of metals release prior to and following
   sorption tests indicates that RAC of metals would significantly increase
   from the level of no or low risk in natural sediment and SPM to high or
   very high risk after sorption. The Langmuir model reveals that the
   highest affinity for Cu, Mn, and Ni in sediment is the organic fraction.
   The classic isotherm models of Freundlich and Langmuir can fit the data
   from chemical extraction studies of adsorbed metals, indicating that
   although sorption was apparently a physical and chemical process in the
   river, isotherm models can be used to simulate the sorption and
   accumulation in different geochemical phases within the particulate
   matter.}},

Abstract = {{Effective techniques for post-silicon validation are required to better
   evaluate functional correctness of increasingly complex multi and
   many-core SoCs. However, there is little data evaluating the coverage of
   post-silicon validation efforts on industrial-scale designs. In this
   paper, we address this knowledge gap by instrumenting a nontrivial SoC
   with on-chip coverage monitors to measure the coverage achieved by
   typical post-silicon validation tests, such as booting the operating
   system (OS). We compare coverage achieved pre and post-silicon, and also
   measure the area overhead required to monitor post-silicon coverage. Our
   results show that the typical test of booting the OS often achieves high
   coverage, well correlated to what is achieved by pre-silicon directed
   tests, but in some blocks the coverage can be low or markedly different
   between pre and post-silicon, highlighting the importance of
   post-silicon validation in general and post-silicon coverage measurement
   in particular.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel combinatorial search algorithm for
   determining minimum circumscribed (MC) circles and spheres from discrete
   data points. The presented algorithm is able to efficiently identify the
   essential subset of the input data points to construct the MC
   circle/sphere for the entire data set. The common issue of computational
   explosion for a large data set due to a greatly increased number of
   combinatorial searches is thus of no concern. The main feature of this
   work is the derivation of an innovative geometric property, named the
   Integrated Property (IP), for a unique three-point subset in 2D or a
   unique four-point subset in 3D. The significance is that the MC
   circle/sphere for the identified IP point subset is in fact the MC
   circle/sphere for the entire data set. As the unique IP point subset can
   always be found, the presented algorithm is guaranteed to yield exact MC
   circle/sphere solutions. A related data exchange scheme is formulated to
   efficiently identify the unique IP point subset from the input point
   set. The expected computational complexity of the search algorithm is
   quantified to be O(n log n) through a large number of computational test
   cases. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{IEEE-ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{190-199}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A typical mechatronic problem (modeling, identification, and design)
   entails finding the best system topology as well as the associated
   parameter values. The solution requires concurrent and integrated
   methodologies and tools based on the latest theories. The experience on
   natural evolution of an engineering system indicates that the system
   topology evolves at a much slower rate than the parametric values. This
   paper proposes a two-loop evolutionary tool, using a hybrid of genetic
   algorithm (GA) and genetic programming (GP) for design optimization of a
   mechatronic system. Specifically, GP is used for topology optimization,
   while GA is responsible for finding the elite solution within each
   topology proposed by GP. A memory feature is incorporated with the GP
   process to avoid the generation of repeated topologies, a common
   drawback of GP topology exploration. The synergic integration of GA with
   GP, along with the memory feature, provides a powerful search ability,
   which has been integrated with bond graphs (BG) for mechatronic model
   exploration. The software developed using this approach provides a
   unified tool for concurrent, integrated, and autonomous topological
   realization of a mechatronic problem. It finds the best solution
   (topology and parameters) starting from an abstract statement of the
   problem. It is able to carry out the process of system configuration
   realization, which is normally performed by human experts. The
   performance of the software tool is validated by applying it to
   mechatronic design problems.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 29}},
Abstract = {{When a barotropic shear layer becomes unstable, it produces the
   well-known Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). The nonlinear
   manifestation of the KHI is usually in the form of spiral billows.
   However, a piecewise linear shear layer produces a different type of KHI
   characterized by elliptical vortices of constant vorticity connected via
   thin braids. Using direct numerical simulation and contour dynamics, we
   show that the interaction between two counterpropagating vorticity waves
   is solely responsible for this KHI formation. We investigate the
   oscillation of the vorticity wave amplitude, the rotation and nutation
   of the elliptical vortex, and straining of the braids. Our analysis also
   provides a possible explanation for the formation and evolution of
   elliptical vortices appearing in geophysical and astrophysical flows,
   e.g., meddies, stratospheric polar vortices, Jovian vortices, Neptune's
   Great Dark Spot, and coherent vortices in the wind belts of Uranus. DOI:

Abstract = {{In this study, schemes for optimisation of power allocation (OPA) for
   asymmetric relay placement are presented for multi-hop communication in
   a Rayleigh-fading environment. For a decode-and-forward (DF) multi-hop
   communication system, expressions are derived for optimised power
   allocation based on symbol error probability (SEP) and global channel
   state information (GCSI). The analysis for OPA based on GCSI is extended
   to a hybrid combination of amplify-and-forward (AF) and DF relays.
   Analysis is done for two kinds of modulation schemes: M-ary phase-shift
   keying with coherent detection and orthogonal M-ary frequency-shift
   keying with non-coherent detection. Simulation results show that for a
   multi-hop system with asymmetric relay placement, power optimisation
   schemes perform better than the conventional equal power allocation
   scheme. In addition, power optimisation based on GCSI shows
   substantially improved performance compared with power allocation based
   on end-to-end SEP. Further, performance comparison is shown for increase
   in number of relay nodes in an AF and DF multi-hop system with and
   without power allocation. The performance of a DF system improves with
   increase in number of relay nodes whereas performance of an AF system
   degrades. Hybrid relaying provides an option to exercise switching
   between DF and AF so as to extract the maximum advantage of the two
   relaying schemes.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the distribution of antibiotic resistant Escherichia
   coli and E. coli O157 isolated from water, sediment and biofilms in an
   intensive agricultural watershed (Elk Creek, British Columbia) between
   2005 and 2007. It also examined physical and chemical water parameters
   associated with antibiotic resistance. Broth microdilution techniques
   were used to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for E.
   coli (n=214) and E. coli O157 (n=27) recovered isolates for ampicillin,
   cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin and
   tetracycline. Both E. coli and E. coli O157 isolates showed highest
   frequency of resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, streptomycin and
   nalidixic acid; respectively. For E. coli, the highest frequency of
   resistance was observed at the most agriculturally-impacted site, while
   the lowest frequency of resistance was found at the headwaters. Sediment
   and river rock biofilms were the most likely to be associated with
   resistant E. coli, while water was the least likely. While seasonality
   (wet versus dry) had no relationship with resistance frequency, length
   of biofilm colonization of the substratum in the aquatic environment
   only affected resistance frequency to nalidixic acid and tetracycline.
   Multivariate logistic regressions showed that water depth, nutrient
   concentrations, temperature, dissolved oxygen and salinity had
   statistically significant associations with frequency of E. coli
   resistance to nalidixic acid, streptomycin, ampicillin and tetracycline.
   The results indicate that antibiotic resistant E. coli and E. coli O157
   were prevalent in an agricultural stream. Since E. coli is adept at
   horizontal gene transfer and prevalent in biofilms and sediment, where
   ample opportunities for genetic exchange with potential environmental
   pathogens present themselves, resistant isolates may present a risk to
   ecosystem, wildlife and public health. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   (iron)\%, with similar to 85\% reduction (all metals) in UV-abs-254
   (UV-abs-254 final = 0.06 cm(-1)) for Suwannee NOM. Specific UV
   absorbance (SUVA-L/mg m) values decreased from 3.1 to 4.2 to under 2.0,

   exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) fractionation supported SUVA results,
   showing reductions from 76\% of DOC > 1450 Da to approximately 40\%

Abstract = {{The selective ring opening of decalin over Pd/H-Y-30, Ir/H-Beta-300 and
   Ir/H-Beta-25 catalysts, measured in a stirred, batch reactor at 350
   degrees C and 3 MPa H-2, showed that Ir/H-Beta-25 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 25) had
   the highest activity and yield of ring-opened products. The effect of
   temperature (275-350 degrees C) and pressure (3-6 MPa) on the activity
   and product selectivity was further investigated over the Ir/H-Beta-25
   catalyst. The highest ring-opened product yield (53 mol\%) was obtained
   at a decalin conversion of 90 mol\% at 325 degrees C and 6 MPa H-2. A
   Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model, that assumed a bifunctional
   catalytic process in which hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions
   occurred on metal sites and isomerization, ring-opening and cracking
   occurred on acid sites, was successfully applied to the data. The model
   included the effect of catalyst deactivation associated with the
   catalyst acid sites. Activation energies estimated from the model
   parameters showed that the ring opening of isomers had the lowest
   activation energy (141 kJ/mol), whereas cracking had the highest (159
   kJ/mol). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},

Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{A revised electrostatic theory for the charged dislocation lines within
   n-type GaN is formulated, this formalism allowing for the screening of
   the charge trapped along the dislocation lines, by both free carriers
   and a partial ionization of the impurities within the space-charge
   region surrounding the dislocation lines. This goes beyond the abrupt
   space-charge region assumption of the Read model {[}W. T. Read, Jr.,
   Philos. Mag. 45, 775 (1954)], where the only screening mechanism
   considered is a complete ionization of bulk donor atoms within the Read
   radius. In addition to determining the spatial distribution of the
   charge enveloping charged dislocation lines, this procedure also
   provides a solution to the electrostatic potential surrounding the
   dislocation lines. An iterative, self-consistent numerical approach to
   the solution of this problem is developed for the purposes of this
   analysis. A special limit for which the results of this model reduce to
   that of Read is indicated. The results obtained from our analysis are
   found to be in satisfactory agreement with experimental results from the
   literature. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Density functional theory (DFT) was used to study H-2 release from
   dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole over Pd. Dehydrogenation of the molecule
   starts from the five-membered ring by weakening the axial C-H bonds
   adjacent to the N atom. In the adsorption mode identified for
   dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole, the five-membered ring was located on a
   hollow site and the axial H atoms adjacent to N were positioned atop Pd
   atoms with an adsorption energy of -95 kJ/mol. The two axial C-H bonds
   of the five-membered ring showed a large increase in bond distance upon
   adsorption, from 1.10 to 1.16 angstrom, that was responsible for the
   weakening of these bonds. The adsorption mode for
   dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole explained the product distribution obtained
   from the dehydrogenation reaction with octahydro-N-ethylcarbazole and
   tetrahydro-N-ethylcarbazole identified as primary and secondary
   products, respectively. DFT was also used to investigate the structure
   sensitivity of dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole dehydrogenation observed on
   Pd catalysts. The effect of the ethyl group and N atom on the rate of
   dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole dehydrogenation was also investigated by
   comparing the adsorption energies of dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole with
   two other H-2 storage candidates, dodecahydrocarbazole and
   dodecahydrofluorene. The latter compounds had much slower H-2 recovery
   rates, a consequence of the strong adsorption of these compounds
   relative to dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole.}},

Abstract = {{The quality of liquid mixing into the main stream for an in-line
   mechanical mixer was investigated for water and pulp suspensions over a
   range of mass concentrations (0-3.0\%), main-stream velocities (0.5-3.0
   m/s), jet velocities (3.8-12.6 m/s), and rotational speeds (0-800 rpm)
   based on electrical resistance tomography and a modified mixing index,
   derived from the coefficient of variation of conductivity values. The
   mixing quality was worse when the jet penetrated to the far wall of the
   pipe for all fiber mass concentrations investigated, whereas this only
   applied at higher mass concentrations without the impeller. For water
   flow, the residence time had a significant effect on mixing at higher
   impeller speeds. With the impeller present, the mixing quality in pulp
   suspensions improved substantially and was similar to that for water
   when the flow approached the turbulent regime, with a considerably lower
   main-stream velocity required for mixing compared to a tee mixer alone.
   At higher mass concentrations, the energy supplied was insufficient to
   provide the same level of turbulence as that in water, even at the
   highest main-stream velocity and impeller speed examined. Improved
   mixing with increasing impeller speed primarily occurred in the
   high-shear zone around the impeller, with turbulence decaying rapidly
   downstream, likely aided by reflocculation.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission congestion management has been an important issue to power
   system operators and planners. As of the remedial/preventive actions,
   transmission reconfiguration has been employed to relieve congestion. In
   this paper, a methodology is proposed which optimally determines the
   system configuration to relieve congestion while respecting system
   security limits such as N-1 contingency criteria, voltage limits,
   voltage stability margin and transient stability. Most of these
   important criteria have been overlooked in the previous literature. The
   corresponding problem is solved using Benders decomposition method. The
   proposed methodology is evaluated using the IEEE 300-bus test system.}},

Abstract = {{Power flow solutions are the key in many power system studies. In this
   paper, the power flow problem is formulated within rectangular
   coordinates. Using a voltage-dependent load model and linear
   approximation techniques, the problem is formulated as a system of mixed
   linear and nonlinear equations. An efficient matrix decomposition is
   then applied to facilitate establishing the Jacobian matrix in the
   linear subproblems of Newton's method. The accuracy of the proposed
   method is compared to the original nonlinear formulation and relative
   errors less than 0.1\% are achieved. The average computation time of the
   proposed method is about 30\% less than the conventional method.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of multiview displays has made the need for synthesizing
   virtual views more pronounced, since it is not practical to capture all
   of the possible views when filming multiview content. View synthesis is
   performed using the available views and depth maps. There is a
   correlation between the quality of the synthesized views and the quality
   of depth maps. In this paper we study the effect of depth map quality on
   perceptual quality of synthesized view through subjective and objective
   analysis. Our evaluation results show that: 1) 3D video quality depends
   highly on the depth map quality and 2) the Visual Information Fidelity
   index computed between the reference and distorted depth maps has
   Pearson correlation ratio of 0.75 and Spearman rank order correlation
   coefficient of 0.67 with the subjective 3D video quality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops the theory for an adaptive Maximum Power Point
   Tracking (MPPT) strategy to reduce extraction losses and other issues
   typically introduced by Perturb and Observe (P\&O) algorithms. Three
   techniques to improve steady-state behavior and transient operation are
   discussed in detail: 1) idle operation on the Maximum Power Point (MPP),
   2) irradiance direction change identification and 3) multi-level
   adaptive tracking step.
   As a result, these strategies are combined to achieve superior overall
   performance while maintaining a simplicity of implementation. Two key
   elements which form the foundation of the techniques are discussed: the
   suppression of perturb oscillations at the MPP and the indirect
   identification of irradiance change through a current-monitoring
   algorithm. The Zero-oscillation, Adaptive-step Perturb and Observe
   (ZA-P\&O) strategy is studied with simulation and validated with
   experimental results. The mechanism for power extraction gains is
   evident, making the combined techniques an excellent solution to enhance
   MPPT performance.}},

Abstract = {{More and more distributed generation units are connected to the grid by
   DC-AC inverters as replacement of conventional generators. The inverters
   are usually controlled by Phase Lock Loop to sync its output frequency
   with the grid frequency. As a result, the grid inertia that used to be
   provided by conventional generators decreases and the grid becomes more
   vulnerable to disturbances. Prior articles have proposed several
   approaches to emulate the inertia characteristics of a synchronous
   generator by using energy storage systems (ESS) such as batteries.
   Inverter is controlled in such way that the ESS performs the function of
   a virtual synchronous generator (VSG). In this paper, a new control
   method for the ESS that smoothens the active power disturbances of the
   microgrid is proposed based on the existing VSG topologies. The new
   control is modeled as a part of the multilevel active power control
   system of the microgrid. In the examined case the microgrid is comprised
   of diesel generators, Photovoltaic (PV) generators, loads and proposed
   battery storage systems. This microgrid is tested for various active
   power disturbances, and the results show how the control method can
   enhances the grid stability.}},

Abstract = {{High voltage direct current (HVDC) systems are of great importance in
   power systems especially for long distance transmission. It is therefore
   necessary to develop efficient and accurate models of these switching
   systems for design purpose and system level studies. In order to avoid
   switching in the model and simulation, the average-value models (AVM)
   which are continuous and computationally efficient have been developed
   in the literature. In this paper, the HVDe system including its controls
   has been modeled using analytical and parametric approaches of
   average-value modeling. The developed AVMs are compared with the
   detailed simulation, and it is shown that the models are accurate in
   predicting the large-signal time-domain transients of the actual

   the dendrite growth, which was uniform all over the entire surface of Pt
   electrode. The recovery ratios of palladium at different nitric acid
   concentrations were high, and the Faradic efficiency decreased as the
   nitric acid concentration was increased, which might be due to the
   reduction of nitric or H+ ions. The reduction of palladium (II) was
   irreversible and stirring during electrolysis could improve the
   electrodeposition rate. (c) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Laparoscopic ultrasound is a useful adjunct for guidance in minimally
   invasive surgery. Tracking the location of the ultrasound transducer
   relative to the laparoscope would enable an augmented reality overlay of
   subsurface anatomical features on the surgeon's field of view. The
   accuracy of tracking is a critical aspect for such augmented reality
   guidance. We propose stereo tracking of visible markers on a new
   ``pick-up{''} laparoscopic ultrasound transducer and a direct
   transformation of the ultrasound image into the coordinates of a stereo
   laparoscope. We also suggest that ultrasound calibration be performed
   using a separate stereo camera system with a wide baseline. Such
   calibration is shown to improve point reconstruction accuracy from 3.1
   mm to 1.3 mm.}},

Abstract = {{Through our research on natural ICT solutions for integration into a
   non-ICT based workflow at a Brazilian chronic care hospital, we created
   a new design process and two additional HCI design criteria for
   maintaining natural work processes using information and communication
   technologies (ICT). For our HCI design we propose two design pathways:
   1. iterating on adoption of designed technologies and 2. iterating on
   appropriation of these technologies. The degree of appropriation
   provides an indicator of how natural a design is since it allows for
   users' inventiveness to uncover latent affordances for use in new
   contexts. Thus, the use of an interface along with whether its potential
   is realized in new, user-oriented contexts, are critical elements for
   designing natural interfaces. We report our insights gained through
   observations and user-centered design for health professionals at a
   non-ICT based, large chronic-care hospital to support this perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Delineation of the prostate from transrectal ultrasound images is a
   necessary step in several computer-assisted clinical interventions, such
   as low dose rate brachytherapy. Current approaches to user segmentation
   require user intervention and therefore it is subject to user errors. It
   is desirable to have a fully automatic segmentation for improved
   segmentation consistency and speed. In this paper, we propose a
   multi-atlas fusion framework to automatically segment prostate
   transrectal ultrasound images. The framework initially registers a
   dataset of a priori segmented ultrasound images to a target image.
   Subsequently, it uses the pairwise similarity of registered prostate
   shapes, which is independent of the image-similarity metric optimized
   during the registration process, to prune the dataset prior to the
   fusion and consensus segmentation step. A leave-one-out cross-validation
   of the proposed framework on a dataset of 50 transrectal ultrasound
   volumes obtained from patients undergoing brachytherapy treatment shows
   that the proposed is clinically robust, accurate and reproducible.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate registration of ultrasound images to statistical shape models
   is a challenging problem in percutaneous spine injection procedures due
   to the typical imaging artifacts inherent to ultrasound. In this paper
   we propose a robust and accurate registration method that matches local
   phase bone features extracted from ultrasound images to a statistical
   shape model. The local phase information for enhancing the bone surfaces
   is obtained using a gradient energy tensor filter, which combines
   advantages of the monogenic scale-space and Gaussian scale-space
   filters, resulting in an improved simultaneous estimation of phase and
   orientation information. A novel statistical shape model was built by
   separating the pose statistics from the shape statistics. This model is
   then registered to the local phase bone surfaces using an iterative
   expectation maximization registration technique. Validation on 96 in
   vivo clinical scans obtained from eight patients resulted in a root mean
   square registration error of 2 mm (SD: 0.4 mm), which is below the
   clinically acceptable threshold of 3.5 mm. The improvement achieved in
   registration accuracy using the new features was also significant (p <
   0.05) compared to state of the art local phase image processing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Manifold learning of medical images plays a potentially important role
   for modeling anatomical variability within a population with
   applications that include segmentation, registration, and prediction of
   clinical parameters. This paper describes a novel method for learning
   the manifold of 3D brain images that, unlike most existing manifold
   learning methods, does not require the manifold space to be locally
   linear, and does not require a predefined similarity measure or a
   prebuilt proximity graph. Our manifold learning method is based on deep
   learning, a machine learning approach that uses layered networks (called
   deep belief networks, or DBNs) and has received much attention recently
   in the computer vision field due to their success in object recognition
   tasks. DBNs have traditionally been too computationally expensive for
   application to 3D images due to the large number of trainable
   parameters. Our primary contributions are 1) a much more computationally
   efficient training method for DBNs that makes training on 3D medical
   images with a resolution of up to 128 x 128 x 128 practical, and 2) the
   demonstration that DBNs can learn a low-dimensional manifold of brain
   volumes that detects modes of variations that correlate to demographic
   and disease parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the ever-increasing density and complexity of integrated
   circuits, FPGA prototyping has become a necessary part of the design
   process. To enhance observability into these devices, designers commonly
   insert trace-buffers to record and expose the values on a small subset
   of internal signals during live operation to help root-cause errors. For
   dense designs, routing congestion will restrict the number of signals
   that can be connected to these trace-buffers. In this work, we apply
   optimal network flow graph algorithms, a well studied technique, to the
   problem of transporting circuit signals to embedded trace-buffers for
   observation. Specifically, we apply a minimum cost maximum flow
   algorithm to gain maximum signal observability with minimum total
   wirelength. We showcase our techniques on both theoretical FPGA
   architectures using VPR, and with a Xilinx Virtex6 device, finding that
   for the latter, over 99.6\% of all spare RAM inputs can be reclaimed for
   tracing across four large benchmarks.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of heart rate and blood oxygen saturation with an imaging
   array on a mobile phone (camera oximetry) has great potential for mobile
   health applications as no additional hardware other than a camera and
   LED flash enabled phone are required. However, this approach is
   challenging as the configuration of the camera can negatively influence
   the estimation quality. Further, the number of photons recorded with the
   photo detector is largely dependent on the optical path length,
   resulting in a non-homogeneous image. In this paper we describe a novel
   method to automatically detect the optimal region of interest (ROI) for
   the captured image to extract a pulse waveform. We also present a study
   to select the optimal camera settings, notably the white balance. The
   experiments show that the incandescent white balance mode is the
   preferable setting for camera oximetry applications on the tested mobile
   phone (Samsung Galaxy Ace). Also, the ROI algorithm successfully
   identifies the frame regions which provide waveforms with the largest
   amplitudes.}},

Abstract = {{Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children can lead to daytime
   sleepiness, growth failure and developmental delay. Polysomnography
   (PSG), the gold standard to diagnose OSA is highly resource intensive
   and is confined to the sleep laboratory. In this study we propose to
   identify children with OSA using blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2))
   obtained from the Phone Oximeter. This portable, in-home device is able
   to monitor patients over multiple nights, causes less sleep disturbance
   and facilitates a more natural sleep pattern. The proposed algorithm
   analyzes the SpO(2) signal in the time and frequency domain using a 90-s
   sliding window. Three spectral parameters are calculated from the power
   spectral density (PSD) to evaluate the modulation in the SpO(2) due to
   the oxyhemoblobin desaturations. The power P, slope S in the
   discriminant band (DB), and ratio R between P and total power are
   calculated for each window. Tendency and variability indices, number of
   SpO(2) desaturations and time spent under 2\% or 3\% of baseline
   saturation level are computed for each time window. The statistical
   distribution of the temporal evolution of all parameters is analyzed to
   identify 68 children, 30 with OSA and 38 without OSA (nonOSA). This
   characterization was evaluated by a feature selection based on a linear
   discriminant. The combination of temporal and spectral parameters
   provided the best leave one out crossvalidation results with an accuracy
   of 86.8\%, a sensitivity of 80.0\%, and a specificity of 92.1\% using
   only 5 parameters. The median of R, mean of P and S and mean and
   standard deviation of the number of desaturations below 3\% of baseline
   saturation level, were the most representative parameters. Hence, a
   better knowledge of SpO(2) dynamics could help identifying children with
   OSA with the Phone Oximeter.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computationally efficient method to design an
   artificial bionic baroreflex. This work is built upon a physiology-based
   mathematical model of autonomic-cardiac regulation describing the
   regulation of heart rate and blood pressure as well as a system
   identification technique to identify a subject-specific mathematical
   model for each subject. The control strategy to regulate blood pressure
   is developed based upon the in-vivo baroreflex mechanism. A unique
   strength of the proposed method is its capability to determine the
   modulating baroreflex functions on the sympathetic and parasympathetic
   nerve activities. This method can be used in the treatment of
   individuals with baroreflex failure through overriding the corresponding
   nerves to properly regulate blood pressure. In fact, nerve overriding
   causes heart rate and arterial stiffness to adjust such that blood
   pressure reaches a proper range to provide enough oxygenated-blood to
   the critical organs.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. A novel real-time cardiorespiratory coherence (CRC) algorithm
   has been developed to monitor nociception during general anesthesia. CRC
   uses custom designed filters to track and analyze the respiratory sinus
   arrhythmia (RSA) as it moves in time and frequency. CRC is a form of
   sensor fusion between heart rate and respiration, estimating the
   strength of linear coupling between the two signals. The aim of this
   study was to estimate the effect of changes in respiration rate (RR) and
   peak airway pressure (PPaw) on CRC. The response of CRC was compared to
   a prior offline wavelet-based algorithm (WTCRC) as well as traditional
   univariate heart rate variability (HRV) measures. A nociception index
   was created for each algorithm, ranging from 0 (no nociception) to 100
   (strong nociception).
   Methods. Following ethics approval and informed consent, data were
   collected from 48 children receiving general anesthesia during dental
   surgery. The times of change in RR and PPaw events were noted in
   real-time. A total of 43 RR and 35 PPaw change events were analyzed post
   hoc in pseudo real-time. The nociception index averages were compared
   between a baseline period and a response period around each event. A
   Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare changes.
   Results. The change in RR changed the CRC nociception index by an
   average of -2.2 {[}95\% CI from -10 to 4.7] (P > 0.3), and the change in
   PPaw changed the CRC nociception index by an average of 5.4 {[}-1.0 to
   11] (P > 0.1). The changes were smaller than those of many traditional
   HRV measures.
   Conclusions. Real-time CRC was blind to the changes in respiration, and
   was less sensitive than many of the traditional HRV measures. A
   nociception index based on CRC can thus function across a wider range of
   respiratory conditions than can many traditional univariate HRV
   measures. The real-time CRC algorithm shows promise for monitoring
   nociception during general anesthesia.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel entropy-based measure to quantify the circadian
   variations of scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) by analyzing waking
   epochs of nap opportunities under an ultradian sleep-wake cycle (USW)
   protocol. To compute this circadian measure for a nap opportunity, each
   waking epoch (similar to 1 sec) is decomposed using wavelet packet
   transform and the relative energy for the desired frequency band (here,
   10-12 Hz) is calculated. Then, in a bootstrapping procedure, a shape
   statistic (skewness or kurtosis) of the relative energy distribution,
   after each resampling, is computed. Finally, the probability density
   function of this statistic is estimated, and the corresponding
   differential entropy is considered as the circadian measure. This
   measure was evaluated using EEG recordings from 4 healthy subjects
   during a 72-h USW procedure. According to the results, the proposed
   measure showed a significant circadian variation both for individual and
   group data, with peak values occurring near the core body temperature
   minimum. The performance of the entropy-based measure was also compared
   with that of two other measures, namely mean energy logarithm and mean
   energy ratio, revealing the superiority of this measure.}},

Abstract = {{Heart Rate Variability (HRV), the variation of time intervals between
   heartbeats, is one of the most promising and widely used quantitative
   markers of autonomic activity. Traditionally, HRV is measured as the
   series of instantaneous cycle intervals obtained from the
   electrocardiogram (ECG). In this study, we investigated the estimation
   of variation in heart rate from a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal,
   called pulse rate variability (PRV), and assessed its accuracy as an
   estimate of HRV in children with and without sleep disordered breathing
   (SDB). We recorded raw PPGs from 72 children using the Phone Oximeter,
   an oximeter connected to a mobile phone. Full polysomnography including
   ECG was simultaneously recorded for each subject. We used correlation
   and Bland-Altman analysis for comparing the parameters of HRV and PRV
   between two groups of children. Significant correlation (r > 0.90, p <
   0.05) and close agreement were found between HRV and PRV for mean
   intervals, standard deviation of intervals (SDNN) and the root-mean
   square of the difference of successive intervals (RMSSD). However
   Bland-Altman analysis showed a large divergence for LF/HF ratio
   parameter. In addition, children with SDB had depressed SDNN and RMSSD
   and elevated LF/HF in comparison to children without SDB. In conclusion,
   PRV provides the accurate estimate of HRV in time domain analysis but
   does not reflect precise estimation for parameters in frequency domain.}},

Abstract = {{In mobile health applications, non-expert users often perform the
   required medical measurements without supervision. Therefore, it is
   important that the mobile device guides them through the correct
   measurement process and automatically detects potential errors that
   could impact the readings. Camera oximetry provides a non-invasive
   measurement of heart rate and blood oxygen saturation using the camera
   of a mobile phone. We describe a novel method to automatically detect
   the correct finger placement on the camera lens for camera oximetry.
   Incorrect placement can cause optical shunt and if ignored, lead to low
   quality oximetry readings. The presented algorithm uses the spectral
   properties of the pixels to discriminate between correct and incorrect
   placements. Experimental results demonstrate high mean accuracy
   (99.06\%), sensitivity (98.06\%) and specificity (99.30\%) with low
   variability. By sub-sampling pixels, the computational cost of
   classifying a frame has been reduced by more than three orders of
   magnitude. The algorithm has been integrated in a newly developed
   application called OxiCam where it provides real-time user feedback.}},

Abstract = {{The uncertainty of cloud resources makes task scheduling very difficult,
   and may results in a waste of energy of cloud resources if some cloud
   resources stay in unusable state for a long time. This paper proposes
   the cloud resource evaluation model based on entropy optimization (EOEM)
   to solve the uncertain problem. The evaluation results also can be used
   to develop resource management strategies, which will be sufficient for
   saving energy. Particularly, the proposed model may release long-term
   unavailable resources to reduce energy consumption. With the entropy
   increasing minimum principle, the proposed model takes the objective
   function of resource providers and user as constraints of maximum
   entropy function, thus it can balance profits of both cloud resource
   providers and cloud users. Meanwhile, the system utilization can be
   maximized and the resources satisfying QoS can be screened. For
   demonstrating their performance we evaluate the proposed model by
   simulation experiment. Simulation results reveal the positive effect of
   the entropy optimization to satisfaction degree of users and completion
   time of task. The model also shows better adaptability when cloud
   resources join or quit the cloud.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a game-theoretic approach to node activation control
   in parameter estimation via diffusion least mean squares (LMS). The
   energy-aware activation control is a noncooperative repeated game where
   nodes autonomously decide when to activate based on a utility function
   that captures the trade-off between node's contribution and energy
   expenditure. The proposed two time-scale stochastic approximation
   algorithm ensures the parameter estimates weakly converge to the true
   parameter across the network, yet the global activation behavior along
   the way tracks the set of correlated equilibria of the underlying
   activation control game.}},

Abstract = {{In a recent study a novel classification algorithm called the Sparse
   Classifier (SC) assumes that if a test sample belongs to class k then it
   can be approximately represented by a linear combination of the training
   samples belonging to k. Good face recognition results were obtained by
   the SC method. This paper proposes two generalizations of the aforesaid
   assumption. The first generalization assumes that the test sample raised
   to a power can be approximated by a linear combination of the training
   samples of that class raised to the same powers. The second
   generalization assumes that the test samples raised to a power can be
   approximately represented by a non-linear combination of the training
   samples raised to the same power. The first generalization requires
   solving a group-sparse optimization problem with linear constraints
   while the second assumption requires solving a group-sparse optimization
   problem with non-linear constraints. We propose two greedy sub-optimal
   algorithms to solve the said problems. The classifiers developed in this
   work are used for single-image-per-person face recognition. We find that
   our first generalization leads to an improvement of 2-3\% in recognition
   accuracy over SC, while the second generalization improves the
   recognition accuracy even further; about 6-7\% better than the first
   generalization.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a non-convex method for rank aware row-sparse
   Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) recovery. Recent studies in row-sparse
   MMV recovery observed that better results can be achieved when the
   recovery algorithm takes into account the fact that the MMV matrix to be
   recovered is low-rank. The proposed non-convex problem requires
   minimizing the sum of l(2,p)-norm and Schatten-q norm subject to data
   constraints. We derive an algorithm to solve the said problem based on
   the FOCally Under-determined System Solver (FOCUSS) approach. We compare
   our proposed method with state-of-the-art methods in rank aware and rank
   blind row-sparse MMV recovery. Our method always yields the best results

Abstract = {{Our research explores the growth of surface complexity through careful
   attention to program and performance criteria. As this complexity
   emerges, however, we are repeatedly confronted with the realization that
   its cost compromises any of its performance gains. While the aggregation
   of repeatable units with variation from one unit to the next is
   achievable at a low cost through subtractive fabrication technologies
   (CNC milling, laser cutting, waterjet cutting), it is more difficult to
   achieve through casting or forming technologies (concrete casting,
   injection molding, vacuum forming). This is because formwork is not
   adaptable. Once you produce a mold, typically at a high cost, that mold
   makes one component only. If you want variation, a new mold must be
   produced for each new component. With the projects Hexwall and VarVac
   Wall we put forward a simple question: can an intelligent, adaptable
   vacuum-forming mold be developed that allows for difference from one
   component to another without the necessity for multiple molds? The
   research positions our design efforts strategically at the front end of
   the fabrication process. Our goal is to develop a malleable tool that
   allows for endless variation in a fabrication process where variation is
   typically impractical.}},

Abstract = {{The scaling of Silicon devices has exacerbated the unreliability of
   modern computer systems, and power constraints have necessitated the
   involvement of software in hardware error detection. At the same time,
   emerging workloads in the form of soft computing applications, (e.g.,
   multimedia applications) can tolerate most hardware errors as long as
   the erroneous outputs do not deviate significantly from error-free
   outcomes. We term outcomes that deviate significantly from the
   error-free outcomes as Egregious Data Corruptions (EDCs).
   In this study, we propose a technique to place detectors for selectively
   detecting EDC causing errors in an application. We performed an initial
   study to formulate heuristics that identify EDC causing data. Based on
   these heuristics, we developed an algorithm that identifies program
   locations for placing high coverage detectors for EDCs using static
   analysis. We evaluate our technique on six benchmarks to measure the EDC
   coverage under given performance overhead bounds. Our technique achieves
   an average EDC coverage of 82\%, under performance overheads of 10\%,
   while detecting 10\% of the Non-EDC and benign faults.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the theory for a model-based Maximum Power Point
   Tracking (MPPTs) strategy for Marine Current Turbines (MCTs) that
   computes the optimal operating point using resource prediction and a
   look-up table. The high predictability of the Marine Currents (MCs) is
   exploited in order to produce a simple algorithm that calculates offline
   the optimal operating point for an evolving date and time. This
   eliminates the use of sensors to measure the current or the use of a
   perturbation to scan the curve. Two MPPT methods based on this strategy
   are discussed in detail: 1) fixed rotating speed with variable pitch
   angle and 2) fixed pitch angle with variable rotating speed.
   As a result, the two proposed MPPT methods improve the efficiency of the
   MCT creating a sensor-less, open loop strategy with precision and
   simplicity. The information needed to predict the MC is obtained through
   site characterization, a process required for any investment in green
   energy. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated
   through simulations.}},

Abstract = {{There has been an increasing interest in remote sensing and analysis of
   the environment. The applications include disaster monitoring,
   exploration, and natural resource protection. However, the human
   operation is labor intensive, time consuming and hazardous. The sensors
   fixed on-site in the environment suffer from limited sensing coverage
   and still requires human's on-site installation and maintenance. This
   paper proposed a novel system for the remote sensing and analysis of the
   environment using a mobile robot with on-board micro-spectrometer. A
   tracked locomotion is designed to adapt to tough terrains. The FLC
   (fuzzy logic control) navigate the mobile robot traversing trough the
   environment and collects the samples. The onboard micro-spectrometer
   system senses the samples and pattern of the solution spectrum is
   recognized through the ANN (artificial neural network). The results show
   the system can effectively and efficiently sample and classify several
   nominal solutions. The robot successfully transmits the spectrum and
   analysis to the remote control station through the proposed distributed
   architecture. The proof-of-concept demonstrates an unmanned operated
   chemical lab in motion for the remote sensing and analysis of the
   environment by integrating the micro-spectrometer with the autonomous

Abstract = {{This chapter summarizes the current state of the art on seismic risk
   analysis and management for civil infrastructure systems. In seismic
   risk analysis and seismic loss estimation, uncertainties are prevalent
   in hazard assessment, ground condition, ground motion prediction
   equations, building stock and infrastructure exposure, and vulnerability
   of infrastructure. The uncertainties often manifest as vagueness,
   missing information, etc., and the need for different formalisms of
   uncertainties is highlighted. Finally, a broader treatise of risk
   analysis and management is provided.}},

   systems, belief networks, and learning theory. In this chapter,
   application and utility of Bayesian belief network (BBN) in liquefaction
   assessment and seismic risk assessments at regional as well as

Abstract = {{Field-emitters based on patterned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays have
   promising properties. For example, they operate at low voltages and
   produce significant current. To pattern carbon nanotube arrays into
   various shapes, the typical approach consists of using lithography to
   pattern the catalyst prior to nanotube growth. However, this technique
   enables only two-dimensional patterning, where the height of the
   nanotubes remains unchanged. It is highly desirable to tailor the shape
   of CNT arrays in three dimensions (3D) in order to optimize the field
   emission performance of the arrays, including height control and
   creating angled surfaces. Here, we report on the polishing of the top
   surface of a CNT forest pillar and creation of cone-type structures in
   CNT arrays, similar in shape to the emitters in a conventional
   field-emitter array based on bulk metals. For this, we use dry
   micro-electro-discharge machining (mu EDM) in oxygen ambient. We also
   report the results of field-emission experiments from them and show that
   the beam resulting from the CNT cone produces a sharp, uniform emission
   spot on the phosphor screen in field-emission microscopy.}},

   We envision future industrial robot assistants that support workers in

   increasing productivity. However, this requires new channels of
   fine-grained, fast and reliable communication. In this research we
   examined the communication required for human-robot collaboration in a
   vehicle door assembly scenario. We identified potential communicative
   gestures applicable to this scenario, implemented these gestures on a
   Barrett WAM(TM1) manipulator, and evaluated them in terms of human
   recognition rate and response time in a real-time interaction. Response
   time analysis reveals insights into the communicative structure of robot
   motions; namely, key short gesture segments include the bulk of the
   communicative information. These results will help us design more
   efficient and fluid task flow in human-robot interaction scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a method for handling persistent visual occlusions that
   disrupt visual tracking for eye-in-hand systems. Our approach allows a
   robot to ``look behind{''} an occluder and re-acquire its target. To
   allow efficient planning, we avoid exhaustive mapping of the 3D occluder
   into configuration space, and instead use informed samples to strike a
   balance between target search and information gain. A particle filter
   continuously estimates the target location when it is not visible.
   Meanwhile, we build a simple but effective map of the occluder's extents
   to compute potential occlusion-clearing motions using very few calls to
   efficient approximations of inverse kinematics. Our mixed-initiative
   cost function balances the goal of directly locating the target with the
   goal of gaining information through mapping the occluder. Monte-Carlo
   optimization with efficient data-driven proposals allows us to
   approximate one-step solutions efficiently.
   Experimental evaluation performed on a realistic simulator shows that
   our method can quickly obtain clear views of the target, even when
   occlusions are persistent and significant camera motion is required.}},

Abstract = {{Lack of haptic feedback in teleoperated robot-assisted surgery (RAS) is
   known to be detrimental in many surgical tasks. While performing a class
   of force sensitive tasks, surgeons commonly use both hands. Oftentimes,
   one hand is used to exert tension/compression forces, and the other to
   hold the suture knot or tissue. A novel control framework to accomplish
   haptic force feedback for two-handed tasks in teleoperated RAS is
   presented in this paper. The force applied on the surgical environment
   by the action hand is not transferred back to the same hand, but rather
   to the other hand. In two-handed tasks that involve an action and a
   reaction force, this provides an intuitive way of feeling the action.
   Because the loop in not closed from the slave back to the master of the
   same hand, it does not have a destabilizing effect.
   The technique can be easily implemented using a variable-structure
   controller that combines two PD controllers and a switch. It has been
   evaluated with an experimental setup consisting of four haptic devices
   with promising results.}},

Abstract = {{Circulating fluidized beds are popular for large-scale combustion
   operations, and they are also gaining attention for gasification of
   carbonaceous feedstocks. Circulating fluidized beds utilize the entire
   height of tall vessels for gas-solids contacting, with no distinct
   interface between bed and freeboard. The corresponding flow regime is
   usually fast fluidization for combustion and gasification of solid
   fuels. Operating conditions, riser geometry, hydrodynamics, heat
   transfer, solids feed and particle recirculation all have significant
   influence on the operation and effectiveness of the system. This chapter
   reviews some of the most important hydrodynamic properties of
   circulating fluidized beds that are relevant in CFB gas-solid combustion
   and gasification reactions, with particular attention to results for
   columns of rectangular cross section. Gas and solid mixing are
   summarized also, and a brief survey of relevant heat transfer aspects is
   provided.}},

Abstract = {{Vibroelastography is a technique to measure tissue elasticity using a
   multi-frequency shear wave approach. The method uses ultrasound to image
   dynamic deformation of soft tissue while an actuator applies surface
   vibrations. In this paper we evaluate vibroelastography for the first
   time in differentiating between malignant and benign breast lesions.
   A dataset of 20 lesions, including fibroadenoma and invasive ductal
   carcinoma (IDC) lesions was analysed. Ultrasound radio-frequency data
   were captured while the breast tissue was vibrated with a snap-on
   actuator at multiple frequencies at an amplitude of less than 100
   microns. After the VE exam, the subjects underwent core-needle biopsy.
   The pathology report was used as the ground truth to validate the VE
   result. The VE results indicate that both benign fibroadenoma and IDC
   result in hardening of the tissue; however, IDC lesions exhibits higher
   values of elasticity compared to benign masses which can be captured
   using absolute and relative elasticity maps provided by VE.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we report the use of ultrasound RF time series analysis
   for separating benign and malignant breast lesions with similar B-mode
   appearance. The RF time series method is versatile and requires only a
   few seconds of imaging. We have employed the spectral and fractal
   features of ultrasound RF time series and used support vector machines
   with leave-one-patient-out cross validation of the classification. We
   have also produced cancer probability maps, by estimating the posterior
   malignancy probability of regions of size 1 mm(2) in the suspicious
   lesions. The first 12 patient cases of our ongoing study are reported
   here. Pathologic analysis of the cores using ultrasound guided needle
   biopsy confirmed the tissue type. We report an area under receiver
   operating characteristic curve of 0.82. We were able to successfully
   classify 6 out of 7 patients with malignant breast lesions and 4 out of
   5 patients with benign lesions, with success defined as correct
   classification of at least 75\% of the 1 mm2 regions in the area of the
   lesion. The above findings suggest that ultrasound time series along
   with support vector machines can help in differentiating malignant from
   benign breast lesions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose two combined antenna selection and beamforming
   schemes: eavesdropper channel nulling (ECN) and distributed phase
   alignment (DPA), for physical layer security in distributed antenna
   systems. Two out of all available distributed antennas are selected for
   secure transmission which is the minimum setting for implementing
   beamforming. Among all possible two-antenna combinations, the best one
   that shows the maximum secrecy rate is selected and, therefore, provides
   a selection gain. ECN cancels the received signal at an eavesdropper
   when the distributed antennas are subject to a total power constraint.
   As the distributed antennas may have individual power constraints in
   practice, we also propose DPA which aligns the phases of the received
   beams at the eavesdropper to minimize the received signal strength. For
   ECN with an average total power constraint, we propose an analysis model
   to track the achievable secrecy rate. Numerical results show that ECN
   exhibits a closed performance as the optimal beamforming with all
   distributed antennas.}},

Abstract = {{The three dimensional simulation for dry gas seal with constant depth
   spiral grooves and with different taper grooves is done using ANSYS
   FLUENT CFD code. Grid independence study and code validation are done
   with experimental work. The fluid state effect on the gas seal internal
   flow and performance is studied. The laminar and turbulent flow with RNG
   K-epsilon turbulence model and LES is examined for the same geometrical
   and operating conditions. The influence of film thickness for constant
   depth groove gas seal is simulated for 2, 3 and 4 mu m film. The effect
   of different rotational speeds on gas seal performance is examined for
   0, 2500, 5000, 7500 and 10380 rpm. Three taper spiral grooves are
   studied each with three different angles, including taper grooves in the
   radial, circumferential and combined radial-circumferential directions.
   The laminar flow simulation for the dry gas seal agree well with the
   experimental results more than the turbulent flow simulation which
   overestimate the pressure distribution inside the seal. The results
   indicate that as the rotational speed increases the seal open force and
   leakage increase. The use of tapered type spiral groove causes a
   reduction in the seal open force and the leakage rate. Increasing the
   angle of radial taper groove reduces the temperature distribution inside
   the gas film. The reduction in seal open force and leakage rate is
   higher when the combined radial-circumferential taper is more than
   radial and circumferential taper used. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{Unidirectional dry gas seal may experiences reverse rotation when
   equipped in a centrifugal compressor. This paper describes how the
   reverse rotation effects on the spiral unidirectional dry gas seal
   performance and pressure distribution inside the gas film, also an
   investigation of using a different herringbone shape grooves
   configurations has been done using ANSYS FLUENT 14.5 CFD simulation. The
   influence of decreasing rotational speed to the static condition and
   rotate in the reverse direction on internal flow and gas seal
   performance is examined from 10800 to -10380 rpm. The results indicate
   that the internal pressure distribution inside the gas seal in reverse
   rotation is decreased and the open force consequently decreased by 4\%.
   The modification on the same seal is done to enhance its performance at
   reverse rotation condition. The herringbone spiral grooves is used with
   different configuration, the new configurations are examined in the
   forward and reverse rotation direction. The analysis for the pressure
   distribution is done and its effect on the seal performance is examined.
   Seal performance is compared with standard one for all geometrical and
   operating conditions. At high forward rotational speed 10380 rpm, the
   pressure at the end of the spiral groove is about 11.4 \% higher than
   the inlet pressure at the seal outer diameter, while at reverse
   rotation, the pressure is not increased in radial direction. The open
   force corresponding to reverse rotation increased with a value 1.5 kN
   for both the 100 overlap and 50\% forward overlap seal faces, but using
   seal face with 50\% backward overlap failed to enhance the open force at

Abstract = {{Space-time codes are of great interest for wireless communication
   systems as they can be used to improve the system performance. For
   optical wireless communications using coherent detection, atmospheric
   channels can induce fading as well as phase noise to degrade wireless
   link performance. In this paper, a space-time coded communication system
   is studied for a wireless optical link using coherent detection over
   atmospheric turbulence channels. An Alamouti-type space-time coded
   system structure is proposed when both turbulence-induced fading and
   phase noise from the channel and lasers are present. The error rate
   performance is analyzed for the proposed scheme over a wide range of
   turbulence conditions. Closed-form error rate expressions are derived
   for such systems for fast performance evaluation. In numerical case
   studies, the usefulness of the proposed optical wireless space-time
   coded system is demonstrated by a comparison to a single-input
   single-output optical wireless communication system.}},

Abstract = {{Shaking table testing method is one of the main sources of experimental
   means to evaluate the dynamic response of structural systems under
   earthquake loads. The experimental technique produces nearly realistic
   prototype conditions, giving important insight into critical issues such
   as collapse mechanisms, component failures, acceleration amplifications,
   residual displacements and post-earthquake capacities. Traditional
   tuning of shaking table relies on the use of linear controllers, which
   are designed to regulate linear systems. With most of the specimens
   being tested to highly nonlinear states (to understand the structural
   response under extreme loads), traditional linear controllers can no
   longer control the shaking table effectively. This results in
   experimental errors between commanded and measured shaking table
   movements which may produce an unintended response of the tested
   structure. Ultimately, it may result in a pre-mature failure of the
   specimen. To address this issue, a Lyapunov-based nonlinear control
   algorithm is utilized to develop an enhanced shaking table control
   system, which is based on nonlinear models accounting for the nonlinear
   response of the hydraulic actuator and specimens. A one-sixth-scaled
   model has been developed and constructed in the laboratory at the
   University of British Columbia, Vancouver. Advanced nonlinear system
   identification techniques have been developed to create the numerical
   model capable of recreating the nonlinearity experienced by the
   laboratory setup. Simulation results indicate that the developed
   nonlinear control algorithm can be used to achieve excellent tracking,
   even when the tested structure behaves nonlinearly. The example also
   demonstrates the ability of the nonlinear controller to compensate for
   disturbances in the actuating force applied to the shaking table. Thus,
   the proposed nonlinear shaking table control algorithm is not only a
   viable alternative, but also a way to significantly improve the quality
   of shaking table tests.}},

Abstract = {{``Social debt{''} in software engineering informally refers to
   unforeseen project cost connected to a `` suboptimal{''} development
   community. The causes of suboptimal development communities can be many,
   ranging from global distance to organisational barriers to wrong or
   uninformed socio-technical decisions (i.e., decisions that influence
   both social and technical aspects of software development). Much like
   technical debt, social debt impacts heavily on software development
   success. We argue that, to ensure quality software engineering,
   practitioners should be provided with mechanisms to detect and manage
   the social debt connected to their development communities. This paper
   defines and elaborates on social debt, pointing out relevant research
   paths. We illustrate social debt by comparison with technical debt and
   discuss common real-life scenarios that exhibit ``sub-optimal{''}

   robot; second, Q-learning-a method of reinforcement learning, is
   integrated with PRM to determine a proper path to reach the goal. In

Abstract = {{There is a complex interplay between welding procedures and the steel
   chemistry which determines the final engineering performance of the heat
   affected zone in a large diameter girth weld. This work uses a
   combination of experimentally determined thermal histories from
   laboratory scale single and dual torch multi-pass gas metal arc welding
   (GMAW) with phenomenological models to predict microstructure and
   mechanical properties in the heat affected zone (HAZ) of an X80 steel.
   The integrated model consists of sub-models for austenite grain growth,
   dissolution of Nb based precipitates and austenite decomposition. These
   models have been calibrated with detailed experimental studies using a
   Gleeble 3500 thermomechanical simulator. The models are fully integrated
   so that the austenite grain size and the Nb solid solution level are
   used as inputs into the austenite decomposition model where these two
   factors strongly affect the final microstructure. The decomposition
   model includes ferrite and bainite models with suitable criteria for
   transition from one model to the other and a simple first order
   empirical relation to predict the final fraction of martensite/retained
   austenite (MA). The integrated model has been applied to a variety of
   thermal scenarios which are derived from experimental measurements of
   thermal histories including dual torch conditions where, for example,
   the Nb solid solution level has to be tracked through both thermal
   excursions into austenite. Using the integrated model, microstructure
   maps of the HAZ can be generated for the different welding scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The heat affected zone (HAZ) during welding experiences a very steep
   temperature gradient which results in significant microstructure
   gradients. Thus, model approaches on the length scale of the
   microstructure, i.e. the so-called mesoscale, are useful to accurately
   simulate microstructure evolution in the HAZ. In this study, a phase
   field model (PFM) is employed to simulate austenite grain growth and
   austenite decomposition in the HAZ of an X80 linepipe steel microalloyed
   with Nb and Ti. The interfacial mobilities and nucleation conditions are
   obtained by benchmarking the PPM with experimental data from austenite
   grain growth and continuous cooling transformation tests. An effective
   grain boundary mobility is introduced for austenite grain growth to
   implicitly account for dissolution of NbC. Subsequently, austenite
   decomposition into polygonal ferrite and bainite is considered. For this
   purpose the PFM is coupled with a carbon diffusion model. Ferrite nuclei
   are introduced at austenite grain boundaries and suitable interfacial
   mobilities are selected to reproduce experimental ferrite formation
   kinetics. Bainite nucleation occurs for a sufficiently high undercooling
   at available interface sites (i.e. austenite grain boundaries and/or
   austenite-ferrite interfaces). For simplicity the formation of
   carbide-free bainite is considered and a suitable anisotropy approach is
   proposed for the austenite-bainite interface mobility. The model is then
   used to predict austenite grain growth and phase transformation in the
   HAZ.}},

   significantly the austenite decomposition kinetics and the resulting
   microstructure. A systematic study has been carried out to quantify the
   influence of Nb on the austenite decomposition kinetics in X80 linepipe
   steel. Continuous cooling transformation tests were conducted with a
   Gleeble 3500. The transformation products include ferrite, granular and
   upper bainite and M/A (martensite/ retained austenite) constituents. For
   this study optical microscopy was used to investigate the formation of
   M/A constituents that critically determine the fracture toughness. A
   relation between M/A and the surrounding microstructure is observed. In
   combination with an existent model for the prediction of the
   microstructure evolution during weld thermal cycles, the area fraction,
   size and morphology of M/A can be predicted for the simulated HAZ, based
   on the prior austenite grain size, cooling rate and amount of Nb in
   solution.}},

   novel networked fuzzy belief rule-based (NF-BRB) system. The proposed
   NF-BRB system is employed to design a decision support tool for relative
   water quality assessment in the distribution network Different nodes of
   the network are grouped in several strata with the connectivity of the
   nodes shown using a spanning tree. For each stratum, a compact NF-BRB
   system is designed. The proposed system has flexible and tunable
   parameters that allow the incorporation of both subjective and numerical
   information. A learning algorithm to find the locally optimum parameters
   of the NF-BRB system is employed. The rule aggregation is performed
   based on a costeffective approach that uses belief rule utility and
   disapproval among activated rules. Then, pignistic probabilities of
   fuzzy evaluation grades are found through aggregation among local
   strata. The case study of spatiotemporal data aggregation based on
   hourly data of online monitoring locations of a water distribution

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an enhanced fuzzy evidential reasoning (EFER)
   approach for decision making for means of water quality monitoring in

   The proposed EFER approach can model epistemic uncertainties including
   ambiguity, interval-valued belief degrees and vagueness in information
   related to a complex system. Nonlinear optimization models that provide
   more information on the effect of interval-valued belief degrees in the
   final belief assessment are introduced to perform decision-making using
   an uncertain decision matrix. Due to modeling more facets of
   uncertainty, more information on the preference ranking of alternatives
   can be extracted. As a result, more distinctive preference between
   decision alternatives can be specified. The application of the proposed
   EFER approach is investigated through designing a decision support tool
   for water quality monitoring. Finally, the performance of the proposed
   framework is tested through online data that were available for a water

   subjective information on water quality parameters (WQP) introduce
   uncertainty to the water quality assessment process. Historical data
   recorded in a network are categorized into two groups including
   microbial and physicochemical parameters. Then, separate rule bases are
   developed to define microbial and physicochemical aspects of water
   quality. The distributed assessments of the water quality that result
   from two rule bases are aggregated using a fuzzy evidential reasoning
   algorithm. The proposed inference engine provides a decision support
   tool, which aids the decision makers to come up with management policies
   based on hundreds of water quality monitoring records. Statistical data
   on WQPs at fifty-two sampling locations of Quebec City main WDN were

Pages = {{50-59}},
Abstract = {{A recent study developed a set of zone-level negative binomial collision
   prediction models to investigate the relationship between various
   transportation and sociodemographic characteristics and overall roadway
   safety. The developed models used data from Metro Vancouver, British
   Columbia, Canada, and considered the effect of Poisson variations and
   heterogeneity (extra variation) on collision occurrence. This study aims
   to evaluate spatial effects on the occurrence of collisions and to check
   whether the inclusion of spatial variables can improve the goodness of
   fit and inference capability of those previously developed prediction
   models. Transit-reliant and application-based collision prediction
   models with spatial correlations were developed by using the WinBUGS
   software. The convergence of the developed models was tested by trace
   plots of the parameter estimated, the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin statistics,
   and ratios of Monte Carlo errors relative to the standard deviations of
   the estimates. The results showed that incorporation of the spatial
   correlations affected the parameter estimates, the values of dispersion
   parameters and intercepts, and also the t-statistics. The effect of the
   main exposure variable on all of the models for total, severe, and
   property-damage-only collisions was found to be smaller under spatial
   models. The smaller values of the exponents of the main exposure
   variable confirmed the assumption that spatial effects need to be
   considered in collision prediction models to mitigate any potential bias
   associated with model misspecification.}},

Abstract = {{Analyzing a switch mode circuit under periodic excitations with variable
   duty cycle provides a way to predict how power efficiency varies with
   output power. The analysis with periodic signals mimics the behaviour of
   amplifying more complex non-periodic pulse encoded signals such as
   sigma-delta modulation (SDM). Equations are derived to predict the power
   efficiency of a RF current mode class-D (CMCD) amplifier design. New
   results are presented that include the effect of switch capacitance and
   the analysis shows, that at low power, the capacitive switching losses
   can exceed inductive switching losses. The predictions of the model are
   compared with simulations of a CMCD amplifier under periodic and SDM
   switching conditions. The CMCD amplifier uses a large signal device
   model for a Cree 15 W GaN power device at a frequency of 1 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{We address the problem of dynamic CT reconstruction from parsimoniously
   sampled sinograms. In this paper we propose a novel approach to solve
   the aforesaid problem by modeling the dynamic CT sequence as a low-rank
   matrix. This dynamic CT matrix is formed by stacking each frame as a
   column of the matrix. As these images are temporally correlated, the
   dynamic CT matrix would therefore be of low-rank as its columns are not
   independent. We exploit the low-rank information to reconstruct the CT
   matrix from its parsimoniously sampled sinograms. Mathematically this is
   a low-rank matrix recovery problem, and we propose a novel algorithm to
   solve it. Our proposed method reduces the reconstruction error by 50\%
   or more when compared to previous recovery techniques.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analysis of the high resolution histopathology
   images of the prostate with a focus on the evolution of morphological
   gland features in prostatic adenocarcinoma. Here we propose a novel
   technique of labeling individual glands as malignant or benign. In the
   first step, the gland and nuclei objects of the images are automatically
   segmented. Individual gland units are segmented out by consolidating
   their lumina with the surrounding layers of epithelium and nuclei. The
   nuclei objects are segmented by using a marker controlled watershed
   algorithm. Two new features, Number of Nuclei Layer (N-NL) and Ratio of
   Epithelial layer area to Lumen area (R-EL) have been extracted from the
   segmented units. The main advantage of this approach is that it can
   detect individual malignant gland units, irrespective of neighboring
   histology and/or the spatial extent of the cancer. The proposed
   algorithm has been tested on 40 histopathology scenes taken from 10 high
   resolution whole mount images and achieved a sensitivity of 0.83 and
   specificity of 0.81 in a leave-75\%-out cross-validation.}},

Title = {{Has Transportation Demand of Shanghai, China, Passed Its Peak Growth?}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{85-92}},
Abstract = {{On the basis of four comprehensive transportation surveys in Shanghai,
   China, this study examined the latest trends in Shanghai's travel
   demand; investigated their social, economic, and spatial drivers; and
   compared the pace of travel demand growth in three periods: 1980s to
   early 1990s, early 1990s to mid-2000s, and mid-2000s to the present. The
   demand growth was relatively slow in the first period and then sped up
   in the second before it returned to a slower pace in the third period.
   As for trip purpose, Shanghai's travel is much more diversified than
   previously, with an increasing share of noncommuting trips (from 28\% in
   1995 to 46\% in 2009). Spatially, travel demand is dispersed from the
   central district to peripheral districts because of urban expansion and
   decentralization and from Puxi (west of the Huangpu River) to Pudong
   (east of the Huangpu River) as a result of significant economic
   development of the Pudong New Area. Both spatial diffusion and purpose
   diversification favor the convenience and flexibility of private motor
   vehicles. Driven by rapid motorization, vehicle travel is growing at a
   much faster pace than person travel. Overall, the annual growth rate for
   travel demand in Shanghai reached its peak in 2004 for both person trips
   and vehicle trips. In absolute numbers, person trip growth has peaked,
   but vehicle trip growth has not. In response to the growing demand,
   especially rapid motorization, the local government has made tremendous
   investments in road infrastructure and public transit, and it has
   attempted to manage demand through vehicle ownership control.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of patient deterioration and triage (prioritization of care)
   are two critical tasks in the high risk environment and
   interdisciplinary care model of patients in an intensive care unit. To
   make decisions and plan treatments, clinicians need to observe,

   various devices located at the bedsides of multiple patients. However,
   several technological and physical limitations prevent them from
   optimally performing these tasks, which negatively impact the
   capabilities of healthcare teams. The Monitoring Messenger concept was
   developed to overcome some of these challenges by integrating
   information on a mobile device and supporting team decision-making and

Abstract = {{Myelin is an essential component of nerve fibers and monitoring its
   health is important for studying diseases that attack myelin, such as
   multiple sclerosis (MS). The amount of water trapped within myelin,
   which is a surrogate for myelin content and integrity, can be measured
   in vivo using MRI relaxation techniques that acquire a series of images
   at multiple echo times to produce a T-2 decay curve at each voxel. These
   curves are then analyzed, most commonly using non-negative least squares
   (NNLS) fitting, to produce T-2 distributions from which water
   measurements are made. NNLS is unstable with respect to the noise and
   variations found in typical T-2 relaxation images, making some form of
   regularization inevitable. The current methods of NNLS regularization
   for measuring myelin water have two key limitations: 1) they use
   strictly local neighborhood information to regularize each voxel, which
   limits their effectiveness for very noisy images, and 2) the neighbors
   of each voxel contribute to its regularization equally, which can
   over-smooth fine details. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
   new regularization algorithm in which local and non-local information is
   gathered and used adaptively for each voxel. Our results demonstrate
   that the proposed method provides more globally consistent myelin water
   measurements yet preserves fine structures. Our experiment with real
   patient data also shows that the algorithm improves the ability to
   distinguish two sample groups, one of MS patients and the other of
   healthy subjects.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the feasibility of using the spatiotemporal
   parameters of gait step frequency and step length-as cues for
   classifying pedestrians according to their gender and age. The gait
   parameters are automatically extracted from the pedestrian walking speed
   profile. Computer vision techniques are used for the automatic detection
   and tracking of pedestrians in an open (uncontrolled) environment. The
   classification is undertaken by using a simple k nearest neighbor
   algorithm. For demonstration, two case studies are used: Vancouver,
   British Columbia, Canada, and Oakland, California. For gender, correct
   classification rates of 78\% and 81\% were achieved for the Vancouver
   and Oakland case studies, respectively. Gender classification for the
   Vancouver case study considered pedestrians walking alone or in groups,
   and the Oakland case study gender classification considered only
   pedestrians walking alone. Pedestrian age classification resulted in a
   correct classification rate of 86\% for the Oakland case study. Another
   classification measure, the kappa statistic, showed that the
   classification results were statistically significant beyond what is
   expected by chance. The method has the advantages of relying only on the
   pedestrian speed profile and using a simple classification algorithm.}},

Title = {{Application of Computer Vision to Diagnosis of Pedestrian Safety Issues}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2393}},
Pages = {{75-84}},
Abstract = {{The potential for using computer vision techniques to solve several
   shortcomings associated with traditional road safety and behavior
   analysis is demonstrated. Surrogate data such as traffic conflicts
   provide invaluable information that can be used to understand
   collision-contributing factors and the collision failure mechanism
   better. Recent advances in computer vision techniques have encouraged
   the use of proactive safety surrogate measures such as detection of
   conflicts and violations. The objective of this study is to demonstrate
   the automated safety diagnosis of pedestrian crossing safety issues by
   using computer vision techniques. The automated safety diagnosis is
   applied at a major signalized intersection in downtown Vancouver,
   British Columbia, Canada, at which concerns had been raised regarding
   the high conflict rate between vehicles and pedestrians as well as the
   elevated number of traffic violations (i.e., jaywalking). This study is
   unique in its attempt to extract conflict indicators and detect
   violations from video sequences in a fully automated way. This line of
   research benefits safety experts because it provides a prompt and
   objective safety evaluation for intersections. The research also
   provides a permanent database for traffic information that can be
   beneficial for a sound safety diagnosis as well as for developing safety
   countermeasures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a digital signal processor (DSP)-based zero current
   detection (ZCD) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) digital
   detection method for the boost power factor correction (PFC) converter.
   The detection technique employs a DSP with integrated high-speed
   comparators to allow simple detection of zero inductor current and DCM
   operation. By avoiding the need for auxiliary circuits, inductor
   windings, and by effectively using DSP resources, the proposed detection
   technique realizes cost and performance advantages over alternative
   detection methods. An experimental 650 W boost PFC converter operating
   in mixed-conduction mode controlled by a TMS320F28035 confirms the
   effectiveness of the proposed detection technique.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel, simple and accurate method is proposed to
   predict the RMS and average current for each component in the most
   common continuous conduction mode (CCM) AC-DC power factor correction

   effective duty cycle independent of the switching action. The proposed
   model enables simple and accurate estimation of powertrain component
   conduction losses. The paper includes the derivation of the RMS, or
   average current for the boost and interleaved boost PFC topologies. PSIM
   simulation and experimental results are used to verify the accuracy of
   model. Experimental and simulation results of a prototype interleaved
   boost converter converting universal AC input voltage to 400 V DC at up
   to 3.4 kW output are given to verify the proposed model. The

Abstract = {{A high-efficiency CMOS rectifier with low start-up voltage for
   ultra-high-frequency (UHF) radio-frequency identification (RFID)
   applications is presented. To enhance the power conversion efficiency
   (PCE) of the conventional rectifier when the input voltage (power) is
   low, appropriate gate-drive voltages for each stage of the rectifier are
   generated using a chain of auxiliary floating rectifier cells. Floating
   rectifier cells are optimized to generate shifted versions of the
   intermediate voltage of each stage to boost the drive voltage of NMOS
   and PMOS switching transistors and accordingly improve the PCE. The
   proposed rectifier architecture is designed in a standard 0.13 mu m CMOS
   technology. For a 950 MHz RF input and 50 k Omega output load,
   simulation results show that the rectifier achieves a PCE of 54\% for a
   small input signal with an amplitude of 200 mV (-19 dBm) which is well
   below the nominal standard threshold voltage of MOS transistors in the

Abstract = {{A technique for improving the linearity of CMOS class-AB power
   amplifiers (PAs) is introduced. The technique is based on compensating
   for the voltage-dependent nonlinear gate-source capacitance of the input
   transistor of the PA. This compensation is achieved through using an
   NMOS capacitor, i.e., an NMOS transistor with its source and drain
   shorted, as a predistortion stage. To enhance cancellation of the
   nonlinearity, body biasing is incorporated as an additional control
   scheme into the predistortion stage. As a proof-of-concept, a 2.4-GHz
   class-AB power amplifier with the proposed predistortion stage has been
   designed and laid out in a 0.13-mu m CMOS technology. Post-layout
   simulation results show that the third-order input-referred intercept
   point (IIP3) of the designed PA improves by more than 3-dB when the bulk
   voltage of the predistortion device is biased appropriately. The PA
   achieves unsaturated output power of +20 dBm while drawing 125 mA from a
   1.2 V supply voltage.}},

Abstract = {{Graph processing has gained renewed attention. The increasing large
   scale and wealth of connected data, such as those accrued by social
   network applications, demand the design of new techniques and platforms
   to efficiently derive actionable information from large scale graphs.
   Hybrid systems that host processing units optimized for both fast
   sequential processing and bulk processing (e. g., GPU-accelerated
   systems) have the potential to cope with the heterogeneous structure of
   real graphs and enable high performance graph processing.
   Reaching this point, however, poses multiple challenges. The
   heterogeneity of the processing elements (e. g., GPUs implement a
   different parallel processing model than CPUs and have much less memory)
   and the inherent irregularity of graph workloads require careful graph
   partitioning and load assignment. In particular, the workload generated
   by a partitioning scheme should match the strength of the processing
   element the partition is allocated to. This work explores the
   feasibility and quantifies the performance gains of such low-cost
   partitioning schemes.
   We propose to partition the workload between the two types of processing
   elements based on vertex connectivity. We show that such partitioning
   schemes offer a simple, yet efficient way to boost the overall
   performance of the hybrid system. Our evaluation illustrates that
   processing a 4-billion edges graph on a system with one CPU socket and
   one GPU, while offloading as little as 25\% of the edges to the GPU,
   achieves 2x performance improvement over state-of-the-art
   implementations running on a dual-socket symmetric system. Moreover, for
   the same graph, a hybrid system with dual-socket and dual-GPU is capable
   of 1.13 Billion breadth-first search traversed edge per second, a
   performance rate that is competitive with the latest entries in the
   Graph500 list, yet at a much lower price point.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main challenges in the conduct of detailed analysis of
   cyclist behavior is the lack of reliable data. Collection of data
   through manual methods is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process.
   Two of the important areas of cyclist data collection are volume counts
   and average speed measurements. A volume count provides the basis for
   necessary exposure measures and conveys essential information about
   traffic patterns. Cyclist speed data are used for traffic control and
   safety studies. The application of computer vision (CV) techniques
   enables the collection of precise spatial and temporal measurements of
   road users in a resource-efficient way. This paper presents the use of a
   set of CV techniques for the automated collection of cyclist data.
   Cyclist tracks obtained from video analysis were used to perform screen
   line counts as well as cyclist speed measurements. The applications were
   demonstrated with the use of a real-world data set from a roundabout in
   Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Further analysis was conducted on
   the mean speed of cyclists with regard to several factors (e.g., travel
   path, helmet use, group size). The motivation for this research was to
   understand better cyclist behavior and how it varied under different
   conditions. Several conclusions could be drawn from the analysis of
   cyclist speed behavior. Group size, travel path, lane position, and
   helmet use were all found to affect the cyclist mean speed. Single
   cyclists had a slightly, but significantly, higher mean cycling speed
   than did group cyclists. The mean cycling speed was highest for those
   cyclists who used the road rather than the sidewalk. The mean cycling
   speed decreased for cyclists without helmets.}},

   In this paper, an effective piecewise linear (PWL) approximation
   technique is introduced which shows promising performance in linearizing
   the nonlinear functions. This method uses a series of linear functions,
   called max-affine functions, to linearize a multivariate function over a
   bounded domain. The important advantage of this method is its ability to
   decide on the size of the subspaces, which other methods are not capable
   of. It is also shown that using the PWL approximation, significant
   efficiency is achievable in computation burden of most power system
   optimizations, such as unit commitment.}},

Abstract = {{Line-commutated converters (LCC) can operate in both rectifier and
   inverter modes and are widely used in various high-power applications
   including the HVDC systems. So far, many average-value modeling (AVM)
   techniques have been introduced to model the rectifier operation of the
   LCCs. However, to extend these models for the inverter mode may be
   challenging. In this paper, the voltage-source and current-source
   average-value modeling (VS-AVM and CS-AVM) formulations are introduced
   based on the well-posedness of the underlying state equations. It is
   shown that the proposed CS-AVM will have advantages for modeling the
   thyristor controlled LCC operating as an inverter, whereas a more
   conventional VS-AVM may not result in a convergent model.}},

Abstract = {{Many system-level studies involve the simulation of power systems with
   growing penetration of power electronic devices and loads at
   distribution level. This gives rise to the need for fast models of
   static switching converters and efficient simulation tools. The
   so-called dynamic average-value models (AVMs), which use averaging
   techniques by neglecting switching, are widely used and appear to be
   very promising for the system-level transient studies of
   power-electronic loads. However, considering converter losses and
   predicting the energy efficiency remains challenging. This paper
   presents a methodology to include converter losses in AVMs of medium
   power active front-end (AFE) rectifier loads. The proposed new method is
   applied to a two-level voltage source converter (VSC) operating under
   direct power control (DPC). The conducted simulation results demonstrate
   the new methodology and confirm its accuracy in predicting conduction
   and switching losses and efficiency, while providing significant
   computational savings compared to the detailed switching model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the implementation of a constant-parameter
   voltage-behind-reactance (CP-VBR) synchronous machines model that can be
   directly interfaced in most state-variable-based transient simulation

   branches, and the rotor equations are expressed in state-space form to
   facilitate their implementation. The proposed model accommodates salient
   or round rotor machines, and its implementation is shown in three
   popular MATLAB/Simulink toolboxes: SimPowerSystems, ASMG, and PLECS. The
   presented studies compare the efficiency and accuracy of the CP-VBR
   models with the classical qd0 model. It is demonstrated that the CP-VBR
   models are faster, have higher accuracy, and are easy to implement.
   Additionally, the limitations of each toolbox for the simulation of
   different scenarios are discussed. It is also noted that the built-in
   toolbox models do not include zero-sequence, which may limit their
   application and make them invalid for some studies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the modeling and transient simulation studies of

   modeled based on the real load characteristics of a medium-sized office
   building, and a UPS with multiple static transfer switches is included
   to protect the system while uninterruptedly feeding critical loads. It
   is envisioned that in future smart buildings the critical loads will be
   selected and protected in real time using the flexibility inherent to
   the UPS and the static transfer switches. The simulation of an outage is
   carried out and the subsequent transient phenomena are analyzed. The
   simulation results show that the given BPN can remain stable during the
   outage and the effects of the distribution automation on the grid is
   outlined. This paper will contribute to the studies of more complex BPN
   distribution automation schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The Synchronous Reference Frame (SRF) has been known as one of the most
   common methods of voltage sag compensation. Despite suitable performance
   in 3-phase voltage sags mitigation, the application of the SRF does not
   work that well in unbalanced situations. This paper addresses this
   problem, through the use of a novel control strategy based on the
   pre-fault compensation theory. In this strategy, not only the control
   system is capable of restoring the amplitude of the voltage to its
   pre-fault value, but it also can remove phase angle jumps. Furthermore,
   the compensator's response has been remarkably improved with the
   application of a Least Squares (LS) algorithm in the estimation part of
   the control module. The response and accuracy of the proposed LS
   estimation algorithm is compared with other conventional methods such as
   SRF, Adaptive Linear Combiner (ADALINE), and Fast Fourier Transform
   (FFT). Finally, the proposed and SRF control algorithms are simulated in
   PSCAD/EMTDC,and their performance is assessed in voltage sag/swell
   mitigation of a distribution system during asymmetrical faults.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling of induction machines (IMs) for power systems transient studies
   has been receiving significant attention in the literature, where a
   continuous effort is made to improve the accuracy and efficiency of
   common general-purpose models. Among recently proposed methods, a
   so-called voltage-be hindreactance (VBR) formulation has been shown to
   improve the interfacing of machine models with the external network.
   Depending on the rotor type and the required model fidelity, the rotor
   may be represented using one or two rotor equivalent windings. In this
   paper, we propose a new algebraically exact generalized 1M model using
   the VBR formulation. The proposed full-order model incorporates two
   rotor windings and main flux saturation, whereas a simpler model with
   only one rotor winding can also be easily obtained. The validity of the
   new model is first verified by comparing it to a traditional (reference)
   model. The improved accuracy and computational efficiency of the
   proposed VBR model is then demonstrated when the 1M is interfaced to an
   external inductive network.}},

   there is no coherency between load and generation buses. Using the
   proposed methodology, it is possible to keep any desired subsystem while
   achieving maximum reduction of the remaining system. The IEEE 50-gen
   95-bus test system is used to validate and demonstrate the proposed
   method.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety performance of a
   sample of intersections that had been improved with the implementation
   of certain safety countermeasures targeting right-turn collisions in the
   city of Edmonton, Canada. A full Bayes approach was used to determine
   the effectiveness of the improvements by employing a before-and-after
   design with matched (yoked) comparison groups. Three linear intervention
   models were considered: a multivariate model that modeled treatment
   effects as a gradual change, a similar model with the addition of a jump
   treatment effect, and a univariate model that specifically analyzed
   right-turn collisions. The results indicated that the safety improvement
   program was effective; up to 40\% of right-turn collisions were reduced.
   Despite the small sample size, these reductions were statistically
   significant. The results show the usefulness of the full Bayes technique
   in performing before-and-after evaluations of traffic treatment programs
   and in eliminating the need for a reference population and also in
   allowing for additional types of analysis, including multivariate
   analysis (modeling collisions of different types and severities at the
   same time), temporal effects (for both treatment and long-term trends),
   and greater freedom in the selection of error structure.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless electroencephalogram (EEG) systems have become an increasingly
   important tool for the diagnosis and management of epilepsy. One major
   consideration in using such a wireless EEG-based system is the stringent
   battery energy constraint at the sensor side. Different solutions to
   reduce the power consumption are therefore highly desired.
   Conventionally, the entire EEG signals acquired by the sensor nodes are
   continuously streamed to an external data server (where seizure
   detection is carried out). Such approach incurs a high power
   consumption, which substantially limits the battery life of the sensor
   node. In this study, we examine the use of data reduction techniques,
   including compressive sensing-based EEG compression and various
   low-complexity feature extraction techniques, for reducing the amount of
   data that has to be transmitted and thereby reducing the required power
   consumption at the sensor side. The performance of such techniques is
   evaluated in terms of power consumption and seizure detection efficacy.
   Results show that by extracting and transmitting only the nonlinear
   autocorrelation features of the EEG signals to the server, the battery
   life of the system is increased by 14 times relative to the conventional
   approach of transmitting the entire EEG signals, while the same seizure
   detection performance is maintained (94.1\% sensitivity and 99.9\%
   specificity).}},

Abstract = {{We propose transmit antenna selection with receive maximal-ratio
   combining (TAS/MRC) as an effective approach to reduce interference in
   cognitive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay networks. To
   demonstrate this, we derive new closed-form expressions for the exact
   and asymptotic outage probability of TAS/MRC with multiple antennas at
   the primary and secondary users. We consider underlay spectrum sharing
   where the secondary users (SUs) transmit in the presence of multiple
   primary users (PUs). We consider independent Nakagamim fading in both
   the primary and secondary networks. Several important design insights
   are revealed. We find that TAS/MRC achieves a full diversity when the
   transmit power at the SUs is proportional to the peak interference power
   at the PUs. Furthermore, we highlight that this diversity gain is
   completely independent of the number of antennas at the PUs.}},

Abstract = {{When deploying wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in practical
   applications, access control systems can limit access to sensitive
   information only to trusted entities and provide a capability to resist
   against various attacks from malicious nodes. However, due to the
   characteristics of highly distributed and resource-constrained, applying
   conventional access control models to WSNs is significantly challenging.
   In this paper, a distributed and fine-grained access control model based
   on the trust and risk degree is proposed (TC-BAC). We first introduce a
   trust evaluation mechanism to meet the security requirements of access
   control systems. Then, a risk function is proposed to assess the
   behavior of nodes and evaluate the risk factor of the access. The
   simulation results show that TC-BAC can achieve both intended security
   and high efficiency of the network.}},

Abstract = {{An energy efficient collaborative spectrum sensing (EE-CSS) protocol,
   based on trust management, is proposed. The protocol reduces the total

   traditional collaborative spectrum sensing (T-CSS) protocol in which
   each SU transmits a sensing report to the SUBS. In addition, the minimum
   total number of sensing reports required to satisfy a target global
   false alarm and miss detection probabilities in T-CSS is shown to be
   higher than that in EE-CSS. Expressions for the average steady-state
   trust values of SUs and the average total number of sensing reports
   transmitted by the SUs to the SUBS in EE-CSS are derived. The global
   false alarm (FA) and miss detection (MD) probabilities are analyzed for
   a commonly used decision fusion technique.}},

Abstract = {{Amplify-and-forward (AF) and demodulate-and-forward (DMF) can be
   effectively used in memoryless two-way relay channels (TWRCs) to enhance
   the spectral efficiency. In this paper, we study AF and DMF, in terms of
   their achievable data exchange rate, for a memoryless TWRC. Our results
   show that unlike memoryless one-way relaying, increasing users' SNR
   benefits AF more than DMF. Another interesting observation is that while
   with DMF a higher data rate is provided for the user whose channel
   condition is better, with AF the situation is the reverse. That is, the
   user with worse channel condition can receive at a higher data rate.
   Further, we find that for a TWRC with asymmetric users' channels, AF can
   take advantage of power back-off at the users, without degrading the
   data rate, to improve the energy efficiency while power back-off is not
   beneficial for DMF.}},

Abstract = {{A CMOS rectifier with a wide input signal range for radio-frequency
   identification (RFID) applications is presented. Using quasi-floating
   gate technique, a gate-biasing scheme is proposed to provide a
   relatively flat power conversion efficiency (PCE) curve for a wide input
   voltage (power) range. The proposed technique also enables an efficient
   operation for input voltage levels well below the standard threshold
   voltage of the MOS switching transistors. Appropriate bias voltages for
   different stages of the rectifier are generated through a chain of
   low-power bandgap reference generators which impose minimal power and
   area overhead. The proposed rectifier architecture is designed and laid
   out in a standard 0.13-mu m CMOS technology. For a 2.4 GHz RF input
   frequency and 30 k Omega output load, post-layout simulation results of
   the circuit show that a maximum PCE of 66.7\% is achieved for an input
   signal with an amplitude (power) of 0.45 V (-8 dBm). While a high PCE of
   60\% is achieved for input voltage (power) levels as low as 0.25 V (-15
   dBm), PCE maintains above 60\% for a wide input voltage (power) range

   randomized mixture of monotone increasing policies. Such monotone
   policies have an inherent sparsity structure. We present a two-stage
   convex optimization algorithm for computing the optimal policy that
   exploits the sparsity. It combines an alternating direction method of
   multipliers (ADMM) to solve a linear programming problem with respect to
   the joint action state probabilities, together with a sub-gradient step
   that promotes the monotone sparsity pattern in the conditional
   probabilities of the action given the state. In the second step,
   sum-of-norms regularization is used to stress the monotone structure of
   the optimal policy.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose the use of compressed sensing (CS) that is
   preceded by an energy-efficient, cross-product based independent
   component analysis (ICA) preprocessing method to efficiently compress
   electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in the context of a wireless body
   sensor network (WBSN). In WBSNs, the battery life puts a strict energy
   constraint at each sensor node. By providing a simple, nonadaptive
   compression scheme at the sensor nodes, CS offers an efficient solution
   to compress EEG signals in WBSNs. Through simulations, we demonstrate
   that our method requires less energy than other state-of-the-art methods
   using ICA, with a reduction in computations that can reach up to 94\%.
   We also demonstrate that for a fixed compression ratio, the achievable
   reconstruction error is similar to the state-of-the-art method using
   ICA, and is much lower than when CS is used alone.}},

Abstract = {{This work addresses the problem of dynamic MRI reconstruction from
   partially sampled K-space. When the frames of the dynamic MRI sequences
   are stacked as columns of a matrix, the resultant matrix is both sparse
   (in a transform domain) and rank-deficient. The dynamic MRI sequence is
   reconstructed by solving an optimization problem that minimizes a sum of
   sparsity and rank-deficiency penalties subject to data constraints
   (K-space data acquisition model). In this work, we propose a non-convex
   optimization problem for dynamic MRI reconstruction where the sparsity
   penalty is an l(p),-norm and the rank-deficiency penalty is the
   Schatten-q norm (0<p,q <= 1). There is no algorithm to solve this
   combined l(p)-norm and Schatten-q norm minimization problem; hence we
   derive a new algorithm based on the Majorization Minimization method.
   Our proposed method shows considerable improvement in reconstruction
   results over state-of-the-art techniques in dynamic MRI reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a method for the analysis of brain structural data to
   simultaneously identify differences in position, orientation and size
   (i.e. pose), and in shape of multiple brain regions between young people
   with, and without, a depressive disorder. Different structures in both
   hemispheres of the brain of depressed and control participants were
   segmented and corresponding points on the surface of each structure were
   extracted. Coordinates of these surface points were used to obtain shape
   variations, and parameters of similarity transformations between brain
   structures across subjects were used to generate pose variations. Since
   these surface points and similarity transformations form Lie groups, a
   logarithmic mapping of members of the Lie groups was performed to
   transform them to a linear tangent space. Then, Independent Component
   Analysis (ICA) was used to obtain the independent sources of pose and
   shape variations on Lie group members, and their corresponding
   modulation profiles. A method for ordering the independent sources is
   proposed. The top ordered sources were used to detect pose and shape
   differences between the two groups, and confirm that even in their first
   depressive episode, the brains of depressed adolescents differ
   structurally from the brains of their nondepressed age- and sex-matched

Abstract = {{We study the MMV (Multiple Measurement Vectors) compressive sensing
   setting with a specific sparse structured support. The locations of the
   non-zero rows in the sparse matrix are not known. All that is known is
   that the locations of the non-zero rows have probabilities that vary
   from one group of rows to another. We propose two novel greedy
   algorithms for the exact recovery of the sparse matrix in this
   structured MMV compressive sensing problem. The first algorithm models
   the matrix sparse structure using a shallow non-linear neural network.
   The input of this network is the residual matrix after the prediction
   and the output is the sparse matrix to be recovered. The second
   algorithm improves the shallow neural network prediction by using the
   stacking operation to form a deep stacking network. Experimental
   evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of both new algorithms
   over existing MMV methods. Among all, the algorithm using the deep
   stacking network for modelling the structure in MMV compressive sensing
   performs the best.}},

Abstract = {{Metric learning for KNN has attracted increasing attentions in the field
   of machine learning (e.g., based on the parametric form of Mahalanobis
   distance). A good distance metric is also the foundation for other
   machine learning models, for example, a Gaussian RBF kernel is
   constructed upon distance metric defined in the feature vector space.
   However, besides the KNN classifier, there is little research work on
   learning a good distance metric for distance-basedmodels. In this paper,
   we propose a novel algorithm to learn a Mahalanobis-distance type metric
   for Gaussian RBF kernels. We conduct experiments on 5 data sets from the
   UCI Machine Learning Repository database and two face recognition data
   sets. The classification results show that the proposed algorithm can
   outperform other state-of-arts on most of the data sets and achieve
   comparable results on the rest of data sets.}},

   phase-type distributed to allow for a general set of change time

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the competitive interactions between electric
   vehicle charging stations (EVeSs) with renewable electricity generation
   facilities (REGFs). As electric vehicles (EVs) become more popular,
   there will be a competition between neighboring EVeSs to attract more
   EVs. Therefore, an EVeS is likely to set its electricity price by taking
   into account the competition with neighboring EVeSs, such that its
   revenue is maximized. We model the competitive interactions between
   EVeSs by using game theory. In this paper, we show that the game played
   by EVeSs is a supermodular game and there exists a unique pure Nash
   equilibrium for best response algorithms with arbitrary initial policy.
   Simulation results confirm the convergence of the game between EVeSs.
   The results also verify that it is beneficial for both EVs and EVeSs to
   have REGFs and all EVeSs will have REGFs in the long run.}},

Abstract = {{Power line communications (PLC) is one of the communication methods
   currently deployed and developed further to support smart grid
   applications. While the fact the PLC signals travel through power lines
   makes reliable communication more challenging than for other wired
   media, it also provides one distinct advantage: PLC signals can be used
   to learn about the grid status. In this paper, we exploit this ``through
   the grid{''} property of PLC for the purpose of inferring the topology
   of the power grid to which a PLC network is deployed. In particular, we
   present a topology estimation algorithm that only requires PLC signaling
   between the end points of a grid, such as between meters and data
   concentrator in an advanced meter management system. Our methodology is
   alike network tomography used to infer internal properties of a
   communication network based on end-to-end measurements, and we refer to
   it as tomography-based topology inference.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a novel spoofing prevention system (SPS) for
   ZigBee based home area networks (HANs) within smart grids. The proposed
   SPS uses the spatial correlation of received signal strength (RSS) in
   order to detect attacks and filter malicious frames. The SPS consists of
   a spoofing detection module which is installed on the security center in
   the HA !, as well as spoofing prevention agents installed on network
   nodes. Once an attack is detected, the agents differentiate and filter
   malicious frames by analyzing the RSS values of received frames. Two
   methods are introduced and investigated for attack prevention, static
   threshold and dynamic threshold. The former has very low computational
   requirements, yet due to high false positive rate introduces some
   network overhead during the attack. The latter needs more computations;
   however, it has a higher performance and a very low network overhead.
   The soundness of the proposed method is proved through both theoretical
   analysis, as well as experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, there is an increasing deployment of photovoltaic (PV)
   units and energy storage systems (ESSs) in households. When the energy
   generated by PV units is greater than the aggregate load of households
   and the capacity of ESS, there will be a reverse energy flow from
   households to the substation. When the reverse energy flow exceeds a
   certain threshold, it will cause a voltage rise problem, which is a
   challenge for PV units to be effectively integrated with the
   distribution network. In this paper, we propose an energy consumption
   scheduling algorithm, which shifts the deferrable load (e. g., washing
   machines, dryers) from peak hours (e. g., 7 pm -10 pm) to high solar
   radiation hours (e. g., 10 am - 2 pm) in order to jointly shave the peak
   load and reduce the reverse energy flow. We formulate the energy
   consumption scheduling problem as a stochastic optimization problem to
   capture the uncertainty of the amount of PV output power. The objective
   of our algorithm is to minimize the electricity bill for the household
   users which have PV units and ESS installed. We use inclining block rate
   (IBR) pricing and time of use (TOU) pricing to encourage users to shift
   their load. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can avoid
   the voltage rise problem and reduce the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) in
   the aggregate load.}},

Abstract = {{Bleached simao pine kraft pulp was treated with Aspergillus niger crude
   cellulase produced by submerged fermentation using the pulp as the
   carbon source. The effects of the cellulase on the pulp beatability and
   mechanical properties were studied. Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FT-IR) was performed to study the effect of cellulase
   treatment on the cellulose crystallinity index. The fiber morphology
   difference before and after treatment was also revealed by atomic force
   microscope observation. Compared to the control pulp, the beating time
   of the cellulase-treated pulp with the dosage of 7 u/g could be reduced
   from 360 s to 260 s under the same beating degree of 48 degrees SR,
   which indicates a savings of about 28\% beating energy consumption. The
   cellulase treatment had negative impacts on the pulp's mechanical
   properties. The cellulase preferentially adsorbed on the fine surface.
   The cellulose amorphous region was easier to treat with cellulase than
   the crystalline region. Atomic force microscope images demonstrated that
   the primary wall of fibers was peeled off and the S-1 layer of fibers
   came to the surface after the cellulase treatment.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented of measuring a bridge's characteristic allowance
   for dynamic interaction in the form of Assessment Dynamic Ratio. Using a
   Bridge Weigh-in-Motion system, measurements were taken at a bridge in
   Slovenia over 58 days. From the total observed traffic population,
   5-axle trucks were extracted and studied. The Bridge Weigh-in-Motion
   system inferred the static weights of the trucks, giving each measured
   event's dynamic increment of load. Theoretical simulations were carried
   out using a 3-dimensional vehicle model coupled with a bridge plate
   model, simulating a traffic population similar to the population
   measured at the site. These theoretical simulations varied those
   properties of the 5-axle fleet that influence the dynamic response;
   simulating multiple sets of total (dynamic + static) responses for a
   single measured static strain response. Extrapolating the results of
   these theoretical simulations to a 50-year Assessment Dynamic Ratio
   gives similar results to those obtained by extrapolating the data
   measured using the Bridge Weigh-in-Motion system. A study of the effect
   of Bridge Weigh-in-Motion system errors on the predictions of Assessment
   Dynamic Ratio is conducted, identifying a trend in the Bridge
   Weigh-in-Motion calculations of maximum static response. The result of
   this bias is in turn quantified in the context of predicting
   characteristic maximum total load effect.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon photonics is going trough a terrific expansion driven by several
   applications, from chip wiring to integrated sensors and
   telecommunications. Some applications, e. g. intra and inter chip
   connections and sensing, require long parallel waveguides for wiring or
   for connecting grating couplers (GCs) to devices situated in sensing
   micro-channels. In well packed photonics chips there are often long
   wiring waveguides parallel for several mm, so loss can be caused by
   light coupled back and forth between them (cross-talk), by scattering,
   wall roughness, mode mismatch, etc. This work aims to investigate
   cross-talk for long parallel waveguides, and to propose methods to
   reduce cross-talk loss when high integration density is required.
   We have designed and fabricated about 200 testing structures exploiting
   e-beam on silicon on insulator (SOI) chip, in order to test several
   parameters and to find out dominant loss mechanisms. All devices have
   been tested and measured using an automatic optical bench, in the
   wavelength range between 1500-1600 nm.
   Achieved results are promising, since they allow for comparing
   cross-talk for short as well as long interaction lengths (up to 5 mm),
   different waveguide width pairs, several separation distances, and for
   TE and TM polarization. For smaller gaps, having not symmetric pair of
   waveguides is very beneficial, since it results in a lower power
   coupling, e. g. about 20/14 dB of crosstalk reduction for TE/TM
   waveguides after 5 mm of propagation and gap of 0.5 mu m. This can be
   very useful for the design of integrated photonics chips requiring
   high-density packaging of devices and waveguides.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the investigation and implementation of a combined
   synthetic aperture (SA) and compounded plane wave (CPW) ultrasound
   imaging technique. Individually, these methods offer unique benefits
   over the conventional transmit beamforming used in ultrasonography
   (higher resolution and increased signal-to-noise ratio, respectively),
   and both have the potential for a higher physical frame rate limit. The
   technique described combines the individual benefits while maintaining a
   higher frame rate, by adaptively compounding the resulting images from
   SA and CPW sequences at half the standard number of transmits. Tests on
   a phantom with both point scatterers and occlusions showed overall
   improvements of 14.5\% in lateral resolution and 7.5\% in axial
   resolution over CPW, and a 14.5 dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) for occlusions over SA. Both resolution and SNR were an
   improvement over that for conventional transmit beamforming with two
   focus depths, and offer double the physical frame rate limit.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OIL GAS AND COAL TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{705-719}},
Abstract = {{Geostatistical modelling of coal quality parameters has not been widely
   adopted in Indonesia. Geostatistical interpolation of non-assay data
   allows the mine planner to estimate quality parameters regarding mining.
   The foresight can then be used for more timely and accurate seam
   blending protocols. This paper discusses the modelling and the spatial
   variability of three coal parameters, namely calorific value, ash
   content, and sulphur content, of a coal seam in Malinau, East
   Kalimantan, Indonesia. It is concluded that the use of the kriging
   procedure is strongly influenced by the amount of drill-hole data and
   their areal distribution. The results are more realistic when more
   drill-hole data are available and the distribution is even. It is thus
   worthwhile to consider the inclusion of geostatistical methods into mine
   planning as they can identify the errors associated with large reserve
   tonnage and quality estimates when used appropriately. The use of these
   methods could be a good opportunity to enhance mine planning in
   Indonesia.}},

Title = {{Changes in thresholds for intracortical excitability in chronic stroke:
   More than just altered intracortical inhibition}},
Journal = {{RESTORATIVE NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{693-705}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of the present study was to assess changes in
   thresholds for the onset of short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and
   intracortical facilitation (ICF) in individuals with chronic stroke
   compared to age-matched healthy adults and evaluate the relationship
   between these thresholds and motor function in the chronic stroke group.
   Methods: Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to
   derive thresholds for the onset of SICI and ICF in 12 neurologically
   healthy and 12 individuals with chronic stroke. Motor evoked potentials
   were elicited by a test stimulus of fixed intensity preceded by a
   conditioning stimulus ranging from 0\%-125\% of active motor threshold
   to generate recruitment curves. Regression functions were fit to these
   recruitment curves to identify thresholds for the onset of SICI and ICF.
   Mixed measures analysis of variance was used to compare thresholds for
   each hemisphere within and between groups.
   Results: Results showed a significant three-way interaction between
   Group (stroke, healthy), Hemisphere (ipsilesional, contralesional) and
   Stimulus interval (2 ms, 12 ms). Significant differences in the
   thresholds for the onset of both SICI and ICF were present in
   individuals with chronic stroke, with no between hemisphere differences
   for the control group. When compared to age-matched controls,
   comparisons revealed significant reductions in ipsilesional, but not
   contralesional thresholds for the onset of ICF, and significant
   reductions in contralesional, but not ipsilesional, thresholds for the
   onset of SICI in individuals with chronic stroke. In addition, as
   thresholds for ICF and SICI in stroke patients approached the level of
   healthy adults, higher function on the Wolf Motor Function Test was
   observed.
   Conclusions: Reduced thresholds for the onset of SICI and ICF observed
   in the present study indicate that both inhibitory and facilitatory
   systems mediate changes in cortical excitability in chronic stroke
   patients. The association between higher onset thresholds and motor
   function in the stroke group also suggests that these thresholds have
   potential utility for tracking functional motor improvements in patients
   with chronic stroke. This study provides new insights to further
   characterize changes in intracortical neurotransmission that play an
   important role in modulating neuroplasticity and the potential
   relationship between inhibitory and facilitatory networks and motor
   function post-stroke.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design, implementation and experimental
   evaluation of a semi-humanoid robotic system for autonomous multi-floor
   navigation. This robot, a Personal Robot 2 named Charlie, is capable of
   operating an elevator to travel between rooms located on separate
   floors. Our goal is to create a robotic assistant capable of locating
   points of interest, manipulating objects, and navigating between rooms
   in a multi-storied environment equipped with an elevator. Taking the
   elevator requires the robot to (1) map and localize within its operating
   environment, (2) navigate to an elevator door, (3) press the up or down
   elevator call button, (4) enter the elevator, (5) press the control
   button associated with the target floor, and (6) exit the elevator at
   the correct floor. To that end, this work integrates the advanced
   sensorimotor capabilities of the robot - laser range finders, stereo and
   monocular vision systems, and robotic arms - into a complete,
   task-driven autonomous system. While the design and implementation of
   individual sensorimotor processing components is a challenge in and of
   itself, complete integration in intelligent systems design often
   presents an even greater challenge. This paper presents our approach
   towards designing the individual components, with focus on machine
   vision, manipulation, and systems integration. We present and discuss
   quantitative results of our live robotic system, discuss difficulties
   faced and expose potential pitfalls.}},

Abstract = {{A new similarity measure called matching residual likelihood (MRL) is
   presented for the task of visual tracking. MRL estimates the likelihood
   of the matching residual between the object representation model and the
   new candidate image based on previous matching errors. A posterior
   probability called a posterior matching residual probability is modeled
   based on the matching residual likelihood, the object motion model
   between sequential states, and the prior probability to estimate the
   density distribution of the object location. At every frame, an on-line
   algorithm is used to learn a low-dimensional PCA model from the object
   image. Then the object is located by maximizing the posterior matching
   residual probability distribution of the object state based on a robust
   factored sampling algorithm. The proposed method cab readily update the
   similarity measure to handle significant appearance changes while it is
   still robust to outliers and occlusion. In our experiments, the proposed
   tracker is applied on several challenging image sequences and the result
   is compared with other state-of-the-art methods and the ground truth
   data. The comparison results show the robustness and accuracy of our
   tracker in existence of large object motion and appearance variation,
   occlusion, outliers, and illumination changes.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated optical properties of tantalum pentoxide films
   obtained by anodization of thin tantalum layers that were deposited on
   BK7 glass in an e-beam system. Ellipsometric studies were conducted in
   the wavelength range 246nm to 1679nm. The ellipsometric complex
   reflection coefficient versus lambda was optimized using the same
   routine for all samples and provided values of n, k, and alpha. Some
   extreme n (up to 1000) and large n (up to 23) and alpha values were
   obtained for some samples in the wavelength range 455nm to 531nm. These
   extreme values probably result from small polycrystalline clusters
   dispersed in amorphous tantalum pentoxide. Such clusters usually are not
   charge neutral; therefore, they can interact with electric fields, such
   as incident light. As for the large n values these are probably
   resulting from possible presence of some impurity molecules.}},
