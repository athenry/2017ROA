Abstract = {{In this paper we examine the development of IoT applications from the
   perspective of the Fog Computing paradigm, where computing
   infrastructure at the network edge in devices and gateways is leverage
   for efficiency and timeliness. Due to the intrinsic nature of the IoT:
   heterogeneous devices/resources, a tightly coupled perception-action
   cycle and widely distributed devices and processing, application
   development in the Fog can be challenging. To address these challenges,
   we propose a Distributed Dataflow (DDF) programming model for the IoT
   that utilises computing infrastructures across the Fog and the Cloud. We
   evaluate our proposal by implementing a DDF framework based on Node-RED
   (Distributed Node-RED or D-NR), a visual programming tool that uses a
   flow-based model for building IoT applications. Via demonstrations, we
   show that our approach eases the development process and can be used to
   build a variety of IoT applications that work efficiently in the Fog.}},

Abstract = {{Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a remote sensing
   technology used for estimating displacement of the earth's surface.
   Phase unwrapping is the most important step in InSAR processing and
   relies on successful selection of points that appear stable across a set
   of satellite images taken over time. This paper presents a new algorithm
   for selecting these points, a problem known as persistent scatterer
   selection. The algorithm computes the temporal coherence on the wrapped
   phase derivative by subtracting phases of a pixel and one of its nearby
   neighbours. It does not require model assumptions, yet preserves
   accuracy. Motivated by the abundance of parallelism the algorithm
   exposes, we have implemented it for GPUs. Evaluation using real-world
   data shows that the GPU implementation not only offers widely superior
   performance but also scales linearly with GPU count and workload size.
   We compare the GPU implementation against a parallel CPU implementation:
   A consumer grade GPU offers an 18x speedup over a 16-core Ivy Bridge
   Xeon System, while four GPUs offer 65x speedup. Roofline analysis shows
   that, on a single GPU, our implementation achieves 83\% of the peak
   FLOP-rate of the dual-CPU system. Additionally, the GPU-based solution
   consumes 29x less energy than the CPU-only solution.}},

Abstract = {{Resonant converters have gained popularity for a variety of applications
   due to their ability to provide soft switching conditions and high power
   density. Controlling these converters is complex because of their
   non-linear behavior and high frequency resonant tank. Controllers are
   often designed by using small-signal models, which are limited to
   operating around a quiescent point. However, the small-signal model
   cannot predict the large-signal behavior during start up and load
   transients, resulting in undesirable transient behavior. This paper
   presents an average large-signal model of a Series Resonant Converter
   (SCR) to provide predictable large transient response. This novel model
   can be used to control the converter during transient mode using
   trajectory or geometrical control strategies, leading to outstanding and
   predictable responses. The theoretical model and transient behavior are
   validated with simulation and experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Voltage mode and dual-loop current-mode linear schemes are widely used
   for controlling boost converters due to their simple implementation and
   fixed frequency PWM operation. Nevertheless, the dynamic response of the
   voltage loop is usually limited by the characteristic non-minimum phase
   behaviour of the boost topology. On the other hand, excellent dynamic
   performances can be achieved with boundary controllers in which the
   demands placed on processors and sensors are greatly increased. A novel
   trajectory-based dual loop control scheme is introduced in this work by
   combining linear techniques with state-plane analysis. Geometric
   trajectories are employed to define the outer voltage loop, allowing to
   achieve fast and reliable dynamic response. The well-known issues caused
   by the right-half plane zero are solved by defining the outer voltage
   loop control using simple geometric equations. The proposed
   trajectory-based voltage loop tightly controls the time-domain evolution
   of the state variables, providing a reliable transient response by
   following a desired geometrical path to reach the desired steady state
   operating point. Straight line and circular trajectories are implemented
   resulting in an outstanding, well defined, and reliable transient
   behaviour. Experimental results of dual-loop geometric-based controlled
   100W platform validate the proposed control concept and highlight the
   strong contribution to the theoretical and applied fields made by this
   innovative controller.}},

Abstract = {{In order to design and fabricate low profile (slim) LLC resonant
   converters, it is essential to replace conventional wire-wound magnetic
   transformers with low profile planar ones. In planar transformers, to
   decrease high-frequency AC resistance and to get high power efficiency,
   the primary and secondary PCBs are stacked together using the interleave
   structure method, which leads to a high amount of inter-winding and
   intra-winding capacitances. These winding capacitances can change the
   behavior of the LLC resonant converter and disturb the soft transition
   of the power MOSFETs, because the resonant circuit current should charge
   and discharge not only the effective Drain-Source capacitances of the
   power MOSFETs, but also the planar transformer winding capacitance. In
   this paper, the steady state equations of the LLC resonant converter
   with the planar transformer are extracted. In order to fully consider
   the characteristics of the LLC resonant converter, a new set of
   analytical equations is obtained for the LLC resonant converter, with
   consideration of the planar transformer equivalent capacitance. The
   experimental results extracted from a 36VDC, 200W prototype platform
   verify the accuracy of the analytical equations obtained, and
   demonstrate the validity of the employed model.}},

   increase switching frequency. However, doing so has detrimental effects,
   including reduced efficiency and increased EMI under hard-switching
   operation. To prevent the side effects of high switching frequencies,
   soft switching methods present advantages. In this paper, a lossless
   passive snubber circuit that operates based on the flyback converter is
   introduced. The proposed snubber circuit is not only able to produce ZVS
   and ZCS conditions for the converter switch, but also to produce soft
   switching conditions for the other semiconductor elements. The snubber
   circuit is applied to a flyback converter and the experimental results
   are presented to justify the theoretical analysis. The outcomes show
   that the proposed converter improved efficiency by over 3\% compared
   with the hard switching flyback converter.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of impulse denoising from
   hyper-spectral images. Impulse noise is sparse; removing impulse noise
   requires minimizing an l(r)-norm data fidelity term. Prior studies have
   exploited the intra-band spatial correlation (leading to sparsity in
   transform domain) and inter-band spectral-correlation (joint-sparsity)
   of hyper-spectral images for Gaussian denoising. In this work, we
   propose to learn the joint-sparsity promoting dictionary adaptively from
   the data for impulse denoising problems. Unlike dictionary learning
   techniques, the sparsifying dictionary is not learnt in an offline
   training phase. We follow the Blind Compressed Sensing (BCS) framework -
   dictionary learning and denoising proceeds simultaneously. The
   optimization problem that arises out of our formulation is solved using
   the Split Bregman approach. The proposed algorithm, when compared
   against prior techniques (on real hyper-spectral datasets) shows more
   than 5dB improvement in PSNR on average.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel mode-driven switching state space approach is
   proposed for the joint tracking and recognition of gestural commands.
   Gestures are modeled as spatio-temporal patterns comprised of syntactic
   sub-units called gesturelets. These gesturelets are directional vectors
   modulating a switching state space model. Stochastic context-free
   grammars (SCFG) are used as generative models for command gestures which
   impart a scale-invariant modeling framework. This translates into a
   method that is user-independent and robust to the signing variation
   between and among users. In addition to the modeling framework, we also
   design a library of useful gestural patterns that cannot be represented
   by regular grammars (hidden Markov models). Our approach combines
   tracking and recognition in a single framework and is able to deal with
   a high perplexity dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   approach by comparing SCFG models with HMM models on synthetic gesture
   trajectories.}},

   Integration of a video quality metric based on the characteristics of
   the Human Visual System (HVS) inside the rate distortion optimization
   procedure is expected to improve the compression efficiency of the video
   coding. in this paper, the PSNR-HVS measure is used in the rate
   distortion optimization process. The compression efficiency of the

Abstract = {{Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is highly prevalent in children and
   causes daytime sleepiness, growth failure and developmental delay.
   Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard to diagnose SDB, provides an
   estimate of severity, called the Apnea Hypoapnea Index (AHI). PSG is
   costly and resource intensive; therefore we propose using the Phone
   Oximeter, a pulse oximeter integrated into a phone that measures blood
   oxygen saturation (Spa)), as an at-home screening tool. In clinical
   practice, an AHI of 2-5 indicates mild SDB, but an AHI >= 5 usually
   prompts SDB treatment, Thus, we studied the performance of the Phone
   Oximeter as an SDB screening tool at varying thresholds of AHI. We
   analyzed the SpO(2) of 146 children, recorded by the Phone Qximeter,
   alongside conventional PSG, Time-frequency characterization of SpO(2)
   dynamics resulted in identification of 77\% and 86\% of children with an
   AHI >= 2 and AHI >= 5, respectively, using a multiple logistic
   regression model.}},

Abstract = {{Given the availability of EEG technology and existing studies, this
   paper discusses the feasibility of development of mobile applications
   controlled by brainwaves using a low-cost, non-invasive, headband type
   of device that collects two-channel EEG signals at frontal lobe. We have
   performed temporal, spectral and spatial analysis on EEG signals
   collected during game playingand found particular trends of EEG signals
   at certain brain (mental) states for all subjects, and some variations
   of the trends among different subjects. The analysis results motivate us
   to design an adaptive thresholding mechanism to find user-specific
   thresholds for a classifier that controls mobile applications.}},

Abstract = {{Current IP Multimedia System (IMS) industry faces the issue that the
   complicated architecture of IMS and the huge early investment in its
   network construction has slowed down its deployment and service
   innovation. Furthermore, IMS network also causes more computing and
   network resource waste than current telecom network becuase no existed
   method can be used to predict the capacity of data service with
   guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) in IMS network. Present research and
   practice consider that virtualizing IMS core and running it on cloud can
   be a way to solve these problems. However, current research shows the
   virtualization brings at least five times longer response delays to IMS
   and makes it unfeasible to be used. We argue that hardware-assisted
   virtualization technology can improve the virtual machine performance,
   and through carefully tuning the virtual machine parameters, the
   overhead caused by virtual machines can be minimized. We choose
   OpenIMSCore as an IMS core network, IMS Benchmark SIPp as a traffic
   generator, design and conduct a performance test. The results show that
   running IMS core network on virtual machines has comparable response
   delays with it running on bare boxes. It is feasible to virtualize the
   IMS core network and run it on private clouds.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach to input design for closed-loop
   identification. The idea is to maximize the trace of the Fisher
   information matrix associated with the plant model, while enforcing
   explicit constraints on both inputs and outputs. The result is the
   richest possible excitation signal for which the operation of a running
   closed-loop system remains within acceptable bounds. The function to be
   maximized is a convex quadratic. A Moving Horizon Predictive (MHP)
   framework is used to solve the input design problem at each sample time.
   If he method can be combined with a fixed model variable regressor
   technique to estimate time delays. The suggested technique is
   implemented and used to identify machine-directional processes in an
   industrial paper machine. (C) 2015, IFAC (International Federation of

Abstract = {{A detailed pseudo-bulk model has been used for prediction of conversion
   and particle size distribution (PSD) of vinyl acetate in a continuous

   techniques are applied for solving population balance equation under
   continuous operation. It is found that both methods can predict
   sustained oscillations in the monomer conversion. however the FV method
   matches the experimental data better than the moment method. The monomer
   conversion and free surfactant concentration are controlled via two
   single control loops. In this work. a new control strategy for
   controlling monomer conversion has been proposed. It has been shown that
   monomer conversion and free surfactant concentration can be controlled

Abstract = {{Gas-metal arc welding is a Widely used welding,process. The testing of
   such welds is clone offline and in most cases after the welding
   operation is over. To monitor the progress of the welding run, it is
   essential to develop multivariate data analysis techniques that can
   classify the welds into good or bad runs and also be able to predict the
   quality variables. In this work, popular multivariate data analysis
   methods such as hierarchical clustering analysis, principal component
   analysis and partial least squares are used to develop classification
   and regression models to predict the weld quality based on various
   parameters. The results indicate that models obtained using these
   methods are effective in classification and prediction of weld quality
   and can be further developed for online and industrial uses in weld run

Abstract = {{Detecting the onset of overloading in a semi-autogenous grinding (SAG)
   mill is a challenging task for operators to perform due to the complex
   and nonlinear nature of an overload. To detect an overload, operators
   must simultaneously monitor the correlations between several
   measurements of the SAG process. However, overloading often goes
   unnoticed at its early stages because the subtle changes in the
   correlations between measurements are difficult for an operator to
   observe. In addition, linear process monitoring techniques such as
   principal component analysis (PCA) provide inconsistent results with
   overload detection because of the process nonlinearity. Recently,
   locally linear embedding (LLE) with a linear classifier has been
   proposed to detect the early onset of an overload in a SAG mill. In this
   paper, we compare the suitability of LLE to detect the early onset of an
   overload against kernel PCA and support vector machines. (C) 2015, IFAC

   resistance. Both the amplifier and rectifier duals are tested under
   identical source power conditions. The amplifier has a drain efficiency
   of 84.3\% for an output power of 10 W, while the rectifier has a
   rectification efficiency of 85\% for a DC output power of 10.15 W. To
   the best knowledge of the authors, this is the highest reported power
   for a RF synchronous inverse class-F rectifier. The rectifier has a
   large dynamic range, and at 20 dB back-off, the efficiency is 48.5\% for
   100 mW of RF input power.}},

   processes that can be recorded during interaction with computers. To do
   so, we have designed a feature vector composed of typical gaze patterns,
   and piloted the approach on the dataset which we gathered. It consists
   of 145 samples of 30 people. A supervised machine learning technique was
   employed for classification and recognition of mood. The results of this
   pilot test suggests that even during these initial steps, the approach
   is quite promising and opens other research paths for improvement
   through multi-modal recognition and information fusion. Multi-modal
   approach would employ the added information provided by our previously
   developed mood extraction approach using camera and/or the information
   gained by the use of EEG signals. Further analysis will be performed in
   feature extraction process to enhance the model accuracy by enriching
   the feature-set of each modality.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a numerical simulation of stall control by using the
   casing treatment method which represents the passive control technique
   and also by using the air injection method which represents the active
   control technique. The casing treatment types used are the holed casing
   treatment and the casing skewed slots. There are four proposed numerical
   models; the first model is the regular shape model without casing
   treatments, the second model combines the holed casing treatment with
   the skewed slots, the third model is similar to the second one but
   enhanced by air injection at specified locations at the slot wall while
   the fourth model contains casing slots only. Results showed that the
   holed casing treatment helps in reducing the tip leakage flow by
   transferring it from the blades tip area to the impeller inlet. Also, it
   was found that the casing slots can cause a flow circulation and
   increase the kinetic energy around the position of slots and this leads
   to decreasing the number of stall cells. Results indicated also that the
   air injection at the casing slots increases the circulated flow rate
   inside the slots and minimizes the flow separation. It was found that
   the third model which contains casing slots only is the best comparing
   with other models in terms of decreasing the stall areas and increasing
   the compressor stability. Final results confirmed also that the casing
   treatment method increases the stability but reduces the isentropic
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Natural and man-made disasters cause tremendous losses every year. Re
   cent events, such as Hurricane Katrina and Sandy, have revealed the need
   for coordinated and effective emergency responses. In order to re duce
   human lives and economic losses, available resources should be allocated
   efficiently. Emergency responders are increasingly being challenged by
   the size and complexity of critical infrastructures that provide vital
   resources for emergency response operations. In this paper, sse propose
   an integrated simulation -optimization tool for assisting emergency
   responders in finding the optimal allocation of available resources
   during a disaster event The proposed tool utilizes the Infrastructure
   Interdependencies Simulator (i2Sim) for modeling the critical
   infrastructures that provides the available resources such as power and
   water. An optimization agent is developed based on a Genetic Algorithm
   (GA) to interact with the i2Sim simulator. We use this integrated
   simulation -optimization tool to address the problem of resources
   allocation during a disaster event. The objective of the optimization
   problem is maximizing the operational capacity of a critical
   infrastructure, a hospital in this case. The problem formulation
   incorporates the physical inte rdependencies between critical
   infrastructures in emergency response operations. This paper describes
   early results of our work that shows the use of our approach in
   optimizing resources allocation in a simulated disaster event.}},

Abstract = {{The generation of three-dimensional (3D) videos from monoscopic
   two-dimensional (2D) videos has received a lot of attention in the last
   few years. Current conversion techniques are based on generating an
   estimated depth map for each frame from different depth cues, and then
   using Depth Image Based Rendering (DIBR) to synthesize the additional
   views. Efficient interactive techniques have been developed in which
   multiple depth factors (monocular depth cues) are utilized to estimate
   the depth map using machine-learning algorithms. The challenge with such
   methods is that they cannot be used for real-time conversion. We address
   this problem by proposing an effective scheme that generates high
   quality depth maps for scenic views in real-time. In our work, we use
   three depth cues, haze, vertical edges, and sharpness to estimate a
   sparse depth map. We then obtain the full depth map from the sparse map
   using an edge-aware interpolation method. Performance evaluations show
   that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D
   conversion methods.}},

Abstract = {{Implementing advanced DSP applications in software on a low power and
   low cost embedded RISC processors is a challenging task because of ISA
   shortcomings that inhibits performance. An embedded CISC processor can
   potentially deliver higher performance but not enough to meet the demand
   of complex DSP applications. We present a novel ISA that eliminates
   unnecessary overheads and speeds up the performance of embedded DSP
   applications on resource constrained processors. The implementation of
   the novel mixed ISA requires minor modification to the base architecture
   which translates to less than 5\% increase in total power consumption.
   The novel ISA reduces the number of instructions used to implement a
   complex Fast Fourier Transform by less than half and speeds the
   processing by three folds leading to a substantial improvement in energy
   efficiency. Simulation results of a number of embedded benchmark
   programs show an average two fold increase in performance compared to a

Abstract = {{Subcooled flow boiling heat transfer of R134a in helically coiled tubes
   was investigated experimentally. Experiments were carried out at
   pressure ranging from 412 to 653 kPa, inlet subcooled temperature from
   5.0 to 11.0 degrees C, heat flux from 0.11 to 15.4 kWm(-2) and mass flux
   from 147 to 249 kg m(-2) s(-1). The wall temperature distribution was
   analyzed. In the case of single-phase flows, the wall temperature
   distribution is attributed to the secondary flow and the velocity
   profile of the main flow. In the case of two-phase flows, the
   temperature distribution is explained based on the buoyance and drag
   forces acting on the bubble. An increase of the inlet subcooling leads,
   for early subcooled boiling, to an increase in the heat transfer
   coefficient. However, the pressure has an opposite function on heat flux
   at the onset of nucleate boiling (ONB) and heat transfer coefficient.
   Besides, raising the mass flux can cause a substantial increase in the
   heat flux at ONB, but the effect on the heat transfer coefficient was
   negligible. The correlations of heat flux at ONB and the subcooled
   boiling heat transfer coefficient in a horizontal, helically coiled tube
   were developed based on the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of ambient vibration tests performed on
   the 4-storey reinforced concrete Health Sciences Parkade at the
   University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Two tests were
   conducted in March 2014 under different operational conditions: for the
   first test, a detailed ambient vibration test, was conducted during
   normal operating conditions while in the second test, the data was
   acquired when the Parkade was almost empty, but only at a few locations.
   The comparison between the results of the two tests shows that the
   frequency values are quite similar, even if the levels of vibration
   during the first test were much higher than those from the almost empty
   case. The vertical component of vibration was found to be predominant
   motion, showing a strong amplification of the vibrations due to traffic.
   The results also show that the ``added{''} mass due to the presence of
   the cars did not significantly affect the modal frequencies.
   The Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) and the Stochastic Subspace
   Identification (SSI) were used to estimate the dynamic parameters of the
   structure. A total of six modes were identified within the frequency
   range of 2-8 Hz, and all showed a significant 3D response. The natural
   frequencies and mode shapes from each technique have been compared and
   the similarities and differences are further discussed in the paper.}},

   documents. The dynamic properties of the structure were then determined
   experimentally through an ambient vibration test. Model updating was
   implemented to better match the model predictions to experimental
   results. The model updating targeted many parameters for specific
   structural elements to arrive at a strong correlation with the
   experimental results. A total of seven natural frequencies were matched.}},

Pages = {{114-121}},
Abstract = {{Computational neuroanatomical techniques that are used to evaluate the
   structural correlates of disorders in the brain typically measure
   regional differences in gray matter or white matter, or measure regional
   differences in the deformation fields required to warp individual
   datasets to a standard space. Our aim in this study was to combine
   measurements of regional tissue composition and of deformations in order
   to characterize a particular brain disorder (here, major depressive
   disorder). We use structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from
   young adults in a first episode of depression, and from an age- and
   sex-matched group of non-depressed individuals, and create population
   gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) tissue average templates using
   DARTEL groupwise registration. We obtained GM and WM tissue maps in the
   template space, along with the deformation fields required to
   co-register the DARTEL template and the GM and WM maps in the
   population. These three features, reflecting tissue composition and
   shape of the brain, were used within a joint independent components
   analysis (jICA) to extract spatially independent joint sources and their
   corresponding modulation profiles. Coefficients of the modulation
   profiles were used to capture differences between depressed and
   non-depressed groups. The combination of hippocampal shape deformations
   and local composition of tissue (but neither shape nor local composition
   of tissue alone) was shown to discriminate reliably between individuals
   in a first episode of depression and healthy controls, suggesting that
   brain structural differences between depressed and non-depressed
   individuals do not simply reflect chronicity of the disorder but arc
   there from the very outset. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Therapists' Perceptions of Social Media and Video Game Technologies in
   Upper Limb Rehabilitation}},
Journal = {{JMIR SERIOUS GAMES}},

Abstract = {{Background: The application of technologies, such as video gaming and
   social media for rehabilitation, is garnering interest in the medical
   field. However, little research has examined clinicians' perspectives
   regarding technology adoption by their clients.
   Objective: The objective of our study was to explore therapists'
   perceptions of how young people and adults with hemiplegia use gaming
   and social media technologies in daily life and in rehabilitation, and
   to identify barriers to using these technologies in rehabilitation.
   Methods: We conducted two focus groups comprised of ten occupational
   therapists/physiotherapists who provide neurorehabilitation to
   individuals with hemiplegia secondary to stroke or cerebral palsy. Data
   was analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. The diffusion of
   innovations theory provided a framework to interpret emerging themes.
   Results: Therapists were using technology in a limited capacity. They
   identified barriers to using social media and gaming technology with
   their clients, including a lack of age appropriateness, privacy issues
   with social media, limited transfer of training, and a lack of
   accessibility of current systems. Therapists also questioned their role
   in the context of technology-based interventions. The opportunity for
   social interaction was perceived as a major benefit of integrated gaming
   and social media.
   Conclusions: This study reveals the complexities associated with
   adopting new technologies in clinical practice, including the need to
   consider both client and clinician factors. Despite reporting several
   challenges with applying gaming and social media technology with
   clinical populations, therapists identified opportunities for increased
   social interactions and were willing to help shape the development of an
   upper limb training system that could more readily meet the needs of
   clients with hemiplegia. By considering the needs of both therapists and
   clients, technology developers may increase the likelihood that
   clinicians will adopt innovative technologies.}},

Abstract = {{In safety-critical control systems, such as closed-loop control of
   anesthesia, it is of utmost importance to guarantee the ability of a
   control approach to maintain states of the systems within a safe region.
   In this paper, we address the problem by applying a safety-preserving
   control technique to anesthesia control. The approach relies on a
   conservative approximation of the viability set. The set specifies
   initial states for which there exists an input that keeps the trajectory
   emanating from those states within the safe region. This approach can be
   applied to any type of controller which satisfies the performance
   criteria. Furthermore, it prevents the performance controller from
   taking the states out of the safe region.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade the interest for heart rate variability analysis has
   increased tremendously. Related algorithms depend on accurate temporal
   localization of the heartbeat, e.g. the R-peak in electrocardiogram
   signals, especially in the presence of arrhythmia. This localization can
   be delivered by numerous solutions found in the literature which all
   lack an exact specification of their temporal precision. We implemented
   three different state-of-the-art algorithms and evaluated the precision
   of their R-peak localization. We suggest a method to estimate the
   overall R-peak temporal inaccuracy-dubbed beat slackness-of QRS
   detectors with respect to normal and abnormal beats. We also propose a
   simple algorithm that can complement existing detectors to reduce this
   slackness. Furthermore we define improvements to one of the three
   detectors allowing it to be used in real-time on mobile devices or
   embedded hardware. Across the entire MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, the
   average slackness of all the tested algorithms was 9 ms for normal beats
   and 1 3 ms for abnormal beats. Using our complementing algorithm this
   could be reduced to 4 ms for normal beats and to 7 ms for abnormal
   beats. The presented methods can be used to significantly improve the
   precision of R-peak detection and provide an additional measurement for
   QRS detector performance.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time feedback is essential for motor learning. Automated feedback
   is especially valuable for at-home stroke rehabilitation in the absence

   motions. A bilateral upper-limb motor learning system, comprising a
   wireless wearable sleeve-armband device for providing vibrotactile
   feedback, a computer target game, and a customized motion tracking
   technology, was developed and evaluated on both hemiparetic stroke
   survivors and able-bodied people. This paper introduces the system and
   presents preliminary data for one hemiparetic stroke subject and one
   healthy subject performing bimanual reaching motions in the transverse
   plane. Vibrotactile training was found to successfully alter both
   subjects' original trajectories and to improve the motion symmetry of
   the stroke subject. These preliminary findings indicated the potential
   efficacy of vibrotactile cues for unsupervised motor learning in both

Abstract = {{``Dynamic wheeled mobility{''} offers ``on the fly{''} seating
   adjustments for wheelchair users such that various activities performed
   throughout the day can be matched by an appropriate seat position. While
   this has benefits for user participation and health, the added weight in
   existing dynamic wheelchairs may impact the user's ability to transport
   the frame, e.g. into cars. Other dynamic features to enable more
   participation avenues are also desirable. This paper outlines the
   development of a ``kneeling{''} ultralight wheelchair design that offers
   dynamic wheeled mobility functionality at a weight that is comparable to
   many existing ultralight wheelchairs. In addition, the wheelchair's
   kneeling function allows a lowered seat position to facilitate
   low-to-the-ground tasks such as floor transfers and other activities
   where sustained low level reaching may be required (e.g. playing with
   children, changing a tire, etc.). This paper also describes the
   development and pilot testing of an end user evaluation protocol
   designed to validate the wheelchair's functionality and performance.
   Successful realization and commercialization of the technology would
   offer a novel product choice for people with mobility disabilities, and
   that may support daily activities, health, improved quality of life, and
   greater participation in the community.}},

Abstract = {{The photoplethysmogram (PPG) obtained from pulse oximetry shows the
   local changes of blood volume in tissues. Respiration induces variation
   in the PPG baseline due to the variation in venous blood return during
   each breathing cycle. We have proposed an algorithm based on the
   synchrosqueezing transform (SST) to estimate instantaneous respiratory
   rate (IRR) from the PPG. The SST is a combination of wavelet analysis
   and a reallocation method which aims to sharpen the time-frequency
   representation of the signal and can provide an accurate estimation of
   instantaneous frequency. In this application, the SST was applied to the
   PPG and IRR was detected as the predominant ridge in the respiratory
   band (0.1 Hz - 1 Hz) in the SST plane. The algorithm was tested against
   the Capnobase benchmark dataset that contains PPG, capnography, and
   expert labelled reference respiratory rate from 42 subjects. The IRR
   estimation accuracy was assessed using the root mean square (RMS) error
   and Bland-Altman plot. The median RMS error was 0.39 breaths/min for all
   subjects which ranged from the lowest error of 0.18 breaths/min to the
   highest error of 13.86 breaths/min. A Bland-Altman plot showed an
   agreement between the IRR obtained from PPG and reference respiratory
   rate with a bias of -0.32 and limits agreement of -7.72 to 7.07.
   Extracting IRR from PPG expands the functionality of pulse oximeters and
   provides additional diagnostic power to this non-invasive monitoring
   tool.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of dry electrodes for EEG measurements has opened up
   possibilities of recording EEG outside of standard clinical environments
   by reducing required preparation and maintenance. However, the signal
   quality of dry electrodes in comparison with wet electrodes has not yet
   been evaluated under activities of daily life (ADL) or high motion
   tasks. In this study, we compared the performances of foam-based and
   spring-loaded dry electrodes with wet electrodes under three different
   task conditions: resting state, walking, and cycling. Our analysis
   showed that signals obtained by the 2 types of dry electrodes and
   obtained by wet electrodes displayed high correlation for all
   conditions, while being prone to similar environmental and
   electrode-based artifacts. Overall, our results suggest that dry
   electrodes have a similar signal quality in comparison to wet electrodes
   during motion and may be more practical for use in mobile and real-time
   motion applications due to their convenience. In addition, we conclude
   that as with wet electrodes, post-processing can mitigate motion
   artifacts in ambulatory EEG acquisition.}},

Abstract = {{Learning to maintain standing balance in the presence of a paretic limb
   is an important recovery process for many stroke survivors. In this
   study, we used a robotic balance simulator to investigate whether
   manipulating medial-lateral or anterior-posterior torque contributions
   (i.e. input gains) could shift the control of balance toward a targeted
   lower limb in healthy controls. Manipulation of medial-lateral (ML)
   torque gains shifted the vertical load distribution toward the virtually
   weakened limb, but did not result in a significant shift in
   anterior-posterior (AP) torque control. Instead individual participants
   were observed to shift AP torque control in either direction, although
   participants more often shifted control toward the virtually weakened
   limb at larger ML asymmetries. In contrast, manipulation of AP torque
   gains did not produce any observable changes in measured torque signals.
   The shift in torque contributions during ML manipulations shows promise
   as an implicit training method for reducing weight-bearing asymmetry.
   However, further work is required to ensure both vertical load and AP
   torque control shift in the desired direction as well as to determine
   the applicability of the protocol in a patient population.}},

Abstract = {{Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) disrupts normal ventilation during sleep
   and can lead to serious health problems in children if left untreated.
   Polysomnography, the gold standard for OSA diagnosis, is resource
   intensive and requires a specialized laboratory. Thus, we proposed to
   use the Phone Oximeter (TM), a portable device integrating pulse
   oximetry with a smartphone, to detect OSA events. As a proportion of OSA
   events occur without oxygen desaturation (defined as SpO(2) decreases >=
   3\%), we suggest combining SpO(2) and pulse rate variability (PRV)
   analysis to identify all OSA events and provide a more detailed sleep
   analysis. We recruited 160 children and recorded pulse oximetry
   consisting of SpO(2) and plethysmography (PPG) using the Phone Oximeter
   (TM), alongside standard polysomnography. A sleep technician visually
   scored all OSA events with and without oxygen desaturation from
   polysomnography. We divided pulse oximetry signals into 1-min signal
   segments and extracted several features from SpO(2) and PPG analysis in
   the time and frequency domain. Segments with OSA, especially the ones
   with oxygen desaturation, presented greater SpO(2) variability and
   modulation reflected in the spectral domain than segments without OSA.
   Segments with OSA also showed higher heart rate and sympathetic activity
   through the PRV analysis relative to segments without OSA. PRV analysis
   was more sensitive than SpO(2) analysis for identification of OSA events
   without oxygen desaturation. Combining SpO(2) and PRV analysis enhanced
   OSA event detection through a multiple logistic regression model. The
   area under the ROC curve increased from 81\% to 87\%. Thus, the Phone
   Oximeter (TM) might be useful to monitor sleep and identify OSA events
   with and without oxygen desaturation at home.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, hybrid models have emerged that combine microscopic and
   mesoscopic regimes in a single stochastic reaction-diffusion simulation.
   Microscopic simulations track every individual molecule and are
   generally more accurate. Mesoscopic simulations partition the
   environment into subvolumes, track when molecules move between adjacent
   subvolumes, and are generally more computationally efficient. In this
   paper, we present the foundation of a multi-scale stochastic simulator
   from the perspective of molecular communication, for both mesoscopic and
   hybrid models, where we emphasize simulation accuracy at the receiver
   and efficiency in regions that are far from the communication link. Our
   multi-scale models use subvolumes of different sizes, between which we
   derive the diffusion event transition rate. Simulation results compare
   the accuracy and efficiency of traditional approaches with that of a
   regular hybrid method and with those of our proposed multi-scale
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the robust transceiver design for a two-hop
   full-duplex decode-and-forward relay system employing single-carrier
   transmission with frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE). The design
   problem for the transmit precoding and receive equalization is
   formulated as an optimization problem with the objective to minimize the
   sum mean-squared error (MSE) of the two hops subject to separate node
   transmit power constraints. We show that the equalization filters can be
   optimized individually at the receiving nodes and take the form of
   robust Wiener filters. However, due to the loopback interference, the
   transmissions in the two hops are coupled and the transmit precoding
   problem boils down to a non-convex power allocation problem in the
   frequency domain. An alternating optimization approach is proposed to
   obtain the power allocation where convex programming problems and
   difference of convex programming problems are solved in an alternating
   manner. Numerical results are provided to validate the MSE and the
   achievable rate of the proposed robust schemes, showing that significant
   performance gains can be achieved compared to conventional half-duplex
   systems and non-robust full-duplex designs.}},

Abstract = {{Downloading remote files (e.g., pictures, videos) from online social
   networks via smart user equipments (UEs) (e.g., smartphones, tablets) is
   becoming popular. Friends who are nearby may want to download the same
   files shared by their mutual acquaintance. People can obtain these files
   in a device-to-device (D2D) manner via opportunistic connections to
   reduce their payment for data service. This is referred to as D2D data
   offloading. However, D2D communications on unlicensed spectrum using
   Bluetooth or WiFi-Direct may not maintain high data rate when many D2D
   pairs nearby need to communicate simultaneously. Since D2D connections
   are transient, it is important to improve spatial reuse of communication
   resources and increase the data rate of opportunistic D2D
   communications. In this paper, we propose a scheme to reuse the downlink
   licensed spectrum of cellular networks for D2D data offloading. Our
   proposed scheme includes determining the availability of digital files
   on neighbouring devices, estimating the channel gains, and performing
   channel allocation and power control for D2D pairs. Simulation results
   show that our proposed scheme does not affect the existing cellular UEs
   and it can also offload more data traffic when compared with WiFi-Direct
   on an unlicensed spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{In mobile crowdsourcing systems, smartphones can collectively monitor
   the surrounding environment and share data with the platform of the
   system. The platform manages the system and encourages smartphone users
   to contribute to the crowdsourcing system. To enable such sensing
   system, incentive mechanisms are necessary to motivate users to share
   the sensing capabilities of their smartphones. In this paper, we propose
   ProMoT, which is a Profit Maximizing Truthful auction mechanism for
   mobile crowdsourcing systems. In the proposed auction mechanism, the
   platform acts as an auctioneer. The smartphone users act as the sellers
   and submit their bids to the platform. The platform selects a subset of
   smartphone users and assigns the tasks to them. ProMoT aims to maximize
   the profit of the platform while providing satisfying rewards to the
   smartphone users. ProMoT consists of a winner determination algorithm,
   which is an approximate but close-to-optimal algorithm based on a greedy
   mechanism, and a payment scheme, which determines the payment to users.
   Both are computationally efficient with polynomial time complexity. We
   prove that ProMoT motivates smartphone users to rationally participate
   and truthfully reveals their bids. Simulation results show that ProMoT
   increases the profit of the platform in comparison with an existing
   scheme.}},

   grow up accordingly due to the high MAC coordination overhead. In this
   paper, we present VFA, namely virtual frame aggregation, to achieve high
   coordination efficiency by amortizing the overhead over multiple
   transmissions. VFA provides a novel way to construct a winner cluster
   and allow the winners to transmit without interruption. Specifically, in
   a multicarrier network, every contending node chooses a subcarrier and
   the nodes are ordered by the index of the chosen subcarrier. When there
   are some subcarriers chosen by two or more nodes, an additional slot is
   exploited to reorder the collided nodes. Finally, all ordered nodes form
   a cluster and the transmissions are issued sequentially and
   uninterruptedly. Simulation results show that usually two slots are
   enough to construct a sufficiently large winner cluster. Moreover, VFA
   achieves a notable throughput gain over IEEE 802.11 as high as 120\%
   with better fairness under various scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Interference alignment (IA) is an effective approach for interference
   management in wireless networks. Nevertheless, the interferences in IA
   networks are usually leveraged to separate out the desired signal and
   then discarded, instead of re-utilizing the interferences. Recently,
   wireless power transfer (WPT) has been introduced to harvest energy in
   IA networks, however, its performance still can be improved. In this
   paper, we propose a novel WPT based on angle switching (WPT-AS) scheme
   to further improve the performance of WPT in IA networks. Since the
   optimization problem of the WPT-AS scheme is difficult to solve, we
   develop a suboptimal algorithm for WPT-AS with low complexity.
   Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the WPT-AS
   scheme to improve the performance of WPT in IA networks.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider mean squared error (MSE)-based robust
   transceiver optimization for multi-user multi-input multi-out (MU-MIMO)
   cellular network that exploits interference alignment (IA) for its
   downlink communication. First, we consider the conventional sum-MSE
   minimization problem, where the MSE is calculated at user equipments
   (UEs). Second, we consider a different approach where the MSE can be
   calculated at base stations (BSs) i.e., leakage-based MSE from each BS.
   Different from conventional perbase station power constraint (PBPC), we
   assume practical perantenna power constraint (PAPC) due to linearity of
   the power amplifier that feeds each transmit antenna at the BSs. To this
   end, we derive robust precoders and receive filters for these two design
   objectives under statistical channel state information (CSI)
   uncertainty. Simulation results suggest that our robust designs offer a
   good performance, showing resilience against CSI uncertainty. In
   addition, the sum-rate performances for designs with PAPC and PBPC are
   compared. It is observed that the sumrate loss due to PAPC is relatively
   small for the robust designs.}},

   infrastructure to enable home users to have dynamic control over their

   allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to perform bandwidth slicing in
   home networks and implement time-dependent hybrid pricing. Given the
   requests from household devices for virtualized and non-virtualized
   services, we formulate a Stackelberg game to characterize the pricing
   strategy of ISP as well as bandwidth allocation strategy in home
   networks. In the Stackelberg game, the leader is the ISP and the
   followers are the home networks. We determine the optimal strategies
   which provide maximal payoff for the ISP. Numerical results show that

Abstract = {{Due to the exponentially increasing demands for multimedia services over
   recent years, the growing network traffic load becomes a severe concern
   for the mobile network operators (MNOs). However, the wireless link
   capacity, the radio access networks, and MNOs' backhaul networks cannot
   deal with the traffic load effectively. To solve this problem, content
   caching is regarded as an effective emerging technique to reduce the
   duplicated transmissions of the content downloads demanded by mobile
   users and improve users' quality of service (QoS). Therefore, in this
   paper, we mainly focus on the cooperative cell caching for future mobile
   networks, where each cell (e.g., base station) can cache popular
   contents for improving QoS especially on the overall delay performance
   of users. The task is formulated as a problem of minimizing the expected
   overall user delay of accessing the demanded contents. Instead of
   rewriting it as a non-linear and non-convex problem based on an
   approximate transformation, we convert it to a linear programming
   problem by using a novel equivalent transformation. To solve the
   problem, rather than using the existing branch-and-bound (BNB) method,
   which suffers from exponential-time and exponential-space complexity, we
   propose a new distributed suboptimal algorithm, which has
   polynomial-time and linear-space complexity. Numerical evaluation
   results demonstrate that our proposed cooperative cell caching framework
   can reduce the expected overall delay significantly.}},

Abstract = {{In machine to machine (M2M) communication systems based on the Third
   Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE), the
   machine type communication (MTC) devices compete in a random access
   channel (RACH) to access the network. AnMTC device randomly chooses a
   preamble from a pool of preambles and transmits it during the RACH. The
   evolved node B (eNodeB) acknowledges the successful reception of a
   preamble if that preamble is transmitted by only one device. To reduce
   the burstiness of the connection requests in heavy traffic situations,
   access class barring (ACB) is proposed in the 3GPP standard. Using ACB,
   an MTC device postpones its request in a RACH with a probability p. In
   this paper, we propose a new adaptive ACB scheme for congestion control
   of bursty M2M traffic. The optimal value of the ACB depends on the total
   number of MTC devices competing in a RACH. To estimate this number, we
   derive a joint conditional probability distribution function (PDF) for
   the number of preambles selected by zero or one MTC device, conditioned
   on the number of MTC devices that passed the ACB check. We design a
   maximum likelihood estimator using this PDF. We use this estimation to
   dynamically adjust the ACB factor. To further improve our estimation, we
   use Kalman filtering based on the dynamics of the system. Numerical
   results show that the total service time for the proposed method is very
   close to the optimal case where the information of the number of MTC
   devices is given.}},

   for a given LU normalized by the probability of it being selected, is
   analyzed and is proved to achieve a double-logarithmic growth when the

Abstract = {{In a cognitive radio (CR) network, a group of CR users can act as relays
   for a given user to improve the quality of communications for this user.
   To achieve such cooperative transmission, we propose a distributed
   beamforming technique that reduces the required feedback overhead in
   terms of sharing the channel state information between the cooperating
   CR relays. In return for their cooperation, the assisted CR user can
   lease its own channel, for a certain amount of time, to the cooperating
   CR relays for their opportunistic access. However, a particular CR relay
   spends a certain amount of power to forward the data to the assisted CR
   user. Therefore, we also propose an autonomous decision making strategy
   that can help each CR user to independently decide whether to
   participate in the cooperative transmission or not, by quantifying the
   reward and cost functions of each CR relay. The presented numerical
   results show an enhancement in the achievable sum rate of the
   cooperative CR network up to 43 \% for a primary channel occupancy
   probability of 0.3, compared to the case of non cooperative

   We assume that the multi-antenna D2D users in the cellular network
   employ interference alignment (IA) for their communication. In addition
   to an interference power constraint that is set by the primary network
   (i.e., macrocell) in the underlay cognitive transmission, we also
   consider channel state information (CSI) imperfectness to obtain a
   robust transceiver design for the D2D users. Due to the non-convexity of
   the design problem, we resort to an alternating minimization technique.
   Numerical simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed
   transceiver compared to the benchmark case of an IA system without
   primary network/macrocell (non-cognitive). It is observed that at low
   SNR and high CSI error with relaxed interference power constraint, the
   worst-case stream data rate of the D2D users are close to that of the
   users in non-cognitive IA system but performance degrades significantly
   with stringent interference power constraint.}},

Abstract = {{Automated computer vision techniques were used to analyze 2 h of video
   data collected at a major signalized intersection in New York City. The
   main objectives of this study were to diagnose pedestrian safety issues
   and identify contributing factors at the intersection and to demonstrate
   the feasibility of the automatic extraction of pedestrian data required
   for pedestrian behavior analysis mainly pedestrian speed and gait
   parameters. The safety study was conducted with traffic conflict
   techniques. The main factor that contributed to the high number of
   pedestrian and vehicle conflicts was found to be pedestrian violations,
   mainly temporal violations in which pedestrians crossed the street
   during the ``Don't Walk{''} or flashing ``Don't Walk{''} phase. During
   the 2 h analyzed, about one-third of pedestrians were noncompliant with
   the signal timing or crosswalk boundary (17.9\% spatial violations and
   15.3\% temporal violations). Pedestrian speed, step frequency, and step
   length were automatically extracted for 333 pedestrians and were found
   to follow the normal distribution with 95\% confidence (mean and
   standard deviation of 1.47 +/- 0.27 m/s, 1.96 +/- 0.17 Hz, and 0.75 +/-
   0.14 m, respectively). Gait analysis showed that the walking speed for
   single pedestrians was 9\% higher than for those who walked in groups.
   Males tended to be slightly faster than females, with higher step length
   but lower step frequency. Violators tended to have higher walking speeds
   compared with non violators, and the difference in speed was dependent
   on step length but not on step frequency.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2519}},
Pages = {{28-38}},
Abstract = {{A better understanding of pedestrian behavior is needed to enhance
   existing pedestrian simulation models. A study was conducted on
   microscopic pedestrian behavior during several interactions, with
   pedestrian walking speed and gait parameters (step frequency and length)
   as variables. Pedestrian trajectories at a signalized intersection in
   Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, were extracted from video
   recordings by means of computer vision techniques. Walking speed and
   gait parameters were estimated by analyzing pedestrian speed profiles.
   The study provided detailed analysis of seven interactions. The
   variations in walking speed and gait parameter values across group size
   and gender during the seven interactions were also investigated. Results
   showed that, for some of the studied interactions, pedestrian speed
   alone may not be adequate to describe pedestrian behavior and that gait
   parameters can help to provide better understanding of pedestrian
   behavior in these particular interactions. Furthermore, a specific set
   of parameters was identified that can be extracted from the results and
   can be used to calibrate a microscopic pedestrian behavior-modeling
   platform currently being developed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new media access control (MAC) protocol for
   in-vehicle power line communications (PLC). Specifically, the proposed
   protocol is based on the HomePlug Green PHY (HomePlug GP) which is a
   modern PLC protocol standard for Smart Grid applications on the Home
   Area Network {[}1], however, it has been found that current HomePlug
   protocols would not cope with the strict timing requirements of
   in-vehicle communication systems. This paper suggests improvements and
   modifications to enhance the real-time MAC performance of HomePlug GP in
   an in-vehicle network through additional priority levels and reduced
   message length. Simulation results based on the open source network
   simulator OMNeT++ are provided to show advantages of the proposed

Abstract = {{Most of the existing channel models are based on the assumption of wide
   sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WS-SUS) properties, which are
   not suitable for time-varying vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) channels. A
   method for generating correlated taps in stochastic V2V channel model is
   proposed in this paper, which represents the non-WSSUS properties
   adequately. With the method for generating correlated taps, the proposed
   tapped delay line channel model is correlated both in the amplitude part
   and the phase part. In the model, the amplitude statistics follows the
   Weibull distribution, and the phase statistics follows the linear
   function of uniform distribution, which are more accurate to represent
   the fading properties of V2V channel. Furthermore, simulation results
   show that the proposed model can generate correlated V2V channel with
   arbitrary amplitude and phase correlation coefficients accurately.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of eye-gaze tracking at the console of surgical robots
   has the potential to add both speed and functionality to the human-robot
   interface. In this paper, we present a novel eye gaze tracker that can
   be integrated as a simple retrofit to the da Vinci console. In
   particular, the eye tracker can be used with the da Vinci Research Kit
   (dVRK) to control the patient side manipulators. We present the
   eye-tracker design and calibration. First, a 2D calibration is carried
   out to estimate the gaze on the da Vinci's stereoscopic display,
   followed by a 3D ``hand-eye{''} calibration to estimate the gaze in the
   surgical scene. Using the dVRK, we demonstrated the use of the
   eye-tracker to perform a gaze-assisted task, in which the estimated gaze
   is used as a set point for the robot and the user is guided towards the
   point of gaze through haptic feedback. The task performed was peg
   placement and was evaluated in a preliminary user study with five users.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we explore the effectiveness of a three-fingered robotic
   gripper in accurately expressing directional instructions (move up,
   down, left, right) as gestures emulating human hand gestures. Such
   gestures can be necessary in noisy manufacturing environments where
   verbal communication is ineffective. Three studies are conducted. In
   Study 1 we explore hand configurations that human dyads use for
   nonverbal instruction (n = 17). In Study 2 we examine which
   hand-configurations from Study 1 are most accurately understood by
   observers (n = 140). In Study 3 we compare performance between a robot
   arm performing similar motions to those of human study participants
   using either an unposed or posed three-fingered robotic gripper (n =
   100) to observe the importance of the hand's pose. Recognition rates of
   directional gestures for both the human and the robot are examined.
   Results indicate that most gestures are better and more confidently
   recognized when displayed with the posed robot hand.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a general criterion to predict conditions under which a
   flat planar medium is capable of imaging a point source. Such a planar
   medium, known as a flat lens, is attractive due to its potential for
   imaging over unbounded aperture dimensions. The criterion first assumes
   a point source on one side of the medium and then evaluates the position
   of the image based on the phase of the paraxial plane waves exiting the
   medium. The benefit of this criterion is that it makes no a priori
   assumption of the medium composition and is thus highly general. We
   apply this criterion to study a recent class of flat-lens structures
   made of nano-layers of metal and dielectric. The criterion is validated
   by comparison against past results. We use the criterion to design new
   flat lenses, such as a lens for transverse-electric polarization and a
   broad-band flat lens operating over the UV-visible spectral range.}},

   discipline. High test data volume and long test time are always two
   major concerns that our work here addresses. Here we combine a test data
   compression technique and broadcast-based decompressor architecture to
   relieve these problems. We propose a new decompressor architecture with
   bidirectional shift register as a source chain to broadcast compressed
   data into parallel scan chains. It enables one more broadcasting mode
   which leads to a higher broadcast ratio. We also propose a heuristic
   method to order the scan cells in each sub scan chain to improve the
   broadcast ratio so as to reduce the test data and test time. We apply
   our method on several benchmark circuits and the experimental results
   show that our method can reduce test data volume by 22.8\% and shorten
   test application time by 19.5\% on average with low area overhead in
   comparison to other state-of-the-art approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling renewable energy generation systems with electrical machines
   has been an active area of research, wherein interfacing the machine
   models with power electronic converters is a known challenge area. As an
   alternative to traditional qd models, the coupled-circuit phase-domain
   (CCPD) and voltage-behind-reactance (VBR) models have been recently
   proposed. The permanent magnet (PM) generator has internal saliency and
   damper structures, which results rotor-position-dependent inductances in
   both CCPD and VBR models, and interfacing qd models requires snubber
   circuits, all of which reduces the simulation efficiency. This paper
   presents a constant-parameter voltage behind reactance (CPVBR) model in
   order to achieve a numerically-efficient interface with the rectifier
   circuit. The model is demonstrated on a grid-connected variable-speed
   wind generation system, wherein significant computational advantages are
   demonstrated compared with existing models.}},

Abstract = {{Line-commutated thyristor-controlled rectifiers are extensively used in
   industrial applications, where controllable dc voltage is required. The
   simulation software developments trend is towards proposing new packages
   for power electronics components that are computationally more efficient
   and still accurate. One of the most widely-used modeling techniques is
   known as parametric average value modeling (PAVM), which avoids the
   discrete switching states of the converters and introduces
   computationally efficient models that are suitable for system level
   studies. In this paper, an industrial application of PAVM of a
   controlled thyristor bridge rectifier is investigated in conjunction
   with four different switching resolution levels of a practical induction
   furnace load. The analytical dynamic model of the induction furnace
   system is also derived in order for decoupling the furnace-side
   converter from the grid-side network. The superior performance of
   different switching-reduced models in terms of CPU efficiency as well as
   accuracy are verified by simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling and simulation of power systems for general-purpose transient
   studies has been receiving significant attention in the literature.
   Among recently proposed methods, the so-called shifted-frequency
   analysis (SFA) approach has been shown to facilitate accurate and
   numerically efficient simulation of electromagnetic and
   electromechanical transients with the use of dynamic phasors. This paper
   proposes a SFA-based voltage-behind-reactance (VBR) model of induction
   machines (IMs), which is shown to permit the use of a large range of
   step sizes to effectively simulate various types of transients. The
   proposed VBR-SFA IM model is developed in state-space formulation, which
   is simple to implement and can be solved with built-in variable-step
   solvers in MATLAB/Simulink and other programs. Computer studies
   demonstrate that the proposed VBR-SFA IM model requires significantly
   fewer time steps and is more efficient than the conventional/existing

Abstract = {{Unprecedented expansion of native direct current (DC) powered equipment
   (computers and consumer electronics) has increased household DC
   electricity consumption over the past decade. Since power utilities
   deliver alternating current (AC) rather than DC, the conversion process
   (rectifier) used to supply DC loads is very inefficient. This paper
   investigates the suitability of employing conventional AC wiring to
   distribute DC power to supply loads directly, in particular around
   outlet/switch arcing issues. The problem of arcing in DC system is very
   predominant and needs to be addressed to meet safety requirements while
   improving the efficiency of the system. In order to overcome the arcing
   issues, an alternative flat DC wiring system is proposed which offers
   improved transient electrical and thermal characteristics for household
   wiring. The flat wire solution employs the same raw materials and
   provides improvements in parasitic values associated with arcing while
   reducing thermal resistance. The proposed flat wire geometry is expected
   to achieve reduction of arcing and improve the overall efficiency of the
   distribution system. Simulations of the two preliminary AC and DC
   systems are provided for typical domestic loads and switching events. A
   complete set of experimental results will be included in the final
   version of the paper.}},

Abstract = {{During decades of interconnected operation of power systems, frequency
   control standards have evolved to fairly share the benefits of
   interconnection and tie-line bias control among Balancing Authorities
   (BAs). The new draft standards of North American Electric Reliability
   Council (NERC) define a frequency-dependent Balancing Authority ACE
   Limit (BAAL) within which BAs must control their Area Control Error
   (ACE). In this paper, the effects of the new draft standards in
   real-time Automatic Generation Control (AGC) of a hydroelectric
   dominated utility are modelled and assessed. Generation scheduling and
   real-time AGC logic based on taking maximum advantage of new wide bounds
   of ACE are modelled. It is shown, through dynamic simulations, that
   generation control under Balance Resource and Demand (BRD) standards is
   more efficient in term of less generation loss and unit maneuvering.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time transient stability assessment is becoming more feasible using
   synchrophasor systems. Modern Wide-Area Monitoring Systems (WAMS) are
   equipped with PMUs and fast communication infrastructure. The paramount
   advantage of modern WAMS is their capability to provide fast, reliable
   and synchronized real-time measurements of different system parameters.
   In this paper, a new real-time Transmission Stability Assessment (TSA)
   technique is proposed. In the proposed technique, angle-based indices
   are applied to train five consecutive Decision Trees (DTs) which are
   used for real-time TSA. The proposed technique is tested on the Northern
   Intertie, connecting BC Hydro and Bonneville Power Administration (BPA)
   systems. The obtained results validate the efficiency of the proposed
   scheme.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the implementation of a heart motion compensation
   system on the da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical Inc.) for
   coronary artery bypass surgery. By introducing a robot-assisted
   solution, this surgery could be performed completely minimally
   invasively and on a beating heart. In this work we describe the
   development of open loop controllers based on spectral line
   decomposition and the assumption of a periodic trajectory. This allows
   the da Vinci patient-side manipulators to track an actual heart
   trajectory with sub-millimetre error. Further, to simulate a virtually
   stabilized environment, we present the novel concept of maintaining the
   camera fixed relative to the heart target, effectively decoupling the
   vision tracking and arm tracking challenges. Finally, we executed
   preliminary experiments to evaluate surgeons' ability to perform
   simulated suturing and peg transfer tasks on a moving target.
   Performance for the simulated suturing was evaluated based on task
   completion time, accuracy of needle placement, and number of errors. For
   the suture task, the number of missed targets decreased from 37\% to
   13\% when compensation was enabled, the number of hit targets increased
   from 26\% to 41\%, and completion time decreased. For the peg transfer
   tasks, again completion time and number of errors were measured. Though
   the margin for error was larger, there was less perceived difficulty of
   the task when compensation was enabled.}},

Abstract = {{Voltage mode and dual-loop current-mode linear controllers are widely
   used in buck converters due to their simple implementation and fixed
   frequency PWM operation. While the dynamic response can be improved by
   pushing the control bandwidth, lower stability margins may lead to
   unexpected peak deviations, leading to failures due to magnetic
   saturations or excessive overshoot. A dual-loop geometric compensator is
   introduced in this work by combining state-plane analysis with
   traditional linear controllers. The proposed geometric voltage loop
   tightly controls the time-domain evolution of the state variables,
   providing a reliable transient response by following a desired
   geometrical path to reach the target steady state operating point.
   Straight line and circular trajectories are implemented resulting in an
   outstanding, well defined, and reliable transient behaviour.
   Experimental results of dualloop geometric-based controlled 50W platform
   validate the proposed control concept and highlight the strong
   contribution to the applied field made by this innovative controller.}},

Abstract = {{Synchronous interleaved boost converters (SIBCs) result in lower ripple
   currents and bidirectional power flow. The boost topology has a
   non-minimum phase characteristic, producing instability problems when a
   large bandwidth is required. Linear controllers inherently limit the
   boost controller bandwidth, resulting in a slow response. In this paper,
   state-trajectory control of the SIBC based on boundary control is
   proposed to provide an outstanding dynamic response during start-up and
   sudden load changes, close to the physical limit of the system. The
   proposed controller and derivation provides a rigorous framework that
   deals with four switching states, and three state equations, resulting
   in a simple control law with very fast dynamic response. The normalized
   trajectories for the SIBC are determined in the geometric domain along
   with the control law. The exact trajectories are used for fast
   transients, and approximate trajectories are employed for constant
   frequency in steady-state. Simulation and experimental results are
   provided to validate the proposed procedures.}},

Abstract = {{In order to fully cover the V-I plane of deep-cycle batteries, battery
   chargers should work under different loading conditions and output
   voltage, and should respond to different States of Charge (SoC). In this
   paper, a fourth order L3C resonant converter is introduced and employed
   as a battery charger. The analytical equation of the L3C voltage gain
   shows the possibility of regulating wide output voltage to an
   unprecedented degree within a narrow frequency range to cover the entire
   V-I charging plane of modern batteries. The topology integrates all of
   the parasitics elements into the resonant circuit, realizes ZVS for the
   inverter MOSFETs, and provides inherent over-current protection
   capacity. These advantages provided by the proposed L3C resonant
   converter make this topology an excellent candidate for use as a charger
   in Electric Vehicles. The experimental results extracted from a 220V DC;
   550W resonant converter platform with a peak efficiency of 96.5\%
   exhibit the excellent performance of the proposed converter for battery
   charger applications.}},

Abstract = {{With the accelerated development of Internet-of-Things (IoT), wireless
   sensor networks (WSNs) are gaining importance in the continued
   advancement of information and communication technologies, and have been
   connected and integrated with the Internet in vast industrial
   applications. However, given the fact that most wireless sensor devices
   are resource constrained and operate on batteries, the communication
   overhead and power consumption are therefore important issues for WSNs
   design. In order to efficiently manage these wireless sensor devices in
   a unified manner, the industrial authorities should be able to provide a
   network infrastructure supporting various WSN applications and services
   that facilitate the management of sensor-equipped real-world entities.
   This paper presents an overview of industrial ecosystem, technical
   architecture, industrial device management standards, and our latest
   research activity in developing a WSN management system. The key
   approach to enable efficient and reliable management of WSN within such
   an infrastructure is a cross-layer design of lightweight and cloud-based

   Communications}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{1298-1312}},
Abstract = {{The general problem of a queue-aware radio resource management and
   scheduling design is investigated for wireless communications under
   quasi-static fading channel conditions. Based on an analysis of the
   source buffer queuing system, the problem is formulated as a constrained
   nonlinear discrete programming problem. The state transition matrix of
   the queuing system determined by the queue-aware scheduler is shown to
   have a highly dynamic structure, so that the conventional matrix
   analysis and optimization tools are not applicable. By reformulating the
   problem into a nonlinear integer programming problem on an integer
   convex set, a direct search approach is considered. Two types of search
   algorithms, gradient based and gradient-free, are investigated. An
   integer steepest-descent search with a sub-sequential interval search
   algorithm and a constrained discrete Rosenbrock search (CDRS) algorithm
   is proposed to solve the nonlinear integer problem. Both algorithms are
   shown to have low complexity and good convergence. The numerical results
   for a single user resource allocation are presented, which show that
   both algorithms outperform equal partitioning and random partitioning
   queue-aware scheduling. The dynamic programming (DP) solution given by
   the relative value iteration algorithm, which provides the true optima
   but has high complexity, is used as a benchmark. In the majority of the
   numerical examples, the performance of the CDRS algorithm is almost
   identical to that of the DP approach in terms of both the average queue
   length minimization and the average packet blocking plus packet
   retransmission minimization, but it is less complex, and thus has better
   scalability.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, mobile networking systems have been designed with more
   complexity of infrastructure and higher diversity of associated devices
   and resources, as well as more dynamical formations of networks, due to
   the fast development of current Internet and mobile communication
   industry. In such emerging mobile heterogeneous networks (HetNets),
   there are a large number of technical challenges focusing on the
   efficient organization, management, maintenance, and optimization, over
   the complicated system resources. In particular, HetNets have attracted
   great interest from academia and industry in deploying more effective
   solutions based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, e.g.,
   machine learning, bio-inspired algorithms, fuzzy neural network, and so
   on, because AI techniques can naturally handle the problems of
   large-scale complex systems, such as HetNets towards more intelligent
   and automatic-evolving ones. In this paper, we discuss the
   state-of-the-art AI-based techniques for evolving the smarter HetNets
   infrastructure and systems, focusing on the research issues of
   self-configuration, self-healing, and self-optimization, respectively. A
   detailed taxonomy of the related AI-based techniques of HetNets is also
   shown by discussing the pros and cons for various AI-based techniques
   for different problems in HetNets. Opening research issues and pending
   challenges are concluded as well, which can provide guidelines for

Abstract = {{The construction of a battlefield surveillance system is very important
   for monitoring the attack of enemy aircrafts and missiles, which
   integrates various sensors and mobile devices. Then, multiple
   battlefield surveillance systems can be connected together to form a
   battlefield surveillance network. The mobile nodes can be deployed in a
   certain region to monitor enemy aircrafts and missiles. Thus, some
   important issues have to be solved efficiently, including the
   cooperation across the administrative domains of a cloud network, the
   direction-of-arrival (DOA), and a polarization estimation algorithm for
   a mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN). In this paper, the architecture
   of a battlefield surveillance system is constructed based on mobile
   cloud computing and 5G link. The root multiple signal classification
   (Root-MUSIC)-like algorithm is proposed for estimating the 1-D DOA and a
   polarization parameter with a uniform linear array. The Root-MUSIC
   algorithm is replaced by the Fourier transform, the former algorithm
   that can be extended to an arbitrary topology structure of a MWSN. Then,
   the proposed algorithm is extended to the 2-D DOA and a polarization
   estimation in further. Based on the deployment of different MWSNs, the
   estimation results of DOA and polarization parameters are fused in order
   to improve the estimation performance. Finally, the parameter
   information (DOA and polarization parameter) of enemy aircrafts and
   missiles can be achieved. The computer simulation verifies the
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm ensures
   the parameter estimation accuracy with a low computational complexity.}},

Title = {{A Multi-Objective Optimization Scheduling Method Based on the Ant Colony
   Algorithm in Cloud Computing}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{2687-2699}},
Abstract = {{For task-scheduling problems in cloud computing, a multi-objective
   optimization method is proposed here. First, with an aim toward the
   biodiversity of resources and tasks in cloud computing, we propose a
   resource cost model that defines the demand of tasks on resources with
   more details. This model reflects the relationship between the user's
   resource costs and the budget costs. A multi-objective optimization
   scheduling method has been proposed based on this resource cost model.
   This method considers the makespan and the user's budget costs as
   constraints of the optimization problem, achieving multi objective
   optimization of both performance and cost. An improved ant colony
   algorithm has been proposed to solve this problem. Two constraint
   functions were used to evaluate and provide feedback regarding the
   performance and budget cost. These two constraint functions made the
   algorithm adjust the quality of the solution in a timely manner based on
   feedback in order to achieve the optimal solution. Some simulation
   experiments were designed to evaluate this method's performance using
   four metrics: 1) the makespan; 2) cost; 3) deadline violation rate; and
   4) resource utilization. Experimental results show that based on these
   four metrics, a multi-objective optimization method is better than other
   similar methods, especially as it increased 56.6\% in the best case
   scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is recognized as the number
   one source of anthropogenic mercury pollution in the world. Miners use
   mercury to amalgamate gold, then heat the amalgam to evaporate the
   mercury. This process, referred to by miners as burning, releases large
   quantities of mercury vapor that affects the health of miners and
   community members. A retort is a mercury capture device that provides a
   simple solution to reduce human exposure to mercury vapor during the
   burning process. In spite of the low cost, ease of use and numerous
   outreach programs that have introduced miners to this technology, miners
   have been reluctant to use retorts. This chapter provides a review of
   ASGM processes involving mercury, discusses the health effects of
   mercury vapor, and provides case studies on retort use in Mozambique,
   Ecuador and Guyana. The chapter concludes with a discussion on reasons
   why retorts have not been widely adopted in these countries, and it
   provides potential solutions to address miners concerns with the use of
   retorts.}},

   Cultures? Case Study of Motorcycle Safety in China}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2520}},
Pages = {{165-174}},
Abstract = {{Limitations associated with traditional collision-based safety analysis
   techniques led to a growing interest in the use of surrogate safety
   measures such as the traffic conflict technique. This interest was
   facilitated by advances in automated video-based data collection methods
   that helped to overcome the reliability issues associated with manual
   collection of data on traffic conflicts. Various objective conflict
   indicators that measure various spatial and temporal aspects of user
   proximity are available to measure the severity of traffic events. These
   time-proximity conflict measures assume that proximity is a surrogate
   for conflict severity. However, this assumption may not be valid in many
   driving environments. The objective of this paper is to investigate
   whether time-proximity conflict measures can be a good indicator of
   safety in less-organized traffic environments with highly mixed road
   users. A case study of motorcycle conflicts in a highly congested shared
   intersection in Shanghai, China, was used as a case study. Traffic
   conflicts were analyzed with the use of automated video-based analysis
   techniques. Several traffic conflict indicators designed to detect
   evasive actions, such as deceleration, jerk, and yaw rate, were
   recommended as better able to measure traffic conflicts in such traffic
   environments. The results showed that indicators that measured evasive
   actions had higher potential to identify motorcycle conflicts in highly
   mixed, less-organized traffic environments than did time-proximity
   measures such as the time to collision.}},

   accepts individual blade pitch, generator torque and yaw control inputs.
   The model is derived by assuming that the entire structure behaves as a
   single rigid body, under the influence of various forces and torques.
   Furthermore, it can be linearized analytically, making the wave
   disturbance matrix obtainable. We validate the proposed nonlinear model

   (CD) processes in paper machines. A performance index is proposed based
   on the spatial and temporal minimum variance benchmark for the CD
   process. Computational complexity of the high dimensional time series
   estimation is reduced by taking advantage of the special structure in
   the coefficient matrices. Illustrative examples from a paper machine
   simulator and industrial data sets are provided to show the
   effectiveness of the techniques as well as the insensitivity of the
   performance index to high frequency spatial disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Any discrepancy between a process and the associated model used in
   control design will compromise closed-loop performance. In almost all
   current techniques to detect model-plant mismatch in model-based control
   systems there must be some sort of external excitation to overcome the
   effect of unmeasured disturbances on closed-loop signals. In this paper,
   we propose a novel technique that enables us to detect model-plant
   mismatch without introducing any external excitation. We show that
   model-plant mismatch in a closed loop system changes the
   cross-correlation coefficients between the model prediction error and
   the process input at certain lags. Indeed, by comparing the correlation
   between prediction error and input signals in the case of poor
   performance with that under good performance, one can detect model-plant
   mismatch. The results are illustrated on paper machine data.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the proliferation of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs),
   the peak load in the power grid is expected to increase in future. The
   peak load can be reduced by implementing appropriate load scheduling
   schemes using advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and smart chargers.
   In this paper, we formulate the charging problem of PHEVs as a potential
   game to jointly optimize the cost of the utility company and payoff of
   the customers. The potential game approach enables us to study the
   existence and uniqueness of the pure strategy Nash equilibrium and to
   design a polynomial time distributed algorithm to achieve that
   equilibrium. It also enables us to define a Lyapunov function to show
   that the Nash equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, i.e., the
   proposed distributed algorithm converges to the Nash equilibrium from
   any arbitrary initial conditions. To evaluate the efficiency of our
   proposed algorithm, we compare its running time with an algorithm based
   on the customers' best response.}},

Abstract = {{The secrecy capacity (SC) from the source to a destination in a dual-hop
   amplify-and-forward (AF) relay network using cooperative jamming (CJ) is
   investigated. Conditions for achieving a positive SC are derived. An
   energy constrained untrusted cooperative relaying protocol is considered
   in which the relay forwards information from the source to the
   destination while harvesting energy from the source signal and the
   destination jamming signal. An optimization problem is proposed to
   maximize the SC subject to the energy constraints. A method is proposed
   to find the optimal power split ratio (PSR) which maximizes the SC. An
   approximate expression for the optimal PSR is also derived. Results show
   that a mutually beneficial relationship exists between
   source-destination pair and the relay. This allows the relay to achieve
   a net energy gain while the secrecy of the confidential message from the
   source to the destination is protected.}},

   question that the author asked the social entrepreneur partnered with a

   Community Service-Learning in which students work on sociotechnical
   problems identified by rural artisans in the craft and textile sector in
   India. Students collaborate closely with the social entrepreneur who has
   developed long-standing, on-the-ground relationships with artisans in
   marginalized communities in India. The course emphasizes the need for
   collaboration, the nature of community, and the search for low-tech
   solutions that are socially appropriate, environmentally sustainable,
   and economically feasible. While Community-Service Learning discourse
   largely focuses on pedagogical methodology and its transformative
   effects on students, the voice of the community often goes unheard. Our
   social entrepreneur's response to the above question reveals surprising
   qualitative insights about the relational nature of technical
   documentation and how even partial student ``work on paper{''} can

Abstract = {{As part of the smart grid, demand response (DR) mechanisms can be used
   by energy providers to encourage consumers to modify their electricity
   consumption in response to time-varying prices or other incentives. If
   many homes use automated appliance schedulers to respond to DR signals,
   consumption peaks can result during times with the lowest electricity
   prices. The effectiveness of strategies designed to prevent this
   phenomenon depends on what kind of automated appliance schedulers are
   being used in homes. In this paper, we assume homes are using a highly
   flexible appliance scheduler and explore how well two different
   strategies of reducing these consumption peaks perform. Namely, we
   consider setting electricity prices to be constant during off-peak times
   and using prices that increase when the total consumption of the home
   increases. We discuss how these two peak reduction strategies interact
   with the scheduler and propose modifications to the scheduler to improve
   or accommodate the strategies. We then present numerical simulations to
   show that the daily peak to average ratio (PAR) of the energy
   consumption of a group of homes using the flexible, sub-optimal
   scheduler can be reduced significantly by both strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Downlink cell association (CA) is studied for cellular heterogeneous
   networks (HetNets) where large-scale antenna array is implemented at the
   macro base station (BS), while the opportunistically deployed small
   cells are single-antenna nodes, and they rely on over-the-air links to
   the macro base station for backhaul. The coupling constraint due to
   in-band wireless backhaul becomes another key criterion for cell
   association. A duplex and spectrum sharing scheme based on reverse
   timedivision duplex (TDD) is considered for interference management in
   the HetNet under the wireless backhaul constraint. A sum
   logarithmic-throughput maximization problem is formulated to balance
   throughput and fairness. By relaxing the binary cell association
   indicator variables, the optimization problem is shown to be a convex
   problem. Dual decomposition for relaxed optimization is employed to
   solve the integer nonlinear CA problem, which results in a distributed
   CA algorithm. Improved performance and fairness are achieved with the
   proposed algorithm under the wireless backhaul constraint, and more
   small cells implemented within the macro cell range achieves better load
   balancing. As no additional radio frequency hardware is required by the
   proposed scheme, it allows low-cost and fast implementation of wireless
   backhaul enabled cellular HetNets.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents modeling and control methods for an integrated
   thermal hydronic system (ITHS) consisting of a solar thermal collector,
   a thermal storage unit and a thermal booster. Control inputs are: valves
   activation time, pitch angle, solar pump rate and compressor rate,
   measurements are: temperatures at critical points, and disturbances are:
   ambient air temperature, source water temperature and the position of
   the sun relative to the plane of the solar thermal collector. In this
   context, the problem of maintaining temperature within the given range
   of the thermal storage is considered. To address this problem, the model
   is developed based on lumped-parameter analysis. Using the model, three
   controllers are tested in simulations, i.e., the on-off controller, the
   PI controller and the scheduling controller. The modeling will be useful

Abstract = {{Fire incidents in large petrochemical complexes such as oil refineries
   cause heavy losses. Due to the strong interdependencies that exist among
   units in these industrial complexes, planning an efficient response is a
   challenging task for firefighters. The task is even more challenging
   during multiple-fire incidents. This chapter describes a firefighting
   decision support system that helps conduct efficient responses to fire
   incidents. The decision support system optimizes the allocation of
   firefighting units in multiple-fire incidents with the objective of
   minimizing the economic impact. In particular, the system considers
   infrastructure interdependencies in estimating the damage associated
   with a given fire scenario, calculates the resulting economic losses and
   determines the optimal assignment of available firefighters. The
   decision support system can be used before an incident for training and
   planning, during an incident for decision support or after an incident
   for evaluating suppression strategies.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing design complexity, post-silicon validation has become a
   critical problem. In pre-silicon validation, coverage is the primary
   metric of validation effectiveness, but in post-silicon, the lack of
   observability makes coverage measurement problematic. On-chip coverage
   monitors are a possible solution, but prior research has shown that the
   overhead is prohibitive for anything beyond a small number of coverage
   points. This paper presents a novel solution for post-silicon coverage
   monitoring: fully instrument the design in emulation to sample the
   relationships between coverage points, and then use this statistical
   data to choose a small set of coverage points whose coverage provides
   high probability that all the other coverage points are covered as well;
   only that small set is instrumented on silicon. To demonstrate the
   method, we propose a simple feature selection algorithm based on
   Bayesian networks to choose the small set of coverage points. In
   experiments emulating a non-trivial SoC, our technique reduces the
   number of coverage monitors by 92\%, yet predicts over 98\% probability
   that all coverage points are covered.}},

   Conflicts?}},

Pages = {{48-57}},
Abstract = {{Recently, there has been growing interest in using microsimulation
   models to assess the safety of road facilities by analyzing vehicle
   trajectories and estimating conflict indicators. Using microsimulation
   models in safety studies can have several advantages, although concerns
   have been raised about the ability of these models to represent unsafe
   vehicle interactions and near misses realistically as well as their need
   for rigorous calibration. The main objective of this study was to
   investigate the relationship between field-measured and simulated
   conflicts at an urban signalized intersection in Surrey, British
   Columbia, Canada. Sixty hours of recorded traffic data were collected in
   2 days and used in the conflict analysis. Automated video based computer
   vision techniques were used to extract vehicle trajectories and identify
   conflicts on all four approaches to the intersection. Conflict measures
   (e.g., time to collision) and location were determined and compared with
   simulated conflicts from a microscopic simulation model (VISSIM) using
   the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM). A two-step calibration
   procedure was proposed to enhance correlation between simulated and
   field-measured conflicts. The first calibration step was matching actual
   field conditions (desired speed and arrival type) to ensure that VISSIM
   gives real average delay values. The second step was the use of
   sensitivity analysis followed by a genetic algorithm procedure to
   calibrate the VISSIM parameters that had the biggest effect on the
   simulated conflicts. Finally, conflict heat maps were provided to
   compare field-measured with simulated conflict locations. The results
   highlighted the importance of model calibration and identified several
   limitations of the SSAM.}},

   Conflict Analysis}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2514}},
Pages = {{58-67}},
Abstract = {{Surrogate safety measures, such as the traffic conflict technique, have
   been promoted as an alternative or complementary approach to evaluate
   road safety from a broader perspective than collision statistics alone.
   The before-and-after evaluation of safety treatments is one application
   that can significantly benefit from the use of surrogate safety
   measures. This study demonstrated the use of automated traffic conflict
   analysis to conduct before-and-after safety evaluations. The objective
   was to conduct a time-series (before-to-after) safety evaluation for an
   intersection in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, where several
   pedestrian related countermeasures were implemented. Treatments included
   one or more of the following: use of protected-only turns for
   left-turning vehicles, installation of pedestrian countdown timers,
   crosswalk realignment, and use of drop-down sidewalks. Results indicated
   a significant decrease in both pedestrian conflict frequency and
   severity at the intersection following the treatments. A greater
   reduction of conflicts was exhibited on the western portion of the
   intersection where several countermeasures were implemented, including a
   protected left-turn phase, dual drop-down ramps, and a shift in the
   crosswalk further west. This variation in conflict reduction along
   different segments of the same intersection gives a particularized view
   of the impact of the adopted countermeasures. The outcome of this
   research provides evidence that surrogate safety indicators can be used
   effectively to diagnose safety problems and evaluate countermeasures at
   intersections.}},

   the problem was to recover the image sequence from under-sampled
   measurements. Second, the sparse component of the signal was not sparse
   in itself but in a transform domain. Recent studies in dynamic MRI
   reconstruction showed that, instead of using a fixed sparsity basis,
   better recovery results can be achieved when the sparsifying dictionary
   is adaptively learned from the data using Blind Compressed Sensing (BCS)
   framework. In this work, we demonstrate that learning the sparsity basis
   using BCS like techniques improve the recovery accuracy from PCP when

Abstract = {{The demand for rich multimedia services over mobile networks has been
   soaring at a tremendous pace over recent years. However, the wireless
   link capacity as well as the bandwidth of the radio access networks and
   the backhaul network cannot practically cope with the explosive growth
   in mobile traffic load. In this article, we mainly focus on a new novel
   framework of cooperative cell caching for future mobile cellular
   networks, where the base station of each cell can have certain
   capability of caching popular contents. Then we carry out necessary
   theoretical modeling-based analysis. We also propose to utilize
   prefix-tree aggregation to improve the caching performance among cells,
   and discuss potential deployment issues for caching in 5G mobile
   networks. Based on trace-driven simulations, we evaluate the performance
   of the proposed framework.}},

   into the multifaceted medical environment and satisfy a wide range of
   user needs. In order to achieve this, users and stakeholders must be

Abstract = {{Hierarchies are commonly used in engineering to make data more
   accessible and concepts more understandable. Engineers readily recognize
   hierarchies and are quite aware of their presence within engineering
   work. Maslow's hierarchy of needs is also used in engineering, but its
   presence is much more subtle. Engineering is seen by many to offer many
   ``problem-solving{''} opportunities which allows engineers to meet their
   ``self-actualization{''} needs at the top level of Maslow's hierarchy.
   Yet these same engineers assume that the problems they solve will all be
   found in the bottom two levels (the more ``practical{''} physiological
   and safety needs). Neglecting the problems of the higher levels,
   engineers often find their best efforts compromised as the effects of
   their ``low level{''} solutions travel up the hierarchy. A good example
   of this can be seen in the negative effects the installation of latrines
   in developing countries has had on women. The insistence that all
   problems come from the bottom and solutions come from the top closes the
   loop, to some extent, on Maslow's hierarchy. As the tale of the
   stonecutter reminds us, hierarchies may not be hierarchies after all.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2515}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Abstract = {{The present study introduces a new technique for multivariate
   identification and ranking of hot spots based on the Mahalanobis
   distance. This approach aims to extend the univariate potential for
   safety improvement to cases in which multiple response variables are
   modeled jointly. Because the literature shows that ranking techniques
   based on Bayesian methods are superior to those that rely simply on the
   observed collision count, the proposed method was developed in a full
   Bayesian (FB) context. The new technique involves the following steps:
   (a) applying multivariate Poisson-lognormal regression models to the
   data by means of the FB method, (b) using the estimates of the Poisson
   posterior means for each site to compute the multivariate (Mahalanobis)
   distance from what is the normal Poisson mean for similar sites, and (c)
   preparing an ordered list of potentially hazardous sites. This method
   was applied to a sample of 173 signalized intersections in the city of
   Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, for the years 2008 to 2012. The
   study also examines the consistency of the technique itself by analyzing
   the mathematical intersection of ranked sites identified in subsequent
   time periods. Finally, the consistency of the multivariate FB ranking
   was assessed against the independent (separate) univariate one that is
   still dominant in road safety evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{Localization of a needle's tip in ultrasound images is often a challenge
   during percutaneous procedures due to the inherent limitations of
   ultrasound imaging. A new method is proposed for tip localization with
   curvilinear arrays using local image statistics over a region extended
   from the partially visible needle shaft. First, local phase-based image
   projections are extracted using orientation-tuned Log-Gabor filters to
   coarsely estimate the needle trajectory. The trajectory estimation is
   then improved using a best fit iterative method. To account for the
   typically discontinuous needle shaft appearance, a geometric
   optimization is then performed that connects the extracted inliers of
   the point cloud. In the final stage, the enhanced needle trajectory
   points are passed to a feature extraction method that uses a combination
   of spatially distributed image statistics to enhance the needle tip. The
   needle tip is localized using the enhanced images and calculated
   trajectory. Validation results obtained from 150 ex vivo ultrasound
   scans show an accuracy of 0.43 +/- 0.31 mm for needle tip localization.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a new ultrasound and magnetic resonance image guidance
   system for robot assisted radical prostatectomy and its first use in
   patients. This system integrates previously developed and new components
   and presents to the surgeon preoperative magnetic resonance images (MRI)
   registered to real-time 2D ultrasound to inform the surgeon of anatomy
   and cancer location. At the start of surgery, a trans-rectal ultrasound
   (TRUS) is manually positioned for prostate imaging using a standard
   brachytherapy stepper. When the anterior prostate surface is exposed,
   the TRUS, which can be rotated under computer control, is registered to
   one of the da Vinci patient-side manipulators by recognizing the tip of
   the da Vinci instrument at multiple locations on the tissue surface. A
   3D TRUS volume is then taken, which is segmented semi-automatically. A
   segmentation-based, biomechanically regularized deformable registration
   algorithm is used to register the 3D TRUS image to preoperatively
   acquired and annotated T2-weighted images, which are deformed to the
   patient. MRI and TRUS images can then be pointed at and examined by the
   surgeon at the da Vinci console. We outline the approaches used and
   present our experience with the system in the first two patients. While
   this work is preliminary, the feasibility of fused MRI and TRUS during
   radical prostatectomy has not been demonstrated before. Given the
   significant rates of positive surgical margins still reported in the
   literature, such a system has potentially significant clinical benefits.}},

Abstract = {{We present a 2D to 3D registration framework that compensates for
   prostate motion and deformations during freehand prostate biopsies. It
   has two major components: 1) a trajectory-based rigid registration to
   account for gross motions of the prostate; and 2) a non-rigid
   registration constrained by a finite element model (FEM) to adjust for
   residual motion and deformations. For the rigid alignment, we constrain
   the ultrasound probe tip in the live 2D imaging plane to the tracked
   trajectory from the pre-procedure 3D ultrasound volume. This ensures the
   rectal wall approximately coincides between the images. We then apply a
   FEM-based technique to deform the volume based on image intensities. We
   validate the proposed framework on 10 prostate biopsy patients,
   demonstrating a mean target registration error (TRE) of 4.63 mm and 3.15
   mm for rigid and FEM-based components, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Prostate brachytherapy preplanning is the process of determining
   treatment target volume and arrangement of radioactive seeds w.r.t. the
   target volume prior to the implantation. Although preplanning is
   typically performed by a trained expert using a strict set of
   guidelines, the process remains highly subjective, resulting in
   significant user-dependent variability in the plans. In this work, we
   aim to reduce the preplanning variability by automating the seed
   arrangement process. We propose a novel framework which uses a
   retrospective treatment dataset to extract common radioactive seed
   patterns. The framework captures the inter-relation between the
   treatment volume delineation and seed arrangements through a joint
   sparse representation of retrospective data. This representation is used
   to estimate an initial seed arrangement for a new treatment volume,
   followed by a novel optimization process which captures the clinical
   guidelines, to fine-tune the seed arrangement. The proposed framework is
   evaluated on a dataset of 590 brachytherapy treatment cases by 5-fold
   cross validation. It achieves 86\% success rate, when compared to the
   clinical guidelines and the actual plans.}},

Abstract = {{Absolute elasticity images can be generated from harmonic motion vector
   measurements over a volume, usually with MRI, called MR elastography
   (MRE). This work aims to apply the same method using motorized 3D
   ultrasound. Previous work has demonstrated measurement of motion vectors
   over ultrasound volumes, however measuring dynamic motion on the order
   of hundreds of cycles per second remains a challenge. A solution is
   proposed based on synchronizing the ultrasound acquisition with the
   mechanical exciter producing the waves. Measured motion is smoothed
   using a constraint on the divergence. An elasticity reconstruction
   algorithm used in MRE is applied to ultrasound data captured on a tissue
   mimicking phantom. The reconstructed values are within 20\% and 8\% of
   previous MRE measurements of hard and soft regions, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Background, Motivation and Objective: This article describes a state of
   the art ultrasound system that is used to quantify tissue elasticity of
   the prostate. Statement of Contribution/Methods: The system involves the
   measurement of the steady-state multi-frequency response of tissue to
   transperineal excitation while imaging the gland using the sagittal
   array of the BK Medical 8848 trans-rectal ultrasound transducer. A roll
   motor rotates the transducer in discrete steps to create a volume sector
   of images. GPU Processing of raw in-phase/quadrature data streamed from
   the ultrasound machine is used to measure the axial (radial) spatial
   distribution of tissue motion and compute displacement phasors. Bandpass
   sampling is used to perform the reconstruction since the sampling
   frequency is below the Nyquist rate. Finally, a local frequency
   estimator is used to compute the Youngs Modulus from the three
   dimensional local spatial wavelengths of the shear wave that is created
   at each of the excitation frequencies. Results/Discussion: The system
   has been used in several clinical studies but its design and function
   has not been published before. Some of the study results have been
   published and include an area under receiver operating characteristic
   curve of 0.820.01 with regards to prostate cancer identification in the
   peripheral zone. The accuracy of the elastic modulus measurement was
   validated using a CIRS elastography phantom. Numerical and visual
   correlations between our elasticity measurements and pathology results
   demonstrate its clinical potential. The system has been expanded to a
   generic platform that can be used to provide real-time quantitative
   elasticity measurements in other organs.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation in the medical device industry is frequently driven by
   collaborations between engineers and clinicians in an academic setting.
   However, many such projects, especially within student design courses,
   end up abandoned and orphaned when approaching the proverbial ``Valley
   of Death{''} in product development. In this paper, this challenge is
   described as three separate Valleys: a financial valley, an
   expertise-driven valley, and an academic-specific valley. This paper
   then presents a case study of the Drill Cover Project, a student design
   project in the Engineers in Scrubs Program at the University of British
   Columbia. Observations of the Project's success to date are presented in
   a resulting model for how engineering design and technology
   commercialization courses can increase the likelihood and ability of
   student groups to bridge the three Valleys.
   This model includes close collaboration with users, strong early
   leadership and team culture, supporting networks of mentors and product
   champions, and an impact-focused mission, which are all contributing
   factors to the success of the Drill Cover Project thus far.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel segmentation approach based on deep convolutional
   encoder networks and apply it to the segmentation of multiple sclerosis
   (MS) lesions in magnetic resonance images. Our model is a neural network
   that has both convolutional and deconvolutional layers, and combines
   feature extraction and segmentation prediction in a single model. The
   joint training of the feature extraction and prediction layers allows
   the model to automatically learn features that are optimized for
   accuracy for any given combination of image types. In contrast to
   existing automatic feature learning approaches, which are typically
   patch-based, our model learns features from entire images, which
   eliminates patch selection and redundant calculations at the overlap of
   neighboring patches and thereby speeds up the training. Our network also
   uses a novel objective function that works well for segmenting
   underrepresented classes, such as MS lesions. We have evaluated our
   method on the publicly available labeled cases from the MS lesion
   segmentation challenge 2008 data set, showing that our method performs
   comparably to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we have evaluated our
   method on the images of 500 subjects from an MS clinical trial and
   varied the number of training samples from 5 to 250 to show that the
   segmentation performance can be greatly improved by having a
   representative data set.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic detection and localization of vertebrae in medical images are
   highly sought after techniques for computer-aided diagnosis systems of
   the spine. However, the presence of spine pathologies and surgical
   implants, and limited field-of-view of the spine anatomy in these
   images, make the development of these techniques challenging. This paper
   presents an automatic method for detection and localization of vertebrae
   in volumetric computed tomography (CT) scans. The method makes no
   assumptions about which section of the vertebral column is visible in
   the image. An efficient approach based on deep feed-forward neural
   networks is used to predict the location of each vertebra using its
   contextual information in the image. The method is evaluated on a public
   data set of 224 arbitrary-field-of-view CT scans of pathological cases
   and compared to two state-of-the-art methods. Our method can perform
   vertebrae detection at a rate of 96\% with an overall run time of less
   than 3 seconds. Its fast and comparably accurate detection makes it
   appealing for clinical diagnosis and therapy applications.}},

Abstract = {{After a comprehensive computational analysis of the geometry of plates
   used in low consistency refiners, a series of low consistency refining
   trials were designed and conducted to better understand the impact of
   different refiner plate patterns and also other operating conditions
   such as: rotational speed of the rotor and gap size between plates on
   final properties of pulp. Most importantly, we propose tools to optimize
   the performance of low consistency refiners by reducing the fibre
   shortening and increasing the strength of final pulp. We accomplish this
   objective through the introduction of two parameters: Bar Interaction
   Length (BIL) and Bar Interaction Area (BIA). These two parameters
   however, are not conceptually new and they have been referred as the
   ``leading edges of bar crossings{''} and the ``area of refining{''} in
   several earlier works. We developed analytical and computational models
   to estimate these two geometrical parameters in a disc refiner with
   parallel distribution of bars.
   For the pilot-scale refining trials, we used market CTMP pulp from
   Northern British Columbia and refined them using a wide range of plate
   patterns, rotational speeds and gap sizes. In total, 144 sample points
   were collected in this study at gaps sizes less than 2.5 mm.}},

Abstract = {{To ensure structural integrity and safety, in-service health monitoring
   techniques are employed in many engineering areas. The safety, cost and
   performance issues of these health and usage monitoring techniques are
   particularly important in the aviation industry. At present monitoring
   techniques are primarily based on pessimistic predictions and periodic
   inspections, which are costly and inefficient. Smart solutions to health
   and usage monitoring techniques relates to systems including sensors for
   damage detection combined with advanced signal processing and analysis.
   The sensitivity of sensors to damage and the reliability of performance
   as well as low cost of integration are the major requirements.
   Electrospun polymer nanofiber (NF) materials have attracted tremendous
   interest in sensor applications as their sensing surface area
   dramatically increases with decreasing fiber diameter. The highly
   tunable composition and surface functionality of the NF material
   facilitate its versatile sensibility to a wide range of visible and
   invisible environmental stimulus. In this presentation, we introduce
   three classes of nanocomposite fibers that have potential for highly
   sensitive large area sensing of various stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, two high-rise buildings with concrete shear wall cores
   have been tested. Both of the tested buildings, shown in Figure 1 below,
   are thoroughly investigated for torsional modes as well as foundation
   rocking, since torsional sensitivity is expected due to the structural
   irregularities present.
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   The first case study presents the results obtained from the ambient
   vibration measurements done on a newly constructed, 20 stories high
   building, with reinforced concrete core, in Vancouver, British Columbia,
   Canada, Figure 1 (a). The experimental results reveal the dynamic
   characteristics of the investigated building by advanced system
   identification methods using enhanced signal processing techniques and
   the fundamentals of frequency domain decomposition. The experimental
   results would include the natural frequencies and the mode shapes of the
   buildings obtained from the vibration measurements.
   The second building tested using this unique technique is a newly
   constructed 30 stories tall reinforced concrete building in Burnaby,
   British Columbia, Canada, Figure 1 (b). The experimental results reveal
   the dynamic characteristics of this investigated building including the
   building rocking modes.
   For the 20 storey building, a total of 12 modes of vibration, up to the
   4th translational and torsional modes, are identified. For the 30 storey
   building, a total of 15 natural periods of vibration are identified
   including the translational and torsional modes (up to the 5th mode)
   along with the foundation rocking component for each mode. Hence, the
   utilized testing approach and the analysis methodology would work well
   for the tall buildings tested and the number of modes identified is
   beyond the expectation.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in red blood cell (RBC) deformability are associated with the
   pathology of many diseases and could potentially be used to evaluate
   disease status and treatment efficacy. We developed a simple, sensitive,
   and multiplexed RBC deformability assay based on the spatial dispersion
   of single cells in structured microchannels. This mechanism is analogous
   to gel electrophoresis, but instead of transporting molecules through
   nano-structured material to measure their length, RBCs are transported
   through micro-structured material to measure their deformability. After
   transport, the spatial distribution of cells provides a readout similar
   to intensity bands in gel electrophoresis, enabling simultaneous
   measurement on multiple samples. We used this approach to study the
   biophysical signatures of falciparum malaria, for which we demonstrate
   label-free and calibration-free detection of ring-stage infection, as
   well as in vitro assessment of antimalarial drug efficacy. We show that
   clinical antimalarial drugs universally reduce the deformability of RBCs
   infected by Plasmodium falciparum and that recently discovered PfATP4
   inhibitors, known to induce hostmediated parasite clearance, display a
   distinct biophysical signature. Our process captures key advantages from
   gel electrophoresis, including image-based readout and multiplexing, to
   provide a functional screen for new antimalarials and adjunctive agents.}},

Abstract = {{A cylindrically shaped magnetically-actuated MEMS
   (microelectromechanical systems) drug delivery device for localized
   prostate cancer treatment is proposed in this work. The device is
   designed for implantation through a gauge 12 needle for minimally

   reservoir, a PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) membrane, a magnetic block and
   a housing. Under external magnetic fields, the movement of the magnetic
   block deflects the membrane and discharges the drug through an aperture
   and into the housing. The housing has a large opening which allows the
   released drug to diffuse to the surrounding tissues while it prevents
   the tissues from touching the membrane. On-demand drug release with
   consistent release rates and device implantation using a needle into ex
   vivo porcine bladder tissue are demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the wide coverage and availability of WiFi signals in indoor
   environments, WiFi access point localization has arisen as a promising
   approach for location awareness. Much research has been dedicated in
   recent years to effectively locate WiFi access points (APs) within a
   building. However, many of the proposed methods are not able to provide
   sufficient accuracy due to the complexity of indoor multipath fading. In
   this paper, a cost effective and accurate method is developed for AP
   localization based on received signal strength (RSS) gradient vectors.
   The proposed algorithm focuses on modifying the observation matrix by
   detecting and filtering erroneous measurements. Blunders and corrupted
   observations are determined by calculating measurement residuals. The
   improved gradient-based method shows superior performance both in terms
   of position accuracy and robustness in comparison to other similar
   methods for AP localization. The proposed algorithm, demonstrates low
   sensitivity to the distribution of measurement points and sparsity of
   the RSS observation matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Diverse means have been deployed for harvesting electrical energy from
   mechanical actuation produced by low-grade waste heat, but cycle rate,
   energy-per-cycle, device size and weight, or cost have limited
   applications. We report the electromagnetic harvesting of thermal energy
   as electrical energy using thermally powered torsional and tensile
   artificial muscles made from inexpensive polymer fibers used for fishing
   line and sewing thread. We show that a coiled 27 mu m-diameter nylon
   muscle fiber can be driven by 16.7 degrees C air temperature
   fluctuations to spin a magnetic rotor to a peak torsional rotation speed
   of 70000 rpm for over 300000 heating-cooling cycles without performance
   degradation. By employing resonant fluctuations in air temperature of
   19.6 degrees C, an average output electrical power of 124 W per kg of
   muscle was realized. Using tensile actuation of polyethylene-based
   coiled muscles and alternating flows of hot and cold water, up to 1.4 J
   of electrical energy was produced per cycle. The corresponding per cycle
   electric energy and peak power output, per muscle weight, were 77 J
   kg(-1) and 28 W kg(-1), respectively.}},

Title = {{A Study on the Power Consumption of H.264/AVC-Based Video Sensor Network}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{There is an increasing interest in using video sensor networks (VSNs) as
   an alternative to existing video monitoring/surveillance applications.
   Due to the limited amount of energy resources available in VSNs, power
   consumption efficiency is one of the most important design challenges in
   VSNs. Video encoding contributes to a significant portion of the overall
   power consumption at the VSN nodes. In this regard, the encoding
   parameter settings used at each node determine the coding complexity and
   bitrate of the video. This, in turn, determines the encoding and
   transmission power consumption of the node and the VSN overall.
   Therefore, in order to calculate the nodes' power consumption, we need
   to be able to estimate the coding complexity and bitrate of the video.
   In this paper, we modeled the coding complexity and bitrate of the
   H.264/AVC encoder, based on the encoding parameter settings used. We
   also propose a method to reduce the model estimation error for videos
   whose content changes within a specified period of time. We have
   conducted our experiments using a large video dataset captured from
   real-life applications in the analysis. Using the proposed model, we
   show how to estimate the VSN power consumption for a given topology.}},

Abstract = {{An approach for vehicle conflict analysis based on three-dimensional
   (3-D) vehicle detection is presented. Techniques for quantitative
   conflict measurements often use a point trajectory representation for
   vehicles. More accurate conflict measurement can be facilitated with a
   region-based vehicle representation instead. This paper describes a
   computer vision approach for extracting vehicle trajectories from video
   sequences. The method relied on a fusion of background subtraction and
   feature-based tracking to provide a three-dimensional (3-D) cuboid
   representation of the vehicle. Standard conflict measures, including
   time to collision and postencroachment time, were computed with the use
   of the 3-D cuboid vehicle representations. The use of these conflict
   measures was demonstrated on a challenging data set of video footage.
   Results showed that the region-based representation could provide more
   precise calculation of traffic conflict indicators compared with
   approaches based on a point representation.}},

Abstract = {{We present a Virtual Proxemics Model inspired by Hall's Proxemics Theory
   targeting wearable technology design and use. In Virtual Proxemics the
   degree of data control defines different levels of data spaces personal
   closeness including: Intimate, Personal, Social and Public in the same
   way Hall's proxemics defines these for physical distance from a person.
   This model is important for wearable technology design due to the design
   characteristics of wearables such as: attention-free, invisibility,
   closeness to the body, sensory linked, controllability and always-on
   that may compromise a wearer's ability to adequately control data either
   coming to them or being sent. We describe an experience with a wearable
   system, called `The Cat in the Map.' In this system, when strangers
   accessed the wearer's Intimate data space, she became uncomfortable,
   consistent with the model. Likewise, when her intimate relations
   accessed the same data space, she enjoyed the experience. Thus, we see
   that Virtual Proxemics Model aligns with wearer's experience of data
   control that may be suitable for the design of automated data access
   control mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{The passivity of titanium was studied in mixed sulfate-chloride
   solutions. Polarization results confirmed that Cl- ions can effectively
   facilitate the anodic passivity of Ti in sulfuric acids at 25 degrees C.
   According to Mott-Schottky analysis, and with point defect model (PDM)
   analysis, this facilitating effect can be attributed to the lower
   density and higher diffusivity of point defects within the pasive films
   formed on titanium in H2SO4 solutions with Cl- additions.
   Electrochemical impediance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements also revealed
   that films formed in 0.5 M H2SO4 + 0.5 M NaCl have a two-layer structure
   and present higher corrosion resistance compared with films formed in
   0.5 M H2SO4 which have a one-layer structure. All the results obtained
   at 75 degrees C showed that the electrochemical responses of films
   formed in 0.5 M H2SO4 with and without 0.5 M NaCl addition are similar.
   Titanium is immune to Cl ions in H2SO4 solutions at 75 degrees C. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{162}},

Abstract = {{The bifunctional oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR and OER,
   respectively) electrocatalytic activity and durability of mixed oxides
   MnO2-LaCoO3 and MnO2-Nd3IrO7, are investigated. The goal is to identify
   possible beneficial synergistic catalytic effects between the two oxides
   and to investigate the role of alkali-metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+ and Cs+)
   for promotion of electrocatalytic activity and durability. The
   combination of the two, structurally different, oxides, improves the
   bifunctional activity compared to the individual oxide components, as
   shown by either lower apparent Tafel slopes or higher exchange current
   densities for ORR and OER in 6 M KOH. Insertion of potassium ion in the
   oxide structure either by longer-term exposure to 6 M KOH or by an
   accelerated potential driven intercalation method, lowers further both
   the OER and ORR overpotentials. At constant current density of 5 mA
   cm(-2) (or 5 A g(-1) catalyst) for two hours, the OER overpotential is
   lowered by 110 mV and 152 mV due to potential driven potassium ion
   insertion in MnO2-LaCoO3 and MnO2-Nd3IrO7, respectively. For ORR, at -2
   mA cm(-2) (or -2 A g(-1) catalyst) the overpotential on MnO2-LaCoO3 is
   decreased by 75 mV. In addition, the stability of the potassium ion
   activated catalysts is also improved. The ORR activity promotion effect
   is specific to potassium compared to all other investigated alkali metal
   hydroxides (LiOH, NaOH, CsOH), whereas for OER, cesium ion also has a
   beneficial effect. The electrode kinetic results are supported by
   surface analysis showing the presence of potassium in the catalyst. (C)

Title = {{Optimal Design of Stochastic Distributed Order Linear SISO Systems Using
   Hybrid Spectral Method}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The distributed order concept, which is a parallel connection of
   fractional order integrals and derivatives taken to the infinitesimal
   limit in delta order, has been the main focus in many engineering areas
   recently. On the other hand, there are few numerical methods available
   for analyzing distributed order systems, particularly under stochastic
   forcing. This paper proposes a novel numerical scheme for analyzing the
   behavior of a distributed order linear single input single output
   control system under random forcing. The method is based on the
   operational matrix technique to handle stochastic distributed order
   systems. The existing Monte Carlo, polynomial chaos, and frequency
   methods were first adapted to the stochastic distributed order system
   for comparison. Numerical examples were used to illustrate the accuracy
   and computational efficiency of the proposed method for the analysis of
   stochastic distributed order systems. The stability of the systems under
   stochastic perturbations can also be inferred easily from the moment of
   random output obtained using the proposed method. Based on the hybrid
   spectral framework, the optimal design was elaborated on by minimizing
   the suitably defined constrained-optimization problem.}},

Abstract = {{The wall slip and melt fracture behaviour of several commercial
   polylactides (PLAs) and poly(epsilon-caprolactone), (PCLs) have been
   investigated. PLAs with molecular weights greater than a certain value
   were found to slip, with the slip velocity to increase with decrease of
   molecular weight consistent with wall slip data reported in the
   literature for other systems. The onset of melt fracture for the high
   molecular weight PLAs was found to occur at about 0.2 to 0.3 MPa,
   depending on the geometrical characteristics of the dies and independent
   of temperature. Similarly, sharkskin and gross melt fracture was
   observed for the case of PCLs depending on the molecular characteristics
   of the resins and the geometrical details of the capillary dies. It was
   also found that the addition of a small amount of PCL (typically 0.5
   wt.\%) into the PLA and vice versa is effective in eliminating and
   delaying the onset of melt fracture to higher shear rates in the
   capillary extrusion of PLA and PCL respectively. This is due to
   significant interfacial slip that occurs in the presence of PCL or PLA
   as well as to the immiscibility of the PLA/PCL blend system at all
   compositions.}},

Abstract = {{The photovoltaic performance of flexible dye-sensitized solar cells
   (DSCs) is generally degraded during bending activity which presents a
   typical flexible service condition. In this study, however, we report an
   unexpected efficiency enhancement of ca. 19\% (i.e., from 3.88\% to
   4.62\%) of flexible DSCs after repeated outward bending. The
   photovoltaic performance, electrochemical properties, mechanical
   properties and electrical properties were examined to understand the
   efficiency enhancement mechanism. It was found that the anisotropic
   evolution of particle-particle connection in the nanostructured TiO2
   film, strengthening the electron transport in the out-plane (vertical to
   the TiO2 film surface) direction and weakening the electron transport in
   the in-plane (parallel to the TiO2 film surface) direction, is
   responsible for such an abnormal efficiency enhancement. Based on the
   results, an efficiency enhancement model for the flexible DSCs under
   repeated outward bending is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{We developed an integrated microfluidic platform for instantaneous flow
   and localized temperature control. The platform consisted of a
   flow-focusing region for emulsion droplet production, a cross-junction
   region embedded with a microheater for droplet trapping and localized
   temperature control by using an active feedback control system. The
   droplet trapping performance and trapping stability were also
   investigated. We further used thermotropic liquid crystal as the droplet
   phase to demonstrate the trapping and temperature control ability of the
   microfluidic platform. Our integrated platform offers the capability of
   manipulating non-contact, instantaneous flow with localized temperature
   control, which provides valuable tools for studying transient
   interfacial dynamics and various biological and industrial processes.}},

Abstract = {{Bone density diseases such as osteoporosis affect a significant number
   of people worldwide. Lanthanide ions are functional mimics of calcium
   ions, able to substitute for Ca2+ in the bone mineral component,
   hydroxyapatite (HAP). Bone undergoes a continuous remodelling cycle and
   lanthanides can affect this cycle, exerting a positive influence on bone
   mineral. We have been engaged in efforts to find new lanthanide
   containing complexes as active agents for treatment of these diseases
   and have identified two lead compounds,
   3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethylpyridin-4(1H)-one (Hdpp) and a phosphinate-EDTA
   derivative, bis{[}{[}bis(carboxymethyl)amino]-methyl]phosphinate (H5XT).
   In this paper, we report in vivo data for the first time for the two
   lead compounds. The pharmacokinetics of La(dpp)(3) suggest the complex
   is rapidly cleared from plasma. We demonstrate that La3+ accumulates in
   the bone following IV dose of either La(dpp)(3) or La(XT) and we have
   investigated the influence of each chelating ligand on the incorporation
   of La3+ into HAP using ITC and HAP-binding studies.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to investigate the structural impact and residual
   performances of ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete
   (UHPFRC) beams. To this end, eight large-sized steel bar-reinforced
   UHPFRC beams were fabricated and tested under quasi-static and impact
   loads. Impact load was applied using a drop-weight impact test machine,
   where the incident kinetic energy and impact velocity were 4.5 kJ and
   4.2 m/s, respectively. Residual flexural performance after impact damage
   was evaluated by comparing the flexural performances of undamaged beams.
   Results demonstrated that the impact and residual capacities were
   significantly improved by including 2 vol.\% of steel fibers. The beams
   with longer steel fibers (L-f = 19.5 and 30 mm) exhibited better impact
   and residual performances including a lower maximum mid-span deflection
   and a higher residual moment capacity than those with shorter fiber (L-f
   = 13 mm). Finally, the residual capacity of UHPFRC beams was closely
   related to the maximum mid-span deflection under impact and the
   quasi-static flexural behavior of the undamaged beams.}},

Abstract = {{While adequate photon migration through the tissue of interest is
   essential for near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), the initial
   transmission of sufficient photons transcutaneously and ultimate capture
   of as many as possible returning from the interrogated tissue is also a
   requisite. Hence the relevance of both the interface between the emitter
   detector array of a NIRS instrument and the characteristics of the skin
   through which photons must migrate. We describe design components
   incorporated into a continuous wave NIRS instrument developed to monitor
   the bladder transcutaneously in subjects in rural African clinics;
   review the relevance and impact of melanin pigmentation, cutaneous hair
   and skin composition on photon migration; and report the results of
   pilot testing. Sufficient photon transmission was achieved to
   transcutaneously monitor changes in chromophore concentration in the
   bladder effectively in darkly pigmented subjects during spontaneous
   voiding. We also confirmed the importance of a new protocol to optimize
   device positioning over the bladder and employing measures to avoid
   signal contamination caused by pubic hair; both enhance the quality of
   chromophore data.}},

Abstract = {{In the traditional Duracell battery, the results obtained to date remain
   marginal in terms of cyclability. The development of the existing
   Zn-MnO2 with superior electrochemical performance for use in alkaline
   rechargeable batteries is reported. Electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD)
   was synthesized from a conventional manganese sulphate bath but having a
   unique non-ionic surfactant (Pluronic F127), and activated carbon, in an
   electrolytic cell. The surface areas and morphologies of the as-prepared
   EMDs were influenced by the presence of these novel additives in the
   solution while the X-ray data revealed that there was no noticeable
   change in the crystal orientations thus all the EMDs were structurally
   similar. The synergistic effect of the optimal ratio of surfactant to
   carbon powder produced rod-like arrays exhibiting a larger surface area,
   which facilitates ion transport for better energy storage. It is
   interesting to note that EMD deposited in the presence of F127 showed
   better cyclability whereas in the presence of carbon, although it showed
   better storage capability, it was endowed with poor efficiency when
   compared with the surfactant added sample, nevertheless the results are
   better than the existing Zn-MnO2 technology (additive free EMD).
   Therefore, both the surfactant (50 mg dm(-3)) and the activated carbon
   (5 g dm(-3)) have been added together in the bath and the resultant EMD
   exhibits a high specific capacity and an excellent cycling stability.
   Moreover, the presence of surfactant and activated carbon improved the
   discharge capacity and its retention thus making this alkaline
   technology feasible for storing renewable energy for future use. The
   synergistic effect and the mechanism involved have been discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Successful operation of sulphate-reducing bioreactors using complex
   organic materials depends on providing a balance between more easily
   degrading material that achieves reasonable kinetics and low hydraulic
   retention times, and more slowly decomposing material that sustains
   performance in the long term. In this study, two organic mixtures
   containing the same ingredients typical of bioreactors used at mine
   sites (woodchips, hay and cow manure) but with different ratios of wood
   (recalcitrant) to hay (labile) were tested in six continuous flow
   bioreactors treating synthetic mine-affected water containing 600 mg/L
   of sulphate and 15 mu g/L of selenium. The reactors were operated for
   short (5-6 months) and long (435-450 days) periods of time at the same
   hydraulic retention time of 15 days. There were no differences in the
   performance of the bioreactors in terms of sulphate-reduction over the
   short term, but the wood-rich bioreactors experienced variable and
   sometimes unreliable sulphate-reduction over the long term. Presence of
   more hay in the organic mixture was able to better sustain reliable
   performance. Production of dissolved organic compounds due to
   biodegradation within the bioreactors was detected for the first 175-230
   days, after which their depletion coincided with a crash phase observed
   in the wood-rich bioreactors only.}},

Abstract = {{The electrocatalytic behavior of flexible platinum (Pt) counter
   electrodes (CEs) is of great importance to practical applications of
   flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). In this study, the
   electrocatalytic activity of two different flexible Pt CEs with
   continuous and non-continuous Pt films, which were prepared by a
   sputtering method and an electroless deposition method, respectively,
   was studied under alternative bending conditions. The data obtained from
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements show that the
   electrocatalytic activity of the continuous Pt CEs slightly increases
   with the increasing bending cycles, due to the enhanced bare surface
   area formed from localized delamination and cracking. In contrast, the
   non- continuous Pt CEs demonstrate much higher resistance towards
   bending tests, i.e., their electrocatalytic activity remains unchanged
   even after 25 000 bending cycles. This can be attributed to the high
   strain tolerance and unique surface structure for this kind of
   non-continuous Pt CE, which helps the release of stress during the
   bending tests.}},

Abstract = {{Modern transfusion medicine relies on the safe, secure, and
   cost-effective delivery of donated red blood cells (RBCs). Once
   isolated, RBCs are suspended in a defined additive solution and stored
   in plastic blood bags in which, over time, they undergo chemical,
   physiological, and morphological changes that may have a deleterious
   impact on some patients. Regulations limit the storage period to 42 days
   and the cells do not routinely undergo analytical testing before use. In
   this study, we use Raman spectroscopy to interrogate stored RBCs and we
   identify metabolic and cell-breakdown products, such as haemoglobin and
   membrane fragments, that build-up in the blood bags as the cells age.
   Our work points the way to the development of an instrument which could
   quickly and easily assess the biochemical nature of stored RBC units
   before they are transfused.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile social networks (MSNs) have become increasingly popular in
   supporting many novel applications since emerging in the recent years.
   Their applications and services are of great interest to service
   providers, application developers, and users. This paper distinguishes
   MSNs from conventional social networks and provides a comprehensive
   survey of MSNs with regard to platforms, solutions, and designs of the
   overall system architecture. We review the popular MSN platforms and
   experimental solutions for existing MSN applications and services and
   present the dominant mobile operating systems on which MSNs are
   implemented. We then analyze and propose the overall architectural
   designs of conventional and future MSN systems. In particular, we
   present the architectural designs from two perspectives: from the client
   side to the server side, and from the wireless data transmission level
   to the terminal utilization level. We further introduce and compare the
   unique features, services, and key technologies of two generations of
   architectural designs of MSN systems. Then, we classify the existing MSN
   applications and propose one special form of MSN, i.e., vehicular social
   network, and demonstrate its unique features and challenges compared
   with common MSNs. Finally, we summarize the major challenges for
   on-going MSN research and outline possible future research directions.}},

Abstract = {{A series of molecular dynamics simulations was performed in this work to
   investigate the kinetic interaction between helium clusters and grain
   boundaries in iron. Helium cluster formation and size distributions were
   found to be markedly different in the bulk compared to the region of a
   stationary boundary. Upon reaching a steady-state cluster distribution,
   the spatial fluctuation of cluster-enriched boundaries was analyzed to
   determine the grain boundary mobility using the random walk method.
   Segregated clusters reduced the boundary mobility, the drag effect of
   clusters increasing as the bulk solute concentration increases. The drag
   effect was further rationalized by employing Cahn's solute drag model
   using the effective binding energy of He clusters and the grain boundary
   diffusivity of a single He atom, their magnitudes having been determined
   from the segregation level and from monitoring the trajectory of a
   solute atom in the investigated grain boundaries, respectively. The
   model is found to provide a satisfactory explanation of the simulation
   results in the zero velocity limit.}},

   composition of biomass greatly affect gasification performance,
   pretreatment, and handling. Primary and secondary catalysts are of key
   importance to improve the conversion and cracking of tars, and
   lime-enhanced gasification advantageously combines CO2 capture with
   gasification. These topics are covered here, including the reaction
   mechanisms and biomass characterization. Experimental research and

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient sensor device
   management scheme called sensor device personalization (SDP) for the
   Internet of things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) based on
   the IEEE 802.15.4 unslotted carrier sense multiple access with collision
   avoidance (CSMA/CA). In the IoT and WSNs with the star topology, a
   coordinator device (CD), user devices (UDs), and sensor devices (SDs)
   compose a network, and the UDs such as smart phones and tablet PCs
   manage the SDs, which consist of various sensors and communication
   modules, e.g., smart fridge, robot cleaner, heating and cooling system,
   and so on, through the CD. Thus, the CD consumes a lot of energy to
   relay packets between the UDs and the SDs and also has a longer packet
   transmission delay. Therefore, in order to reduce the energy consumption
   and packet transmission delay, in the proposed SDP scheme, the UDs
   obtain a list of SD profiles (including SDs' address information) that
   the UDs want to manage from the CD, and then the UDs and the SDs
   directly exchange control messages using the addresses of the SDs.
   Through analytical models, we show that the proposed SDP scheme
   outperforms the conventional scheme in terms of normalized throughput,
   packet transmission delay, packet loss probability, and total energy
   consumption.}},

Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{3540-3548}},
Abstract = {{This work, focusing on an implantable drug delivery system, presents the
   first prototype electrolytic pump that combines a catalytic reformer and
   a cyclically actuated mode. These features improve the release
   performance and extend the lifetime of the device. Using our platinum
   (Pt)-coated carbon fiber mesh that acts as a catalytic reforming
   element, the cyclical mode is improved because the faster recombination
   rate allows for a shorter cycling time for drug delivery. Another
   feature of our device is that it uses a solid-drug-in-reservoir (SDR)
   approach, which allows small amounts of a solid drug to be dissolved in
   human fluid, forming a reproducible drug solution for long-term
   therapies. We have conducted proof-of-principle drug delivery studies
   using such an electrolytic pump and solvent blue 38 as the drug
   substitute. These tests demonstrate power-controlled and pulsatile
   release profiles of the chemical substance, as well as the feasibility
   of this device. A drug delivery rate of 11.44 +/- 0.56 mu g min(-1) was
   achieved by using an input power of 4 mW for multiple pulses, which
   indicates the stability of our system.}},

Abstract = {{Developments in micro- and nanofluidic technologies have led to new
   kinds of cell culture and screening systems that are collectively termed
   organ-on-a-chip systems. Organ-on-a-chip systems are in vitro
   microfabricated devices that mimic dynamic interactions of in vivo
   microenvironments. In addition to existing two-dimensional and
   three-dimensional tissues, organ-on-a-chip systems can mimic the
   biomechanical and biochemical microenvironments of in vivo tissues as
   well as the interactional effects of the microenvironments on cell and
   tissue functions. Owing to those features, organ-on-a-chip systems have
   become excellent platforms for drug screening and delivery tests. In
   this review, specific examples of organ-on-a-chip devices and their
   applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery tests are

Abstract = {{The first example of a one-component precursor to star-shaped
   polyesters, and its utilization in the synthesis of previously unknown
   star-shaped poly(hydroxybutyrate)-poly(lactic acid) block copolymers, is
   reported. A series of such mono- and bis-benzyl alkoxy-bridged complexes
   were synthesized, fully characterized, and their solvent dependent
   solution structures and reactivity were examined. These complexes were
   highly active catalysts for the controlled polymerization of
   beta-butyrolactone to form poly(hydroxybutyrate) at room temperature.
   Solution studies indicate that a mononuclear propagating species formed
   in THF and that the dimer-monomer equilibrium affects the rates of BBL
   polymerization. In the presence of linear and branched alcohols, these
   complexes catalyze well-controlled immortal polymerization and
   copolymerization of beta-butyrolactone and lactide.}},

Abstract = {{Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are involved in protecting plants against
   diverse biotic and abiotic stresses. In the present study, a novel
   Cu/Zn-SOD gene (JcCu/Zn-SOD) was cloned from Jatropha curcas L.
   Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis
   revealed that JcCu/Zn-SOD is constitutively expressed in different
   tissues of J. curcas and induced under NaCl treatment. To characterize
   the function of this gene with respect to salt tolerance, the construct
   p35S:JcCu/Zn-SOD was developed and transformed into Arabidopsis using
   Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Compared with wild-type,
   transgenic plants over-expressing JcCu/ Zn-SOD showed enhanced tolerance
   to salt stress during germination, seedling establishment, and growth in
   terms of longer root, larger rosette area, and a larger number of leaves
   in addition to higher SOD activity levels under NaCl stress. In
   addition, over-expression of JcCu/Zn-SOD resulted in lower
   monodialdehyde content in transgenic Arabidopsis compared to wild-type
   plants under the same NaCl stress. Therefore, JcCu/Zn-SOD can increase a
   plant salt stress tolerance potentially by reducing oxidant injury.}},

Title = {{Multi-variate seismic demand modelling using copulas: Application to
   non-ductile reinforced concrete frame in Victoria, Canada}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{39-51}},
Abstract = {{Joint probabilistic characteristics of key structural demand variables
   due to intense ground shaking are important for quantitative seismic
   loss estimation. Current damage-loss models require inputs of multiple
   seismic demand parameters, such as maximum/residual inter-storey drift
   ratio (ISDR) and peak floor acceleration (PFA). This study extends
   current seismic demand estimation methods based on incremental dynamic
   analysis (IDA) by characterising dependence among different engineering
   demand parameters (EDP) using copulas explicitly. The developed method
   is applied to a 4-storey non-ductile reinforced concrete (RC) frame in
   Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. The developed multi-variate seismic
   demand model is integrated with a storey-based damage-loss model to
   assess the economic consequences due to different earthquake loss
   generation modes (i.e. non-collapse repairs, collapse, and demolition).
   Results obtained from this study indicate that the effects of
   multi-variate seismic demand modelling on the expected seismic loss
   ratios are significant. The critical information is the limit state
   threshold for demolition. In addition, consideration of a realistic
   dependence structure of maximum and residual inter-storey drift ratios
   can be important for seismic loss estimation as well as for
   multi-criteria seismic performance evaluation. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Rechargeable lithium air (Li-air) batteries, especially the non-aqueous
   type, are considered the most promising energy storage and conversion
   device candidates for use in future electric vehicle applications due to
   their ultrahigh energy density. The air cathode has been identified as a
   key factor affecting the overall performance of Li-air batteries. The
   current low level performance of air cathodes is the major challenge
   hindering commercial applications of Li-air batteries. In the past
   decade, a great many cathode materials, structures and fabrication
   processes have been developed and investigated with the goal of
   enhancing cathode performance. This paper reviews, the role of the
   cathode in nonaqueous Li-air batteries including the cathode reaction
   mechanisms and the properties and morphologies of cathode materials,
   followed by approaches to optimize cathode performance. The most
   recently published global progress and the main achievements in the
   field of Li-air batteries are also systematically and critically
   reviewed in terms of cathode materials, structures and fabrication
   processes, with the objective of providing some state-of-the-art
   information. Technical challenges are analyzed, and insights into future
   research directions for overcoming these development challenges of
   rechargeable non-aqueous Li-air battery cathodes are also identified in

Abstract = {{Information security has been received more and more attention for
   next-generation wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we consider the
   problem of resource management based on security satisfaction ratio with
   fairness-aware in two-way relay networks. Multiple source nodes exchange
   information with the help of relay node in the presence of an
   eavesdropper, and diverse security requirements are taken into account
   with coexistence of security users and normal users. The joint problem
   of power allocation, and subchannel pairing and allocation aims to
   maximize the security satisfaction ratio for legitimate users subject to
   limited power and subchannel constraints. We model the security resource
   management problem as a mixed integer programming problem, which is
   decomposed into three subproblems, distributed power allocation,
   distributed subchannel allocation, and distributed subchannel pairing,
   and then solved it in constraint particle swarm optimization (CPSO),
   binary CPSO (B\_CPSO), and classic Hungarian algorithm (CHA) method,
   respectively. Moreover, a suboptimal subchannel pairing algorithm is
   proposed to reduce the computational complexity compared with the CHA.
   Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Some open pits in China are severely threatened by hidden cavities under
   benches which are always inaccessible and unmapped. The first thing to
   be well considered is safe and precise cavity detection, as the
   conventional detection methods cannot output a clear cavity vision, a
   three-dimensional laser measurement system is employed to perform
   detection, which is deployed from the surface through boreholes. The
   results from the scanner demonstrated very well the detailed level of
   information that can be collected in a cavity using this method, with
   the cavities' layout under various benches being fully mapped. As
   detected cavities are always in horizontal and vaulted roof shape, two
   different theoretical calculation methods are proposed to analyze the
   cap rock stability for different roof shape. And also, the
   three-dimensional solid model generated through scanned laser data is
   used for stability numerical simulation by converting the data format
   into the one that recognized in corresponding software. Furthermore,
   acoustic emission technique is adopted to carry out long term real time
   rupture monitoring in cap rock, and four kinds of typical monitoring
   results are discussed which represent the rupture behavior in cap rock
   of unstable cavity, stable cavity, cavity with large working drill above
   and cavity beside explosion site. Thus, a complete safety evaluation
   system for such cavity will be established to ensure safe operation
   above.}},

Abstract = {{A coupled solidification-thermomechanical model is presented that
   investigates the hot tearing susceptibility of an aluminium 6061
   semisolid weld. Two key phenomena are considered: excessive deformation
   of the semisolid weld, initiating a hot tear, and the ability of the
   semisolid weld to heal the hot tear by circulation of the molten metal.
   The model consists of two major modules: weld solidification and
   thermomechanical analysis. 1) By means of a multi-scale model of
   solidification, the microstructural evolution of the semisolid weld is
   simulated in 3D. The semisolid structure, which varies as a function of
   welding parameters, is composed of solidifying grains and a network of
   micro liquid channels. The weld solidification module is utilized to
   obtain the solidification shrinkage. The size of the micro liquid
   channels is used as an indicator to assess the healing ability of the
   semisolid weld. 2) Using the finite element method, the mechanical
   interaction between the weld pool and the base metal is simulated to
   capture the transient force field deforming the semisolid weld.
   Thermomechanical stresses and shrinkage stresses are both considered in
   the analysis; the solidification contractions are extracted from the
   weld solidification module and applied to the deformation simulation as
   boundary conditions. Such an analysis enables characterization of the
   potential for excessive deformation of the weld. The outputs of the
   model are used to study the effect of welding parameters including
   welding current and speed, and also welding constraint on the hot
   cracking susceptibility of an aluminium alloy 6061 semisolid weld.}},

Abstract = {{The common practice for biopsy guidance is through transrectal
   ultrasound, with the fusion of ultrasound and MRI-based targets when
   available. However, ultrasound is only used as a guidancemodality in
   MR-targeted ultrasound-guided biopsy, even though previous work has
   shown the potential utility of ultrasound, particularly ultrasound
   vibro-elastography, as a tissue typing approach. We argue that
   multiparametric ultrasound, which includes B-mode and vibro-elastography
   images, could contain information that is not captured using
   multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and therefore play a role in refining the
   biopsy and treatment strategies. In this work, we combine mpMRI with
   multiparametric ultrasound features from registered tissue areas to
   examine the potential improvement in cancer detection. All the images
   were acquired prior to radical prostatectomy and cancer detection was
   validated based on 36 whole mount histology slides. We calculated a set
   of 24 texture features from vibro-elastography and B-mode images, and
   five features from mpMRI. Then we used recursive feature elimination
   (RFE) and sparse regression through LASSO to find an optimal set of
   features to be used for tissue classification. We show that the set of
   these selected features increases the area under ROC curve from 0.87
   with mpMRI alone to 0.94 with the selected mpMRI and multiparametric
   ultrasound features, when used with support vector machine
   classification on features extracted from peripheral zone. For features
   extracted from the whole-gland, the area under the curve was 0.75 and
   0.82 for mpMRI and mpMRI along with ultrasound, respectively. These
   preliminary results provide evidence that ultrasound and ultrasound
   vibro-elastography could be used as modalities for improved cancer
   detection in combination with MRI.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) images with diffusion
   MRI has shown great potential in prostate cancer detection. The
   parameterization of DCE images to generate cancer markers is
   traditionally performed based on pharmacokinetic modeling. However,
   pharmacokinetic models make simplistic assumptions about the tissue
   perfusion process, require the knowledge of contrast agent concentration
   in a major artery, and the modeling process is sensitive to noise and
   fitting instabilities. We address this issue by extracting features
   directly from the DCE T1-weighted time course without modeling. In this
   work, we employed a set of data-driven features generated by mapping the
   DCE T1 time course to its principal component space, along with
   diffusion MRI features to detect prostate cancer. The optimal set of DCE
   features is extracted with sparse regularized regression through a Least
   Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) model. We show that
   when our proposed features are used within the multiparametric MRI
   protocol to replace the pharmacokinetic parameters, the area under ROC
   curve is 0.91 for peripheral zone classification and 0.87 for whole
   gland classification. We were able to correctly classify 32 out of 35
   peripheral tumor areas identified in the data when the proposed features
   were used with support vector machine classification. The proposed
   feature set was used to generate cancer likelihood maps for the prostate
   gland.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular structures are one of the most important features in the
   diagnosis and assessment of skin disorders. The presence and clinical
   appearance of vascular structures in skin lesions is a discriminating
   factor among different skin diseases. In this paper, we address the
   problem of segmentation of vascular patterns in dermoscopy images. Our
   proposed method is composed of three parts. First, based on biological
   properties of human skin, we decompose the skin to melanin and
   hemoglobin component using independent component analysis of skin color
   images. The relative quantities and pure color densities of each
   component were then estimated. Subsequently, we obtain three reference
   vectors of the mean RGB values for normal skin, pigmented skin and blood
   vessels from the hemoglobin component by averaging over 100000 pixels of
   each group outlined by an expert. Based on the Euclidean distance
   thresholding, we generate a mask image that extracts the red regions of
   the skin. Finally, Frangi measure was applied to the extracted red areas
   to segment the tubular structures. Finally, Otsu's thresholding was
   applied to segment the vascular structures and get a binary vessel mask
   image. The algorithm was implemented on a set of 50 dermoscopy images.
   In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we have artificially
   extended some of the existing vessels in our dermoscopy data set and
   evaluated the performance of the algorithm to segment the newly added
   vessel pixels. A sensitivity of 95\% and specificity of 87\% were
   achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Prostate cancer is the most prevalently diagnosed and the second cause
   of cancer-related death in North American men. Several approaches have
   been proposed to augment detection of prostate cancer using different

   approaches have been the subject of several recent studies. This paper
   presents the results of a feasibility study on differentiating between
   lower and higher grade prostate cancer using ultrasound RF time series
   data. We also propose new spectral features of RF time series to
   highlight aggressive prostate cancer in small ROIs of size 1 mm x 1 mm
   in a cohort of 19 ex vivo specimens of human prostate tissue. In
   leave-one-patient-out cross-validation strategy, an area under

Abstract = {{Current developments on enhancing our smart living experience are
   leveraging the increased interest for novel systems that can be
   compatible with foldable, wrinkled, wavy and complex geometries and
   surfaces, and thus become truly ubiquitous and easy to deploy.
   Therefore, relying on innovative structural designs we have been able to
   reconfigure the physical form of various materials, to achieve
   remarkable mechanical flexibility and stretchability, which provides us
   with the perfect platform to develop enhanced electronic systems for
   application in entertainment, healthcare, fitness and wellness, military
   and manufacturing industry. Based on these novel structural designs we
   have developed a silicon-based network of hexagonal islands connected
   through double-spiral springs, forming an ultra-stretchable (similar to
   1000\%) array for full compliance to highly asymmetric shapes and
   surfaces, as well as a serpentine design used to show an
   ultra-stretchable (similar to 800\%) and flexible, spatially
   reconfigurable, mobile, metallic thin film copper (Cu)-based,
   body-integrated and non-invasive thermal heater with wireless
   controlling capability, reusability, heating-adaptability and
   affordability due to low-cost complementary metal oxide semiconductor
   (CMOS)-compatible integration.}},

Abstract = {{Highly dispersed 50 wt\% Pt nanoparticles supported on carbon were
   successfully synthesized via a simple modified polyol method using
   different solvent volume ratios (ethylene glycol/water). The control of
   water proportion is found to have an important effect on the
   physicochemical properties of the in-house synthesized Pt/C catalysts.
   The structural and electrochemical characterizations reveal that the
   addition of water not only favors the homogeneous distribution of Pt
   particles with reduced particle size but also improves the
   electrocatalytic properties. In particular, at an optimum volume ratio
   of ethylene glycol to water of 45 : 23 among all studied ratios, the TEM
   images indicate that the as-synthesized Pt/C catalyst has a minimum
   particle size of 2.2 +/- 0.5 nm, which is close to that of the
   commercial 46.6 wt\% Pt/TKK catalyst, while the electrochemical
   measurements disclose electrochemical active surface areas and oxygen
   reduction reaction activity comparable to those of the commercial 46.6
   wt\% Pt/TKK catalyst. The simplicity of the synthesis process associated
   with the ease of the filtering step due to the addition of water has
   significant implications for its practical application in large scale
   production of Pt/C catalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel
   cells.}},

Abstract = {{In out-of-order (OoO) processors, speculative execution with high branch
   prediction accuracy is employed to achieve good single thread
   performance. In these processors the branch prediction unit tables (BPU)
   are accessed in parallel with the instruction cache before it is known
   whether a fetch group contains branch instructions. For integer
   applications, we find 85 percent of BPU lookups are done for non-branch
   operations and of the remaining lookups, 42 percent are done for highly
   biased branches that can be predicted statically with high accuracy. We
   evaluate on-demand branch prediction (ODBP), a novel technique that uses
   compiler generated hints to identify those instructions that can be more
   accurately predicted statically to eliminate unnecessary BPU lookups. We
   evaluate an implementation of ODBP that combines static and dynamic
   branch prediction. For a four wide superscalar processor, ODBP delivers
   as much as 9 percent improvement in average energy-delay (ED) product, 7
   percent core average energy saving, and 3 percent speedup. ODBP also
   enables the use of large BPU's for a given power budget.}},

   Our results show that the strain-engineered GeH monolayer captures a
   broad range of the solar spectrum. Moreover, photogenerated
   electron-hole pairs can be efficiently separated in the GeH/graphene
   heterojunction by formation of a Schottky barrier. Comparing to a pure
   GeH monolayer, the hybrid GeH/graphene complex displays an enhanced

Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we follow a healthy patient volunteer with daily breast
   scans using our time-domain microwave radar monitoring system. Over the
   course of a 28-day period, which corresponds to the time frame of the
   menstrual cycle, we perform a total of 54 scans per breast. Our breast
   monitoring system uses a time-domain, multistatic radar approach with 16
   wideband sensors. We first directly compare the recorded signals for
   each scan, then examine reconstructed images for each breast, and
   compare how they vary day by day. Images are compared using the
   structural similarity index, and based on their pixel intensities. We
   further estimate the daily average tissue permittivity for each breast.
   The results demonstrate that our system is able to detect variations in
   the breast tissues over the monthly period; however, we estimate that
   the quality of these changes differs from those that would appear due to
   a malignant growth. The tissue changes seen in this trial are not likely
   to affect the outcome of long-term monitoring for the purpose of
   abnormality detection; however, measurements on a larger population are
   required before wider conclusions can be made.}},

   hydrogen evolution reaction with a small Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1),

Abstract = {{Trilayer actuators enable large mechanical amplification, but at the
   expense of force. Thicker trilayers can generate more force, but
   displacement drops. Ideally of course a combination of high force and
   large displacement is desirable. In this work we explore the stacking of
   trilayers driven by conducting polymers in order to combine large force
   and reasonable deflection. Trilayer actuators operating in air are
   simulated using the finite element method. Force generated and the
   maximum beam deflection of individual and multiple stacked trilayers are
   studied in terms of the interface condition of the neighboring layers
   and the length of the auxiliary trilayer. The best performance is
   obtained when trilayers are able to slide with respect to each other so
   forces can add without impeding displacement. This case will require low
   friction and uniformity among the trilayers. Bonding of stacked
   trilayers along their entire length increases force, but dramatically
   reduces displacement. An alternative which leads to moderate
   displacements with increased force is the use of a long and a short
   trilayer that are bonded.}},

Abstract = {{Components in automotive and aerospace applications require a wide
   temperature range of operation. Newly discovered thermally active
   Baughman muscle potentially provides affordable and viable solutions for
   driving mechanical devices by heating them from room temperature, but
   little is known about their operation below room temperature. We study
   the mechanical behavior of nylon coil actuators by testing elastic
   modulus and by investigating tensile stroke as a function of
   temperature. Loads that range from 35 MPa to 155 MPa were applied. For
   the nylon used and the coiling conditions, active thermal contraction
   totals 19.5 \% when the temperature is raised from -40 degrees C to 160
   degrees C. The thermal contraction observed from -40 degrees C to 20
   degrees C is only similar to 2 \%, whereas between 100 and 160 degrees C
   the contraction is 10 \%. A marked increase in thermal contraction is
   occurs in the vicinity of the glass transition temperature (similar to
   45 degrees C). The elastic modulus drops as temperature increases, from
   similar to 155 MPa at -40 degrees C to 35 MPa at 200 degrees C.
   Interestingly the drop in active contraction with increasing load is
   small and much less than might be expected given the temperature
   dependence of modulus.}},

Abstract = {{In muscle variable impedance and ability to recruit fibers as needed
   helps enable actions such as walking and catching. A new biomimetic
   structure of nylon actuator is presented that imitates the human pennate
   muscle in structure, ability to vary stiffness and the ability to
   increase force by recruiting additional fibers. The actuator consists of
   16 silver coated nylon coiled fibers attached to a central tendon at an
   angle of 20 degrees. Each nylon coil produces 20 MPa of stress at
   constant length and nearly 20\% strain at fixed load. Fibers are
   individually switched ON and OFF using transistors so that each element
   can be recruited, and the stiffness varied. The amount of input power is
   controlled with pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques. It is observed
   that the spring constant of the pennate structure varies from that of
   its passive state, 503 N/m and a resonance frequency of 1.4 Hz, to 1480
   N/m with resonance frequency of 3.1 Hz in the active state where all the
   fibers are switched on under a 25 N load. Stiffness can be varied by a
   factor of 9.}},

Abstract = {{A polyurethane hydrogel based touch sensor with high transparency and
   conformability is demonstrated. Polyurethane hydrogels swollen with
   various electrolytes were compressed at a pressure of 30 kPa, simulating
   a fingertap on a conventional touch screen device. Unlike ionic polymer
   metal composite and conducting polymer trilayer sensors, where
   electrodes render the sensors opaque and relatively rigid, the
   electrodes used in this work are metal wires or strips, separated from
   each other by regions of transparent film, enabling transparency and
   compliance. The voltages and currents observed when the perturbation is
   above one electrode are on the order of 10(-2) V and 10(-7) A, relative
   to a second electrode that is approximately 1 cm away. The sign of
   voltage and current signals detected from perturbations made between
   electrodes is determined by relative proximity to each electrode, and
   the magnitude appears to decrease with increasing distance from the
   electrodes. These observations suggest that it may be possible to
   discriminate the location of touch based on signals transmitted to the
   edges of an ionically conductive film. A model to describe the
   inhomogeneous ionic distribution and predict the resultant voltage and
   current is presented to qualitatively explain the sensing, based on the
   Donnan potential.}},

Abstract = {{Erroneous human arm motion leads to inaccuracy in tool positioning which
   often affects the quality of many precision manipulation tasks.
   Variability in tool endpoints during mechanical interactions among
   humans, tools, and environments can be reduced by bracing strategies;
   therefore, such a cost-effective approach may increase accuracy and
   reproducibility in human arm movements and thus prove useful in
   improving performance of selected interactive tasks. Although a great
   number of works is found in the literature related to performance
   augmentation of braced robotic manipulators, only a few studies are
   found on bracing strategies for performing interactive tasks and on
   analogies to human manipulation. In this paper, a method for predicting
   bracing properties is proposed for single degree of freedom interactive
   task to improve performance. To reflect real workplace scenarios, models
   of the human impedance, the brace, and the contact of the interaction
   are represented and used to predict the quality of the executed task.
   The task execution model intended to predict real-life performance in
   both free arm and braced conditions are then used to estimate the brace
   properties to augment performance of the representative task. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Forming process of engineering materials is often simulated using
   numerical/computer tools such as Finite Element methods. Although this
   type of simulation has a long history in the metal forming and polymer
   industries, it is not as widely established when it comes to high
   performance composites. This is due to the fact that the mechanical
   behaviour of most composites is different from monolithic materials and
   extended research on their physical and mechanical behaviours is still
   under development. Moreover, among different types of composites,
   textile composites because of their multi-scale nature and fibrous
   architecture have more sources of embedded uncertainties. In this
   article, selected sources of uncertainties in the woven fabric type of
   textile reinforcements, their manufacturing and simulation process are
   discussed. In addition, applications of statistical techniques for their
   characterization as well as sensitivity analysis on the effect of
   uncertainties on their overall behavior are addressed. Subsequently, a
   combination of finite element simulation and statistical data analysis
   is suggested to estimate, and eventually to control, the performance
   variability in the formed part based on uncertainties observed in the
   raw material, process, and simulation itself.}},

Abstract = {{Lignin, the second most abundant native polymer on Earth, can be a major
   source of renewable materials. This low cost material has potential in
   composites as a matrix and/or reinforcement in resin, filler, fibre, and
   aerogel forms.
   In the resin form, lignin and its derivatives can be used to make
   coatings, coupling agents, and composites, and can form stable mixtures.
   Some of the applications, for instance, can be in the wood industry,
   civil and electrical engineering.
   In the fibre form, lignin, a promising precursor candidate for
   manufacturing carbon fibre, can replace petroleum based precursors, such
   as polyacrylonitrile and pitch (petroleum or coal). The lignin-based
   composite nanofibres reinforced by carbon nanotube/nanocrystalline
   cellulose can be used for automobile and structural applications. In
   addition, the fibre can be functionalized by embedded nanoparticles
   and/or surface modification. The concept of multifunctional carbon
   nanofibre can be extended to a wide range of advanced applications in
   the energy, electronic, and environmental sectors.
   In the aerogel form, lignin-based carbon composites, due to their unique
   network structure, low density and high surface area, are promising
   materials as electrodes for hydrogen and electrical storage,
   supercapacitors, thermal and acoustic insulators, adsorbents, catalyst
   supports and sensors.}},

   behavior with effective piezoelectric coefficient of 2-3 pC/N. The

Abstract = {{There is a desire in aerospace industry to replace traditional autoclave
   processing methods with lower cost out-of-autoclave (OOA) methods such
   as OOA processing of prepregs. However, high porosity is a challenge in
   this process. One of the main means of void reduction in OOA processing
   of prepregs is reducing the gas pressure inside voids by gas transport.
   It is therefore important to understand the gas permeability in a
   laminate throughout the process. A key problem is that when the resin is
   soft, sending gas through this soft porous structure alters the
   microstructure and thereby the gas permeability. This study investigates
   the effect of the measurement technique on microstructure and
   permeability of the test sample both in-plane and through thickness.
   Permeability measurements in continuous and interrupted modes are
   performed and the void morphology of the test samples is characterized
   using optical microscopy. It is shown that the porous structure and the
   permeability are affected by permeability measurements when taken
   continuously during the low viscosity region as it creates an
   interconnected network of inter-laminar voids. This effect can be
   reduced by discrete measurements of permeability, which is more
   representative of the situation during actual processing conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in self-interference cancellation techniques enable
   in-band full-duplex wireless systems, which transmit and receive
   simultaneously in the same frequency band with high spectrum efficiency.
   As a typical application of in-band full-duplex wireless, in-band
   full-duplex relaying (FDR) is a promising technology to integrate the
   merits of in-band full-duplex wireless and relaying technology. However,
   several significant research challenges remain to be addressed before
   its widespread deployment, including small-size full-duplex device
   design, channel modeling and estimation, cross-layer/joint resource
   management, interference management, security, etc. In this paper, we
   provide a brief survey on some of the works that have already been done
   for in-band FDR, and discuss the related research issues and challenges.
   We identify several important aspects of in-band FDR: basics, enabling
   technologies, information-theoretical performance analysis, key design
   issues and challenges. Finally, we also explore some broader
   perspectives for in-band FDR.}},

Abstract = {{During papermaking pulp suspension drains through the forming fabric to
   create a wet pulp mat. A series of experiments were conducted to
   investigate the small-scale variation in fines distribution caused by
   the forming fabric's weave structure. Pulp fines are first separated
   from the pulp fibers and are then stained with fluorescent dye. The
   fibers and fines are recombined and handsheets are made on two different
   fabrics under different drainage conditions. The effect of retention
   aids on the fines distribution is also observed.
   The fines distribution is found to be strongly correlated with the
   fabric weave structure. The area of paper formed over knuckles in the
   forming fabric contained the least amount of fines mass, paper formed
   over the threads contained more, and the paper formed over openings in
   the fabric had the highest fines concentration. The variations are
   higher on the wire side of the sheet and become more pronounced under
   the vacuum drainage condition as compared with gravity drainage. It is
   also observed that addition of retention aids improves the uniformity of
   the fines distribution. Paper samples made with an industrial forming
   fabric showed the same distribution trends as over a coarse fabric, but
   displayed an improved uniformity of the fines. These fines distribution
   variations are attributed to the variable drainage velocity through the
   fabric structure.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Prior research indicates the epidermal pigment layer of
   human skin (Melanin) has a significant absorption coefficient in the
   near infra-red (NIR) region; hence attenuation of light in vivo is a
   potential confounder for NIR spectroscopy (NIRS). A NIRS method
   developed for transcutaneous evaluation of bladder function is being
   investigated as a means of improving the burden of bladder disease in
   sub-Saharan Africa. This required development of a simple wireless NIRS
   device suitable for use as a screening tool in patients with pigmented
   skin where the NIR light emitted would penetrate through the epidermal
   pigment layer and return in sufficient quantity to provide effective
   monitoring.
   Methods: Two healthy subjects, one with pigmented skin and one with fair
   skin, were monitored as they voided spontaneously using the prototype
   transcutaneous NIRS device positioned over the bladder. The device was a
   self-contained wireless unit with light emitting diodes (wavelengths 760
   and 850 nanometres) and interoptode distance of 4cm. The raw optical
   data were transmitted to a laptop where graphs of chromophore change
   were generated with proprietary software and compared between the
   subjects and with prior data from asymptomatic subjects.
   Results: Serial monitoring was successful in both subjects. Voiding
   volumes varied between 350 and 380 cc. In each subject the patterns of
   chromophore change, trend and magnitude of change were similar and
   matched the physiologic increase in total and oxygenated hemoglobin
   recognized to occur in normal bladder contraction during voiding.
   Conclusions: Skin pigmentation does not compromise the ability of
   transcutaneous NIRS to interrogate physiologic change in the bladder
   during bladder contraction in healthy subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging complicated structures with photoacoustic (PA) modality when the
   field of view is limited can result in significant imaging artifacts or
   missing structures. Approaches to solve this problem include new
   reconstruction algorithms and specific transducer structures, such as
   hemi-spherical transducer arrays for breast cancer detection. However,
   most existing PA imaging techniques require either full-view complete
   projection data collection or complex and computationally-intensive
   reconstructions. Such approaches are not only time-consuming but also
   unsuitable for many clinical applications, because most clinical imaging
   hardware is constrained to limited reconstruction angles. In this paper,
   we present a method of using two commercial linear array transducers at
   different orientations to increase the view angle and thus improve the
   reconstruction of PA imaging. The method involves a two-step process.
   First, a calibration phantom is imaged to calibrate the relative
   position of these two linear transducers. Second, two PA images are
   obtained by a simple back projection algorithm and these images are
   registered using the information from the calibration process. The final
   registered image contains more detailed structures without the
   requirements of a specialized transducer or long processing time.
   Experimental results show that this method has the potential to provide
   good image quality using standard low-cost transducers.}},

Abstract = {{We examined and established the potential of ex-vivo confocal
   fluorescence microscopy for differentiating between normal cervical
   tissue, low grade Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN1), and high
   grade CIN (CIN2 and CIN3). Our objectives were to i) use Quantitative
   Tissue Phenotype (QTP) analysis to quantify nuclear and cellular
   morphology and tissue architecture in confocal microscopic images of
   fresh cervical biopsies and ii) determine the accuracy of high grade CIN
   detection via confocal microscopy. Cervical biopsy specimens of
   colposcopically normal and abnormal tissues obtained from 15 patients
   were evaluated by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Confocal images were
   analyzed and about 200 morphological and architectural features were
   calculated at the nuclear, cellular, and tissue level. For the purpose
   of this study, we used four features to delineate disease grade
   including nuclear size, cell density, estimated nuclear-cytoplasmic
   (ENC) ratio, and the average of three nearest Delaunay neighbors
   distance (3NDND). Our preliminary results showed ENC ratio and 3NDND
   correlated well with histopathological diagnosis. The Spearman
   correlation coefficient between each of these two features and the
   histopathological diagnosis was higher than the correlation coefficient
   between colposcopic appearance and histopathological diagnosis.
   Sensitivity and specificity of ENC ratio for detecting high grade CIN
   were both equal to 100\%. QTP analysis of fluorescence confocal images
   shows the potential to discriminate high grade CIN from low grade CIN
   and normal tissues. This approach could be used to help clinicians
   identify HGSILs in clinical settings.}},

Abstract = {{Percutaneous treatment of scaphoid fractures has found increasing
   interest in recent years as it promises to minimize soft-tissue damage,
   and minimizes the risk of infections and the loss of the joint
   stability. However, as this procedure is mostly performed on 2D
   fluoroscopic images, the accurate localization of the scaphoid bone for
   fracture fixation renders extremely challenging. In this work, we thus
   propose the integration of a statistical wrist model with 3D
   intraoperative ultrasound for accurate localization of the scaphoid
   bone. We utilize a previously developed statistical wrist model and
   register it to bone surfaces in ultrasound images using a probabilistic
   approach that involves expectation-maximization. We utilize local phase
   symmetry to detect features in noisy ultrasound images; in addition, we
   use shadow information in ultrasound images to enhance and set apart
   bone from other features. Feasibility experiments are performed by
   registering the wrist model to 3D ultrasound volumes of two different
   wrists at two different wrist positions. And the result indicates a
   potential of the proposed technique for localization of the scaphoid
   bone in ultrasound images.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new needle detection technique for ultrasound
   guided interventions based on the spectral properties of small
   displacements arising from hand tremour or intentional motion. In a
   block-based approach, the displacement map is computed for each block of
   interest versus a reference frame, using an optical flow technique. To
   compute the flow parameters, the Lucas-Kanade approach is used in a
   multiresolution and regularized form. A least-squares fit is used to
   estimate the flow parameters from the overdetermined system of spatial
   and temporal gradients. Lateral and axial components of the displacement
   are obtained for each block of interest at consecutive frames.
   Magnitude-squared spectral coherency is derived between the median
   displacements of the reference block and each block of interest, to
   determine the spectral correlation. In vivo images were obtained from
   the tissue near the abdominal aorta to capture the extreme intrinsic
   body motion and insertion images were captured from a tissue-mimicking
   agar phantom. According to the analysis, both the involuntary and
   intentional movement of the needle produces coherent displacement with
   respect to a reference window near the insertion site. Intrinsic body
   motion also produces coherent displacement with respect to a reference
   window in the tissue; however, the coherency spectra of intrinsic and
   needle motion are distinguishable spectrally. Blocks with high spectral
   coherency at high frequencies are selected, estimating a channel for
   needle trajectory. The needle trajectory is detected from locally
   thresholded absolute displacement map within the initial estimate.
   Experimental results show the RMS localization accuracy of 1.0 mm, 0.7
   mm, and 0.5 mm for hand tremour, vibrational and rotational needle
   movements, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{In low-dose prostate brachytherapy treatment, a large number of
   radioactive seeds is implanted in and adjacent to the prostate gland.
   Planning of this treatment involves the determination of a Planning
   Target Volume (PTV), followed by defining the optimal number of seeds,
   needles and their coordinates for implantation. The two major planning
   tasks, i.e. PTV determination and seed definition, are associated with
   inter- and intra-expert variability. Moreover, since these two steps are
   performed in sequence, the variability is accumulated in the overall
   treatment plan. In this paper, we introduce a model based on a data
   fusion technique that enables joint determination of PTV and the minimum
   Prescribed Isodose (mPD) map. The model captures the correlation between
   different information modalities consisting of transrectal ultrasound
   (TRUS) volumes, PTV and isodose contours. We take advantage of joint
   Independent Component Analysis (jICA) as a linear decomposition
   technique to obtain a set of joint components that optimally describe
   such correlation. We perform a component stability analysis to generate
   a model with stable parameters that predicts the PTV and isodose
   contours solely based on a new patient TRUS volume. We propose a
   framework for both modeling and prediction processes and evaluate it on
   a dataset of 60 brachytherapy treatment records. We show PTV prediction
   error of 10.02 +/- 4.5\% and the V100 isodose overlap of 97 +/- 3.55\%
   with respect to the clinical gold standard.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an automatic method for vertebra localization,
   labeling, and segmentation in multi-slice Magnetic Resonance (MR)
   images. Prior work in this area on MR images mostly requires user
   interaction while our method is fully automatic. Cubic intensity-based
   features are extracted from image voxels. A deep learning approach is
   used for simultaneous localization and identification of vertebrae. The
   localized points are refined by local thresholding in the region of the
   detected vertebral column. Thereafter, a statistical multi-vertebrae
   model is initialized on the localized vertebrae. An iterative
   Expectation Maximization technique is used to register the vertebral
   body of the model to the image edges and obtain a segmentation of the
   lumbar vertebral bodies. The method is evaluated by applying to nine
   volumetric MR images of the spine. The results demonstrate 100\%
   vertebra identification and a mean surface error of below 2.8 mm for 3D
   segmentation. Computation time is less than three minutes per
   high-resolution volumetric image.}},

Abstract = {{At early stage of cancer, a small number of circulating tumor cells
   (CTCs) appear in the blood circulation. Thus, early detection of
   malignant circulating tumor cells has great significance for timely
   treatment to reduce the cancer death rate. We have developed an in vivo
   photoacoustic flow cytometry (PAFC) to monitor the metastatic process of
   CTCs and record the signals from target cells. Information of target
   cells which is helpful to the early therapy would be obtained through
   analyzing and processing the signals. The raw signal detected from
   target cells often contains some noise caused by electronic devices,
   such as background noise and thermal noise. We choose the Wavelet
   denoising method to effectively distinguish the target signal from
   background noise. Processing in time domain and frequency domain would
   be combined to analyze the signal after denoising. This algorithm
   contains time domain filter and frequency transformation. The frequency
   spectrum image of the signal contains distinctive features that can be
   used to analyze the property of target cells or particles. The PAFC
   technique can detect signals from circulating tumor cells or other
   particles. The processing methods have a great potential for analyzing
   signals accurately and rapidly.}},

Abstract = {{The enumeration and capture of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are
   potentially of great clinical value as they offer a non-invasive means
   to access tumor materials to diagnose disease and monitor treatment
   efficacy. Conventional immunoenrichment of CTCs may fail to capture
   cells with low surface antigen expression. Micropore filtration presents
   a compelling label-free alternative that enriches CTCs using their
   biophysical rather than biochemical characteristics. However, this
   strategy is prone to clogging of the filter microstructure, which
   dramatically reduces the selectivity after processing large numbers of
   cells. Here, we use the resettable cell trap (RCT) mechanism to separate
   cells based on their size and deformability using an adjustable aperture
   that can be periodically cleared to prevent clogging. After separation,
   the output sample is stained and analyzed using multi-spectral analysis,
   which provides a more sensitive and unambiguous method to identify CTC
   biomarkers than traditional immunofluorescence. We tested the RCT device
   using blood samples obtained from 22 patients with metastatic
   castrate-resistant prostate cancer while comparing the results with the
   established CellSearch (R) system. The RCT mechanism was able to capture
   >= 5 CTCs in 18/22 (82\%) patients with a mean count of 257 in 7.5 ml of
   whole blood, while the CellSearch system found >= 5 CTCs in 9/22 (41\%)
   patients with a mean count of 25. The similar to 10x improvement in the
   CTC capture rate provides significantly more materials for subsequent
   analysis of these cells such as immunofluorescence, propagation by
   tissue culture, and genetic profiling.}},

Abstract = {{The key characteristics of an air filter-flow resistance and filtration
   efficiency-are strongly affected by captured particles. The impact of
   exposing loaded heating, ventilating, and air conditioning air filters
   to a relative humidity (RH) other than that experienced during loading
   is investigated to develop an understanding of the role of RH throughout
   filter operation. Flat sheets of commercial filter media were loaded
   with hygroscopic, non-hygroscopic, or a mixture of particles in a
   laboratory apparatus. When filters loaded with hygroscopic particles in
   dry air were exposed to an elevated RH of 40\%, the flow resistance
   reduced by up to 47\%, depending on the filter being tested.
   Investigation of filter efficiency before and after changes in RH in the
   same samples shows reductions of up to 11 percentage points in the
   130-nm size range. Further increasing RH causes additional drops in flow
   resistance and efficiency whereas reverting back to a lower humidity
   does not change the filter characteristics. The irreversibility of the
   particle-loaded filter characteristics implies that the RH increases are
   associated with an irreversible change in the particle structure. The
   response to humidity was reduced if an aerosol mixture of hygroscopic
   and non-hygroscopic particles is used. Exposure of filters loaded with
   only non-hygroscopic particles does not show the same dependence on RH.
   Small increases in growth factor for RH changes below deliquescence,
   causing morphological changes in captured particle aggregates, is a
   potential explanation for the changes observed.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluation of the proper and appropriate hazardous industrial waste
   transportation firm (HIWTF) is a vital problem for hazardous waste
   generators as hazardous and toxic industrial wastes may cause extensive
   damage to both humans and the environment when improperly handled. In
   general, many conflicting factors affect the appropriate HIWTF selection
   problem which adheres to uncertain and imprecise data. In this paper, a
   simple, systematic and logical scientific approach is structured to
   evaluate HIWTF through integrating fuzzy analytical hierarchy process
   (FAHP) with the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment
   Evaluations (PROMETHEE). The proposed decision-making approach takes
   advantage of the synergy between these two well-known multi-criteria
   decision-making (MCDM) methods in which their strong and weak points are
   detected and a ranking is provided which facilitates the final selection
   for the decision maker. To accredit the proposed model, it is
   implemented in an automotive battery manufacturing company in
   Bangladesh.}},

Abstract = {{The use of centrifugal gravity concentration in the closed-grinding
   circuit of a gold-containing massive sulphide ore was tested on
   classifier underflow and overflow. A continuous Knelson CVD6 was
   retrofitted to the hydrocyclone underflow for recovery of Au and Pb at a
   coarser feed size. The objective of treatment of overflow was recovering
   unliberated Au prior to flotation. The tests were performed in actual
   operating conditions at Nyrstar's Myra Falls Mine. The results of the
   tests on the cyclone underflow revealed that both liberated and
   unliberated Au and Pb were recovered by the Centrifugal Variable
   Discharge (CVD) concentrator. Concentrate grades <60g/Mg Au were
   attainable at a more than 20\% recovery. This application also allowed
   early and increased Pb recovery before it became gravity unrecoverable
   by over-grinding. Other benefits included capturing middlings for
   regrinding as well as potential coarser grinding and increase in mill
   throughput. A coarse grind also corresponds to a reduction in
   deformation of Au-particles, and is beneficial for increased Au recovery
   in downstream processing. Treatment of cyclone overflow by the CVD also
   provided favourable results. The outcomes included capturing unliberated
   gold prior to flotation and potentially reducing pumping requirements
   and reagent consumption. A comparison of the metallurgical performances
   showed that CVD application on classifier underflow was more effective.
   The CVD was capable of recovering unliberated gold in sulphides and
   performed better at a coarser particle size. Therefore, when used with
   the grinding circuit, a coarser grind can be applied and the CVD could
   be used to reject gangue at a coarser size.}},

Abstract = {{From natural evolution, nacre, a biogenic organic-inorganic composite,

   Its basic building block, the individual nacre tablet, assumes an

   hence provide essential information for the pursuit of high-performance
   artificial composites. Here, the nanostructure inside the individual
   nacre tablet (Pinctada maxima) was investigated using transmission
   electron microscopy techniques. Results show that organic matter is
   trapped inside the tablet in both an islet-like and sheet-like manner.
   More interestingly, the crystal structure of aragonite scaffold is
   continuous and homodromous throughout the whole tablet even in this
   case. A biomineralization mechanism of the tablet is discussed based on
   this finding.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional (3D) topological Dirac semimetal (TDSM) Cd3As2 has
   very recently been discovered, which can be turned into a variety of
   quantum phases by breaking either time reversal symmetry or inversion
   symmetry. Here, we present a density functional theory (DFT) study to
   systematically investigate the doping effects of 3d transition-metal
   (TM) atoms (Ti:Cu) in Cd3As2. The results reveal that the introduced 3d
   TMs lower the symmetries of the system, resulting in massive Dirac
   fermions with gap opening at the Dirac point. The substitution of Cr
   atoms could tailor Cd3As2 to a ferromagnetic half-metal due to the
   effective p-d exchange. The Monte Carlo simulations predict that the
   Curie temperature (T-c) of Cr-Cd3As2 is up to room temperature,
   suggesting powerful potential for further spintronic applications.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Pages = {{9984-9990}},
Abstract = {{Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) prevent ice growth by binding to a specific
   ice plane. Some AFPs have been found to inhibit the formation of gas
   hydrates which are a serious safety and operational challenge for the
   oil and gas industry. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to
   determine the mechanism of action of the winter flounder AFP (wf-AFP) in
   inhibiting methane hydrate growth. The wf-AFP adsorbs onto the methane
   hydrate surface via cooperative binding of a set of hydrophobic methyl
   pendant groups to the empty half-cages at the hydrate/water interface.
   Each binding set is composed of the methyl side chain of threonine and
   two alanine residues, four and seven places further down in the sequence
   of the protein. Understanding the principle of action of AFPs can lead
   to the rational design of green hydrate inhibitor molecules with
   potential superior performance.}},

Title = {{Toward enhanced hydrogen generation from water using oxygen permeating
   LCF membranes}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{10093-10107}},
Abstract = {{Hydrogen production from water thermolysis can be enhanced by the use of
   perovskite-type mixed ionic and electronic conducting (MIEC) membranes,
   through which oxygen permeation is driven by a chemical potential
   gradient. In this work, water thermolysis experiments were performed
   using 0.9 mm thick La0.9Ca0.1FeO3-delta (LCF-91) perovskite membranes at
   990 degrees C in a lab-scale button-cell reactor. We examined the
   effects of the operating conditions such as the gas species
   concentrations and flow rates on the feed and sweep sides on the water
   thermolysis rate and oxygen flux. A single step reaction mechanism is
   proposed for surface reactions, and three-resistance permeation models
   are derived. Results show that water thermolysis is facilitated by the
   LCF-91 membrane especially when a fuel is added to the sweep gas.
   Increasing the gas flow rate and water concentration on the feed side or
   the hydrogen concentration on the sweep side enhances the hydrogen
   production rate. In this work, hydrogen is used as the fuel by
   construction, so that a single-step surface reaction mechanism can be
   developed and water thermolysis rate parameters can be derived. Both
   surface reaction rate parameters for oxygen incorporation/dissociation
   and hydrogen-oxygen reactions are fitted at 990 degrees C. We compare
   the oxygen fluxes in water thermolysis and air separation experiments,
   and identify different limiting steps in the processes involving various
   oxygen sources and sweep gases for this 0.9 mm thick LCF-91 membrane. In
   the air feed-inert sweep case, the bulk diffusion and sweep side surface
   reaction are the two limiting steps. In the water feed-inert sweep case,
   surface reaction on the feed side dominates the oxygen permeation
   process. Yet in the water feed-fuel sweep case, surface reactions on
   both the feed and sweep sides are rate determining when hydrogen
   concentration in the sweep side is in the range of 1-5 vol\%.
   Furthermore, long term studies show that the surface morphology changes
   and silica impurities have little impact on the oxygen flux for either
   water thermolysis or air separation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents theoretical analysis and verification of a micro
   vibration energy harvester based on magnetic levitation using
   diamagnetic structures. The analysis verifies that diamagnetic material
   experiences anti-magnetic force in magnetic field and that it can be
   used for stable magnetic levitation. This study proposes a novel design
   that is comprised of a lifting permanent magnet, an upper pyrolytic
   graphite sheet, a floating permanent magnet, and a lower pyrolytic
   graphite sheet, with copper spiral coils formed on the two pyrolytic
   graphite sheets. The gravity of the floating permanent magnet is
   balanced by the attractive force between the lifting and floating
   magnets. The diamagnetic force exerted on the levitated magnet by the
   two pyrolytic graphite sheets serves as a restoring force, forcing the
   floating permanent magnet return to the equilibrium position. Through
   finite element analysis, the maximum movable range of the floating
   magnet is defined to be 1.3 mm. Comparative analysis of the attractive
   magnetic force and the anti-magnetic force is performed to determine the
   key parameters of the structure. The characteristics of vertical and
   horizontal motion of the magnet are also studied in detail. The results
   validate the effectiveness of the proposed design for harvesting
   multi-dimensional, low-frequency vibration energy. The diamagnetic
   levitation mechanism without conventional mechanical suspensions
   eliminates loss of vibration energy and resultant thermal issues. The
   system is potentially promising, through further miniaturization, in
   providing sustainable power for micro-electro-mechanical systems.}},

Title = {{Making It Trustable: Acoustic-Based Signcryption Mutual Authentication
   for Multiwearable Devices}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{We address the problem of authentication and secure communication
   between wearable devices. As people rely heavily on such mobile and
   wearable devices, the need for seamless and secure communication across
   these spectra of devices becomes increasingly important. In order to
   provide secure communication, mutually trusted authentication becomes
   the first line of protection to guard our personal information. We
   propose an acoustic-based signcryption mutual authentication (ASMA),
   which is a key-agreement protocol by employing timestamp and owning
   functions of multiple-times identity authentication, password change,
   and devices addition and alteration. Through series of experiments
   verifying the reliability and accuracy, the protocol shows that it can
   ensure secure data transmission and data sharing for multiwearable
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{Bit-error rate (BER) performance of subcarrier M-ary phase-shift keying
   (MPSK) and M-ary differential PSK (MDPSK) is analyzed for optical

   approximate BER, which is obtained by dividing the symbol-error rate by
   the number of bits per symbol, for subcarrier MPSK and MDPSK
   modulations. The asymptotic BER performance gap between the exact and
   the approximate BERs is quantified analytically through our asymptotic
   analyses. The accuracy of the approximate BER of both MPSK and MDPSK
   depends on the channel conditions. Under weak turbulence conditions, the
   approximate BER expression can be used to predict the system performance
   with high accuracy, while under strong turbulence conditions the
   approximate BER becomes inaccurate and can only serve as a loose lower
   bound of the exact BER. The asymptotic BER performance loss of MDPSK
   with respect to MPSK is also quantified analytically.}},

Title = {{Flutter Instability Speeds of Guided Splined Disks: An Experimental and
   Analytical Investigation}},
Journal = {{SHOCK AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{``Guided splined disks{''} are defined as flat thin disks in which the
   inner radius of the disk is splined and matches a splined arbor that
   provides the driving torque for rotating the disk. Lateral constraint
   for the disk is provided by space fixed guide pads. Experimental lateral
   displacement of run-up tests of such a system is presented, and the
   flutter instability zones are identified. The results indicate that
   flutter instability occurs at speeds when a backward travelling wave of
   a mode meets a reflected wave of a different mode. Sometimes, the system
   cannot pass a flutter zone, and transverse vibrations of the disk lock
   into that flutter instability zone. The governing linear equations of
   transverse motion of such a spinning disk, with assumed free inner and
   outer boundary conditions, are derived. A lateral constraint is
   introduced and modeled as a linear spring. Rigid body translational and
   tilting degrees of freedom are included in the analysis of the total
   motion of the spinning disk. The eigenvalues of the system are computed
   numerically, and the flutter instability zones are defined. The results
   show that the mathematical model can predict accurately the flutter
   instability zones measured in the experimental tests.}},

Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, experimental results are shown for a synchronous class-F
   RF to DC rectifier. The rectifier design is obtained by transforming a
   class-F amplifier into a rectifier using the theory of time reversal
   duality. The amplifier and rectifier are tested under identical source
   power conditions to demonstrate the duality between the circuits. A 10W
   Cree HEMT device is used in the designs at a frequency of 985 MHz. The
   class-F amplifier delivers 8.3W with an efficiency of 77.5\% for a DC
   source power of 10.7W. The time reversed dual, a class-F rectifier,
   delivers 8.7W of DC load power for a RF input source power of 10.7W with
   an efficiency of 81.3\%. The rectifier circuit has slightly higher
   efficiency than the amplifier and lower losses in the rectifier are
   attributed to device operation in both quadrants I and III compared to
   an amplifier which operates exclusively in quadrant I. The rectifier has
   a peak output power of 11.3W with an efficiency of 78\% and this is the
   highest reported power for a synchronous RF class-F amplifier.}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Electrostatic charges can influence the hydrodynamics of gas-solid
   fluidized beds. In our previous work (Jalalinejad et al., 2012), it was
   shown that high charge density modified the single bubble shape in
   fluidized beds. In this study, we investigate the effect of
   electrostatics on interaction of bubbles by simulating pairs of bubbles
   in vertical and horizontal alignment in uncharged and charged particles.
   The geometry simulated is based on the experiment of Clift and Grace
   (1970), with simulation results compared with their experiments for
   bubbles in vertical alignment. The model predicts the overall
   coalescence pattern, but the trailing bubble splits in simulations,
   unlike experiment.
   The effect of electrostatics is modeled by solving electrical equations
   and adopting the Two Fluid Model in MFIX (an open source code).
   Comparison of uncharged and charged cases for bubbles in vertical
   alignment shows different bubble coalescence behaviour, with greater
   asymmetry in the charged case, leading to larger resultant bubble. For
   bubbles in horizontal alignment, electric charges cause the side bubble
   to migrate towards the axis of the column, reversing the
   leading-trailing role of the two bubbles, which led to the decrease in
   the height of complete coalescence. (C) 2014 The Society of Powder

Abstract = {{Quantitative tools for deciphering the environment of microbialite
   formation are relatively limited. For example, the oxygen isotope
   carbonate-water geothermometer requires assumptions about the isotopic
   composition of the water of formation. We explored the utility of using
   `clumped' isotope thermometry as a tool to study the temperatures of
   microbialite formation. We studied microbialites recovered from water
   depths of 10-55 m in Pavilion Lake, and 10-25 m in Kelly Lake, spanning
   the thermocline in both lakes. We determined the temperature of
   carbonate growth and the O-18/O-16 ratio of the waters that
   microbialites grew in. Results were then compared to current
   limnological data from the lakes to reconstruct the history of
   microbialite formation. Modern microbialites collected at shallow depths
   (11.7 m) in both lakes yield clumped isotope-based temperatures of
   formation that are within error of summer water temperatures, suggesting
   that clumped isotope analyses may be used to reconstruct past climates
   and to probe the environments in which microbialites formed. The deepest
   microbialites (21.7-55 m) were recovered from below the present-day
   thermoclines in both lakes and yield radioisotope ages indicating they
   primarily formed earlier in the Holocene. During this time, pollen data
   and our reconstructed water O-18/O-16 ratios indicate a period of
   aridity, with lower lake levels. At present, there is a close
   association between both photosynthetic and heterotrophic communities,
   and carbonate precipitation/microbialite formation, with biosignatures
   of photosynthetic influences on carbonate detected in microbialites from
   the photic zone and above the thermocline (i.e., depths of generally <20
   m). Given the deeper microbialites are receiving <1\% of
   photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), it is likely these
   microbialites primarily formed when lower lake levels resulted in
   microbialites being located higher in the photic zone, in warm surface
   waters.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of temperature (100-230 degrees C) and sulfate concentration
   (0-0.5 mol L-1) on the pitting corrosion of titanium were studied in
   de-aerated 1 mol L-1 NaCl solution using cyclic potentiodynamic
   polarization (CPP) and linear-sweep thermammetry measurements. With
   increasing temperature, the breakdown potential E-b of titanium
   decreased, while the repassivation potential E-rp of titanium remained
   constant in 1 mol L-1 NaCl solution. The presence of sulfate ions
   shifted both the E-b and E-rp to higher values, implying that the
   pitting of titanium was inhibited. In 1 mol L-1 NaCl solution with 0.5
   mol L-1 sulfate addition, titanium did not undergo passivity breakdown
   at 200 degrees C, even up to 9 V vs. SHE. X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy results showed that the inhibition effect of sulfate on the
   pitting could be attributed to the competition for adsorption sites on
   the oxide surface. A metastable pitting temperature threshold (MPTT) was
   defined for titanium as a function of sulfate to chloride mole ratio
   using linear-sweep thermammetry measurements. The MPTT results were
   consistent with those obtained in CPP measurements. The results
   confirmed that the MPTT of titanium was elevated by the addition of
   sulfate ions. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Determine the effects of dynamic injurious axial compression applied at
   various lateral eccentricities (lateral distance to the centre of the
   spine) on mechanical flexibilities and structural injury patterns of the
   cervical spine.
   13 three-vertebra human cadaver cervical spine specimens (6 C3-5, 3
   C4-6, 2 C5-7, 2 C6-T1) were subjected to pure moment flexibility tests
   (+/- 1.5 Nm) before and after impact trauma was applied in two groups:
   low and high lateral eccentricity (1 and 150 \% of the lateral diameter
   of the vertebral body, respectively). Relative range of motion (ROM) and
   relative neutral zone (NZ) were calculated as the ratio of post and
   pre-trauma values. Injuries were diagnosed by a spine surgeon and
   scored. Classification functions were developed using discriminant
   analysis.
   Low and high eccentric loading resulted in primarily bony fractures and
   soft tissue injuries, respectively. Axial impacts with high lateral
   eccentricities resulted in greater spinal motion in lateral bending
   {[}median relative ROM 3.5 (interquartile range, IQR 2.3) vs. 1.4 (IQR
   0.5) and median relative NZ 4.7 (IQR 3.7) vs. 2.3 (IQR 1.1)] and in
   axial rotation {[}median relative ROM 5.3 (IQR 13.7) vs. 1.3 (IQR 0.5),
   p < 0.05 for all comparisons] than those that resulted from low
   eccentricity impacts. The developed classification functions had 92 \%
   classification accuracy.
   Dynamic axial compression loading of the cervical spine with high
   lateral eccentricities produced primarily soft tissue injuries resulting
   in more post-injury spinal flexibility in lateral bending and axial
   rotation than that associated with the bony fractures resulting from low
   eccentricity impacts.}},

Title = {{Coal Macerals Chemistry and Its Implications for Selectivity in Coal
   Floatability}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL PREPARATION AND UTILIZATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{99-110}},
Abstract = {{Macerals are the smallest components of coal recognizable on the
   microscopic scale and, even when optically homogeneous, they may have
   variable elemental and molecular chemistry not only across different
   coal ranks but also in iso-rank coals. These variations in maceral
   chemistry may have significant impact on the behavior of the coal during
   processing and may also complicate predictions of this behavior.
   Flotation is one of the processes that is impacted by intermaceral
   variations. Flotation is used as a main process to upgrade the fines of
   higher rank coals. It depends on the surface properties of coal
   particles, hence their chemical composition. Most of the minerals
   associated with coal, with the exception of a few (elemental sulfur or
   some pyrites), are hydrophilic and can easily be separated if liberated
   from coal by flotation. The organic matter (macerals) possesses
   different degrees of hydrophobicity, and its response to flotation can
   vary depending on the surface properties that result from chemical
   composition of macerals and their associations with each other and
   minerals. This article addresses research progress in the area of
   chemistry of macerals and their hydrophobicity with a special reference
   to achieving selectivity in coal flotation.}},

   annealing on magnetic and structural properties of the produced

   squareness of prepared nanowires improved when the Cr content reached to
   7.5 \%. Also, the coercivity of Co92.5Cr7.5 nanowire improved after
   thermal annealing at 650 degrees C. Hysteresis loops measured for the
   synthesized nanowires at different electrodeposition frequencies exhibit
   higher coercivity and squareness for nanowires prepared at 200 Hz.
   Meantime, magnetic properties of the nanowires were seen to be

Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1050-1058}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate an active, implantable drug delivery device embedded with
   a microfluidic pump that is driven by a radio-controlled actuator for
   temporal drug delivery. The polyimide-packaged 10 x 10 x 2 mm(3) chip
   contains a micromachined pump chamber and check valves of Parylene C to
   force the release of the drug from a 76 mu L reservoir by wirelessly
   activating the actuator using external radio-frequency (RF)
   electromagnetic fields. The rectangular-shaped spiral-coil actuator
   based on nitinol, a biocompatible shape-memory alloy, is developed to
   perform cantilever-like actuation for pumping operation. The
   nitinol-coil actuator itself forms a passive 185 MHz resonant circuit
   that serves as a self-heat source activated via RF power transfer to
   enable frequency-selective actuation and pumping. Experimental wireless
   operation of fabricated prototypes shows successful release of test
   agents from the devices placed in liquid and excited by radiating tuned
   RF fields with an output power of 1.1 W. These tests reveal a single
   release volume of 219 nL, suggesting a device's capacity of similar to
   350 individual ejections of drug from its reservoir. The thermal
   behavior of the activated device is also reported in detail. This
   proof-of-concept prototype validates the effectiveness of wireless RF
   pumping for fully controlled, long-lasting drug delivery, a key step
   towards enabling patient-tailored, targeted local drug delivery through
   highly miniaturized implants.}},

Abstract = {{The variation of moisture content in the biomass materials would affect
   the quality during the utilization of these materials as solid biofuel.
   The ability to predict the time-dependent moisture contents of the
   biomass via modeling can help to devise a better way to store and manage
   these biomass materials. In this study, pieces of aspen stems were
   subject to cycles of wetting and drying in lab-scale tests. A lumped
   mathematical model for simulating the moisture changes during storage
   was developed and calibrated using the experimental data. With the
   available weather data (air temperature, relative humidity, solar
   radiation, wind speed, and precipitation) as inputs, the model was then
   applied to estimate the moisture content of aspen (Populus tremuloides)
   during one year of storage in the field. Results showed that, for both
   uncovered bales and covered bales, the predicted moisture contents and
   the profiles were in good agreement with the measured in-field results.
   This lumped model may be used as a first approximation, and applied to
   estimate the moisture content of aspen or similar woody biomass
   materials during relatively long-term field storage.}},

Abstract = {{Providing direct communications among a rapidly growing number of
   wireless devices within the coverage area of a cellular system is an
   attractive way of exploiting the proximity among them to enhance
   coverage and spectral and energy efficiency. However, such
   device-to-device (D2D) communications create a new type of interference
   in cellular systems, calling for rigorous system analysis and design to
   both protect mobile users (MUs) and guarantee the connectivity of
   devices. Motivated by the potential advantages of cognitive radio (CR)
   technology in detecting and exploiting underutilized spectrum, we
   investigate CR-assisted D2D communications in a cellular network as a
   viable solution for D2D communications, in which devices access the
   network with mixed overlay-underlay spectrum sharing. Our comprehensive
   analysis reveals several engineering insights useful to system design.
   We first derive bounds of pivotal performance metrics. For a given
   collision probability constraint, as the prime spectrum-sharing
   criterion, we also derive the maximum allowable density of devices. This
   captures the density of MUs and that of active macro base stations.
   Limited in spatial density, devices may not have connectivity among
   them. Nevertheless, it is shown that for the derived maximum allowable
   density, one should judiciously push a portion of devices into receiving
   mode in order to preserve the connectivity and to keep the isolation
   probability low. Furthermore, upper bounds on the cellular coverage
   probability are obtained incorporating load-based power allocation for
   both path-loss and fading-based cell association mechanisms, which are
   fairly accurate and consistent with our in-depth simulation results.
   Finally, implementation issues are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the time-dependent behavior of laminated shale that is
   prone to massive roof falls. One particular compressional failure known
   as ``Cutter{''} roof failure often transforms into massive roof failure
   within a few days or months. High horizontal stresses also increase the
   propensity of these failures. In the past few decades, the effects of
   high horizontal stresses have been studied using numerical models, and
   these studies have been successful in providing significant insight into
   their role. However, the models did not include any time-dependency
   analysis of the roof rocks. The main explanation for this has been the
   absence of data on the time-dependent properties of roof rocks.
   Therefore, a series of uniaxial and triaxial creep tests were performed
   on shale specimens to investigate whether roof rock deforms with time
   and how it fails under complex stress conditions. In uniaxial tests, the
   load applied to specimens varied from 70 to 85\% of their uniaxial
   compressive strength. When the load was 75 and 85\% of the strength, the
   specimens failed instantaneously. The strain rate changed throughout the
   test period and did not attain a steady state. Results showed that rocks
   will deform with time and increasing strain will result in potential
   failure. In triaxial creep tests, both axial and confining stresses were
   incremented in stages. Finally, results from these tests showed that the
   rocks under complex stress conditions will also strain with time and
   will transform into complete failure of the specimen. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study investigates the potential integration of a dairy farm and a
   greenhouse into an eco-industrial system to promote waste-to-energy and
   waste-to-material exchanges. Natural gas consumption is substituted by
   renewable biogas generated from anaerobic digestion (AD) of the dairy
   manure; CO2 for plant enrichment in greenhouses is supplied by biogas
   combustion and the digestate (digestion residue) from digesters is used
   as animal bedding, plant growing media and liquid fertilizers.
   A life cycle analysis (LCA) was conducted to quantify the environmental
   impacts of the eco-industrial system in comparison to the conventional
   agriculture practices. The results show that the integrated system
   reduces non-renewable energy consumption, climate change impact,
   acidification, respiratory effects from organic emissions, and human
   toxicity by more than 40\%. If the digestate surplus is treated as a
   waste, the integrated system shows an increase in eutrophication and
   respiratory effects from inorganic emissions while all the analyzed
   impacts are reduced if the digestate can be used for substituting
   chemical fertilizers. (C) 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Abstract = {{A computational model for simulating the performance of immobilized
   photocatalytic ultraviolet (UV) reactors used for water treatment was

   optimization. This model integrated hydrodynamics, species mass
   transport, chemical reaction kinetics, and irradiance distribution
   within the reactor. Among different hydrodynamic models evaluated
   against experimental data, the laminar, Abe-Kondoh-Nagano, and Reynolds
   stress turbulence models showed better performance (errors <5\%, 12\%,
   and 20\%, respectively) in terms of external mass transfer and surface
   reaction prediction capabilities at different hydrodynamic conditions. A
   developed finite-volume-based UV lamp emission model was able to
   predict, with errors of less than 5\%, near-and far-field irradiance
   measurements. Combining all these models, the integrated computational
   fluid dynamics (CFD)-based model was able to successfully predict the
   photocatalytic degradation rate of model pollutants (benzoic acid and
   2,4-D) in various configurations of annular reactors and UV lamp sizes,
   over a wide range of hydrodynamic conditions (350 < Re < 11,000). In
   addition, the integrated model was used in combination with a Taguchi
   design of experiments method to perform reactor design optimization.
   Following this approach, a base case annular reactor design was modified

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional Digital Image Correlation is typically done using two
   cameras that view the measured object from differing oblique directions.
   The measured images are independent and must be spatially connected
   using a detailed calibration procedure. This places a large demand on
   the practitioner, the optical equipment and the computational method. A
   novel approach is presented here where a single color-camera is used in
   place of multiple monochrome cameras. The color-camera measures three
   independent Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color-coded images. This feature
   greatly reduces the scale of the required system calibrations and
   spatial computations because the color images are physically aligned on
   the camera sensor. Out-of-plane information is obtained by triangulation
   using oblique illumination from separate colored light sources. The 3-D
   Digital Image Correlation is completed by combining the 2-D correlations
   for each RGB color. An example apparatus is described and some typical
   results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{ESPI is typically done using a single monochromatic light source with a
   monochrome camera. This arrangement enables full-field measurements of a
   single deformation quantity according to the particular arrangement of
   the optical system. If a further deformation quantity is to be measured,
   then the associated optical arrangement must be used sequentially. Here,
   an alternative approach is described where multiple interferometric
   measurements are simultaneously made using a color camera imaging
   monochromatic light sources of different wavelengths. The Red-Green-Blue
   (RGB) sensors of a conventional Bayer type camera can be read
   separately, thereby providing three independent color signals and
   independent ESPI phase maps. An example case is demonstrated here where
   two Michelson interferometers are combined to form a shearography camera
   with surface slope sensitivity in two perpendicular directions. By the
   use of two colors, both surface slopes can be measured simultaneously.
   The availability of the two surface slopes gives the opportunity for the
   data to be integrated numerically to give the surface displacement
   shape. This application is of significant practical interest because the
   surface displacement measurement can be made under field conditions by
   taking advantage of the well-known stability of shearography
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient power management of the radio is a critical requirement for
   the battery-operated portable electronic devices incorporating wireless
   transceivers to have a longer runtime. The power management function of
   IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLANs) allows stations (STAs)
   to operate in the doze mode to save energy significantly. In this paper,
   the enhanced timer-based power management (E-TPM) scheme, which supports
   the applications with delay-intolerant uplink traffic (DIUT), is
   presented for infrastructure IEEE 802.11 WLANs. With E-TPM, the radio
   transceiver of the dozing STA is woken up right away when an outgoing
   frame is generated by the STA so that DIUT is transmitted in a timely
   manner. In addition, a novel model for stochastic analysis of the E-TPM
   is developed. Based on this model, the probabilities that an STA is
   active, idle, or dozing are derived, and the power consumption of the
   STA, the number of frames buffered at the access point (AP) for the STA
   operating in doze mode, and the average delay per frame are obtained.
   These results enable an efficient power management algorithm that
   optimizes the idle timer and doze duration at the STA so that the doze
   mode does not result in extra delay in DIUT, and the delay of downlink
   traffic is controlled within a given bound. Numerical results show that
   the proposed E-TPM is able to considerably reduce delay with limited
   available memory space at the AP.}},

   EndoSequence BC (Brasseler, Savannah, GA), MTA Fillapex (Angelus
   Industria de Produtos Odontologicos S/A, Londrina, PR, Brazil) and a
   control sealer (AH Plus; Dentsply DeTrey GmbH, Konstanz, Germany) were
   evaluated. Human gingival fibroblasts were incubated for 3 days both
   with the extracts from fresh and set materials in culture medium and
   cultured on the surface of the set materials in Dulbecco-modified Eagle
   medium. Fibroblasts cultured in Dulbecco-modified Eagle medium were used
   as a control group. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by flow cytometry, and
   the adhesion of the fibroblasts to the surface of the set materials was
   assessed using scanning electron microscopy. The data of cell
   cytotoxicity were analyzed statistically using a 1-way analysis of
   variance test at a significance level of P < .05. Results: Cells
   incubated with extracts from BC Sealer showed higher viabilities at all
   extract concentrations than cells incubated with extracts from freshly
   mixed AH Plus and fresh and set MTA Fillapex, esspecially for the high
   extract concentrations (1:2 and 1:8 dilutions). Extracts from set MTA
   Fillapex of 2 weeks and older were more cytotoxic than extracts from
   freshly mixed and 1-week-old cement. With extract concentrations of 1:32
   and lower, MTA Fillapex was no longer cytotoxic. After setting, AH Plus
   was no longer cytotoxic, and the fibroblast cells grew on set AH Plus
   equally as well as on BC Sealer. Conclusions: BC Sealer and MTA
   Fillapex, the 2 calcium silicate containing endodontic sealers,
   exhibited different cytotoxicity to human gingival fibroblasts.}},

Title = {{Performance of conditional source-term estimation model for LES of

Abstract = {{Conditional source-term estimation (CSE) is a subfilter-scale (SFS)
   model for representing turbulence-chemistry interactions in turbulent
   reactive flows. In the present study, the CSE model is coupled with a
   two-dimensional flame-generated manifold (FGM) chemistry reduction
   technique and modified laminar-flame-based probability density function
   (PDF) and applied to large eddy simulation (LES) of laboratory-scale
   turbulent premixed flames. CSE estimates conditional moments by solving
   an inverse problem and uses a conditional moment closure to determine
   the influence of the unresolved turbulence on the reaction rates. While
   the CSE model has been used extensively in simulating turbulent
   non-premixed flames, the study represents a first application of the
   combustion model to LES of premixed flames. Two axisymmetric Bunsen-type
   premixed turbulent methane-air flames are examined corresponding to lean
   and stoichiometric conditions with both lying within the thin reaction
   zones regime. The LES predictions are compared to available experimental
   data for the two flames. The predictions of the CSE model are also
   compared to those of a more traditional flamelet-based approach: the
   presumed conditional moment (PCM) with flame prolongation of intrinsic
   low-dimensional manifolds (FPI) tabulated chemistry, or so-called
   PCM-FPI model. The comparisons of the CSE and PCM-FPI models allow the
   relative importance of deviations from the standard flamelet assumption
   to be assessed for flames lying outside the flamelet premixed combustion
   regime. The performance of CSE for LES of turbulent premixed combustion
   is evaluated. The CSE combustion model is found to be stable and
   converges to physically meaningful values. It also yields LES results
   that agree very well with experiment, both qualitatively and
   quantitatively, and would seem able to incorporate correctly the
   influence of turbulent strain on conditionally-filtered quantities and
   hence burning rate as flame behaviour deviates from that of a flamelet
   in the thin reaction zones regime. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute.

Abstract = {{Rapid technological advances have made the acquisition of large numbers
   of spectra not only feasible, but also routine. As a result, a
   significant research effort is focused on semi-automated and fully
   automated spectral processing techniques. However, the need to provide
   initial estimates of the number of peaks, their band shapes, and the
   initial parameters of these bands presents an obstacle to the full
   automation of peak fitting and its incorporation into fully automated
   spectral-preprocessing workflows. Moreover, the sensitivity of peak-fit
   routines to initial parameter settings and the resultant variations in
   solution quality further impede user-free operation. We have developed a
   technique to perform fully automated peak fitting on fully automated
   preconditioned spectra specifically, baseline-corrected and smoothed
   spectra that are free of cosmic-ray-induced spikes. Briefly, the tallest
   peak in a spectrum is located and a Gaussian peak-fit is performed. The
   fitted peak is then subtracted from the spectrum, and the procedure is
   repeated until the entire spectrum has been processed. In second and
   third passes, all the peaks in the spectrum are fitted concurrently, but
   are fitted to a Pearson Type VII model using the parameters for the
   model established in the prior pass. The technique is applied to a
   synthetic spectrum with several peaks, some of which have substantial
   overlap, to test the ability of the method to recover the correct number
   of peaks, their true shape, and their appropriate parameters. Finally
   the method is tested on measured Raman spectra collected from human
   embryonic stem cells and samples of red blood cells.}},

Title = {{Severity of urban cycling injuries and the relationship with personal,

   metrics}},
Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the relationship between cycling injury severity
   and personal, trip, route and crash characteristics.
   Methods: Data from a previous study of injury risk, conducted in Toronto
   and Vancouver, Canada, were used to classify injury severity using four
   metrics: (1) did not continue trip by bike; (2) transported to hospital
   by ambulance; (3) admitted to hospital; and (4) Canadian Triage and
   Acuity Scale (CTAS). Multiple logistic regression was used to examine
   associations with personal, trip, route and crash characteristics.
   Results: Of 683 adults injured while cycling, 528 did not continue their
   trip by bike, 251 were transported by ambulance and 60 were admitted to
   hospital for further treatment. Treatment urgencies included 75 as
   CTAS=1 or 2 (most medically urgent), 284 as CTAS=3, and 320 as CTAS=4 or
   5 (least medically urgent). Older age and collision with a motor vehicle
   were consistently associated with increased severity in all four metrics
   and statistically significant in three each (both variables with
   ambulance transport and CTAS; age with hospital admission; and motor
   vehicle collision with did not continue by bike). Other factors were
   consistently associated with more severe injuries, but statistically
   significant in one metric each: downhill grades; higher motor vehicle
   speeds; sidewalks (these significant for ambulance transport); multiuse
   paths and local streets (both significant for hospital admission).
   Conclusions: In two of Canada's largest cities, about one-third of the
   bicycle crashes were collisions with motor vehicles and the resulting
   injuries were more severe than in other crash circumstances,
   underscoring the importance of separating cyclists from motor vehicle
   traffic. Our results also suggest that bicycling injury severity and
   injury risk would be reduced on facilities that minimise slopes, have
   lower vehicle speeds, and that are designed for bicycling rather than
   shared with pedestrians.}},

Abstract = {{Vinyl (-CH=CH2) is a functional group in chlorophyll molecules that are
   essential in natural photosynthesis, which is crucial for tuning the
   electronic properties and the interaction between chlorophyll and other
   biological cofactors. Approaches to apply a vinyl group in artificial
   photosynthesis have been reported to improve the electron transfer from
   an iridium complex photosensitizer (PS) to a colloidal platinum catalyst
   likely by chemical adsorption. However, versatile molecular design of
   Ir-PSs utilizing a vinyl group is still very important to further
   develop photocatalytically active compounds. Here we report two new
   Ir-PSs with a phenylvinyl (styrenyl) moiety in two different positions.
   Their hydrogen-generation performance was assessed in the presence of a
   triethylamine electron donor and a colloidal platinum catalyst. As
   expected, both the Ir-PSs show much higher turnover numbers than the
   non-styrenylic Ir-PS, and interestingly, the H-2 generation longevity
   was clearly observed to be dependent on the styrenyl position.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},

Abstract = {{Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a class of
   global environmental pollutants whose environmental fate and adverse
   effects are of concern. However, data on the basic physicochemical
   properties of PFASs are scarce. To fill part of the data gaps, improved
   quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models for
   prediction of PFAS properties are developed based on the correlation
   between reported experimental data and molecular descriptors (fluorine
   number, molar volume and total surface area). Properties include vapor
   pressure, aqueous solubility, octanol/water partition coefficient,
   air/water partition coefficient and octanol/air partition coefficient.
   The fluorine number-descriptor model is based on good statistical
   results. However, this model cannot distinguish among PFASs with the
   same number of attached fluorines. Setting aside the fluorine
   number-descriptor models, models based on molar volume are statistically
   better than those based on total surface area. Therefore, The PFAS data
   obtained from the molar volume descriptor model are more reliable than
   from fluorine number and total surface area descriptor models. These
   results are intended to improve the understanding of the behavior and
   fate of PFASs in the environment, at contaminated sites and during

Abstract = {{In ambient assisted living, one of the most concerning problems is how
   the living status of the elderly can be accurately judged through the
   data collected by ambient sensors. To solve this problem, environmental
   influences should be sufficiently considered. Some researchers have
   proposed collecting data comprehensively by distributed environmental
   sensors, but how the massive collected data were to be analyzed and
   transmitted was ignored. In this article, we propose a local data
   processing architecture on a local server to analyze collected data. In
   this three-layer architecture, the latest received data is stored in a
   data gathering layer. Afterward, a data filtering layer checks the
   efficiency of data. Also, this layer classifies the received data into
   static data reflecting sensors' status and a real-time data stream
   reflecting quality of life. For static data, they are directly stored in
   a database, and the real-time data stream is divided into different
   levels. Based on these levels, a data analyzing layer reorganizes data
   into a neighborhood structure, which will be called RDAA. A risk factor
   is returned by RDAA and only abnormal data will be sent to a health care
   provider when its risk factor is larger than a given threshold. LDAP
   disperses the stress of remote centralized processing and data storage,
   which decreases the workload of the remote health care provider.
   Meanwhile, it also reduces network load and improves processing speed.}},

Title = {{Adaptive Error-Correction Coding Scheme for Underwater Acoustic

Abstract = {{Underwater acoustic communication networks (UWANs) have recently
   attracted much attention in the research community. Two properties that
   set UWANs apart from most radio-frequency wireless communication
   networks are the long propagation delay and the possible sparsity of the
   network topology. This in turn offers opportunities to optimize
   throughput through time and spatial reuse. In this paper, we propose a
   new adaptive coding method to realize the former. We consider
   time-slotted scheduling protocols, which are a popular solution for
   contention-free and interference-free access in small-scale UWANs, and
   exploit the surplus guard time that occurs for individual links for
   improving transmission reliability. In particular, using link distances
   as side information, transmitters utilize the available portion of the
   time slot to adapt their code rate and increase reliability. Since
   increased reliability trades off with energy consumption per
   transmission, we optimize the code rate for best tradeoff, considering
   both single and multiple packet transmission using the incremental
   redundancy hybrid automatic repeat request (IR-HARQ) protocol. For
   practical implementation of this adaptive coding scheme, we consider
   punctured and rateless codes. Simulation results demonstrate the gains
   achieved by our coding scheme over fixed-rate error-correction codes in
   terms of both throughput and consumption of transmitted energy per
   successfully delivered packet. We also report results from a sea trial
   conducted at the Haifa harbor, which corroborate the simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This work analyzes the anti-icing performance of flat aluminum surfaces

   they are subjected to repeated icing/deicing cycles. The wetting
   properties of the samples upon long-term immersion in water are also

   with alkyl groups are prone to gradual degradation of their hydrophobic
   and icephobic properties, which is caused by interactions and reactions
   with both ice and liquid water. This implies that alkyl-group based
   monolayers on aluminum surfaces are not likely to be durable icephobic
   coatings unless their durability in contact with ice and/or water is
   significantly improved.}},

Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) is a complicated process that
   involves multiple environmental and socio-economic criteria.
   Decision-makers look for decision support frameworks that can guide in
   defining alternatives, relevant criteria and their weights, and finding
   a suitable solution. In addition, decision-maldng in MSWM problems such
   as finding proper waste treatment locations or strategies often requires
   multiple stakeholders such as government, municipalities, industries,
   experts, and/or general public to get involved. Multi-criteria Decision
   Analysis (MCDA) is the most popular framework employed in previous
   studies on MSWM; MCDA methods help multiple stakeholders evaluate the
   often conflicting criteria, communicate their different preferences, and
   rank or prioritize MSWM strategies to finally agree on some elements of
   these strategies and make an applicable decision. This paper reviews and
   brings together research on the application of MCDA for solving MSWM
   problems with more focus on the studies that have considered multiple
   stakeholders and offers solutions for such problems. Results of this
   study show that AMP is the most common approach in consideration of
   multiple stakeholders and experts and governments/municipalities are the
   most common participants in these studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Quantitative measurements of water's effects on
   the tension response of plant tissue will assist in understanding the
   regulatory mechanism underlying expansive growth. Such measurements
   should be multiscale in nature to account for plants' hierarchical
   structure.
   Methods: Outer onion epidermal tissues were cut and bonded to uniaxial
   displacement-controlled mechanical loading devices to apply and measure
   the force on the sample. Fluorescent polystyrene beads (500 nm in
   diameter) were dispersed on the sample surface under various levels of
   tensile load conditions to obtain displacement maps with a confocal
   fluorescent microscope. The resulting strain was measured using a
   digital image correlation technique by tracking individual bead
   displacements. The applied forces were obtained by measuring the
   displacement of the calibrated force-sensing device. Tissue- and
   cell-scale mechanical properties were quantified by calculating the
   applied stress and the corresponding global and local strains.
   Key results: The Young's modulus values of individual cell walls of
   dehydrated and rehydrated samples were 3.0 +/- 1.0 GPa and 0.4 +/- 0.2
   GPa, respectively, and are different from the Young's modulus values of
   the global tissue-scale dehydrated and rehydrated samples, which were
   1.9 +/- 0.3 GPa and 0.08 +/- 0.02 GPa, respectively. Poisson's ratio
   increased more than 3-fold due to hydration.
   Conclusion: The results on global, cell-to-cell, and point-to-point
   mechanical property variations suggest the importance of the mechanical
   contribution of extracellular features including the middle lamella,
   cell shape, and dimension. This study shows that a multiscale
   investigation is essential for fundamental insights into the
   hierarchical deformation of biological systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel speech steganography method using

   increased undetectability. The proposed method also yields improvements
   on both stego signal quality and embedding capacity, which are the two
   major requirements of a steganography algorithm. Our experimental
   results illustrate that the stego signals generated by the proposed
   method are perceptually indistinguishable from the original cover
   signals, quantified by both SNR and PESQ quality measures. When compared
   with two well-known steganography methods, the proposed method is shown
   to be superior on addressing major requirements of a steganography

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analytical model of conductivity and sensitivity
   of passive wireless sensors for biohazard gas detection with lower
   computational cost and reasonable accuracy. Based on the effect of
   electron tunneling among the carbon nanotubes embedded in a polymer
   matrix, an analytical model for conductivity of the composite is
   presented. This model provides significantly lower computational cost as
   compared to the numerical resistive network models. By incorporation of
   electron tunneling effects, this model also provides closer
   approximation to experimental results in comparison to the models based
   on the percolation theory, which are highly relevant for filler/polymer
   composite applications designed around the percolation threshold. Using
   this conductivity model, the conductivity and sensitivity of the
   composite films are estimated in the presence of an organic gas. The
   change in the film resistance due to the absorption of the gas is
   investigated for different filler and gas concentrations. From the phase
   of the reflected radio frequency signal, the applications of the sensor
   for passive wireless gas sensing is estimated in a lossless transmission
   system terminated with a composite film as the load. This paper is
   useful for design and development of biohazard gas sensors for real-time

Journal = {{OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{291-301}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Through experiments that simulated sideways falls with a mechanical hip
   impact simulator, we demonstrated the protective effect of hip abductor
   muscle forces in reducing peak stresses at the femoral neck and the
   corresponding risk for hip fracture.
   Over 90 \% of hip fractures are due to falls, and an improved
   understanding the factors that separate injurious and non-injurious
   falls (via their influence on the peak stress generated at the femoral
   neck) may lead to improved risk assessment and prevention strategies.
   The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of muscle forces
   spanning the hip, and knee boundary conditions, on peak forces and
   estimated stresses at the femoral neck during simulated falls with a
   mechanical system.
   We simulated hip abductor muscle forces and knee boundary conditions
   with a mechanical hip impact simulator and measured forces and stresses
   at the femoral neck during sideways falls.
   Peak compressive and tensile stresses, shear force, bending moment, and
   axial force are each associated with hip abductor muscle forces and knee
   boundary conditions (p < 0.0005). When muscle force increased from 400
   to 1,200 N, peak compressive and tensile stresses decreased 24 and 56
   \%, respectively. These effects were similar to the magnitude of decline
   in fracture strength associated with osteoporosis and arose from the
   tension-band effect of the muscle in reducing the bending moment by 37
   \%. Furthermore, peak compressive and tensile stresses averaged 40 and
   51 \% lower, respectively, in the free knee than fixed knee condition.
   Contraction of the hip abductor muscles at the moment of impact during a
   fall, and landing with the knee free of constraints, substantially
   reduced peak compressive and tensile stresses at the femoral neck and
   risk for femoral fracture in a sideways fall.}},

Abstract = {{The seismic response of a pile foundation is usually analyzed by
   approximate methods in practice. These methods typically neglect one or
   more of the important factors that affect seismic response such as
   inertial interaction, kinematic interaction, seismic pore water
   pressures, soil nonlinearity, cross stiffness coupling and dynamic pile
   to pile interaction. A nonlinear 3-D analysis is used to show how all
   these factors affect pile response, to demonstrate some of the
   consequences of using various approximate methods and to provide a
   comprehensive overview of how pile foundations behave during earthquakes

Abstract = {{Induced by incorporating the powerful data storage and data processing
   abilities of cloud computing (CC) as well as ubiquitous data gathering
   capability of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), CC-WSN integration
   received a lot of attention from both academia and industry. However,
   authentication as well as trust and reputation calculation and
   management of cloud service providers (CSPs) and sensor network
   providers (SNPs) are two very critical and barely explored issues for
   this new paradigm. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a novel
   authenticated trust and reputation calculation and management (ATRCM)
   system for CC-WSN integration. Considering the authenticity of CSP and
   SNP, the attribute requirement of cloud service user (CSU) and CSP, the
   cost, trust, and reputation of the service of CSP and SNP, the proposed
   ATRCM system achieves the following three functions: 1) authenticating
   CSP and SNP to avoid malicious impersonation attacks; 2) calculating and
   managing trust and reputation regarding the service of CSP and SNP; and
   3) helping CSU choose desirable CSP and assisting CSP in selecting
   appropriate SNP. Detailed analysis and design as well as further
   functionality evaluation results are presented to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of ATRCM, followed with system security analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A single-task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment
   may only partially highlight alterations to functional brain networks
   affected by a particular disorder. Multivariate analysis across multiple
   fMRI tasks may increase the sensitivity of fMRI-based diagnosis. Prior
   research using multi-task analysis in fMRI, such as those that use joint
   independent component analysis (jICA), has mainly assumed that brain
   activity patterns evoked by different tasks are independent. This may
   not be valid in practice. Here, we use sparsity, which is a natural
   characteristic of fMRI data in the spatial domain, and propose a joint
   sparse representation analysis (jSRA) method to identify common
   information across different functional subtraction (contrast) images in
   data from a multi-task fMRI experiment. Sparse representation methods do
   not require independence, or that the brain activity patterns be
   nonoverlapping. We use functional subtraction images within the joint
   sparse representation analysis to generate joint activation sources and
   their corresponding sparse modulation profiles. We evaluate the use of
   sparse representation analysis to capture individual differences with
   simulated fMRI data and with experimental fMRI data. The experimental
   fMRI data was acquired from 16 young (age: 19-26) and 16 older (age:
   57-73) adults obtained from multiple speech comprehension tasks within
   subjects, where an independent measure (namely, age in years) can be
   used to differentiate between groups. Simulation results show that this
   method yields greater sensitivity, precision, and higher Jaccard indexes
   (which measures similarity and diversity of the true and estimated brain
   activation sources) than does the jICA method. Moreover, superiority of
   the jSRA method in capturing individual differences was successfully
   demonstrated using experimental fMRI data.}},

Abstract = {{With recent developments in the infrastructure of smart meters and smart
   grid, more electric power data is available and allows real-time easy
   data access. Modeling individual home appliance loads is important for
   tasks such as non-intrusive load disaggregation, load forecasting, and
   demand response support. Previous methods usually require sub-metering
   individual appliances in a home separately to determine the appliance
   models, which may not be practical, since we may only be able to observe
   aggregated real power signals for the entire-home through smart meters
   deployed in the field. In this paper, we propose a model, named
   Explicit-Duration Hidden Markov Model with differential observations
   (EDHMM-diff), for detecting and estimating individual home appliance
   loads from aggregated power signals collected by ordinary smart meters.
   Experiments on synthetic data and real data demonstrate that the
   EDHMM-diff model and the specialized forward-backward algorithm can
   effectively model major home appliance loads.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear and configuration-dependent five-axis kinematics make
   contouring errors difficult to estimate and control in real time. This
   paper proposes a generalized method for the on-line estimation and
   control of five-axis contouring errors. First, a generalized Jacobian
   function is derived based on screw theory in order to synchronize the
   motions of linear and rotary drives. The contouring error components
   contributed by all active drives are estimated through interpolated
   position commands and the generalized Jacobian function. The estimated
   axis components of contouring errors are fed back to the position
   commands of each closed loop servo drive with a proportional gain. The
   proposed contouring error estimation and control methods are general,
   and applicable to arbitrary five-axis tool paths and any kinematically
   admissible five-axis machine tools. The proposed algorithms are verified
   experimentally on a five-axis machine controlled by a modular research
   CNC system built in-house. The contouring errors are shown to be reduced
   by half with the proposed method, which is simple to implement in
   existing CNC systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-scale modelling framework was developed for predicting the
   mechanical properties of strand-based wood composites. This framework is
   based on closed-form analytical models at three different resolution
   levels; micro-, meso- and macro-mechanical. A preprocessing step was
   performed to provide the input data for the three main modelling steps
   in this framework. Finite element-based mechanical analyses were
   employed to verify the accuracy of the analytical models developed for
   the first two steps. The predictive capability of the entire framework
   was validated using a set of experimental data reported in the
   literature. Although the methodology presented is general, it has
   specifically been applied here to predict an important structural
   property (modulus of elasticity, MOE) of a special strand-based wood
   composite product, namely, oriented strand board (OSB). The MOE
   predictions of OSB panels showed reasonable agreement with the available
   experimental data, thus providing confidence in the practical utility of
   this easy-to-use and efficient analytical modelling tool for predicting
   the properties of wood composites employed in structural members.}},

Abstract = {{Three types of wood pellets samples, including two types of commercial

   characterized by the pellet density, bulk density, higher heating value,
   Meyer hardness, saturated moisture uptake, volumetric energy density,
   and energy yield. Results showed that torrefaction significantly
   decreased the pellet density, hardness, volumetric energy density, and
   energy yield. The higher heating value increased and the saturated
   moisture content decreased after torrefaction. In view of the lower
   density, lower hardness, lower volumetric energy density, and energy
   yield of torrefied pellets, it is recommended that biomass should be
   torrefied and then compressed to make strong pellets of high
   hydrophobicity and volumetric energy density. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Deep learning has traditionally been computationally expensive, and
   advances in training methods have been the prerequisite for improving
   its efficiency in order to expand its application to a variety of image
   classification problems. In this letter, we address the problem of
   efficient training of convolutional deep belief networks by learning the
   weights in the frequency domain, which eliminates the time-consuming
   calculation of convolutions. An essential consideration in the design of
   the algorithm is to minimize the number of transformations to and from
   frequency space. We have evaluated the running time improvements using
   two standard benchmark data sets, showing a speed-up of up to 8times on
   2D images and up to 200times on 3D volumes. Our training algorithm makes
   training of convolutional deep belief networks on 3D medical images with
   a resolution of up to 128 x 128 x 128 voxels practical, which opens new
   directions for using deep learning for medical image analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Alarming carbon dioxide emissions and its detrimental environmental
   impacts (e.g. climate change and global warming) are the major
   consequences of the undue reliance of the modern civilization on fossil
   fuels. Long-term solutions to address these issues are based on
   developing sustainable alternatives for the human energy thirst.
   However, the versatilities offered by the carbonaceous fuels have still
   preserved their popularity as the main source of energy for a wide
   variety of applications. After decades of practicing conventional carbon
   capture and storage, researchers believe the ultimate solution of
   realistically facing with CO2 sequestration problem is the chemical
   conversion of carbon dioxide to valuable products. However, substantial
   development of state-of-the-art materials remains the major bottleneck
   of such technologies. Graphene, as the rising star of the materials
   world in 21st century, offers game-changing prospects towards a more
   sustainable future for fossil-fuel-based economies. This two-dimensional
   planar sheet of sp(2)-bonded carbon atoms is the most widely studied
   nanomaterial since its discovery in 2004. Here we aim to highlight
   various aspects of graphene research in carbon dioxide capture and
   conversion from materials viewpoint. After presenting an overview of the
   most common and effective synthesis and doping/functionalization
   methods, the application of graphene and its derivatives in CO2 capture
   and conversion is discussed in detail. Catalytic, electrocatalytic and
   photoelectrocatalytic use of graphene-based compounds could potentially
   revolutionize some of the current techniques for CO2 transformation to
   valuable chemical `commodities. CO2 to graphene conversion pathways are
   also covered extensively in this review paper as another intriguing
   relation of graphene with CO2. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART A-APPLIED SCIENCE AND MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{29-41}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A methodology is presented to directly measure the damage properties and
   strain softening response of laminated composites by conducting
   over-height compact tension (OCT) and compact compression (CC) tests.
   Through the use of digital image correlation (DIC) technique, and
   analysis of the measured surface displacement/strain data, the
   strain-softening response of composites is constructed. This method
   leads to a direct determination of the Mode I translaminar fracture
   properties with the assumption that the shear stress is negligible
   around the damage zone and the crack growth occurs in the symmetric
   opening mode. Using this methodology, and by correlating the observed
   failure mechanisms with the strain-softening curves, the interaction of
   failure mechanisms leading to the final failure and also the distinction
   between the tensile and compressive failure mechanisms can be studied.
   The effectiveness of the method in accurate identification of the damage
   parameters is demonstrated through sectioning and deplying techniques.
   As a consistency check and further verification of the method, the
   obtained strain-softening curves are fed into a numerical damage
   mechanics model and successfully used to simulate the detailed response
   of the very same OCT and CC specimens from which the strain-softening
   curves were extracted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Size-dependent vibration behavior of functionally graded CNT-Reinforced
   polymer microcantilevers: Modeling and optimization}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS A-SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{26-34}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Based on the modified couple stress theory, the free vibration behavior
   of micro scale Bernoulli Euler nanocomposite cantilever beams is
   analytically investigated by introducing a material length scale
   parameter. The mechanical properties of polymer composite micro-beams
   reinforced by multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are assumed to vary
   continuously in the longitudinal direction of the beam. A new
   exponential distribution of the volume fraction of the constituents is
   proposed to achieve the beam's highest fundamental natural frequency
   given a weight percent (wt.\%) of MWCNTs. The effect of the material
   length scale parameter on the fundamental natural frequency of the
   ensuing axially functionally graded (FG) composite micro-beam is
   investigated for various CNT gradient indices. The difference between
   the frequencies, predicted by the modified couple stress theory and the
   classical continuum mechanics theory is considerable when the ratio of
   the beam thickness to the internal material length scale is
   approximately less than two. It is also observed that with a 1.0 wt.\%
   addition of MWCNTs to the polymer-based microcantilevers, almost a
   two-fold improvement in the relative change of the fundamental natural
   frequency is achieved by adopting the proposed optimum CNT dispersion
   pattern rather than the commonly used uniform CNT distribution pattern.

Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{73}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{How to express an expert's or decision maker's preference for
   alternatives is an open issue. Consistent fuzzy preference relation
   (CFPR) is with big advantages to handle this problem due to it can be
   construed via a smaller number of pairwise comparisons and satisfies
   transitivity property. However, the CFPR is incapable of dealing with
   the cases involving uncertain and incomplete information. In this paper,
   a D numbers extended consistent fuzzy preference relation (D-CFPR) is
   proposed to overcome the weakness. The D-CFPR extends the classical CFPR
   by using a new model of expressing uncertain information called D
   numbers. The D-CFPR inherits the merits of classical CFPR and can
   totally reduce to the classical CFPR. This study can be integrated into
   our previous study about D-AHP (D numbers extended AHP) model to provide
   a systematic solution for multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). (C)

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{159-167}},
Abstract = {{The extraordinary deformability of red blood cells gives them the
   ability to repeatedly transit through the microvasculature of the human
   body. The loss of this capability is part of the pathology of a wide
   range of diseases including malaria, hemoglobinopathies, and
   micronutrient deficiencies. We report on a technique for multiplexed
   measurements of the pressure required to deform individual red blood
   cell through micrometer-scale constrictions. This measurement is
   performed by first infusing single red blood cells into a parallel array
   of similar to 1.7 mu m funnel-shaped constrictions. Next, a saw-tooth
   pressure waveform is applied across the constrictions to squeeze each
   cell through its constriction. The threshold deformation pressure is
   then determined by relating the pressure-time data with the video of the
   deformation process. Our key innovation is a self-compensating fluidic
   network that ensures identical pressures are applied to each cell
   regardless of its position, as well as the presence of cells in
   neighboring constrictions. These characteristics ensure the consistency
   of the measurement process and robustness against blockages of the
   constrictions by rigid cells and debris. We evaluate this technique
   using in vitro cultures of RBCs infected with P. falciparum, the
   parasite that causes malaria, to demonstrate the ability to profile the
   deformability signature of a heterogeneous sample.}},

Abstract = {{To enable robots to learn handover orientations from observing natural
   handovers, we conduct a user study to measure and compare natural
   handover orientations with giver-centered and receiver-centered handover
   orientations for twenty common objects. We use a distance minimization
   approach to compute mean handover orientations. We posit that, computed
   means of receiver-centered orientations could be used by robot givers to
   achieve more efficient and socially acceptable handovers. Furthermore,
   we introduce the notion of affordance axes for comparing handover
   orientations, and offer a definition for computing them. Observable
   patterns were found in receiver-centered handover orientations.
   Comparisons show that depending on the object, natural handover
   orientations may not be receiver-centered; thus, robots may need to
   distinguish between good and bad handover orientations when learning
   from natural handovers.}},

Abstract = {{In a wireless video sensor network (WVSN), each video sensor node
   consumes a significant amount of power on video compression in addition
   to the required power for communication. Therefore, the power
   optimization is a more critical issue in WVSN. This paper presents a
   cross-layer algorithm for the minimization of the total power in a video
   sensor network organized in a clustered architecture. The algorithm
   minimizes the total power in the network by jointly optimizing the
   encoding and transmission powers, in addition to the source encoding
   rate at each video sensor node. Furthermore, the allocation of the MAC
   layer resources (time slots and frequency bands) considering flat fading
   channel is addressed. We formulate the problem as a non-linear
   optimization, and propose a solution based on Lagrange duality subject
   to video signal distortion and packet loss constraints. The simulation
   results show the trade-off between allocating power to the encoding
   process or the transmission process. Moreover, the interaction between
   the nodes competing for channel resources for both intra-cluster, and
   inter-cluster bases, and how this affects their power consumption and
   distortion levels is studied(1).}},

Abstract = {{We study bit-error rate performance of subcarrier binary phase-shift
   keying (BPSK) and quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) systems with
   carrier phase error (CPE) in log-normal turbulence channels. The CPE is
   modeled as a Tikhonov random variable. We quantify the CPE induced
   asymptotic noisy reference losses using an auxiliary random variable
   method. Both approximate and exact calculations of the asymptotic noisy
   reference loss for a subcarrier BPSK system over the lognormal channel
   are analytically shown to be 0 dB. This suggests that a subcarrier BPSK
   system is robust to CPE in lognormal fading when the signal-to-noise
   ratio is sufficiently large. A closed-form exact asymptotic noise
   reference loss expression for a subcarrier QPSK system is also
   presented, and such performance metric can be used to assess the
   robustness of the system to CPE.}},

Abstract = {{Existing work on exact outage probabilities of diversity receptions over
   arbitrarily correlated Rician channels involves intractable integrals.
   Although asymptotic analysis provides closed-form approximation and can
   be highly accurate at large signal-to-noise ratio, it is not known at
   what signal-to-noise ratio will the exact outage probability converge to
   the asymptotic result. In this paper, we propose a new approach to
   derive the asymptotic outage probability of maximal ratio combining,
   selection combining and equal gain combining over arbitrarily correlated
   Rician channels. The new asymptotic analysis is more straightforward
   than the previous approach, and results in an interesting geometrical
   explanation for the asymptotic outage probabilities. More importantly,
   asymptotically tight outage probability bounds of the three most popular
   linear diversity receptions are also derived for the arbitrarily
   correlated Rician channels. Using these bounds, we can show at what
   signal-to-noise ratio the asymptotic results are accurate without
   resorting to computer simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Transcutaneous bladder spectroscopy is a novel non-invasive optical
   technique that uses near infrared (NIR) light to detect changes in
   concentration of the tissue chromophores oxy and deoxy-hemoglobin in the
   anterior wall of the organ as it fills and empties. From the patterns,
   trends and magnitude of these changes alterations in tissue oxygenation
   and hemodynamics can be inferred, and, as these differ in health and
   disease, novel information is gained related to the pathophysiology
   underlying the causation and symptoms of voiding dysfunction. Following
   proof of concept and a series of clinical studies, evolution of NIR
   spectroscopy (NIRS) devices for bladder study now requires computer
   aided solutions to optimize device design and refine software
   development to further advance application of this technology. We review
   the concept of bladder spectroscopy, summarize the evolution of related

Abstract = {{Static magnetic resonance imaging partially resolves soft tissue details

   However, delineation of tongue tissue remains a challenge due to the
   lack of definitive boundary features. In this article, we propose a
   minimally interactive inter-subject mesh-to-image registration scheme to
   tackle 3D segmentation of the human tongue from MRI volumes. A tongue
   surface-mesh is first initialised using an exemplar expertdelineated
   template, which is then refined based on local intensity similarities
   between the source and target volumes. A shape-matching technique

   the deformation. We enable effective minimal user interaction by
   incorporating additional boundary labels in areas where automatic
   segmentation is deemed inadequate. We validate our method on 18 normal
   subjects using expert manual delineation as the ground truth. Results

   context-aware semantic service (CSS) to support the development and
   deployment of context-aware applications for vehicular social networks

   passengers, and pedestrians. The programming model of the framework
   incorporates features that support collaborations between mobile agents
   to provide communication services on behalf of owner applications, and
   service (or resident) agents to provide application services on mobile
   devices. Using this model, different self adaptive applications and
   services for VSNs can be effectively developed and deployed. Built on
   top of the mobile devices' operating systems, the framework architecture
   consists of framework service layer, software agent layer and owner
   application layer. Integrated with the proposed novel CSS, applications
   developed on the framework can autonomously and intelligently self-adapt
   to rapidly changing network connectivity and dynamic contexts of VSN
   users. A practical implementation and experimental evaluations of
   S-Aframe are presented to demonstrate its reliability and efficiency in
   terms of computation and communication performance on popular mobile

Abstract = {{The integration of ubiquitous wireless sensor network (WSN) and powerful
   mobile cloud computing (MCC) is a research topic that is attracting
   growing interest in both academia and industry. In this new paradigm,
   WSN provides data to the cloud and mobile users request data from the
   cloud. To support applications involving WSN-MCC integration, which need
   to reliably offer data that are more useful to the mobile users from WSN
   to cloud, this paper first identifies the critical issues that affect
   the usefulness of sensory data and the reliability of WSN, then proposes
   a novel WSN-MCC integration scheme named TPSS, which consists of two
   main parts: 1) time and priority -based selective data transmission
   (TPSDT) for WSN gateway to selectively transmit sensory data that are
   more useful to the cloud, considering the time and priority features of
   the data requested by the mobile user and 2) priority -based sleep
   scheduling (PSS) algorithm for WSN to save energy consumption so that it
   can gather and transmit data in a more reliable way. Analytical and
   experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TPSS in improving
   usefulness of sensory data and reliability of WSN for WSN-MCC
   integration.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we compare a touch-based human-to-robot command scheme
   with traditional button commands in a series of human-robot
   collaborative assembly tasks. We find a mapping between command style
   and task outcome that depends on task complexity and is influenced by
   robot ``feel.{''} In our direct touch-based scheme, the user commands
   the robot through direct physical contact by tapping and pushing the
   robot. With a small, compliant desktop robot and a simple, scripted,
   bolt insertion task, button commands performed slightly better than
   direct physical commands in quantitative task performance metrics and
   qualitative user preference. In a second study with a human-scale,
   stiffer robot arm, physical commands performed better than button
   commands in a more complex and less scripted bolt insertion task, which
   greatly outperformed using buttons in a cooperative positioning task. We
   conclude that commanding a robot through direct force-transmitting
   contact can decrease task completion time, aid in teamwork, and improve
   user experience in appropriately chosen tasks. We achieve our haptic
   commands using only robot position sensors, demonstrating that direct,
   intuitive physical command is an option for existing position-controlled
   industrial robots.}},

Abstract = {{The cerebellum plays an important role in motor control and is also
   involved in cognitive processes. Cerebellar function is specialized by
   location, although the exact topographic functional relationship is not
   fully understood. The spinocerebellar ataxias are a group of
   neurodegenerative diseases that cause regional atrophy in the
   cerebellum, yielding distinct motor and cognitive problems. The ability
   to study the region-specific atrophy patterns can provide insight into
   the problem of relating cerebellar function to location. In an effort to
   study these structural change patterns, we developed a toolbox in MATLAB
   to provide researchers a unique way to visually explore the correlation
   between cerebellar lobule shape changes and function loss, with a rich
   set of visualization and analysis modules. In this paper, we outline the
   functions and highlight the utility of the toolbox.
   The toolbox takes as input landmark shape representations of subjects'
   cerebellar substructures. A principal component analysis is used for
   dimension reduction. Following this, a linear discriminant analysis and
   a regression analysis can be performed to find the discriminant
   direction associated with a specific disease type, or the regression
   line of a specific functional measure can be generated. The
   characteristic structural change pattern of a disease type or of a
   functional score is visualized by sampling points on the discriminant or
   regression line. The sampled points are used to reconstruct synthetic
   cerebellar lobule shapes. We showed a few case studies highlighting the
   utility of the toolbox and we compare the analysis results with the
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{In performance based seismic design of structures, estimating the
   equivalent viscous damping (EVD) using a damping-ductility relationship
   is a major step. The seismic response of Shape Memory Alloy (SMA)
   reinforced concrete (RC) bridge pier is different from its traditional
   steel reinforced or post-tensioned counterparts. Due to its
   significantly different hysteretic response and material properties, it
   is necessary to estimate the EVD of SMA-RC pier and establish the
   damping-ductility relationship. An error in the estimation of equivalent
   viscous damping can lead to significant errors in the ductility demand
   of the designed pier. This study aims to develop expressions for
   equivalent viscous damping and damping-ductility relationship for SMA
   reinforced bridge pier when SMA rebars are used in the plastic hinge
   region of the bridge pier. New equivalent damping relations for five
   different bridge piers reinforced with five different types of SMAs have
   been developed. Nonlinear dynamic time history analyses were conducted
   on five different SMA-RC bridge piers using 100 ground motions. The
   accuracy of the new equivalent damping relation was assessed to ensure
   the applicability of the proposed relationships. Finally, a general
   expression was developed that can assist in estimating equivalent
   viscous damping for performance based seismic design of SMA reinforced
   bridge pier.}},

Abstract = {{Seismic base isolation is one of the most efficient ways to protect
   structures (e.g. buildings or bridges) from disastrous effects of
   earthquakes. Base-isolated structures are mostly being designed and
   constructed in developed countries such as United States, Italy, Japan,
   and New Zealand. In order to extend such applications to developing
   countries, new techniques are introduced by reducing the cost and
   improving the performance of earthquake protective systems. In this
   regard, advanced materials such as shape memory alloys (SMA) are
   implemented into base isolation mechanisms (e.g. elastomeric bearings)
   and efficient manufacturing processes are developed. When a new
   generation of smart elastomeric isolator is introduced, it is critical
   to assess its seismic performance under different ground motions. The
   goal of this study is to evaluate the seismic fragility of a multi-span
   continuous steel-girder bridge isolated by SMA wire-based natural rubber
   bearings (SMA-NRBs). Results show that equipping natural rubber bearing
   (NRB) with SMA wires decreases the probability of damage of the bridge.
   It means that the bridge system becomes less fragile when NRB is fitted
   with SMA wires.}},

Abstract = {{In the 2010 National Building Code of Canada (NRC 2010), certain
   structures can be designed for seismic loads using an equivalent static
   force procedure. In these provisions, elastic design forces are reduced
   by a ductility factor, Rd, which accounts for the ability of different
   systems to deform beyond yielding. The NBCC 2010, however, only provides
   ductility factors for traditional structural systems, including timber-
   or steel-based systems; there are currently no specific Rd factors for
   hybrid structural systems. Thus research is required to safely and
   efficiently design novel systems within the existing seismic design
   provisions. The FFTT system, an acronym for ``Finding the Forest Through
   the Trees{''} is an innovative building system proposed for high-rise
   timber-steel composite structures using mass timber panels connected
   with steel beams. This research presents nonlinear dynamic analyses to
   propose an Rd factor for design Option-1 of the FFTT system considering
   the uncertainties of structural mass, hold-down stiffness, and
   connection properties of the lateral load resisting system. Based on the
   analyses presented herein, a ductility factor of 5.0 is deemed
   reasonable for design Option-1 of the novel timber- steel hybrid system.}},

Abstract = {{In the past earthquakes, steel moment resisting frames suffered damage.
   Earthquake-induced damage in the main structural members, such as beams,
   and columns, leads to permanent deformations in buildings. The resulting
   permanent damage following earthquakes substantially increases repair
   costs. The repair of damaged buildings with extensive permanent
   deformations may not be economically feasible. Therefore, it is
   essential to eliminate the residual deformations while designing ductile
   beam-to-column connections. The seismic performance of steel buildings
   can be improved by allocating pre-specified elements in the building so
   as to dissipate the input energy and also provide self-centering (the
   ability to return the structure to its undeformed position). This paper
   presents a feasibility study of utilizing superelastic Shape Memory
   Alloy (SMA) plates in steel beam-column connections. Three-dimensional
   finite element models of steel beam-column subassemblies are generated
   to assess the efficiency of SMA-plates on the seismic behavior of
   connections. In this new application, SMA-plates are used in the plastic
   hinge region of the beam. The results of these finite element
   simulations are promising. The proposed connections with SMA plates
   could return to their original positions, while exhibiting a ductile
   behavior with good energy dissipation. Furthermore, the occurrence of
   local buckling in beam flanges was prevented in the new connections with
   SMA-plates.}},

Abstract = {{The superelastic shape memory alloy (SMA) rebar can significantly
   improve the seismic performance of reinforced concrete (RC) structures.
   This study was motivated from a blind prediction contest of a full-scale
   7-storey RC shear wall building at the University of California, San
   Diego. A finite element (FE) analysis was conducted to investigate the
   seismic performance of RC shear wall with the application of SMA rebar.
   The SMA rebar was applied at the plastic hinge location of the shear
   wall only and the steel rebar was used for all other sections. The
   seismic performance of shear wall was evaluated by performing
   incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) using 13 ground motions. The seismic
   demand was recorded in terms of inter-storey drift ratio until the full
   collapse of the building. The safety of the wall was measured in terms
   of collapse margin ratio (CMR) explicitly considering the uncertainty.
   The results show that the SMA rebar significantly improved the
   performance of the shear wall building and yielded higher CMR as
   compared to the conventional RC building.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-Laminated-Timber (CLT) is increasingly gaining popularity in
   residential and non-residential applications in North America. To use
   CLT as lateral load resisting system, individual panels need to be

   may be joined with a variety of options including the use of
   self-tapping-screws (STS) in surface splines and half-lap joints.
   Alternatively, STS can be installed at an angle to the plane allowing
   for simple butt joints and avoiding any machining. This study
   investigated the performance of CLT panel assemblies connected with STS
   under vertical shear loading. The three aforementioned options were
   applied to join 3ply and 5-ply CLT panels. A total of 60 mid-scale
   quasi-static shear tests were performed to determine and compare the
   connection performance in terms of strength, stiffness, and ductility.
   It was shown that - depending on the screw layout - either very stiff or
   very ductile joint performance can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Timber-Concrete Composite (TCC) systems have been employed as an
   efficient solution in medium span structural applications; their use
   remains largely confined to European countries. TCC systems are
   generally comprised of a timber and concrete element with a shear
   connection between. A large number of precedents for T-beam
   configurations exist; however, the growing availability of flat plate
   engineered wood products (EWPs) in North America has offered designers
   greater versatility in terms of floor plans and architectural expression
   in modern timber and hybrid structures. The opportunity exists to
   enhance the strength, stiffness, fire, and vibration performance of
   floors using these products by introducing a concrete topping, connected
   to the timber to form a composite. A research program at the University
   of British Columbia Vancouver investigates the performance of five
   different connector types (a post-installed screw system, cast-in
   screws, glued-in steel mesh, adhesive bonded, and mechanical
   interlocking) in three different EWPs (Cross-Laminated-Timber,
   Laminated-Veneer-Lumber, and Laminated-Strand-Lumber). Over 200

Abstract = {{\textbackslash{}The major difficulties faced with traditional structural
   bracing systems against seismic loading include compression buckling and
   permanent residual deformation under seismic loading. Once buckling
   occurs, the strength and stiffness of a brace gets significantly reduced
   and the stiffness degrades rapidly in subsequent load cycles. A
   significant number of researches have been conducted in resolving this
   issue and various ideas have been proposed and developed for the
   industry, e.g. buckling restrained brace, cast steel yielding fuse,
   SCED, MANSIDE, and RHDB braces, etc. Unfortunately, most of these
   solutions are expensive and complicated to construct. Authors here have
   proposed a novel approach in addressing this issue using a modification
   of a device commonly seen in mechanical systems, which is a
   cylinder-piston assembly. In this system, stiffness and re-centering are
   contributed by shape memory alloy ties. This study investigates the
   behavior of this innovative Piston Based Self-Centering (PBSC) bracing
   system in finite element environment. Utilizing this assembly, a brace
   member is able to carry large magnitude of tensile and compression
   loading without buckling. Furthermore, this brace is able to re-center
   after large nonlinear deformation. This paper presents the results of
   the analytical investigation carried out in ABAQUS software using finite
   element method. The load deformation hysteresis was determined and a
   flag shaped hysteresis was achieved, which indicates good re-centering
   capability of the proposed system.}},

   nonlinear behavior of the structure. Four typical high-rise steel
   buildings of 8, 12, 16 and 20 stories are designed and detailed using
   various seismic codes. Seismic response of the reference buildings is
   assessed with detailed fiber-based models using inelastic pushover and
   incremental dynamic analyses subject to 20 strong seismic records. The
   proposed study provides comparisons between different seismic design
   codes for the range of the reference buildings at different performance
   levels. This study may help the designers in optimizing their design in

Abstract = {{A refinement of the traditional Mine-to-Mill integration opportunity for
   copper block cave mines is introduced here as a Cave-to-Mill production
   management concept. This is essentially the integration of underground

   processing management based upon fragment size and geometallurgical ore
   characteristics. Cave-to-Mill defines ore block models with respect to
   both mine and mill performance. Linkages between key cave and mill
   parameters have been established so that coordinated efforts towards
   maximizing net present value (NPV) can be made. Discrete fracture
   network (DFN) based methods were found to hold significant value within
   the Cave-to-Mill approach. The variable and relatively uncontrollable
   nature of cave fragmentation is considered to be a key distinguishing
   feature of Cave-to-Mill when compared with typical Mine-to-Mill
   strategies established for open-pit mines. It is envisioned that
   Cave-to-Mill will be an important design and operational strategy for
   block cave mines.}},

Abstract = {{A major consideration in the design of high-capacity tiedown anchors for
   dams, bridges and tower foundations includes the tensile resistance of
   the rock mass to pullout typically as a result of overturning moments or
   hydrostatic uplift. Rock mass pullout capacity for installed anchors is
   developed from the tensile strength and fracture propagation properties
   of intact rock, the orientation and physical properties of the
   discontinuities and anchor confinement at depth. The typically assumed
   but conservative design approach is to assume that only the dead weight
   of a uniformly shaped inverted `rock pull out cone' provides resistance
   to anchor pullout with an assumed initiation point and breakout angle.
   It is appreciated that the `dead weight' cone assumption may be valid if
   the discontinuities are continuous and the geometry allows for a
   discrete block to form in the area of anchorage. However, if these
   persistent joints are not ubiquitously developed this failure mechanism
   may not represent the conditions across a foundation and can lead to a
   very conservative anchor designs. A less conservative approach is to
   consider the deadweight and the tensile strength across the surface area
   of the assumed pullout cones. Strength estimates are often estimated by
   a designer using correlations based on the Hoek-Brown failure criteria
   or the Barton Q-system. However, fundamental assumption of these
   empirical methods is that the discontinuities are sufficiently closely
   spaced such that the rock mass can be considered homogenous and
   isotropic - and this often not the case (Hoek, Carter and Diederichs
   2013). In reality, at the scale of many rock anchor pullout problems,
   the strength and deformation properties of the rock mass are
   anisotropic, controlled by a few persistent discontinuities and small
   `rock bridges' that exist between naturally occurring joints. To
   accommodate scale effects and the variability of jointing, this paper
   introduces a reliability-based design (RBD) approach for anchors that
   uses discrete fracture networks (DFNs) combined with numerical models.
   With this approach, limitations of the current practice for anchor
   design are addressed and opportunities are identified to optimise rock
   anchor designs provided that sufficient information is available to
   produce a representative DFN. Typically, this requires geological
   mapping to characterise the rock mass and verify the conditions at
   discrete anchor locations and in situ anchor testing can be carried out
   during construction.}},

Abstract = {{This work studied the feasibility of co-gasification of biosolids with
   biomass as a means of disposal with energy recovery. The kinetics study
   at 800 degrees C showed that biomass, such as switchgrass, could

   proportion of potassium, an excellent catalyst for gasification.
   However, biosolids could also inhibit gasification due to interaction
   between biomass alkali/ alkaline earth metals and biosolids clay

   biosolids in the feedstockaffected gasification performance negatively.
   Syngas yield and char conversion decreased from 1.38 to 0.47 m(3)/kg and
   82-36\% respectively as the biosolids proportion in the fuel increased
   from 0\% to 100\%. Over the same range, the tar content increased from
   10.3 to 200 g/m(3), while the ammonia concentration increased from 1660

Title = {{Intraoperative Registered Transrectal Ultrasound Guidance for

Abstract = {{Purpose: To provide unencumbered real-time ultrasound image guidance
   during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, we developed a
   robotic transrectal ultrasound system that tracks the da Vinci (R)
   Surgical System instruments. We describe our initial clinical experience
   with this system.
   Materials and Methods: After an evaluation in a canine model, 20
   patients were enrolled in the study. During each procedure the
   transrectal ultrasound transducer was manually positioned using a
   brachytherapy stabilizer to provide good imaging of the prostate. Then
   the transrectal ultrasound was registered to the da Vinci robot by a
   previously validated procedure. Finally, automatic rotation of the
   transrectal ultrasound was enabled such that the transrectal ultrasound
   imaging plane safely tracked the tip of the da Vinci instrument
   controlled by the surgeon, while real-time transrectal ultrasound images
   were relayed to the surgeon at the da Vinci console. Tracking was
   activated during all critical stages of the surgery.
   Results: The transrectal ultrasound robot was easy to set up and use,
   adding 7 minutes (range 5 to 14) to the procedure. It did not require an
   assistant or additional control devices. Qualitative feedback was
   acquired from the surgeons, who found transrectal ultrasound useful in
   identifying the urethra while passing the dorsal venous complex suture,
   defining the prostate-bladder interface during bladder neck dissection,
   identifying the seminal vesicles and their location with respect to the
   rectal wall, and identifying the distal prostate boundary at the apex.
   Conclusions: Real-time, registered robotic transrectal ultrasound
   guidance with automatic instrument tracking during robot-assisted
   laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is feasible and potentially useful.
   The results justify further studies to establish whether the approach
   can improve procedure outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundTreatment of neuroblastoma with targeted immunotherapy using
   chimeric anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies (ch14.18) is associated with
   significant pain requiring management with a high-dose opioid infusion.
   We present a case series of six children, for whom dexmedetomidine and
   hydromorphone infusions safely and effectively reduced the pain of
   ch14.18 therapy in the oncology ward setting.
   ProcedureThe ch14.18 infusion is administered for 10hr over four
   consecutive days in each of 5 cycles. Hydromorphone
   (2-8mcg.kg(-1).hr(-1)) and dexmedetomidine (0.1-0.6mcg.kg(-1).hr(-1))
   infusions were commenced 1hr before starting ch14.18 immunotherapy and
   titrated to optimal clinical effect. One hour after stopping the ch14.18
   infusion, dexmedetomidine was discontinued and hydromorphone weaned as
   tolerated. This strategy was supervised by the Acute Pain Service with
   strict monitoring and nursing policies. Patient charts were reviewed for
   evidence of side effects and quality of analgesia.
   ResultsData from six patients, with median (range) age of 3.5 (2-12)
   years are reported. Median (range) utilization of hydromorphone was 2.9
   (2.0-4.7) mcg.kg(-1).hr(-1), and of dexmedetomidine was 0.17 (0.10-0.20)
   mcg.kg(-1).hr(-1). A drop in mean arterial pressure 30\% below baseline
   was identified during 30\% of treatment days, but only prompted
   interrupting or reducing the ch14.18 infusion on 7\% of treatment days;
   only one episode of grade 3 hypotension was recorded during this series.
   Hypoxemia occurred during 8\% and bradycardia during 4\% of treatment
   days.
   ConclusionsDexmedetomidine infusion may be an effective and safe pain
   management adjunct to opioid therapy for the pain of ch14.18 infusion.

   flows, when present, can have a significant impact on solid melting
   behavior in a system where forced convection is not significant. The
   various flow drivers influence the development of the interfacial
   boundary layer and impact on heat and mass transfer. Thus application of
   empirical-based heat and mass transfer coefficients will be prone to

Abstract = {{In this article, a new analytical approach for the deflection analysis
   of yarns in woven materials under tensile loading is presented. A unit
   cell of a warp yarn surrounded by adjacent weft yarns is modeled using
   curved beams. Next, using the Winkler theory of curved beams, the warp
   yarn strain energy under tensile loading is derived; followed by the
   implementation of the variational method to obtain the governing
   equations as well as related boundary conditions. The exact displacement
   field solution was found and using the continuity of deflection
   condition at crossover points, the normal inter-yarn contact force was
   estimated. In the proposed analytical approach, shear forces and
   potential slippage of yarns at contact points are neglected. The
   validation of the solution was checked by comparing results of a
   benchmark example on steel textile preforms to two sets of finite
   element simulations. For further evaluation of the approach, the
   uniaxial extension response of a polypropylene/glass woven fabric
   composite with a noncircular yarn cross section is also considered under
   large deformation and predictions are compared to earlier data in the
   literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It has been reported that since year 2000, there have been an average
   700 water main breaks per day only in Canada and the USA costing more
   than CAD 10 billions/year. Moreover, water main leaks affect other
   neighboring infrastructure that may lead to catastrophic failures. For
   this, municipality authorities or stakeholders are more concerned about
   preventive actions rather reacting to failure events. This paper
   presents a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model to evaluate the risk of
   failure of metallic water mains using structural integrity, hydraulic
   capacity, water quality, and consequence factors. BBN is a probabilistic
   graphical model that represents a set of variables and their
   probabilistic relationships, which also captures historical information
   about these dependencies. The proposed model is capable of ranking water
   mains within distribution network that can identify vulnerable and
   sensitive pipes to justify proper decision action for
   maintenance/rehabilitation/replacement (M/R/R). To demonstrate the
   application of proposed model, water distribution network of City of
   Kelowna has been studied. Result indicates that almost 9\% of the total
   259 metallic pipes are at high risk in both summer and winter. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper determines the seismic performance of four-storey
   concentrically braced frames equipped with either steel
   buckling-restrained braces or buckling-restrained superelastic shape
   memory alloy (SMA) braces through incremental dynamic analysis. The
   incremental dynamic analysis technique is used to examine the behaviour
   of four-storey braced frames with four different bracing configurations
   (including diagonal, split-X, chevron-V and inverted-V) under 20
   different ground motion records. The study reveals a satisfactory
   performance at the design intensity level for both types of braced
   frames. The results show that the SMA braces lead to a uniform
   distribution of inelastic response over the height of the buildings, as
   well as mitigating seismic response in terms of maximum inter-storey
   drift and residual roof displacement. By comparing the responses of SMA
   and buckling-restrained braced frames under higher intensities of
   earthquake loading, it is found that the SMA braces can be more
   beneficial especially under severe ground motion excitations. Copyright

Title = {{A survey of stakeholder perspectives on exoskeleton technology}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Exoskeleton technology has potential benefits for wheelchair
   users' health and mobility. However, there are practical barriers to
   their everyday use as a mobility device. To further understand potential
   exoskeleton use, and facilitate the development of new technologies, a
   study was undertaken to explore perspectives of wheelchair users and
   healthcare professionals on reasons for use of exoskeleton technology,
   and the importance of a variety of device characteristics.
   Methods: An online survey with quantitative and qualitative components
   was conducted with wheelchair users and healthcare professionals working
   directly with individuals with mobility impairments. Respondents rated
   whether they would use or recommend an exoskeleton for four potential
   reasons. Seventeen design features were rated and compared in terms of
   their importance. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to
   categorize the 17 design features into meaningful groupings. Content
   analysis was used to identify themes for the open ended questions
   regarding reasons for use of an exoskeleton.
   Results: 481 survey responses were analyzed, 354 from wheelchair users
   and 127 from healthcare professionals. The most highly rated reason for
   potential use or recommendation of an exoskeleton was health benefits.
   Of the design features, 4 had a median rating of very important:
   minimization of falls risk, comfort, putting on/taking off the device,
   and purchase cost. Factor analysis identified two main categories of
   design features: Functional Activities and Technology Characteristics.
   Qualitative findings indicated that health and physical benefits, use
   for activity and access reasons, and psychosocial benefits were
   important considerations in whether to use or recommend an exoskeleton.
   Conclusions: This study emphasizes the importance of developing future
   exoskeletons that are comfortable, affordable, minimize fall risk, and
   enable functional activities. Findings from this study can be utilized
   to inform the priorities for future development of this technology.}},

Abstract = {{Drug discovery for malaria has been transformed in the last 5 years by
   the discovery of many new lead compounds identified by phenotypic
   screening. The process of developing these compounds as drug leads and
   studying the cellular responses they induce is revealing new targets
   that regulate key processes in the Plasmodium parasites that cause
   malaria. We disclose herein that the clinical candidate (+)-SJ733 acts
   upon one of these targets, ATP4. ATP4 is thought to be a
   cation-transporting ATPase responsible for maintaining low intracellular
   Na+ levels in the parasite. Treatment of parasitized erythrocytes with
   (+)-SJ733 in vitro caused a rapid perturbation of Na+ homeostasis in the
   parasite. This perturbation was followed by profound physical changes in
   the infected cells, including increased membrane rigidity and
   externalization of phosphatidylserine, consistent with eryptosis
   (erythrocyte suicide) or senescence. These changes are proposed to
   underpin the rapid (+)-SJ733-induced clearance of parasites seen in
   vivo. Plasmodium falciparum ATPase 4 (pfatp4) mutations that confer
   resistance to (+)-SJ733 carry a high fitness cost. The speed with which
   (+)-SJ733 kills parasites and the high fitness cost associated with
   resistance-conferring mutations appear to slow and suppress the
   selection of highly drug-resistant mutants in vivo. Together, our data
   suggest that inhibitors of PfATP4 have highly attractive features for
   fast-acting antimalarials to be used in the global eradication campaign.}},

Abstract = {{The well documented inaccuracy of conventional two fluid modeling of
   hydrodynamics in fluidized beds of Geldart Group A particles is
   revisited. A new force balance (FB) sub-grid-scale model, applied to the
   conventional Wen-Yu drag correlation, analyzes the balance of van der
   Waals, drag, gravity and buoyancy forces. It predicts formation of
   agglomerates inside the bed, updating the drag calculations by applying
   a correction factor to the conventional drag models to account for
   agglomerate formation. Good predictions were obtained of fluidization
   regimes and bed expansion, and there was promising agreement with
   experimental time average radial voidage profiles reported by Dubrawski
   et al. (2013). Good quantitative agreement between DEM and two-fluid
   predictions of minimum bubbling velocity was also observed when the
   model was used to predict minimum bubbling velocity, in contrast to the
   predictions from a non-cohesive, Wen-Yu model. Further evaluation
   studies are required to test the ability of the new model to predict the
   properties of larger-scale fluidized beds. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Spinal cord injury (SCI) biomechanics suggest that the mechanical
   factors of impact depth and speed affect the severity of contusion
   injury, but their interaction is not well understood. The primary aim of
   this work was to examine both the individual and combined effects of
   impact depth and speed in contusion SCI on the cervical spinal cord.
   Spinal cord contusions between C5 and C6 were produced in anesthetized
   rats at impact speeds of 8, 80, or 800 mm/s with displacements of 0.9 or
   1.5 mm (n=8/group). After 7 days postinjury, rats were assessed for
   open-field behavior, euthanized, and spinal cords were harvested. Spinal
   cord tissue sections were stained for demyelination (myelin-based
   protein) and tissue sparing (Luxol fast blue). In parallel, a finite
   element model of rat spinal cord was used to examine the resulting
   maximum principal strain in the spinal cord during impact. Increasing
   impact depth from 0.9 to 1.5 mm reduced open-field scores (p<0.01) above
   80 mm/s, reduced gray (GM) and white matter (WM) sparing (p<0.01), and
   increased the amount of demyelination (p<0.01). Increasing impact speed
   showed similar results at the 1.5-mm impact depth, but not the 0.9-mm
   impact depth. Linear correlation analysis with finite element analysis
   strain showed correlations (p<0.001) with nerve fiber damage in the
   ventral (R-2=0.86) and lateral (R-2=0.74) regions of the spinal cord and
   with WM (R-2=0.90) and GM (R-2=0.76) sparing. The results demonstrate
   that impact depth is more important in determining the severity of SCI
   and that threshold interactions exist between impact depth and speed.}},

Abstract = {{The compositional dependence of the fundamental bandgap of pseudomorphic
   GaAs1-xBix layers on GaAs substrates is studied at room temperature by
   optical transmission and photoluminescence spectroscopies. All
   GaAs1-xBix films (0 <= x <= 17.8\%) show direct optical bandgaps, which
   decrease with increasing Bi content, closely following density
   functional theory predictions. The smallest measured bandgap is 0.52 eV
   (similar to 2.4 mu m) at 17.8\% Bi. Extrapolating a fit to the data, the
   GaAs1-xBix bandgap is predicted to reach 0 eV at 35\% Bi. Below the
   GaAs1-xBix bandgap, exponential absorption band tails are observed with
   Urbach energies 3-6 times larger than that of bulk GaAs. The Urbach
   parameter increases with Bi content up to 5.5\% Bi, and remains constant
   at higher concentrations. The lattice constant and Bi content of
   GaAs1-xBix layers (0 < x <= 19.4\%) are studied using high resolution
   x-ray diffraction and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy. The
   relaxed lattice constant of hypothetical zincblende GaBi is estimated to
   be 6.33 +/- 0.05 angstrom, from extrapolation of the Rutherford
   backscattering spectrometry and x-ray diffraction data. (C) 2014 AIP

   representing different air sparging conditions (continuous coarse
   bubble, intermittent coarse bubble, and large pulse bubble) was applied
   in combination with various backwash frequencies (0.5, 2, and 6 hours)
   during UF of two natural surface waters. Results indicated that air
   sparging during permeation with intermittent coarse or large pulse
   bubbles significantly reduced the rate of irreversible fouling. This
   allowed for longer permeation times (up to 6 hours) between backwashing,
   when compared to a baseline condition which assumed a 0.5 h-backwash
   frequency with no air sparging during permeation. As a result, operation
   and maintenance cost savings estimated at > \$350,000/year for a 29 MLD
   membrane train could be realized. This study demonstrates that optimized
   air sparging could serve as a cost-effective UF fouling control strategy
   for drinking water production.}},

Abstract = {{Ironic as it sounds, the pharmaceutical industry is ailing. Despite
   doubling their R\&D expenditures over the past decade, innovator drug
   companies have struggled to increase their annual drug approval rates.
   Worse still, candidate attrition rates and development times actually
   rose during this period. It now costs well in excess of a billion
   dollars and takes over a decade to discover and develop a new drug. A
   variety of prognostications have been made regarding the future course
   that the pharmaceutical industry might take, but none has been as
   controversial as the suggestion that small-molecule drugs could
   disappear by 2030. Rest assured that these claims could not be further
   from the truth. Herein, I outline how biocatalysis and metabolic
   engineering could drive the next wave of innovation in small-molecule
   drug discovery. The recent past has witnessed staggering developments in
   analytical chemistry, genome sequencing and assembly, flow chemistry,
   chemi- and bioinformatics, metabolic engineering and synthetic
   chemistry, as well as exponential improvements in the raw computing
   power that is available for drug research; integrating these parallel
   innovations into a single platform could translate a vastly higher
   number of small-molecule drugs to the bedside. I term this integrated
   approach as biosynthonics. Many of its individual elements are already
   in use drug discovery and development, albeit in a scattered manner, and
   despite the substantial progress that has occurred in each individual
   domain, a lot still remains to be achieved if biosynthonics is to become
   a broad platform for generating focused libraries of natural
   product-like molecules. It is hoped that this article spurs debate and
   future collaborations toward achieving these goals, which, if
   successful, would undoubtedly improve small-molecule R\&D productivity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates effects of ducting on power output from vertical
   axis hydro-current turbines. A numerical two-dimensional method based on
   the potential flow theory is developed for calculation of
   non-dimensional power output from these turbines. In this method, the
   blades are represented by vortex filaments. The vortex shedding from the
   blades is modeled by discrete vortices. A boundary element method is
   used to incorporate the duct shape which is represented by a series of
   panels with constant distributions of sources and doublets. The
   aerodynamic loading on the blades are calculated using a quasi-steady
   modeling. A time-marching scheme is used for implementation of the
   numerical method. The results of this method are compared with
   experimental results for a turbine model. A good correlation between the
   numerical and experimental results is obtained for tip speed ratios
   equal and higher than 2.25. However due to a lack of dynamic stall
   modeling, the numerical method is not able to predict power output
   accurately at lower tip speed ratios wherein effects of dynamic stall
   are significant. Both numerical and experimental results also showed
   that the power output from a turbine can increase significantly when it
   is enclosed within a well-designed duct. The maximum power output of the
   turbine model investigated in this paper showed a 74\% increase when the
   turbine is operating within the duct relative to the case it is in
   free-stream conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the impact of external noise sources, including
   interfering transmitters, on a diffusive molecular communication system,
   where the impact is measured as the number of noise molecules expected
   to be observed at a passive receiver. A unifying model for noise,
   multiuser interference, and intersymbol interference is presented,
   where, under certain circumstances, interference can be approximated as
   a noise source that is emitting continuously. The model includes the
   presence of advection and molecule degradation. The time-varying and
   asymptotic impact is derived for a series of special cases, some of
   which facilitate closed-form solutions. Simulation results show the
   accuracy of the expressions derived for the impact of a
   continuously-emitting noise source, and show how approximating old
   intersymbol interference as a noise source can simplify the calculation
   of the expected bit error probability of a weighted sum detector.}},

Abstract = {{The gap between processor and memory performance has become a focal
   point for microprocessor research and development over the past three
   decades. Modern architectures use two orthogonal approaches to help
   alleviate this issue: (1) Almost every microprocessor includes some form
   of on-chip storage, usually in the form of caches, to decrease memory
   latency and make more effective use of limited memory bandwidth. (2)
   Massively multithreaded architectures, such as graphics processing units
   (GPUs), attempt to hide the high latency to memory by rapidly switching
   between many threads directly in hardware. This paper explores the
   intersection of these two techniques. We study the effect of
   accelerating highly parallel workloads with significant locality on a
   massively multithreaded GPU. We observe that the memory access stream
   seen by on-chip caches is the direct result of decisions made by the
   hardware thread scheduler. Our work proposes a hardware scheduling
   technique that reacts to feedback from the memory system to create a
   more cache-friendly access stream. We evaluate our technique using
   simulations and show a significant performance improvement over
   previously proposed scheduling mechanisms. We demonstrate the
   effectiveness of scheduling as a cache management technique by comparing
   cache hit rate using our scheduler and an LRU replacement policy against
   other scheduling techniques using an optimal cache replacement policy.}},

   theory-based equations of state applied to hard chain mixtures. The
   theory is extended to mixtures and compared to molecular simulation
   data. The comparison to molecular simulation data shows good to
   excellent results for phase co-existence properties, energy and
   effective dipole moment. The validity of the theory is demonstrated by
   studying VLE of highly non-ideal mixtures of aldehyde and ketones using

Abstract = {{This study was conducted as part of the development of a novel process
   for copper recovery from copper sulfide concentrates by chloride
   leaching, simultaneous cuprous oxidation and cupric solvent extraction
   to transfer copper to a conventional sulfate electrowinning circuit and
   hematite precipitation to reject iron. Four LIX reagents (LIX84-I,
   LIX612N-LV, XI-04003 and LIX984N) were used as extractants while
   kerosene was used as a diluent. Copper was effectively extracted into
   LIX reagent organic solution from chloride solution. However, iron
   coextraction exceeded 0.5 g/L. Two-stage countercurrent solvent
   extraction is proposed to reduce iron extraction. In the first stage,
   copper-loaded organic solution was pre-scrubbed by contacting with the
   cuprous and ferrous chloride pregnant leach solution. The extent of iron
   removal increased from 78 to 91 to 95\% with decreasing pH from 1.0 to
   0.5 to 0.0 while the extent of copper removal increased from 1 to 17 to
   36\%. Although more iron was removed at a pH below 0.5, copper was
   removed to an unacceptable level. Therefore, it is recommended that pH
   should be controlled around 1.0 to remove the bulk of the loaded iron
   while avoiding excessive copper stripping. In the second solvent
   extraction stage, copper is loaded into the organic solution by
   simultaneous cuprous oxidation by oxygen and cupric extraction. After
   two-stage counter current solvent extraction, the organic solution was
   further scrubbed by contacting with copper sulfate (4 g/L Cu) and
   sulfuric acid (15 g/L) solution. The iron extraction was reduced to a
   satisfactory level at an A/O ratio of 1/40 to 1/20 while the copper
   extraction practically did not change. The Cu/Fe ratio in the
   copper-loaded organic solution can meet the industrial requirement. (C)

Abstract = {{The consumption of manganese in a zinc electrowinning cell house is
   examined using a process simulation coupled with industrial cell house
   data. A cell house of a major industrial producer of zinc was simulated
   using process simulation software. Process data was input in to the
   simulation on a simulated hourly basis to provide a simulation which
   appropriately represented the dynamic process. A small amount of
   dissolved manganese is desired in a zinc electrowinning electrolyte in
   order to reduce corrosion of the anodes by the formation of a thin layer
   of manganese dioxide. The manganese consumption was followed through a
   major change in the Mn concentration. The consumption rate of manganese
   ions from solution was found to vary between 8 x 10(-7) and 4 x 10(-7)
   mol s(-1) m(-2) on PbAg anodes. During shut downs, aqueous manganese
   concentration was not reduced. Larger rates of manganese consumption
   were found to be associated with lower concentration ratios of manganese
   ions to chloride ions in the electrolyte. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The electrospun microfibers of high-viscosity polyacrylonitrile (PAN)
   solution possess stronger tensile strength, but poor
   electrospinnability. Sonication treatment was introduced to improve the
   electrospinnability of highviscosity PAN solution. The influences of
   sonication time on the solution properties, including dynamic
   rheological properties, electric conductivity and surface tension, as
   well as the deformation of Taylor cone and electrospinning jet whipping
   behavior were investigated. The surface morphology of the resultant
   fibers was observed using scanning electron microscope, and the
   mechanical properties of the fiber mats were measured through tensile
   test. The experimental results indicated that the electrospinnability of
   the PAN solution was significantly improved by the sonication treatment
   due to the improved rheological properties, increased electric
   conductivity and reduced surface tension. It was also found that
   sonication treatment could elongate the Taylor cone and drastically
   intensify the whipping instability of the electrospinning jet. When the
   solution was treated for 4 min (720 W), the average diameter of the
   obtained electrospun PAN fibers reduced from 3,180.46 to 2,657.23 nm as
   the unevenness rate reduced from 16.38 to 15.27 \%. The tensile strength
   of microfiber mats increased from 2.50 to 6.61 MPa, showing an increment
   of 164 \%, while the Young's modulus is strengthened fivefold,
   increasing from 39.49 to 248.97 MPa.}},

Abstract = {{In the development of the next generation of smart homes and remote
   health monitoring system, human action analyzing algorithms are of vital
   importance. Among different sensor technologies, vision-based systems
   are superior in the sense that they can provide a non-intrusive
   interface between human occupants and the environment. It is almost
   impossible to build an efficient system for human action recognition
   without fine-tuning and evaluating its performance on a realistic
   dataset. An important challenge here is the absence of such a
   comprehensive dataset. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset
   designed for human action recognition applications in a smart home
   environment. The performance of the existing human action recognition
   algorithms is tested using this dataset. In addition, we propose a
   heuristic approach based on error-correction codes to prioritized
   different actions in the learning process and improve the recognition
   accuracy for difficult actions up to 17\%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Title = {{Merging pathology with biomechanics using CHIMERA (Closed-Head Impact
   Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration): a novel, surgery-free
   model of traumatic brain injury}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR NEURODEGENERATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health care concern
   that currently lacks any effective treatment. Despite promising outcomes
   from many preclinical studies, clinical evaluations have failed to
   identify effective pharmacological therapies, suggesting that the
   translational potential of preclinical models may require improvement.
   Rodents continue to be the most widely used species for preclinical TBI
   research. As most human TBIs result from impact to an intact skull,
   closed head injury (CHI) models are highly relevant, however,
   traditional CHI models suffer from extensive experimental variability
   that may be due to poor control over biomechanical inputs. Here we
   describe a novel CHI model called CHIMERA (Closed-Head Impact Model of
   Engineered Rotational Acceleration) that fully integrates biomechanical,
   behavioral, and neuropathological analyses. CHIMERA is distinct from
   existing neurotrauma model systems in that it uses a completely
   non-surgical procedure to precisely deliver impacts of prescribed
   dynamic characteristics to a closed skull while enabling kinematic
   analysis of unconstrained head movement. In this study, we characterized
   head kinematics as well as functional, neuropathological, and
   biochemical outcomes up to 14d following repeated TBI (rTBI) in adult
   C57BL/6 mice using CHIMERA.
   Results: Head kinematic analysis showed excellent repeatability over two
   closed head impacts separated at 24h. Injured mice showed significantly
   prolonged loss of righting reflex and displayed neurological, motor, and
   cognitive deficits along with anxiety-like behavior. Repeated TBI led to
   diffuse axonal injury with extensive microgliosis in white matter from
   2-14d post-rTBI. Injured mouse brains also showed significantly
   increased levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta and increased endogenous tau
   phosphorylation.
   Conclusions: Repeated TBI using CHIMERA mimics many of the functional
   and pathological characteristics of human TBI with a reliable
   biomechanical response of the head. This makes CHIMERA well suited to
   investigate the pathophysiology of TBI and for drug development
   programs.}},

Abstract = {{We numerically study the displacement flow of two iso-viscous Newtonian
   fluids in an inclined two-dimensional channel, formed by two parallel
   plates. The results are complementary to our previous studies on
   displacement flows in pipes and channels. The heavier displacing fluid
   moves the lighter displaced fluid in the downward direction. Three
   dimensionless groups largely describe these flows: the densimetric
   Froude number (Fr), the Reynolds number (Re), and the duct inclination
   (beta). As a first order approximation, we are able to classify
   different flow regimes phenomenologically in a two-dimensional (Fr; Re
   cos beta/Fr)-plane and provide leading order expressions for the
   transitions between different regimes. The stabilizing and/or
   de-stabilizing effects of the imposed mean flow on buoyant exchange
   flows (zero imposed velocity) are described for a broad range of
   dimensionless parameters. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study rate allocation mechanisms that allocate
   available transmission rate of a particular secondary user (SU) among
   its different classes of services assuming that a specific channel
   assignment algorithm across active SUs is in place. In particular, we
   formulate the rate allocation mechanism of a SU between its two
   different classes of services namely, delay sensitive (DS) and best
   effort (BE) services as a Markov decision process. Then the optimal rate
   allocation mechanism that minimizes the average queuing delay of DS
   packets while guaranteeing the packet loss probabilities of both classes
   of packets is obtained using a linear programming technique. Since the
   optimal rate allocation mechanism can be complex for implementation in a
   SU device due to its probabilistic nature, we also study a
   low-complexity suboptimal rate allocation mechanism. For this suboptimal
   scheme, we develop a queuing analytic model to measure and compare
   different data-link layer performance parameters e.g., packet loss
   probability and queuing delay distribution. The developed analytic model
   for the suboptimal scheme is further useful for a call admission
   decision. We compare the performances of the suboptimal rate allocation
   mechanism with its optimal counterpart. Presented simulation results
   show that the suboptimal mechanism has a quite similar performance as
   the optimal mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional two-channel ITM (ion transport membrane) reactors applied
   to oxy-combustion, face the potential drawback of high thermal gradients
   and high local temperatures, which can result in membrane damage. In
   such reactors, air flows on the feed side and fuel are introduced on the
   permeate side, where it reacts with the permeated oxygen. In this work,
   we propose to use a three-channel configuration in which a porous plate
   is used to separate the permeate stream from the fuel stream, allowing
   the fuel to diffuse gradually into the permeate side. The gradual
   combustion of the fuel results in a slow temperature rise and a more
   spatially uniform temperature distribution along the membrane. We model
   this three-channel reactor using computational fluid dynamics and
   compare its performance to a conventional two-channel reactor. It is
   shown that, indeed, in case of a two-channel reactor, a high temperature
   zone is concentrated near the inlet, whereas the three-channel reactor
   produces a milder temperature gradient along the reactor length. The
   more-uniform heat flux associated with the latter results in a moderate
   temperature distribution and reduction in the wall shear stress along
   the channels and the associated pressure drop. The more uniform
   temperature distribution should be less damaging to the membrane. The
   reaction zone associated with the gradual fuel diffusion into the sweep
   side improves the membrane performance by maintaining a more uniform
   oxygen flux. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1275-1301}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To better understand the dynamics of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in
   environmental flows, their evolution is investigated using direct
   numerical simulations (DNS). Two-dimensional DNS is used to examine the
   large-scale and small-scale structures of the instability at high
   Reynolds and Prandtl numbers that represent real environmental flows.
   The semi-analytical model of Corcos and Sherman (J Fluid Mech
   73:241-264, 1976) is used to explain the physics of these simulations
   prior to saturation of the KH billow, and also provide a computationally
   efficient prediction of the vortex dynamics of the instability. The DNS
   results show that the large-scale structure of the billow does not
   depend on the Reynolds number for sufficiently high Reynolds numbers.
   The billow structure reveals a less straightforward dependence on the
   Prandtl number. Predictions of the model of Corcos and Sherman (J Fluid
   Mech 73:241-264, 1976) improve as Reynolds number and Prandtl number
   increase. The small-scale structure of the vorticity and density fields
   vary with both Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. Three-dimensional DNS of KH
   flows and their transition to turbulence are used to study small length
   scales. Based on the thickness of the braid, a simple method is
   introduced to estimate the Batchelor scale, which can be used as a guide
   for the resolution required for the direct numerical simulation of two
   and three-dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz flow fields.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundAccurate localization of bone surfaces remains a challenge
   hampering adoption of ultrasound guidance in computer-assisted
   orthopaedic surgery. Local phase image features have recently been
   proven efficacious for segmenting bone surfaces from ultrasound images,
   but the quality of the processing depends on numerous filter parameters
   that are currently set through a trial and error process that is
   tedious, unintuitive and subject to large inter-user variability.
   MethodsA method is presented for automatically selecting parameters of
   Log-Gabor filters used to extract bone surfaces from 3D ultrasound
   volumes that is based on properties estimated directly from the specific
   image.
   ResultsA 15\% and 69\% average improvement in bone surface localization
   accuracy on phantom and clinical data, respectively, is demonstrated
   compared with empirically-set parameters.

   containing a matrix of bicarbonate and carbonate concentrations at 298
   K. The slow 0.05mV/s potentiodynamic scans revealed that the passivation
   onsets earlier in proportion with the bicarbonate concentrations,
   possessing accordingly greater immunity against chloride ions on HAZs
   cooled at 10 and 60 K/s from 1223 K peak temperature. The HAZs cooled at
   10 K/s, particularly in concentrated carbonate solutions, showed the
   most stable passivation, and the HAZs cooled at 60 K/s showed the lowest
   cathodic activity regardless of the chemical conditions. 0.1 V, versus
   saturated calomel electrode, potentiostatic currents and the
   open-circuit potentials decreased and increased, respectively, with the
   carbonate concentration, confirming with the main potentiodynamic

Abstract = {{Considering the limitations of satellite communication systems and
   advantages of new emerging interleave-division multiple access (IDMA)
   technology, IDMA is introduced into the satellite systems, providing a
   new solution for multiple access techniques of satellite systems. To
   further validate the IDMA into satellite systems, a novel medium access
   control (MAC) scheme is proposed. In the random access channel, the
   interleave-division slotted ALOHA method is adopted to alleviate the
   collision of access requests. Furthermore, a novel minimum power
   allocation scheme based on signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
   (SINR) evolution is proposed to maximize the capacity of such an
   interference-sensitive system. By virtue of SINR evolution, our proposed
   scheme can accurately estimate multi-user detection efficiency with low
   computational cost and further reduce the transmitted power,
   illustrating the high power efficiency of IDMA. To further enhance the
   performance of the MAC protocol, an effective call admission control
   scheme considering the effect of power control error is designed and
   combined into our MAC protocol. Analysis and simulation results show
   that, by taking full advantage of the chip-by-chip multi-user detection
   technique, the proposed IDMA MAC protocol achieves high throughput and
   low average packet delay simultaneously, with low onboard processing
   complexity in the multi-beam satellite communication systems. Copyright

Abstract = {{Artisanal gold mining amalgams from the Munhena mine in Manica province,
   Mozambique were burned under laboratory conditions to determine the
   ratio of mercury to sponge gold. When compared to established phase
   diagrams of the mercury-gold alloy, the results indicate that all miners
   actually form a mixture of amalgam and excess mercury. The variability
   in mass percentage of mercury in each artisanal amalgam is indicative of
   the techniques used by individual miners to form their amalgam. Removal
   of excess mercury prior to the burning process will greatly reduce the
   amount of mercury evolved during the mining process. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{A practical approach for the management of resources and reserves in
   Small-Scale Mining}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},

Volume = {{84}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Artisanal (ASM) and Small-Scale Mining (SSM) are well-known sources of
   environmental, health and safety risk. Nonetheless, due to the massive
   increase in the price of gold in the last few years, ASM and SSM units
   have rapidly appeared and are operating in many remote locations around
   the world. This trend is bound to last, since there are no valid
   alternative livelihoods for the operators in the sector, and the
   attractiveness of the profit does not counterpoise any concern about the
   environment or safety. The most viable solution for such activities is a
   shift towards responsible operations. This can be done by turning an ASM
   operation into a sustainable and profitable SSM industrial extractive
   unit. For doing so capital investment is needed from external investors.
   The main task, therefore, is to make ASM attractive for investment. The
   approach proposed in this work is based on a main differential from
   large-scale mining: the attractiveness for external investment only lies
   in proving, in the early stages of the business, a minimum mineral
   reserve that is able to rapidly return the investment committed to
   upgrade the artisanal operation into a small-scale industrial one, plus
   an attractive profit. This is done by introducing the concepts of
   ``minimal reserve to be proved{''} and ``replication{''}. The paper
   proposes a practical methodology for the evaluation of the minimal
   reserve to be proved, based on mining and processing CAPEX and OPEX. A
   portion of the profits of the operation on such minimal reserve is to be
   shared between the stakeholders of the business, and another is to be
   re-invested in future exploration. With this last share, the process of
   proving the reserve can be consequently replicated to the next portion
   of the mineral resource. This methodology is applied to prove viable a
   real SSM unit in Ecuador. The results are compared with large-scale
   reserve estimations: the order of magnitude of the volume that needs to
   be proved at the start to make the operation viable varies by 1/1000 in
   favor of SSM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{154-164}},

Abstract = {{The enzyme taxadiene synthase of the paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway
   cyclizes geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) to produce taxadiene, which
   is then believed to be stereo- and regiospecifically oxidized by
   taxadiene 5 alpha-hydroxylase to form taxadien-5 alpha-ol. However, when
   the metabolism of Escherichia coli was re-engineered in the present
   study to express both aforementioned plant enzymes, it was observed that
   taxadiene 5 alpha hydroxylase acts on 4 substrates and forms 12
   products, of which taxadien-5 alpha-ol is only a minor constituent.
   Additionally, 2 of the 4 substrates of taxadiene 5 alpha-hydroxylase are
   products of taxadiene synthase, and it is very likely that this behavior
   by the two enzymes is independent of the host. Enzyme multispecificity
   and promiscuity are entirely new propositions in metabolic engineering,
   and canonical enzyme engineering strategies for modulating the activity
   of enzymes are largely inapplicable for addressing this phenomenon. To
   this end, a novel computational methodology was specifically developed
   to investigate the catalytic mechanism of taxadiene 5 alpha
   u-hydroxylase - hereinafter re-christened as taxadiene monooxygenase -
   and potentially guide rational re-engineering of its active site. The
   methodology could be extended to other P450 systems, is faster, and
   comparably insightful as more elaborate structure-guided approaches such
   as X-crystallography. In addition, the methodology can also be used to
   infer the influence of mutations in the active site of the enzyme on its
   catalytic promiscuity. The insights provided by such computational
   analyses of multispecificity and promiscuity could greatly enhance the
   scope and impact of enzyme engineering for over-production of plant
   secondary metabolites in microorganisms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Security issues of free-space optical (FSO) communications are
   discussed. Based on a subcarrier intensity-modulated air-to-ground FSO
   system model, we first analyze the coherence time of the air-to-ground

   reciprocity holds in the FSO communication system. A private
   secret-key-based cryptosystem with key management is introduced to
   enhance FSO security, and a key agreement approach is proposed based on
   statistics of the random atmospheric-turbulence-induced fading channel
   measurements. The secret key rate of the key agreement scheme is
   investigated for the gamma-gamma turbulence model. Practical key
   agreement protocols based on bidirectional channel identification are
   designed for different FSO communication scenarios. Our numerical
   results reveal that the key rate is not sensitive to the strength of the
   atmospheric turbulence; the per-symbol signal-to-noise ratio and the
   training sequence length are the dominating factors.}},

Abstract = {{We show that a classical imaging criterion based on angular dependence
   of small-angle phase can be applied to any system composed of planar,
   uniform media to determine if it is a flat lens capable of forming a
   real paraxial image and to estimate the image location. The real
   paraxial image location obtained by this method shows agreement with
   past demonstrations of far-field flat-lens imaging and can even predict
   the location of super-resolved images in the near-field. The generality
   of this criterion leads to several new predictions: flat lenses for
   transverse-electric polarization using dielectric layers, a broadband
   flat lens working across the ultraviolet-visible spectrum, and a flat
   lens configuration with an image plane located up to several wavelengths
   from the exit surface. These predictions are supported by full-wave
   simulations. Our work shows that small-angle phase can be used as a
   generic metric to categorize and design flat lenses. (C) 2014 Optical

Abstract = {{Active front-end (AFE) rectifiers are becoming widely used in

   the modeling methodology presented in this paper highlight the specifics
   of the hysteresis bang-bang type DPC that is used to track the real and

Abstract = {{A timber-steel hybrid system, where cross-laminated timber (CLT) shear
   panels are used as infill in steel moment resisting frames, is
   analytically investigated. The proposed hybrid system combines ductile
   behavior of steel moment frame with lighter and stiffer CLT panels.
   Initial parametric study is carried out with a single-bay-single-story
   model using pushover analysis to investigate effect of CLT panel
   thickness, crushing strength, and confinement gap. Results showed that
   the parameters studied have a significant influence on system's ultimate
   strength, ultimate drift capacity, and post-peak behavior. Subsequently,
   parametric studies are carried out for three-bay hybrid buildings with
   three-, six-, and nine-story hybrid buildings for varying panel
   configuration (a given gap, panel thickness, and crushing strength)
   values. The parameters varied and are design ductility level (limited
   ductility and ductile) and infill pattern. A monotonic pushover analysis
   was performed to develop a preliminary ductility and overstrength values
   based on both steel yield of frame and panel crushing force in the
   links. Overall, the results suggest that addition of infill bays is less
   beneficial in ductile moment frames; CLT infill panels are better suited
   to lower ductility systems. Ultimately, a ductility factor of 2.5 is
   recommended for the infilled frame system, and an overstrength factor of
   1.25 appears to be warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The development of hybrid structures is constantly being pushed forward
   because of the need for more efficient components that incorporate
   multiple functions. Structural requirements lead to state-of-the-art
   timber-concrete-composite (TCC) floor systems, which consist of a
   concrete layer on top of timber beams or decks. In bending, the TCC
   concrete layer is in compression and the timber is in tension. When
   multifunctionality requirements such as building physics or fire
   protection are added, other solutions of the structural form of hybrid
   systems can emerge that challenge common engineering conceptions. This
   paper presents research on the connection system of a novel TCC setup
   that integrates thermal and fire protection functionality, in which
   timber beams are placed at the top and a concrete layer at the bottom.
   The results from full-scale bending tests, and shear and tension tests
   on a subsection of the system, show that the grooves cut into the timber
   beams transmit the shear forces and sufficiently connect the concrete
   deck vertically to the timber. Subsequently, the structural behavior was
   numerically modeled and the agreement between experimental and numerical
   results allow for the validated model to be used for geometric
   optimizations, and predicting the performance of optimized systems.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-laminated timber (CLT) products are gaining popularity in the
   North American market and are being used in midrise wood buildings, in
   particular, in shearwall applications. Shearwalls provide resistance to
   lateral loads such as wind and earthquake loads, and therefore it is
   important to gain a better understanding of the behavior of CLT
   shearwall systems during earthquake events. This paper is focused on the
   seismic performance of connections between CLT shearwall panels and the
   foundation. CLT panels are very stiff and energy dissipation is
   accomplished by the connections. A literature review on previous
   research work related to damage prediction and assessment for wood frame
   structures was performed. Furthermore, a test program was conducted to
   investigate the performance of CLT connections subjected to simulated
   earthquake loads. Two different brackets in combination with five types
   of fasteners were tested under monotonic and cyclic loading protocols.
   In total, 98 connection tests were conducted and the monotonic
   load-displacement curves and hysteretic loops were obtained. In this
   paper, an energy-based cumulative damage assessment model was calibrated
   with the CLT connection test data. Finally, a correlation between the
   damage index and physical damage is provided.}},

Abstract = {{Concrete-filled steel tubular columns have been studied extensively
   worldwide. Such columns provide stable energy dissipation, which is
   ideal for earthquake engineering application. However, most applications
   use rectangular steel tubular sections. In the location of wall
   intersections, these sections often create sharp corners, which are
   architecturally displeasing. In some facilities such as schools and
   correctional facilities, sharp corners are even prohibited due to their
   potential hazard to occupants. To resolve the issue, concrete-filled
   crisscross steel tubular columns (CCSTCs) have been proposed. Three
   half-scaled specimens were constructed and tested under cyclic
   displacement loading history. The experimental results were used to
   calibrate numerical models of the components and further used to examine
   the seismic behavior of a three-story prototype office building located
   in Los Angeles. The results showed the proposed CCSTC has excellent
   energy dissipation and postearthquake performance, and hence it can be
   used as an alternative lateral force resisting system for seismic

Title = {{Performance-Based Design and Optimization of Buckling Restrained Knee
   Braced Truss Moment Frame}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A buckling restrained knee braced truss moment frame (BRKBTMF) is a
   novel steel structural system that combines steel trusses with
   buckling-restrained braces (BRBs) to form an alternative seismic
   force-resisting system. The combination of the steel trusses and the
   BRBs allows the BRKBTMF to have a large interior opening without the
   need to provide ductile detailing for the steel trusses. This makes the
   design very efficient and economical. More importantly, through the use
   of BRBs as the designated energy-dissipation devices, the damage is
   controlled within the BRBs, which can be replaced easily after the
   earthquake. This will drastically reduce the structural damage, repair
   cost, and repair time, which makes this structure more efficient and
   resilient toward future earthquakes. In this study, a modification of
   the performance-based plastic design (PBPD) procedure was derived to
   design the member sizes of the BRKBTMF. A parameter study was conducted
   by varying the inclination of BRBs to optimize the initial construction
   cost and expected financial loss during the maximum credible earthquake
   shaking. A prototype four-story office building located in Berkeley,
   California, was selected for this study. State-of-the-art site-specific
   hazard analysis, finite element models, and damaged fragility models
   were used to evaluate the seismic performance of the BRKBTMF with
   different BRB inclinations. The result shows excellent seismic
   performance in the proposed BRKBTMF, where the structure is able to
   satisfy both the drift and force limits. The parameter study shows that
   the design forces in the steel trusses are not affected by the
   inclination of the BRB. Instead, the design forces in the BRBs and
   columns increase as the inclination of the BRB becomes more horizontal.
   This results in larger column sizes and thus higher initial construction
   costs. The cost of the BRB is not significantly affected by the
   inclination of the BRB. This is because as the BRB inclination becomes
   more horizontal, the cross-sectional area of the BRB increases, but the
   length of the BRB decreases. The results of the nonlinear dynamic
   analysis show that the peak dynamic responses (peak interstory drift and
   floor acceleration) of the BRKBTMF are very similar among the different
   BRB inclinations. This shows that the proposed PBPD design methodology
   is very effective in designing the BRKBTMF. The detailed parameter study
   also shows that the BRB strain is the lowest when the BRB inclination is
   around 30 degrees or 90 degrees. As the BRB inclination gets closer to
   60 degrees (using the geometry presented in this study), at the same
   interstory drift demand, the axial strain demand in the BRB is the
   highest. This results in a high degree of damage to the BRBs, which
   translates to the highest degree of structural damages and financial
   losses during the maximum credible earthquake shaking. Hence, it is
   recommended that optimal choices of BRB inclination are either
   horizontal or connecting directly to the end of the columns.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a track before detect approach utilizing trajectory shape
   constraints is proposed to track dimly lit targets. The shape of the
   target trajectory is modeled syntactically using stochastic context-free
   grammar models (SCFG) that arise in natural language processing. The
   directional vector of the target acceleration modes are used as
   geometric primitives called tracklets. The tracklets are syntactic
   sub-units of complex spatial trajectory shapes. Stochastic context-free
   grammars are a generalization of Markov chains (regular grammars) and
   can model such complex spatial patterns with long range dependencies.
   Knowledge about the evolution of the trajectory is used in enhancing the
   track before detect algorithm. A novel multiple model SCFG particle
   filter is proposed and numerical results are presented to show
   significant improvement over conventional jump Markov models in track
   before detect.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses stochastic dominance principles to construct upper and
   lower sample path bounds for Hidden Markov Model (HMM) filters. We
   consider an HMM consisting of an X-state Markov chain with transition
   matrix P. By using convex optimization methods for nuclear norm
   minimization with copositive constraints, we construct low rank
   stochastic matrices (P) under bar and (P) over bar so that the optimal
   filters using (P) under bar, (P) over bar provably lower and upper bound
   (with respect to a partially ordered set) the true filtered distribution
   at each time instant. Since (P) under bar and (P) over bar are low rank
   (say R), the computational cost of evaluating the filtering bounds is
   O(XR) instead of O(X-2). A Monte-Carlo importance sampling filter is
   presented that exploits these upper and lower bounds to estimate the
   optimal posterior. Finally, explicit bounds are given on the variational
   norm between the true posterior and the upper and lower bounds in terms
   of the Dobrushin coefficient.}},

Abstract = {{AimTo examine the fatigue behaviour of heat-treated NiTi instruments
   when immersed in aqueous media and to determine the effect of cyclic
   fatigue on the hardness and elastic modulus of NiTi instruments using a
   nanoindentation technique.
   MethodologyK3XF and K3 NiTi instruments, both in sizes 25, 0.04 taper
   and 40, 0.04 taper, were subjected to rotational bending at a curvature
   of 42 degrees either in air or under deionized water, and the number of
   revolutions to fracture (N-f) was recorded. The fracture surface of all
   fragments was examined with a scanning electron microscope. The hardness
   and elastic modulus of the fracture surface of instruments sized 25,
   0.04 taper were then measured using a nanoindentation test.
   ResultsThe K3XF instruments had a fatigue resistance superior to K3
   instruments under dry and aqueous environments (P<0.05). The fatigue
   life of K3 instruments was similar under both conditions, whereas the
   N-f of K3XF was greater under water than in air, especially at the size
   40, 0.04 taper (P<0.05). The values for the fraction of the area
   occupied by the dimple region were significantly smaller in K3XF
   instruments than in K3 instruments, especially under water (P<0.05).
   There was no difference in hardness on K3XF instruments between new
   files and instruments subjected to the fatigue process. The hardness of
   instruments subjected to the fatigue process was significantly lower in
   K3XF than in K3 instruments (P<0.05).
   ConclusionThe fatigue life of K3XF instruments under water is longer
   than it is for K3XF instruments in air. There was no work-hardening
   effect on K3XF instruments subjected to the fatigue process.}},

Title = {{Moment Measurements in Dynamic and Quasi-Static Spine Segment Testing
   Using Eccentric Compression are Susceptible to Artifacts Based on
   Loading Configuration}},

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{The tolerance of the spine to bending moments, used for evaluation of
   injury prevention devices, is often determined through eccentric axial
   compression experiments using segments of the cadaver spine. Preliminary
   experiments in our laboratory demonstrated that eccentric axial
   compression resulted in ``unexpected{''} (artifact) moments. The aim of
   this study was to evaluate the static and dynamic effects of test
   configuration on bending moments during eccentric axial compression
   typical in cadaver spine segment testing. Specific objectives were to
   create dynamic equilibrium equations for the loads measured inferior to
   the specimen, experimentally verify these equations, and compare moment
   responses from various test configurations using synthetic (rubber) and
   human cadaver specimens. The equilibrium equations were verified by
   performing quasi-static (5 mm/s) and dynamic experiments (0.4 m/s) on a
   rubber specimen and comparing calculated shear forces and bending
   moments to those measured using a six-axis load cell. Moment responses
   were compared for hinge joint, linear slider and hinge joint, and roller
   joint configurations tested at quasi-static and dynamic rates.
   Calculated shear force and bending moment curves had similar shapes to
   those measured. Calculated values in the first local minima differed
   from those measured by 3\% and 15\%, respectively, in the dynamic test,
   and these occurred within 1.5 ms of those measured. In the rubber
   specimen experiments, for the hinge joint (translation constrained),
   quasi-static and dynamic posterior eccentric compression resulted in
   flexion (unexpected) moments. For the slider and hinge joints and the
   roller joints (translation unconstrained), extension ({''}expected{''})
   moments were measured quasi-statically and initial flexion (unexpected)
   moments were measured dynamically. In the cadaver experiments with
   roller joints, anterior and posterior eccentricities resulted in
   extension moments, which were unexpected and expected, for those
   configurations, respectively. The unexpected moments were due to the
   inertia of the superior mounting structures. This study has shown that
   eccentric axial compression produces unexpected moments due to
   translation constraints at all loading rates and due to the inertia of
   the superior mounting structures in dynamic experiments. It may be
   incorrect to assume that bending moments are equal to the product of
   compression force and eccentricity, particularly where the test
   configuration involves translational constraints and where the
   experiments are dynamic. In order to reduce inertial moment artifacts,
   the mass, and moment of inertia of any loading jig structures that
   rotate with the specimen should be minimized. Also, the distance between
   these structures and the load cell should be reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal deformations that occur during formation of
   long-fiber-reinforced composites have been a continued challenge for
   manufacturers as the final shape of a given part can be different from
   the original mold shape. The ensuing dimensional distortions can be
   difficult to predict due to complex thermo-mechanical behaviour of
   composite laminates during different forming cycles. This study intends
   to model the fundamental mechanisms that lead to thermal deformations
   during forming of a thermoplastic matrix composite comprised of
   comingled polypropylene and E-glass fibers. While the discussion is
   framed around a custom-design multi-stage roll-forming process, it is
   also relevant to a wider range of thermoplastic composites manufacturing
   processes. A methodology is developed to characterize the thermal
   mechanical behavior of the material, optimize the manufacturing process,
   and predict the magnitude of resulting spring-in angle due to thermal
   deformations. It is found that the process control parameters can be
   optimized first such that the crystallization of the matrix occurs at an
   ideal position along the forming line. Once the process is optimized,
   the developed numerical model, with a thermoelastic material behaviour,
   can give an adequate prediction of spring-in at the end of the process.
   Finally, through a comparative study, it is discussed how for other
   manufacturing processes, such as compression molding, including a
   thermoviscoelastic liquid/solid material behaviour may be required to
   yield accurate spring-in predictions.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Internal instability is a form of internal erosion in broadly graded
   cohesionless soils in which fine particles can be eroded at lower
   hydraulic gradients than predicted by classical theory for piping or
   heave. A key mechanism enabling internal instability is the formation of
   a stress-transmitting matrix dominated by the coarse particles, which
   leaves the finer particles under lower effective stress. In this study,
   discrete element modeling is used to analyze the fabric and effective
   stress distribution within idealized gap-graded samples with varying
   potential for internal stability. The reduction in stress within the
   finer fraction of the materials is directly quantified from grain-scale
   data. The particle-size distribution, percentage finer fraction, and
   relative density are found to influence the stress distribution. In
   particular, effective stress transfer within a critical finer fraction
   between 24 and 35\% is shown to be highly sensitive to relative density.}},

Abstract = {{Within the framework of an ensemble semi-classical three-valley Monte
   Carlo simulation approach, we examine how the character of the electron
   transport within zinc-blende indium nitride varies in response to
   changes in the non-parabolicity. All other material and band structural
   parameters are set to the nominal zinc-blende indium nitride values
   prescribed by Hadi et al. (J Appl Phys 113:113709, 2013). We find that
   while low non-parabolicities lead to a substantial number of transitions
   into the upper energy conduction band valleys, for non-parabolicity
   coefficients in excess of 3 eV, very few such transitions occur.
   Variations in the non-parabolicity are also noted to play an important
   role in shaping the form of the corresponding velocity-field
   characteristic. Correlations between the results are explored. How the
   relationship between the electron transport within zinc-blende indium
   nitride and its non-parabolicity may be exploited for device application
   purposes is commented upon.}},

Title = {{Identifying a rapid bolus dose of dexmedetomidine (ED50) with acceptable

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Background Dexmedetomidine is a highly sensitive, specific alpha(2)
   adrenoceptor agonist with anxiolytic, sedative, and analgesic effects.
   Administration is recommended as a loading dose infused over 10min.
   Clinical experience and a previous study suggested a shorter time frame
   might be used without causing adverse hemodynamic effects.
   Objective To determine the dexmedetomidine dose that can be given as a
   rapid 5s bolus to healthy children during total intravenous anesthesia
   (TIVA) without causing significant hemodynamic effects.
   Methods ASA I-II children, aged 5-9years, having elective surgery under
   TIVA were recruited. The up-and-down sequential study design was
   employed to determine the effective dose of dexmedetomidine, starting at
   0.3mcg center dot kg(-1) with 0.1mcg center dot kg(-1) intervals, which
   caused no hemodynamic response in half the subjects (ED50). Positive
   responses were defined as mean blood pressure (MAP) and/or heart rate
   (HR) changes >= 30\% from baseline. Three parametric estimators and one
   nonparametric estimator were used to determine the ED50.
   Results Twenty-one subjects with median age 7.1 (range 5.4-9.5) years
   and median weight 23.6 (range 16.2-36.7) kg were recruited. A maximum
   median HR decrease of 20bmin(-1) occurred at 50s and a maximum median
   MAP increase of 12.5mmHg occurred at 100s after bolus dose
   administration. Fifteen subjects (71\%) had a HR <60b center dot min(-1)
   while one subject had a HR <40b center dot min(-1) (minimum 35bmin(-1))
   for 60s following the dexmedetomidine bolus. Four estimators led to an
   ED50 estimate for dexmedetomidine of 0.49mcgkg(-1) {[}95\% CI
   0.26-0.80mcg center dot kg(-1)].
   Conclusion The ED50 of dexmedetomidine administered over 5s without
   significant hemodynamic compromise is 0.49mcg center dot kg(-1). Further
   work is needed to determine the safe' (ED5 or less) and effective dose
   for desired perioperative clinical outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of surface heterogeneities extends vertically within the
   atmospheric surface layer to the so-called blending height, causing
   changes in the fluxes of momentum and scalars. Inside this region the
   turbulence structure cannot be treated as horizontally homogeneous; it
   is highly dependent on the local surface roughness, the buoyancy and the
   horizontal scale of heterogeneity. The present study analyzes the change
   in scalar flux induced by the presence of a large wind farm installed
   across a heterogeneously rough surface. The change in the internal
   atmospheric boundary-layer structure due to the large wind farm is
   decomposed and the change in the overall surface scalar flux is
   assessed. The equilibrium length scale characteristic of surface
   roughness transitions is found to be determined by the relative position
   of the smooth-to-rough transition and the wind turbines. It is shown
   that the change induced by large wind farms on the scalar flux is of the
   same order of magnitude as the adjustment they naturally undergo due to
   surface patchiness.}},

Abstract = {{This study compared advanced anaerobic digestion combining two-phased
   anaerobic digestion (2PAD) with high pressure homogenization (HPH)
   pretreatment to conventional anaerobic digestion of municipal sludge at
   laboratory scale. The study began with examination of thickened waste
   activated sludge (TWAS) solubilization due to HPH pretreatment at
   different pressure (0-12,000 psi) and chemical dose (0.009-0.036 g
   NaOH/g total solids). Homogenizing pressure was found as the most
   significant factor (p-value < 0.05) for increasing solubilization of
   particulate chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biopolymers in TWAS. Based
   on the preliminary results, a pretreatment with chemical dose of 0.009 g
   NaOH/g total solids and pressure of 12,000 psi was selected for digester
   studies. Upon acclimation of anaerobic inocula to pretreatments, a total
   number of twelve lab-scale digesters were operated under scenarios
   including single-stage (control), 2PAD, and HPH coupled with 2PAD (HPH +
   2PAD) at sludge retention times (SRTs) of 20, 14 and 7 days. Between
   mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures, mesophilic digestion was found
   to benefit more from pretreatments. Relative (to control) improvements
   in methane yield and volatile solids (VS) removals increased noticeably
   as SRT was shortened from 20 to 14 and 7 days. HPH + 2PAD system was
   found to achieve the maximum methane production (0.61-1.32 L
   CH4/L-digester-d) and VS removals (43-64\%). Thermophilic control, 2PAD
   and HPH + 2PAD systems resulted in significant pathogen removals meeting
   Class A biosolids requirements according to Organic Matter Recycling
   Regulations (OMRR) of British Columbia (BC) at 20 d SRT. Energy analysis
   indicated that all the digestion scenarios attained positive energy
   balance with 2PAD system operated at 20 d SRT producing the maximum net
   energy of 4.76 GJ/tonne CODadded. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A new technique is presented for securing a space-time block code in the
   presence of an eavesdropper without channel state information (CSI) at
   the transmitter. Assuming channel reciprocity between the transmitter
   and the intended receiver, we use the receive signal strength indicator,
   which is much easier to estimate reliably than CSI, to randomly rotate
   the information symbols at each transmit antenna without increasing the
   transmit signal's peak-to-average ratio. It is shown that the proposed
   scheme guarantees full diversity to an intended recipient while reducing
   the diversity order of an eavesdropper to zero even in the presence of
   perfect channel state information.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption of anionic dye - Orange II - in aqueous solution onto
   hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA)-coated zeolite (HCZ) reached
   38.96 mg/g compared with 8.13 mg/g onto natural zeolite. Fourier
   Transform Infrared (FTIR), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and
   X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data showed that HDTMA-coated zeolite
   developed surficial positive charges. The adsorption reaction fits the
   Freundlich isotherm (R-2 = 0.93) and the value of 1/n was less than
   unity (=0.81) and suggest a multi-layer physi-sorption process. The
   kinetics of the adsorption is a pseudo-second-order model. The
   activation energy (E-a) of the reaction is +35.70 kJ/mol to further
   support a physi-sorption process while the Delta H degrees (+82.79
   kJ/mol) is characteristic for an endothermic reaction. The Delta G
   degrees values of -2.33, -0.98 and -0.37 kJ/mol at 25 degrees C, 30
   degrees C and 35 degrees C, respectively implied that the adsorption
   reaction was feasible and thermodynamically spontaneous. We proposed
   that both electrostatic interactions and partitioning process are
   involved in the adsorption mechanisms of Orange II dye onto HCZ. (C)

Abstract = {{Torrefied biomass represents a high quality renewable energy commodity
   that can be used to substitute fossil fuels such as coal. However,
   densification processes such as pelletisation is necessary to improve
   the tradability of ``low-dense{''} torrefied biomass. In this work, two
   process pathways were assessed for energy and mass balance in making
   torrefied pellets from softwood chips and qualities of the resulting
   torrefied pellets were compared. Pathway I involve drying the wood
   chips, torrefaction, grinding followed by densification. In pathway II,
   wood chips were dried, ground, densified and finally torrefied. The
   results showed that it was difficult to bind the torrefied biomass
   particles and a binding agent was necessary to enable their effective
   pelletisation with reasonable energy consumption. In contrary,
   pelletization of raw materials was possible without using binding agents
   and when the ``raw wood pellets{''} were torrefied, the pellets
   surprisingly stayed intact and had several promising properties such as
   higher energy/carbon value, reduced moisture content and higher
   stability in water. In addition, the pathway II was more efficient in
   terms of overall energy and material balance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

   formulation of dynamic thread milling which is periodic in threading
   cycle, in a semi-discrete time domain. The stability of the operation is
   predicted as a function of spindle speed, axial depth of cut, cutter
   path and tool geometry. The mechanics and stability models are
   experimentally proven in opening M16 x 2 threads with a five-fluted

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{With the increase in natural gas (NG) production in recent years,
   primarily from shale gas, some sources, including the US Environmental
   Protection Agency (EPA), have suggested that upstream methane emissions
   are increasing. Much of the recent controversy has centered on emissions
   during well drilling, testing, and completion even though emissions
   downstream of the wellhead are also of concern. The study critically
   assessed the current state of knowledge about the life cycle GHG
   footprint of NG, analyzed the assumptions, data and analysis
   methodologies used in the existing literature. This study
   comprehensively analyzed the emission of methane from different stage of
   the life of well for conventional and unconventional NG using the EPA's
   revised 2011 estimates as well as other existing literature and publicly
   available government data. The study proposed a probabilistic model to
   estimate the range of total GHG footprint of NG with varying
   probabilities. Through the bottom up approach starting from the well
   construction to the delivery of NG to the small user and using Monte
   Carlo simulation, the study identified the critical sources of fugitive
   emissions from the NG. As expected, emissions from well completion and
   periodic emissions (e.g. liquid unloading in the case of onshore
   conventional wells and workovers in the case of unconventional wells)
   are significant contributors to the overall GHG footprint of NG, and
   possess large opportunity for reduction. Finally the application of
   probabilistic model is demonstrated through a case study using the data
   from the Montney and Horn River shale gas basins in the Northern British
   Columbia to estimate the range of total GHG footprint of shale gas with
   varying probabilities. The study found that the GHG footprint of Montney
   and Horn River wells are much smaller than that of Barnett shale (which
   is representative of US shale gas) due to strict flaring regulations
   followed in BC. The study also undercuts the outcome of Howarth et al.
   (Clim Chang Lett 106:679-690, 2011), which states that the GHG footprint
   of shale gas is at least 20 \% greater than coal.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS}},

Volume = {{29}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{LCL-filters are a cost-effective solution to mitigate harmonic current
   content in grid-tie converters. In order to avoid stability problems,
   the resonance frequency of LCL-filters can be damped with active
   techniques that remove dissipative elements but increase control
   complexity. A notch filter provides an effective solution, however
   tuning the filter requires considerable design effort and the variations
   in the grid impedance limit the LCL-filter robustness. This paper
   proposes a straightforward tuning procedure for a notch filter
   self-commissioning. In order to account for the grid inductance
   variations, the resonance frequency is estimated and later used for
   tuning the notch filter. An estimation for the maximum value of the
   proportional gain to excite the resonance is provided. The resonance
   frequency is calculated using the Goertzel algorithm, which requires
   little extra computational resources in the existing control processor.
   The discrete Fourier transform coefficients are therefore obtained, with
   less calculations than the running sum implementation and less memory
   requirements than with the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Thus, the
   self-commissioning technique is robust to grid impedance variations due
   to its ability to tune the grid-tie inverter on-site. Finally, the
   analysis is validated with both simulation and experiments.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of sharing a viral file between users in a local
   community network (e. g., college and office campuses). Community
   computing is computer networking among and between users in a
   geographically bounded setting for local purposes and activities. Due to
   the community-oriented nature of such networks, it is likely that users
   of a community network would like to share content. Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
   networks have turned out to be one of the most innovative paradigms for
   sharing content on the Internet. In this paper, we analyze the
   performance of P2P content sharing in community networks and investigate
   the role that infrastructure nodes (helpers) can play to enhance the
   performance of content sharing and distribution. We model the evolution
   of content demand in a community network. The use of this demand
   prediction model allows us to design a delicate P2P-with-helpers content
   distribution system. Our in-sights that we obtain using fluid-flow model
   increase our understanding of how helper provisioning affects the
   performance of content sharing and distribution. The derived results
   show that significant reduction in both the cost of distributing content
   and the average content download time can be realized when only few
   infrastructure nodes in the community network play the role helpers and
   cache P2P objects.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding proximal femur fracture may yield new targets for fracture
   prevention screening and treatment. The goal of this study was to
   characterize force-displacement and failure behaviours in the proximal
   femur between displacement control and impact loading fall simulations.
   Twenty-one human proximal femurs were tested in two ways, first to a
   sub-failure load at a constant displacement rate, then to fracture in an
   impact fall simulator. Comparisons of sub-failure energy and stiffness
   were made between the tests at the same compressive force. Additionally,
   the impact failure tests were compared with previous, constant
   displacement rate failure tests (at 2 and 100 mm/s) in terms of energy,
   yield force, and stiffness. Loading and displacement rates were
   characterized and related to specimen stiffness in the impact tests. No
   differences were observed between the sub-failure constant displacement
   and impact tests in the aforementioned metrics. Comparisons between
   failure tests showed that the impact group had the lowest absorbed
   energy, 24\% lower maximum force and 160\% higher stiffness than the 100
   mm/s group (p <0.01 for all), but suffered from low statistical power to
   differentiate the donor age and specimen BMD. Loading and displacement
   rates for the specimens tested using impact varied during each test and
   between specimens and did not show appreciable viscoelasticity. These
   results indicate that constant displacement rate testing may help
   understand sub-failure mechanical behaviour, but may not elucidate
   failure behaviours. The differences between the impact and constant
   displacement rate fall simulations have important ramifications for
   interpreting the results of previous experiments. Crown Copyright (C)

Title = {{Bicycling crash circumstances vary by route type: a cross-sectional
   analysis}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Widely varying crash circumstances have been reported for
   bicycling injuries, likely because of differing bicycling populations
   and environments. We used data from the Bicyclists' Injuries and the
   Cycling Environment Study in Vancouver and Toronto, Canada, to describe
   the crash circumstances of people injured while cycling for utilitarian
   and leisure purposes. We examined the association of crash circumstances
   with route type.
   Methods: Adult cyclists injured and treated in a hospital emergency
   department described their crash circumstances. These were classified
   into major categories (collision vs. fall, motor vehicle involved vs.
   not) and subcategories. The distribution of circumstances was tallied
   for each of 14 route types defined in an earlier analysis. Ratios of
   observed vs. expected were tallied for each circumstance and route type
   combination.
   Results: Of 690 crashes, 683 could be characterized for this analysis.
   Most (74\%) were collisions. Collisions included those with motor
   vehicles (34\%), streetcar (tram) or train tracks (14\%), other surface
   features (10\%), infrastructure (10\%), and pedestrians, cyclists, or
   animals (6\%). The remainder of the crashes were falls (26\%), many as a
   result of collision avoidance manoeuvres. Motor vehicles were involved
   directly or indirectly with 48\% of crashes. Crash circumstances were
   distributed differently by route type, for example, collisions with
   motor vehicles, including ``doorings{''}, were overrepresented on major
   streets with parked cars. Collisions involving streetcar tracks were
   overrepresented on major streets. Collisions involving infrastructure
   (curbs, posts, bollards, street furniture) were overrepresented on
   multiuse paths and bike paths.
   Conclusions: These data supplement our previous analyses of relative
   risks by route type by indicating the types of crashes that occur on
   each route type. This information can guide municipal engineers and
   planners towards improvements that would make cycling safer.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel and simple method for patterning oxygen-sensitive
   polystyrene thin films and demonstrate its potential for integration
   with microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices. Optical oxygen sensing films
   composed of polystyrene with an embedded luminescent oxygen-sensitive
   dye present a convenient option for the measurement of oxygen. levels in
   microfluidic and lab-on-a-chip devices; however, patterning and
   integrating the films with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic
   devices has proven difficult due to a residue after dry etch patterning
   that inhibits subsequent PDMS bonding. Our new method uses mask-less
   laser ablation by a commercial laser ablation system to define the
   outline of the structures and subsequent bulk film removal by aqueous
   lift-off. Because the bulk film is peeled or lifted off of the substrate
   rather than etched, the process is compatible with standard PDMS plasma
   bonding. We used ToF-SIMS analysis to investigate how laser ablation
   facilitates this fabrication process as well as why dry etching
   polystyrene inhibits PDMS plasma bonding. The results of this analysis
   showed evidence of chemical species formed during the laser ablation and
   dry etching processes that can produce these effects. Our new method's
   mask-less nature, simplicity, speed, and compatibility with PDMS bonding
   make it ideally suited for single-use lab-on-a-chip applications. To
   demonstrate the method's compatibility with PDMS microfluidics, we also
   present a demonstration of the sensors' integration into a microfluidic
   oxygen gradient generator device.}},

Abstract = {{Arrayed hexagonal metal nanostructures are used to maximize the local
   current density while providing effective thermal management at the
   nanoscale, thereby allowing for increased emission from photoconductive
   terahertz (THz) sources. The THz emission field amplitude was increased
   by 60\% above that of a commercial THz photoconductive antenna, even
   though the hexagonal nanostructured device had 75\% of the bias voltage.
   The arrayed hexagonal outperforms our previously investigated strip
   array nanoplasmonic structure by providing stronger localization of the
   current density near the metal surface with an operating bandwidth of
   2.6 THz. This approach is promising to achieve efficient THz sources.

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) can lead to daytime
   sleepiness, growth failure and developmental delay in children.
   Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard to diagnose SDB, is a highly
   resource-intensive test, confined to the sleep laboratory.
   Aim: To combine the blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) characterization
   and cardiac modulation, quantified by pulse rate variability (PRV), to
   identify children with SDB using the Phone Oximeter, a device
   integrating a pulse oximeter with a smartphone.
   Methods: Following ethics approval and informed consent, 160 children
   referred to British Columbia Children's Hospital for overnight PSG were
   recruited. A second pulse oximeter sensor applied to the finger adjacent
   to the one used for standard alongside the PSG.
   Results: We studied 146 children through the analysis of the SpO(2)
   pattern, and PRV as an estimate of heart rate variability calculated
   from the PPG. SpO(2) variability and SpO(2) spectral power at low
   frequency, was significantly higher in children with SDB due to the
   modulation provoked by airway obstruction during sleep (p-value <0:01).
   PRV analysis reflected a significant augmentation of sympathetic
   activity provoked by intermittent hypoxia in SDB children. A linear
   classifier was trained with the most discriminating features to identify
   children with SDB. The classifier was validated with internal and
   external cross-validation, providing a high negative predictive value
   (92.6\%) and a good balance between sensitivity (88.4\%) and specificity
   (83.6\%). Combining SpO(2) and PRV analysis improved the classification
   performance, providing an area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve of 88\%, beyond the 82\% achieved using SpO(2)
   analysis alone.
   Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the implementation of this
   algorithm in the Phone Oximeter will provide an improved portable,
   at-home screening tool, with the capability of monitoring patients over
   multiple nights.}},

Title = {{The role of soil humic and fulvic acid in the sorption of endosulfan

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{The sorption behaviour of alpha- and beta-endosulfan in soil organic
   matter was investigated using standard soil humic acid (HA) and soil
   fulvic acid (FA) with a modified solubility enhancement method and a
   dialysis bag technique. For HA, all the experiments were conducted at an
   ionic strength of 0.001mol/L, in both the presence and absence of
   calcium and at an ionic strength of 0.01mol/L. For FA, the experiments
   were conducted at two ionic strengths: 0.001mol/L (with calcium) and
   0.01mol/L. This study is the first to describe the striking differences
   in the sorption behaviours of the two stereoisomers of endosulfan in HA
   and in FA. The sorption coefficients of alpha-endosulfan in HA and FA
   were significantly higher than those of beta-endosulfan. Beta-endosulfan
   has comparable sorption coefficients (1.5-5.4L/g) in HA and in FA. Ionic
   strength and the presence of calcium have no significant effect on the
   sorption of beta-endosulfan in HA. However, calcium can significantly
   (p=0.01) enhance the solubility of alpha-endosulfan in HA. Changes in
   ionic strength by one order of magnitude also affect the solubility of
   alpha-endosulfan in HA. The sorption coefficients of alpha-endosulfan in
   HA (10-36L/g) were greater than those in FA (9-14L/g). The chirality of
   the alpha-isomer was hypothesised to be the primary reason behind its
   higher sorption in soil organic matter relative to the beta-isomer. In
   the presence of dissolved HA and FA found in natural soil environments,
   solubility of endosulfan can be increased by five times than the aqueous
   solubility of endosulfan without HA and FA.}},

Title = {{Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of VUV/UV photoreactors for
   water treatment}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{256}},
Pages = {{51-60}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Vacuum-UV/UV process, an incipient catalyst/chemical-free advanced
   oxidation process (AOP), is potentially a cost-effective solution for
   the treatment of persistent micropollutants from water sources. In this
   study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for the simulation of
   VUV/UV photoreactors used for water treatment was developed and
   evaluated experimentally. The developed model integrated hydrodynamics,
   species mass transport, more than 40 reactions, along with the
   irradiance distribution at 185 nm VUV and 254 nm UV wavelengths within
   the reactor. The 185 nm VUV and 254 nm UV emissions from an
   ozone-generating lamp were experimentally measured and fed to the model.
   The evaluation showed that the proposed CFD model successfully predicted
   the degradation rate of a model pollutant in a prototype flow-through
   VUV/UV reactor. The developed model was also able to trace the main
   by-products of the target micropollutant resulting from 185 nm and 254
   nm photolysis as well as OH oxidation. Detailed analysis of the
   direct-photolysis of the model contaminant at 254 nm and 185 nm vs. OH
   radical based degradation of the contaminant revealed the latter one as
   the most dominant degradation pathway. The performed analysis confirmed
   that degradation rates of micropollutants in the VUV/UV photoreactors
   are strongly limited by mass transfer in proximity of the quartz sleeve.

Abstract = {{The reduction kinetics of ferric ion on chalcopyrite in the quaternary
   H2SO4-Fe-2( SO4)(3)-FeSO4-H2O system were systematically studied by
   cathodic potentiodynamic polarization (0.5 mV/s) through a wide range of
   solution compositions and temperatures (25-150 degrees C). Results
   reveal that all of the pseudo-polarization plots exhibit reproducible
   well-defined linear Tafel regions and thus the temperature dependence of
   various kinetic parameters, such as the exchange current density,
   transfer coefficient and rate constant, has been determined. The
   exchange current densities of the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple obtained by
   extrapolating the cathodic linear Tafel line to the reversible potential
   are on the order of 10(-7)-10(-5) A/cm(2) in the range of 25-150 degrees
   C, substantially less than that on platinum due to the formation of a
   passive film. In general, at the same nominal Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio,
   increasing the temperature from 25 to 150 degrees C was observed to give
   rise to an increase in io, especially when a larger amount of free
   ferrous existed in the solution. Based on the obtained exchange current
   densities, the rate constants for ferric ion reduction were calculated,
   and further analysis indicates that the rate constants can be well
   described by the Arrhenius equation. Experimental evidence clearly shows
   an anomalous independent variation of Tafel slope with temperature and a
   corresponding unexpected increased linear variation of transfer
   coefficient with respect to temperature (rather than being constant
   throughout the investigated temperature range). Analysis by mixed
   potential theory indicates that in the acidic iron sulfate leaching
   system the control scenario highly depends on both the solution
   composition and temperature. The importance of the cathodic ferric ion
   reduction reaction on the overall leaching process is progressively
   increased when increasing the nominal Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio and temperature.
   The leaching reaction is under anodic control when the nominal Fe3+/Fe2+
   ratio is around 1:1, whereas at higher nominal Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios and
   temperatures the reaction is under mixed control, by both anodic
   oxidation and cathodic reduction reactions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Band diagrams of layered plasmonic metamaterials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{We introduce a method to map the band diagrams, or equipotential
   contours (EPCs), of any layered plasmonic metamaterial using a general
   expression for the Poynting vector in a lossy layered medium of finite
   extent under plane-wave illumination. Unlike conventional methods to get
   band diagrams by solving the Helmholtz equation using the Floquet-Bloch
   theorem (an approach restricted to infinite, periodic, lossless media),
   our method adopts a bottom-up philosophy based on spatial-frequency
   decomposition of the electric and magnetic fields (an approach
   applicable to finite, lossy media). Equipotential contours are used to
   visualize phase and group velocities in a wide range of layered
   plasmonic systems, including the basic building block of a thin metallic
   layer and more complex multi-layers with unique optical properties such
   as negative phase velocity, super-resolution imaging, canalization, and
   far-field imaging. We show that a thin metallic layer can mimic a
   left-handed electromagnetic response at the surface plasmon resonance
   and that stacks of metal and dielectric layers can do the same provided
   that the dielectric layer is sufficiently thin. We also use EPCs to
   estimate resolution limits of both Pendry's silver slab lens and the
   Veselago lens and show that the image location and lateral image
   resolution of metal-dielectric layered flat lenses can be described (and
   tailored) by the concavity and spectral reach of the dominant band in
   their EPCs. Homogenization methods for describing the effective optical
   properties of various layered systems are validated by the extent to
   which they accurately mimic features in their EPCs. (C) 2014 AIP

   Dictator Game}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{The evolution of cooperation is a hot and challenging topic in the field
   of evolutionary game theory. Altruistic behavior, as a particular form
   of cooperation, has been widely studied by the ultimatum game but not by
   the dictator game, which provides a more elegant way to identify the
   altruistic component of behaviors. In this paper, the evolutionary
   dictator game is applied to model the real motivations of altruism. A
   degree-based regime is utilized to assess the impact of the assignation
   of roles on evolutionary outcome in populations of heterogeneous
   structure with two kinds of strategic updating mechanisms, which are
   based on Darwin's theory of evolution and punctuated equilibrium,
   respectively. The results show that the evolutionary outcome is affected
   by the role assignation and that this impact also depends on the
   strategic updating mechanisms, the function used to evaluate players'
   success, and the structure of populations.}},

Title = {{Effects of insulin on human pancreatic cancer progression modeled in
   vitro}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the most lethal cancers,
   yet it remains understudied and poorly understood. Hyperinsulinemia has
   been reported to be a risk factor of pancreatic cancer, and the rapid
   rise of hyperinsulinemia associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes
   foreshadows a rise in cancer incidence. However, the actions of insulin
   at the various stages of pancreatic cancer progression remain poorly
   defined.
   Methods: Here, we examined the effects of a range of insulin doses on
   signalling, proliferation and survival in three human cell models meant
   to represent three stages in pancreatic cancer progression: primary
   pancreatic duct cells, the HPDE immortalized pancreatic ductal cell
   line, and the PANC1 metastatic pancreatic cancer cell line. Cells were
   treated with a range of insulin doses, and their proliferation/viability
   were tracked via live cell imaging and XTT assays. Signal transduction
   was assessed through the AKT and ERK signalling pathways via
   immunoblotting. Inhibitors of AKT and ERK signalling were used to
   determine the relative contribution of these pathways to the survival of
   each cell model.
   Results: While all three cell types responded to insulin, as indicated
   by phosphorylation of AKT and ERK, we found that there were stark
   differences in insulin-dependent proliferation, cell viability and cell
   survival among the cell types. High concentrations of insulin increased
   PANC1 and HPDE cell number, but did not alter primary duct cell
   proliferation in vitro. Cell survival was enhanced by insulin in both
   primary duct cells and HPDE cells. Moreover, we found that primary cells
   were more dependent on AKT signalling, while HPDE cells and PANC1 cells
   were more dependent on RAF/ERK signalling.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that excessive insulin signalling may
   contribute to proliferation and survival in human immortalized
   pancreatic ductal cells and metastatic pancreatic cancer cells, but not
   in normal adult human pancreatic ductal cells. These data suggest that
   signalling pathways involved in cell survival may be rewired during
   pancreatic cancer progression.}},

Abstract = {{Resolving atomic-scale defect topologies and energetics with accurate
   atomistic interaction models provides access to the nonlinear phenomena
   inherent at atomic length and time scales. Coarse graining the dynamics
   of such simulations to look at the migration of, e.g., solute atoms,
   while retaining the rich atomic-scale detail required to properly
   describe defects, is a particular challenge. In this paper, we present
   an adaptation of the recently developed ``diffusive molecular
   dynamics{''} model to describe the energetics and kinetics of binary
   alloys on diffusive time scales. The potential of the technique is
   illustrated by applying it to the classic problems of solute segregation
   to a planar boundary (stacking fault) and edge dislocation in the Al-Mg
   system. Our approach provides fully dynamical solutions in situations
   with an evolving energy landscape in a computationally efficient way,
   where atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulations are difficult or
   impractical to perform.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel quantization-based information hiding
   approach, which is invariant to gain attack. In the presented scheme,
   the host signal vector is first divided into two parts, then l (p)-norm
   of each vector is calculated. The watermark bits are embedded by
   quantizing the ratio of the l (p)-norm of each part. The decoding scheme
   is performed blindly using the Euclidean distance. Due to the use of
   division function, the proposed method is robust to scaling attacks. The
   analytical error probability and embedding distortion are derived and
   assessed by simulations on artificial signals. The optimum parameter in
   the l (p)-norm function is obtained based on minimizing the error
   probability. Experimental results confirm the superiority of the
   proposed technique against common attacks in comparison with the
   existing state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{Autografts and allografts are extensively used for reconstruction of
   skeletal defects caused by trauma, tumor resection, and other diseases.
   They are also often used together with total hip and total knee
   implants. Similar to synthetic implants, these bone grafts also face the
   risk of infection. In this report, we propose to combine bone
   autografting and allografting with local delivery of antimicrobial
   agents to combat pen-implant infections. A special group of
   antimicrobial peptides was selected for this purpose to address the
   concern of developing antibiotic resistance. Both natural and sintered
   trabecular bone specimens were impregnated with a short cationic
   antimicrobial peptide HHC-36 (KRWWKWWRR). Antimicrobial activity using a
   survival assay against Gram-positive bacterium, S. aureus confirmed that
   the natural bone scaffolds could kill 100\% of bacterial cells, while
   the sintered scaffolds could reduce the number of bacterial cells by
   99\% within four hours of culture. Such a difference is attributed to
   the peptide loading efficiency in the natural bone scaffolds which is
   five times as high as that in the sintered trabecular bone specimens.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to find an optimal mixture ratio of the
   platinum-loaded carbon catalyst and the electrolyte in a membrane
   electrode assembly (MEA) of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell for
   reducing the activation resistance, which influences the electrochemical
   surface area, activation polarization, and maximum power density of the
   MEA. First, mixture ratios of 10, 20, 40, and 60 wt\% platinum-loaded
   carbon catalysts and electrolyte were examined. The results indicated
   that the fuel cell performance improved for mixing weight ratios of
   1.0:2.0 in 10 wt\% Pt/C, 1.0:1.8 in 20 wt\% Pt/C, 1.0:1.1 in 40 wt\%
   Pt/C, and 1.0:0.5 in 60 wt\% Pt/C. Next, we evaluated the activation
   resistances of the MEA from the AC impedance characteristics using the
   optimal mixing weight ratio of the platinum-loaded carbon catalyst and
   the electrolyte. It was found that the activation resistances of the
   anode and cathode decrease with an increase in the weight ratio of
   platinum-loaded carbon in the catalyst layer. (C) 2013 The Institution

Abstract = {{Watermarking and data hiding are important tools for copyright
   protection of digital media contents. To reduce the interference effect
   of the host signal and improve the decoding performance in the popular
   additive Spread Spectrum (ASS) embedding scheme, we have proposed a
   novel correlation-and-bit-aware additive Spread Spectrum (CASS)
   embedding scheme for the Gaussian distributed host signal. However, in
   practice, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of real
   images follow the Laplacian distribution. For practical application of
   CASS to real images in the DCT domain, this paper proposes a CASS data
   hiding scheme for the Laplacian distributed host image signal. To
   extract the hidden message bits, we derive an optimal decoder of the ASS
   scheme for the Laplacian distributed host signal. The bit-error ratio
   (BER) of ASS and proposed CASS schemes are analyzed in theory. Finally,
   Monte Carlo simulations and tests on real images are carried out to
   illustrate the decoding performance of the ASS and proposed CASS
   schemes. Compared with the traditional ASS scheme, the proposed CASS
   scheme maintains the simplicity of the decoder, significantly reduces
   the host effect in data hiding and improves the decoding performance
   remarkably. As an extension, we discuss the CASS scheme for the
   generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) distributed host signal in
   brief. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{16-36}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Collecting microscopic pedestrian behavior and characteristics data is
   important for optimizing the design of pedestrian facilities for safety,
   efficiency, and comfortability. This paper provides a framework for the
   automated classification of pedestrian attributes such as age and gender
   based on information extracted from their walking gait behavior. The
   framework extends earlier work on the automated analysis of gait
   parameters to include analysis of the gait acceleration data which can
   enable the quantification of the variability, rhythmic pattern and
   stability of pedestrian's gait. In this framework, computer vision
   techniques are used for the automatic detection and tracking of
   pedestrians in an open environment resulting in pedestrian trajectories
   and the speed and acceleration dynamic profiles. A collection of gait
   features are then derived from those dynamic profiles and used for the
   classification of pedestrian attributes. The gait features include
   conventional gait parameters such as gait length and frequency and
   dynamic parameters related to gait variations and stability measures.
   Two different techniques are used for the classification: a supervised
   k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm and a newly developed
   semi-supervised spectral clustering. The classification framework is
   demonstrated with two case studies from Vancouver, British Columbia and
   Oakland, California. The results show the superiority of features sets
   including gait variations and stability measures over features relying
   only on conventional gait parameters. For gender, correct classification
   rates (CCR) of 80\% and 94\% were achieved for the Vancouver and Oakland
   case studies, respectively. The classification accuracy for gender was
   higher in the Oakland case which only considered pedestrians walking
   alone. Pedestrian age classification resulted in a CCR of 90\% for the
   Oakland case study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One of the biggest challenges facing wireless designers is determining
   how to configure multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antennas in
   underground-environments, such as mines, so that they deliver best
   performance. Here, we showed that angular dispersion of the signal, a
   phenomenon that greatly impacts channel capacity, can be accurately
   predicted in both near-field and far-field of underground tunnels using
   a multimode waveguide. Not only this analytical model is much faster
   than other methods, but also it does not have other shortcomings of
   measurement-based modeling (e.g., poor resolution for far distances in
   the tunnel). Further, we characterized angular-spread for different
   tunnel sizes and showed that the power-azimuth-spectrum can be modeled
   by a zero-mean Gaussian distribution whose standard-deviation
   (angular-spread) is dependent on the tunnel dimension and the
   transmitter-receiver distance. Angular-spread is found to be a
   decreasing function of axial distance. After a certain distance, it
   becomes very small (about 4 degrees) and independent of tunnel
   transverse dimension. Our results are useful for design of MIMO systems
   in underground tunnels and sufficient to permit the correlation-matrix
   required to extend the IEEE 802.11n MIMO channel model to underground
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Grid-connected converters employ LCL-filters, instead of simple
   inductors, because they allow lower inductances while reducing cost and
   size. Active damping, without dissipative elements, is preferred to
   passive damping for solving the associated stability problems. However,
   large variations in the grid inductance may compromise system stability,
   and this problem is more severe for parallel converters. This situation,
   typical of rural areas with solar and wind resources, calls for robust
   LCL-filter design. This paper proposes a design procedure with
   remarkable results under severe grid inductance variation. The procedure
   considers active damping using lead-lag network and capacitor current
   feedback. Passive damping is also discussed. The design flow, with
   little iteration and no complex algorithms, selects the proper ratios
   between the switching and resonance frequency, the grid and converter
   inductance, and the filter capacitance and total inductance. An
   estimation for the grid current total harmonic distortion (THD) is also
   proposed. Simulation and experiments validate the proposals.}},

Abstract = {{Two factors commonly differentiate proposed balance control models for
   quiet human standing: 1) intermittent muscle activation and 2)
   prediction that overcomes sensorimotor time delays. In this experiment
   we assessed the viability and performance of intermittent activation and
   prediction in a balance control loop that included the neuromuscular
   dynamics of human calf muscles. Muscles were driven by functional
   electrical stimulation (FES). The performance of the different
   controllers was compared based on sway patterns and mechanical effort
   required to balance a human body load on a robotic balance simulator.
   All evaluated controllers balanced subjects with and without a neural
   block applied to their common peroneal and tibial nerves, showing that
   the models can produce stable balance in the absence of natural
   activation. Intermittent activation required less stimulation energy
   than continuous control but predisposed the system to increased sway.
   Relative to intermittent control, continuous control reproduced the sway
   size of natural standing better. Prediction was not necessary for stable
   balance control but did improve stability when control was intermittent,
   suggesting a possible benefit of a predictor for intermittent
   activation. Further application of intermittent activation and
   predictive control models may drive prolonged, stable FES-controlled
   standing that improves quality of life for people with balance
   impairments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an energy-efficient resource allocation scheme is
   designed for orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access cellular
   wireless networks with multiuser cooperation. Joint relay selection,
   subcarrier allocation and pairing, and power-allocation algorithms are
   developed with the objective of maximizing the energy efficiency of the
   system considering the quality-of-service requirements of the users. The
   optimization problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which
   is generally very difficult to solve in its original form. The energy
   efficiency metric is a fractional and nonlinear function, which
   complicates the problem further. We provide a novel optimization
   framework to solve such nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problems.
   The MINLP optimization problem is reformulated to a convex problem by
   relaxing the integer variables and by introducing the ``Dinkelbach{''}
   method to tackle the nonlinear fractional objective function. We prove
   that our proposed solution of the relaxed problem is optimal and has
   integer values. Based on the dual-decomposition method, we propose a
   solution to the joint optimization problem, which is optimal and
   computationally efficient with polynomial-time complexity. Numerical
   results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose multiuser two-way relaying strategies for
   pairwise internode communication in a network consisting of
   ultrawideband transceivers with limited signal processing capability,
   via a central relay unit. We propose reducing the complexity associated
   with the design of filters at the relay by using pre/post-rake
   processing in conjunction with optimized filtering at the relay. Two
   relaying strategies relevant to multipath fading channels, namely,
   detect-and-forward and filter-and-forward with self-interference
   cancelation, are considered. For both methods, we start with a convex
   optimization problem formulation with closed-form solutions, then extend
   the design to the more general case, which is a nonconvex problem, and
   use an alternating optimization algorithm to solve the design problems.
   Furthermore, for both design schemes, widely linear design formulations
   are devised. The presented numerical results demonstrate the capability
   of the proposed design schemes in establishing a reliable communication
   link between nodes with limited signal processing power and in the
   absence of a direct link.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the scarce bandwidth and limited power supply in mobile
   terminals, performance and energy consumption in wireless communications
   must be continually focused upon. Cooperative transmissions improve the
   capacity performance of wireless ad hoc networks (WANETs). However, when
   energy efficiency is considered, the advantage of user cooperation over
   noncooperation does not always exist since it involves multiple nodes
   with more energy consumption in transmissions. To exploit the benefits
   of user cooperation in cooperative WANETs, we propose a distributed
   energy-efficient selective diversity (EESD) topology control to improve
   energy efficiency, which jointly considers network capacity and energy
   consumption in terms of bits per Joule. EESD forms transmission
   coalitions via cooperative manner (i.e, diversity) selection, by taking
   into account the cost of channel information exchange. We then formulate
   EESD as a coalition game and propose an adaptive coalition formation
   algorithm for EESD with proved convergence property and stable coalition
   structures. Simulation results show the performance improvement of EESD
   in energy efficiency and network lifetime compared to the existing
   topology control schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The-aim of this study,was to describe the canal shaping
   properties of ProTaper Next (PTN; Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues,
   Switzerland), ProTaper Universal (PTU; Dentsply Tulsa Dental
   Specialties, Johnson City, TN), and WaveOne (Dentsply Maillefer)
   nickel-titanium instruments in mandibular first molars by using micro
   computed tomographic (micro-CT) scanning. Methods: A total of 36
   maxillary first molars with 2 separate mesial canals and 1 distal canal
   were selected and scanned preoperatively and postoperatively by using
   micro-CT scanning with a voxel size of 30 dam. Canals were prepared with
   PTU, PIN, and WaveOne systems under hypochlorite irrigation. The volume
   of the untreated canal; the volume of dentin removed after preparation;
   the amount of the uninstrumented area; and the transportation to the
   coronal, middle, and apical thirds of canals were measured. The
   preparation time and instrument failure were also recorded. Results:
   Instrumentation of canals increased their volume and surface area. The
   distal canals had a significantly higher proportion of unprepared
   surfaces than mesial canals (P < .05). The PTN system produced less
   transportation than the WaveOne and PTU systems in the apical third of
   the mesial canals (P < .05). There was no significant difference on
   apical transportation in distal canals among the 3 instrument systems.
   Instrumentation with WaveOne was significantly faster than with the
   other 2 instruments (P < .05). Conclusions: The PTN, PTU, and WaveOne
   instruments shaped root canals in mandibular first molars in vitro
   without significant shaping errors. The curved canals prepared using PIN
   had less apical transportation than the canals prepared using WaveOne
   and PTU.}},

Title = {{Steady-state and transient electron transport within the wide energy gap
   compound semiconductors gallium nitride and zinc oxide: an updated and

Abstract = {{The wide energy gap compound semiconductors, gallium nitride and zinc
   oxide, are widely recognized as promising materials for novel electronic
   and optoelectronic device applications. As informed device design
   requires a firm grasp of the material properties of the underlying
   electronic materials, the electron transport that occurs within these
   wide energy gap compound semiconductors has been the focus of
   considerable study over the years. In an effort to provide some
   perspective on this rapidly evolving field, in this paper we review
   analyzes of the electron transport within the wide energy gap compound
   semiconductors, gallium nitride and zinc oxide. In particular, we
   discuss the evolution of the field, compare and contrast results
   determined by different researchers, and survey the current literature.
   In order to narrow the scope of this review, we will primarily focus on
   the electron transport within bulk wurtzite gallium nitride, zinc-blende
   gallium nitride, and wurtzite zinc oxide. The electron transport that
   occurs within bulk zinc-blende gallium arsenide will also be considered,
   albeit primarily for bench-marking purposes. Most of our discussion will
   focus on results obtained from our ensemble semi-classical three-valley
   Monte Carlo simulations of the electron transport within these
   materials, our results conforming with state-of-the-art wide energy gap
   compound semiconductor orthodoxy. A brief tutorial on the Monte Carlo
   electron transport simulation approach, this approach being used to
   generate the results presented herein, will also be featured.
   Steady-state and transient electron transport results are presented. We
   conclude our discussion by presenting some recent developments on the
   electron transport within these materials. The wurtzite gallium nitride
   and zinc-blende gallium arsenide results, being presented in a previous
   review article of ours (O'Leary et al. in J Mater Sci Mater Electron 17:
   87, 2006), are also presented herein for the sake of completeness.}},

Abstract = {{We report experiments on the migration of a large bubble in an otherwise
   monodisperse two-dimensional (2D) foam sheared in a wide-gap Couette
   device. The bubble migrates away from the walls toward an equilibrium
   position between the center of the gap and the inner cylinder. This
   differs from the situation in a narrow-gap Couette device, where the
   equilibrium position is at the center of the gap {[}Mohammadigoushki and
   Feng, Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 084502 (2012)]. The shift in equilibrium
   position is attributed to the non-Newtonian rheology of the foam, which
   is brought out by the non-homogeneous shearing in a wide-gap geometry.
   Two aspects of the rheology, shear-thinning and the first normal stress
   difference, are examined separately by comparing with bubble migration
   in a xanthan gum solution and a Boger fluid. Shear-thinning shifts the
   equilibrium position inward while the normal stress does the opposite.
   Bubble migration in the 2D foam is the outcome of the competition
   between the two effects. (C) 2014 The Society of Rheology.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a bulk-modulation technique is introduced for improving
   the performance of low-drop-out (LDO) voltage regulators. Compared to
   conventional LDO voltage regulators, the proposed circuit achieves
   improved accuracy, stability, and output load current capability. The
   technique is particularly suited for low-power applications such as
   biomedical implants and portable devices. A proof-of-concept prototype
   is designed and fabricated in 0.13-mu m CMOS, to illustrate the
   enhancement that can be achieved by applying this technique. The
   proposed enhanced LDO regulator which is based on conventional LDO
   regulators is able to delivers up to 5 mA of load current while
   providing a 1 V (similar to 1.5\% load regulation) drawing 99.0 mu A
   from a 1.2 V supply. Measurement results confirm that as compared to
   conventional LDOs, the proposed circuit offers better stability as well
   as \%75 improvement in the load current delivery and similar to 10x
   faster recovery time for no-load to and from full-load transitions.}},

Abstract = {{The bidirectional relay channel, in which two users communicate with
   each other through a relay node, is a simple but fundamental and
   practical network architecture. In this paper, we consider the block
   fading bidirectional relay channel with a decode-and-forward relay and
   propose efficient transmission strategies that exploit the block fading
   property of the channel. We assume that a direct link between the two
   users is not present and consider two transmission modes: 1) the
   multiple-access mode (both users transmit to the relay) and 2) the
   broadcast mode (the relay transmits to both users). Most existing
   relaying protocols assume a fixed schedule for using these transmission
   modes. In contrast, we abandon the restriction of having a fixed and
   predefined schedule and propose to optimize the selection of the
   transmission modes and the associated transmission rates based on the
   instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the involved links.
   Thereby, we consider two different types of transmit power constraints:
   1) a fixed transmit power for each node and 2) a per-node long-term
   power constraint. To enable the use of a nonpredefined schedule for
   transmission mode selection, the relay has to be equipped with two
   buffers for storage of the information received from both users. We
   develop new relaying protocols based on adaptive mode selection and
   provide the corresponding achievable long-term rate regions. In
   particular, based on the CSI of the involved links, the optimal
   transmission mode as well as the optimal transmission rates and/or the
   transmit powers of the nodes are chosen in each time slot to maximize
   the weighted sum rate of both users. By varying the weights assigned to
   the users, the boundary surface of the achievable long-term rate region
   of the proposed protocol can be obtained. In addition, we discuss and
   address two practical challenges for the implementation of the proposed
   protocols, namely, the availability of the knowledge of the channel
   statistics required for the implementation of the optimal protocols, and
   the increase of the end-to-end delay due to the data buffering.
   Numerical results confirm the superiority of the proposed buffer-aided
   protocols compared with existing bidirectional relaying protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Most conventional spine interventions are performed under X-ray
   fluoroscopy guidance. In recent years, there has been a growing interest
   to develop nonionizing imaging alternatives to guide these procedures.
   Ultrasound guidance has emerged as a leading alternative. However, a
   challenging problem is automatic identification of the spinal anatomy in
   ultrasound data. In this paper, we propose a local phase-based bone
   feature enhancement technique that can robustly identify the spine
   surface in ultrasound images. The local phase information is obtained
   using a gradient energy tensor filter. This information is used to
   construct local phase tensors in ultrasound images, which highlight the
   spine surface. We show that our proposed approach results in a more
   distinct enhancement of the bone surfaces compared to recently proposed
   techniques based on monogenic scale-space filters and logarithmic Gabor
   filters. We also demonstrate that registration accuracy of a statistical
   shape+pose model of the spine to 3-D ultrasound images can be
   significantly improved, using the proposed method, compared to those
   obtained using monogenic scale-space filters and logarithmic Gabor
   filters.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we describe a novel strategy for synthesizing
   hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites via the nanoscale
   depolymerization-reorganization of natural aluminosilicate minerals.
   This strategy involves two important steps: the first is the top-down
   depolymerization of one aluminum-rich aluminosilicate mineral via a
   novel submolten salt system and one silicon-rich aluminosilicate mineral
   via conventional thermal treatment into nanoscale building blocks, and
   the second is the bottom-up rearrangement and reorganization of
   nanoscale building blocks in the synthesis system into hierarchical
   ZSM-5 zeolites. When used as a fluid catalytic cracking catalyst
   additive, the resulting ZSM-5 zeolite with hierarchical micro-mesoporous
   structure exhibited high activity and selectivity for valuable products
   in preliminary oil refining tests. The salient features of the strategy
   lie in that it neither involves any inorganic aluminum and silicon salts
   as precursors nor uses any secondary mesoscale template and
   post-treatment to create mesopores, thus demonstrating itself to be a
   green route to synthesizing hierarchical zeolites. (C) 2014 Elsevier

   thermal Gleeble cycles of heating up to 1223 K peak temperature,
   followed by cooling at 10, 30, and 60 K/s. The 30 and 60 K/s HAZs showed
   evidence of thin, highly sensitive passive films towards the increased
   chloride concentration, and evidence of increased charge-transfer
   resistance over immersion time at the OCP conditions. The corrosion
   rates of the 30 K/s HAZs, of which acicular ferrite is the main
   constituent, were the lowest, among other samples, as revealed by the
   slow 0.05 mV/s potentiodynamic polarization and EIS. The passive films

Abstract = {{Quantum density functional theory (DFT) is used to compute binding
   energies of important alloying elements (Ag, Zn, Ti, Al, Cd, Zr, Y, Ca,
   Nd, Ce and La) to a Sigma 7 grain boundary (GB) in Mg. In particular,
   quantifying the interaction of rare earth (RE) elements with Mg GBs is
   of significance given the strong effect of these solutes on modifying
   the texture of Mg alloys. For most alloying elements studied, the
   binding energy scales with the size of the solute and the local GB site
   volumes. Based on these trends, a model for the solute-GB binding energy
   is developed which accurately captures the behavior of the
   technologically important RE solutes and Ca. This model is then employed
   in conjunction with molecular statics calculations to predict solute
   segregation to general GBs not accessible by DFT. The predicted trends
   are found to be in qualitative agreement with available experimental
   data for GB segregation in Mg. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{Toward the progress in the era of globalization and ubiquity of sensors
   and devices, sharing and dissemination of information dominate todays
   networks. Content-centric networking, cloud services, and open
   connectivity form the main ingredients of the future Internet
   architecture. With the problem of information overload, the networking
   paradigm of cloud computing can benefit from transitioning to a network
   of information in which information is the main token of communication
   instead of physical address. Available methods may not be efficient in
   exploiting the semantics of information for content dissemination.
   Considering a content-centric approach, we intend to tackle this problem
   by using the expander graphs for an enhanced network coding scheme that
   takes an opportunistic strategy to utilize the spectral characteristics
   of the network topology to achieve a better solvability and reliability
   and lowering the processing cost for the entire system. By simulation
   and analytical evaluation, we compare our proposed method with an
   epidemic network coding based approach. Our evaluation examines the
   performance of our clustering method in the presence of different random

   hydration is analyzed during the filming process at the open-circuit
   potentials. In dilute bicarbonate solutions, H2CO3 drives more
   dominantly the cathodic reduction and the passive films form slowly. In
   the concentrated solutions, bicarbonate catalyzes both the anodic and
   cathodic reactions, only initially, after which it drives a fast-forming
   thick passivation that inhibits the underlying dissolution and impedes
   the cathodic reduction. The significance of the substrate is as critical
   as that of passivation in controlling the course of the corrosion
   reactions in the dilute solutions. For fast-cooled (heat treatment)
   HAZs, its metallurgical significance becomes more comparable to that of

Title = {{Accounting for heterogeneity among treatment sites and time trends in
   developing crash modification functions}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{116-126}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Collision modification factors (CMFs) are commonly used to quantify the
   impact of safety countermeasures. The CMFs obtained from observational
   before-after (BA) studies are usually estimated by averaging the safety
   impact (i.e., index of effectiveness) for a group of treatment sites.
   The heterogeneity among the treatment locations, in terms of their
   characteristics, and the effect of this heterogeneity on safety
   treatment effectiveness are usually ignored. This is in contrast to
   treatment evaluations in other fields like medical statistics where
   variations in the magnitude (or in the direction) of response to the
   same treatment given to different patients are considered.
   This paper introduces an approach for estimating a CMFunction from BA
   safety studies that account for variable treatment location
   characteristics (heterogeneity). The treatment sites heterogeneity was
   incorporated into the CMFunction using fixed-effects and random-effects
   regression models. In addition to heterogeneity, the paper also
   advocates the use of CMFunctions with a time variable to acknowledge
   that the safety treatment (intervention) effects do not occur
   instantaneously but are spread over future time. This is achieved using
   non-linear intervention (Koyck) models, developed within a hierarchical
   full Bayes (FB) context. To demonstrate the approach, a case study is
   presented to evaluate the safety effectiveness of the ``Signal Head
   Upgrade Program{''} recently implemented in the city of Surrey (British
   Columbia, Canada), where signal visibility was improved at several urban
   signalized intersections. The results demonstrated the importance of
   considering treatment sites heterogeneity and time trends when
   developing CMFunctions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Turbulent flow over a rough wall with suction or blowing is an
   industrially important fluid mechanics problem. In the screening of wood
   pulp fibre suspensions, for example, turbulent flow is induced by a
   rotor adjacent to a slotted screen cylinder. To better understand the
   complex hydrodynamics in the critical region between the pulp screen
   rotor and the slotted screen wall, the stream-wise velocity and aperture
   velocities were measured using particle image velocimetry. The vortex
   generated above the aperture is shown to be strongly dependent on
   aperture velocity and wall roughness. The vortex diminishes in size at
   higher aperture velocities and increased exit layer height. The
   experiments also show that the reversal flow in the slot decreases with
   lower rotor speeds and increased mean slot velocities. This observation
   challenges the existing models of apertures being cleared by flow
   reversal driven by a Bernoulli-type suction pulse. In its place, this
   paper identifies elements of a more sophisticated flow model that
   considers the depletion of the zone below the rotor as well as the flow
   in the wake of the foil.}},

   electrospinning and post treatment with 90 vol \% acetone. The effect of
   collection method on the morphology of regenerated spider silk protein
   (RSSP) fibrous scaffold, the effects of the post treatment solvents and
   their concentrations on the molecular conformation, crystallinity and
   mechanical properties were studied. The results show that the morphology
   was affected by the solvent used in the coagulation bath. The molecular
   conformation, crystallinity and mechanical property of this scaffold
   were strongly affected by the kind of post treatment solvent and
   slightly influenced by its concentration when it was higher than 50 vol
   \%. The degradation rate of this scaffold was very slow and resulting in
   little pH change of the degradation medium within 5 months. PC 12 cells
   were cultured on the electrospun RSSP fibrous scaffold and in its
   extraction fluid to examine the changes of PC 12 cells after different
   times of culture. The results show that the electrospun RSSP fibrous

Abstract = {{Standard libraries for systematic evolution of ligands by exponential
   enrichment (SELEX) typically utilize flanking regions that facilitate
   amplification of aptamers recovered from each selection round. Here, we
   show that these flanking sequences can bias the selection process, due
   in part to their ability to interfere with the fold or function of
   aptamers localized within the random region of the library sequence. We
   then address this problem by investigating the use of complementary
   oligonucleotides as a means to block aptamer interference by each
   flanking region. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies are
   combined with fold predictions to both define the various interference
   mechanisms and assess the ability of added complementary
   oligonucleotides to ameliorate them. The proposed blocking strategy is
   thereby refined and then applied to standard library forms of benchmark
   aptamers against human alpha-thrombin, streptavidin, and vascular
   endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In each case, ITC data show that the
   new method effectively removes fixed-region mediated interference
   effects so that the natural binding affinity of the benchmark aptamer is
   completely restored. We further show that the binding affinities of
   properly functioning aptamers within a selection library are not
   affected by the blocking protocol, and that the method can be applied to
   various common library formats comprised of different flanking region
   sequences. Finally, we present a rapid and inexpensive qPCR-based method
   for determining the mean binding affinity of retained aptamer pools and
   use it to show that introduction of the pre-blocking method into the
   standard SELEX protocol results in retention of high-affinity aptamers
   that would otherwise be lost during the first round of selection.
   Significant enrichment of the available pool of high-affinity aptamers
   is thereby achieved in the first few rounds of selection. By eliminating
   single-strand (aptamerlike) structures within or involving the fixed
   regions, the technique is therefore shown to isolate aptamer sequence
   and function within the desired random region of the library members,
   and thereby provide a new selection method that is complementary to
   other available SELEX protocols. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber-reinforced elastomeric isolators (FREIs) are relatively new
   elastomeric bearings in which fiber-reinforced polymer composite plates
   are used as reinforcements rather than steel shims. Here in this
   research, a number of carbon FREIs are produced in scaled size using a
   simple and fast manufacturing process, which has potentials to be
   applied in developing countries. The aim is to show how efficient the
   carbon FREIs in bonded applications can operate under different loading
   conditions. Experimental results show that under cyclic displacements,
   although a partial delamination occurs between rubber layer and steel
   supporting plate because of the rollover deformation at shear strains
   greater than 50\%, the rubber bearings perform properly up to 100\%
   shear strain. The vertical stiffness increases with increasing the
   fiber-reinforced layers' thickness and with decreasing the elastomers'
   thickness. The flexibility in the horizontal direction increases by
   increasing the total thickness of rubber layers, while the energy
   dissipation capacity enhances with increasing the thickness of both
   fiber-reinforced and elastomeric layers. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{108-121}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Scanning reflective surfaces using 3D laser scanners is a challenging
   task since reflective surfaces of complex geometry promote the formation
   of unwanted data outliers. These outliers are characterized with large
   measurement errors, which significantly deteriorate the quality of the
   scanned point cloud data. This paper experimentally investigates the
   formation of outliers in relation to scanning reflective surfaces using
   a commercial laser stripe scanner. Two outlier formation models are
   developed: mixed reflection and multi-path reflection. The undesirable
   specular reflections in both mixed reflection and multi-path reflection
   scanning situations cause multiple peaks in the image sensing arrays.
   The false image peaks are recorded and will eventually be observed as
   outliers because they are not part of the scanned object surface
   geometry. A series of scanning experiments have been conducted and the
   results confirm the validity of the developed outlier formation models.
   Potential applications of the developed models such as scan path
   evaluation and outlier filter design are also discussed. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The leakage of gas between two interconnected gas-solid fluidized beds

   downcomer; and from the BFB to the riser via the loop-seal. Gas leakage
   from the riser to the BFB varied between 0.1 and 0.6\%, translating to 1
   and 7\% of the BFB being contaminated with riser gas. This leakage is
   dependent on pressure difference across the downcomer and the solids
   circulation flux. Leakage in the downcomer is proposed to be caused by
   the riser gas being dragged down by the falling particles in the upper
   section of the downcomer. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The extent and causes of attrition for three possible carbon dioxide
   capture sorbents for fluidized bed systems were investigated. The
   sorbents were crushed limestone, lime-based pellets containing calcium

   standard, with several improvements in testing capabilities, was used to
   conduct experiments for varying attrition periods, gas velocities,
   temperatures, relative humidities and initial particle sizes. The
   results indicate that the cement-bound pellets suffered similar or worse
   attrition than crushed limestone, and were highly sensitive to humidity
   because of the hygroscopic cement and formation of calcium hydroxide.
   The silica-coated pellets were found to have high attrition resistance
   in dry air at 500 degrees C. After 24 h of operation, compared to the

Abstract = {{This paper reports batch-mode, three-dimensional micropatterning for
   arrays of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes, also known as CNT
   forests, based on dry micro-electro-discharge machining (mu EDM). The
   process employs an array of copper electrodes microfabricated through an
   advanced UV-LIGA process enabled with a new photoresist system in
   combination with electroplating, providing a low-cost path to
   constructing high-density arrays of mu EDM electrodes for
   high-throughput parallel processing. The fabricated arrays of 85-mu
   m-tall electrodes are utilized to demonstrate and characterize planar
   dry mu EDM for post-growth patterning of CNT forests in air. Die sinking
   and scanning processes are tested to show pattern transfers with a 4-mu
   m tolerance and an average surface roughness of 230 nm. An elemental
   analysis suggests that contamination of the electrode material on the
   produced patterns is minimal. Key characteristics in the use of planar
   electrodes for batch processing of CNT forests are revealed through
   experimental analysis and discussed in detail. The results suggest that
   the investigated process is a promising approach toward offering a
   cost-effective manufacturing technology for future products
   functionalized with custom-designed microstructures of CNT forests. (C)

Abstract = {{The Swiss-roll single-cell mixed reactant (SR-MRFC) borohydride oxygen
   fuel cell equipped with Pt/carbon cloth 3D anode and either MnO2 or Ag
   gas-diffusion cathodes is investigated by a combination of experimental

   We investigate the effects of four variables: cathode side metallic mesh
   fluid distributor, separator type (Nafion 112 (R) vs. Viledone (R)),
   cathode catalyst (MnO2 vs. Ag), and the hydrophilic pore volume fraction
   of the gas-diffusion cathode. Using a two-phase feed of alkaline
   borohydride solution (1 M NaBH4 2 M NaOH) and O-2 gas in an SR-MRFC
   equipped with Pt/C 3D anode, MnO2 gas diffusion cathode, Viledon (R)
   porous diaphragm, expanded mesh cathode-side fluid distributor, the
   maximum superficial power density is 2230W m(-2) at 323 K and 105
   kPa(abs). The latter superficial power density is almost 3.5 times
   higher than our previously reported superficial power density for the
   same catalyst combinations. Furthermore, with a Pt anode and Ag cathode
   catalyst combination, a superficial power density of 2500 W m(-2) is
   achieved with superior performance durability compared to the MnO2
   cathode. The fuel cell results are substantiated by impedance
   spectroscopy analysis and preliminary mathematical model predictions

Abstract = {{Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) strategies in photovoltaic (PV)
   systems ensure efficient utilization of PV arrays. Among different
   strategies, the perturb and observe (P\&O) algorithm has gained wide
   popularity due to its intuitive nature and simple implementation.
   However, such simplicity in P\&O introduces two inherent issues, namely,
   an artificial perturbation that creates losses in steady-state operation
   and a limited ability to track transients in changing environmental
   conditions. This paper develops and discusses in detail an MPPT
   algorithm with zero oscillation and slope tracking to address those
   technical challenges. The strategy combines three techniques to improve
   steady-state behavior and transient operation: 1) idle operation on the
   maximum power point (MPP); 2) identification of the irradiance change
   through a natural perturbation; and 3) a simple multilevel adaptive
   tracking step. Two key elements, which form the foundation of the
   proposed solution, are investigated: 1) the suppression of the
   artificial perturb at the MPP; and 2) the indirect identification of
   irradiance change through a current-monitoring algorithm, which acts as
   a natural perturbation. The zero-oscillation adaptive step P\&O strategy
   builds on these mechanisms to identify relevant information and to
   produce efficiency gains. As a result, the combined techniques achieve
   superior overall performance while maintaining simplicity of
   implementation. Simulations and experimental results are provided to
   validate the proposed strategy, and to illustrate its behavior in steady
   and transient operations.}},

Title = {{Sleep Scheduling for Geographic Routing in Duty-Cycled Mobile Sensor

Abstract = {{Recently, the research focus on geographic routing, a promising routing
   scheme in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), is shifting toward
   duty-cycled WSNs in which sensors are sleep scheduled to reduce energy
   consumption. However, except the connected-k neighborhood (CKN) sleep
   scheduling algorithm and the geographic routing oriented sleep
   scheduling (GSS) algorithm, nearly all research work about geographic
   routing in duty-cycled WSNs has focused on the geographic forwarding
   mechanism; further, most of the existing work has ignored the fact that
   sensors can be mobile. In this paper, we focus on sleep scheduling for
   geographic routing in duty-cycled WSNs with mobile sensors and propose
   two geographic-distance-based connected-k neighborhood (GCKN) sleep
   scheduling algorithms. The first one is the geographic-distance-based
   connected-kneighborhood for first path (GCKNF) sleep scheduling
   algorithm. The second one is the geographic-distance-based
   connected-kneighborhood for all paths (GCKNA) sleep scheduling
   algorithm. By theoretical analysis and simulations, we show that when
   there are mobile sensors, geographic routing can achieve much shorter
   average lengths for the first transmission path explored in WSNs
   employing GCKNF sleep scheduling and all transmission paths searched in
   WSNs employing GCKNA sleep scheduling compared with those in WSNs
   employing CKN and GSS sleep scheduling.}},

Title = {{Affinity-based design of a synthetic universal reversal agent for
   heparin anticoagulants}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{260}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{Heparin-based anticoagulant drugs have been widely used for the
   prevention of blood clotting during surgical procedures and for the
   treatment of thromboembolic events. However, bleeding risks associated
   with these anticoagulants demand continuous monitoring and
   neutralization with suitable antidotes. Protamine, the only clinically
   approved antidote to heparin, has shown adverse effects and
   ineffectiveness against low-molecular weight heparins and fondaparinux,
   a heparin-related medication. Alternative approaches based on cationic
   molecules and recombinant proteins have several drawbacks including
   limited efficacy, toxicity, immunogenicity, and high cost. Thus, there
   is an unmet clinical need for safer, rapid, predictable, and
   cost-effective anticoagulant-reversal agents for all clinically used
   heparins. We report a design strategy for a fully synthetic dendritic
   polymer-based universal heparin reversal agent (UHRA) that makes use of
   multivalent presentation of branched cationic heparin binding groups
   (HBGs). Optimization of the UHRA design was aided by isothermal
   titration calorimetry studies, biocompatibility evaluation, and heparin
   neutralization analysis. By controlling the scaffold's molecular weight,
   the nature of the protective shell, and the presentation of HBGs on the
   polymer scaffold, we arrived at lead UHRA molecules that completely
   neutralized the activity of all clinically used heparins. The optimized
   UHRA molecules demonstrated superior efficacy and safety profiles and
   mitigated heparin-induced bleeding in animal models. This new polymer
   therapeutic may benefit patients undergoing high-risk surgical
   procedures and has potential for the treatment of anticoagulant-related
   bleeding problems.}},

Abstract = {{Highly stabilized mesoporous core shell-structured CaO-based spheriform
   CO2 sorbents are fabricated, for the first time, by a novel repeated
   impregnation coating process combined with the mesoscopic
   surfactant-templating method. By adopting our established wet-coating
   strategy along with a sol gel process, different mesoporous
   material-shelled sorbents with various shell thicknesses (1-5 mu m) and
   shell compositions (silica/zirconia or pure zirconia) are synthesized.
   Cyclic CO2 capture performance is tested in a thermogravimetric analyzer
   with the core shell pellet sorbents with a similar to 1 mu m mesoporous
   zirconia shell exhibiting an unprecedented CO2 uptake capacity of
   similar to 7.2 moles CO2 per kg decarbonated sorbent and the lowest
   activity loss of only 30.8\% after 20 cycles. This is attributed to the
   unique core shell coating strategy in which the thermally stable Zr
   species prevent the aggregation and overgrowth of CaO crystals and
   sorbent sintering. When comparing the core shell sorbents with
   Si-contained mesoporous shells, zirconia shelled ones exhibit
   significantly more outstanding performance. An attrition study using an
   air-jet apparatus under the standard test method reveals that the
   mesoporous zirconia shelled sorbent exhibits enhanced attrition
   resistance, which is also attributed to the novel core shell design,
   offering protection for the reactive core.}},

Abstract = {{Na-doped Ni-rich LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode material,
   Li0.97Na0.03Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2, is synthesized by a hydroxide
   co-precipitation route. The structural characterization reveals that the
   substitution of Na for Li results in a more ordered alpha-NaFeO2
   structure, enlarges Li layer spacing, and reduces the degree of cation
   mixing. The Li0.97Na0.03Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 material has a high tap
   density of 2.17 g cm(-3) that meets the commercial requirement in
   lithium ion batteries (LIBs). The galvanostatic charge/discharge results
   show that the electrochemical performance of the
   Li0.97Na0.03Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 is significantly improved. At 0.2, 1, 10,
   30 and 50 C, the specific capacities of the
   Li0.97Na0.03Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 are 228.43, 163.12, 121.43, 95.56 and
   60.09 mA h g(-1), respectively, which are superior to those of the
   undoped LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 due to the enlargement of Li layer spacing,
   the decreased degree of cation mixing, and the rapid diffusion of Li-ion
   in the bulk lattice after the substitution of Na for Li. Therefore, the
   Na-doped Ni-rich LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 material is a promising cathode
   candidate for the next generation of LIBs.}},

Abstract = {{Modulating autophagy provides a new method to increase CHO cell protein
   production. A fed-batch protocol using the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyl
   adenine (3-MA), developed for a tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA)
   expressing DHFR based CHO cell line, was successfully adapted to a
   monoclonal antibody (MAb) expressing CHOK1-SV based CHO cell line. By
   optimizing the timing and dose of 3-MA treatment, the cell-specific
   productivity was increased 4-fold, resulting in 2-fold increased total
   MAb production. The positive effect of the 3-MA treatment appeared to be
   reduced when the amino acid feed concentration was increased 5-fold.
   Further investigation revealed that by slowly increasing osmolality up
   to similar to 450 mOsm/kg, both the cell-specific productivity and the
   total MAb almost doubled. This effect was replicated with a DUXB-based
   CHO cell line expressing a human-llama chimeric antibody. The positive
   effect of gradually increasing osmolality was then combined with the
   positive effects of the 3-MA treatment, however their combined effect
   were not additive. Thus, either increased osmolality or 3-MA treatment
   were equally effective in increasing MAb-CHO cell fed-batch production
   on the cell lines tested. Analysis of protein glycosylation showed that
   both of these fed-batch modifications did not substantially influence
   the overall glycan profiles of the MAb product. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Attrition is very important in fluidized-bed reactors, especially for
   limestone-based sorbents used to capture SO2 and CO2. The initial size
   distribution of the sorbent particles is commonly used to predict the
   rate of attrition, but the distribution changes during the process.
   Limestone samples of narrow particle size distributions (PSDs) were
   tested in an ASTM air-jet attrition apparatus, and the evolution of the
   PSDs was investigated. The entropies of information on log-normal
   functions, a measure of the disorder of particles being entrained into
   the jets, remained almost unchanged during the attrition process. This
   indicates that particles of greater entropy generally experience
   attrition at a greater rate in an air-jet apparatus, except for
   particles which are too large to be mobilized or too small to stay in
   the bed.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time in situ synchrotron X-ray tomographic microscopy was used to
   gain new insights into and quantify the nucleation mechanisms and growth
   kinetics of beta-Al5FeSi intermetallics during solidification of an
   aluminium A1-7.5Si-3.5Cu-0.6Fe (wt.\%) alloy. Three new insights were
   obtained. First, the plate-like beta-intermetallics appeared to nucleate
   mainly on or near the primary aluminium dendrites and to a lesser extent
   off the oxide skin on the surface of the specimen. Second, for this
   alloy composition, beta-intermetallic formation was largely complete
   before the formation of Al-Si eutectic. Third, the beta-intermetallics
   formed via fast lateral growth, wrapping around and in between the
   primary dendrite arms. Further, the nucleation and growth dynamics of
   beta-intermetallics were quantified as a function of undercooling in a
   functional form that could be easily used in microstructural
   simulations. The frequency of intermetallic interaction mechanisms, such
   as plate nucleation vs. impingement and branching, were also quantified.

Abstract = {{The increase in gold price of over 400\% between 2002 and 2012, due to a
   shift towards safe investments in a period of crisis in the global
   economy, created a rapid increase in gold production. A response to this
   shift in production was observed for artisanal and small-scale mining
   (ASM) units in remote locations of the world, but this phenomenon has
   not been quantified yet. The work presented here was done to provide a
   quantitative tool for estimation of the gold (Au) produced by ASM and
   the population of workers involved in the production process, and
   assessment of mercury (Hg) consumed. The following hypotheses were
   addressed: i) It is possible to estimate, on first approximation, the
   amount of Au production in the world by artisanal mining; ii) Au
   production by artisanal mining varies by country and continent and iii)
   Hg consumption due to ASM can be correlated with the methods applied in
   the different countries and continents for the production of Au. To do
   this we estimated the number of miners, calculated the change in Au
   price and production and then applied an adjustment factor to calculate
   Hg Production by country and continent. The amount of Au produced
   depends on technology of the miners by continents (highest in South
   America, medium in Asia and Central America, and lowest in Africa), and
   the geologic setting (not investigated here). The results of the
   estimation show that, as of 2011, over 16 million Artisanal Miners, in
   the world, were involved in gold extraction (mining or treatment),
   producing between 380 and 450 t of gold per year, with clear global
   behavior between the continents in terms of recovery efficiency,
   confirmed by data on Hg release that is higher in countries with lower
   technology. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{178-186}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{A method for determining the minimum practical energy for comminution
   was developed and is presented in this paper. An objective of the method
   was to determine experimentally the energy-breakage relationship for a
   wide size range in order to evaluate the energy performance of both
   crushing and grinding processes using one energy benchmarking value.
   Single-particle compression breakage, referred to in the field of
   comminution as one of the more efficient forms of mechanical
   comminution, was the basis for a test regimen to characterize the
   energy-breakage properties of ores. Existing models for impact breakage
   were found to be valid for single-particle compression breakage when
   used in a modified form. A key parameter of the adopted model, the
   threshold energy, was also investigated for three ore types and a range
   of particle sizes.
   The energy performance of comminution processes at a Canadian mining
   operation was determined by comparing the determined minimum practical
   energy, using the new method, with actual site specific energy
   requirements. In order to evaluate the energy performance of different
   crushing and grinding technologies, the proposed energy benchmarking
   method was used to compare the energy performance of alternative
   comminution flowsheets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biomass is considered a renewable and eco-friendly source for conversion
   into bioenergy. The objective of this paper is to investigate the gas
   emissions and dry matter loss during storage for better management and
   handling of biomass. Experiments were conducted using Douglas fir
   residues for a range of temperatures under non-aerobic and aerobic
   conditions. Results showed that the CO2 emission from the mixed chips
   and greens was an order of magnitude greater than the wood chips. CO2
   emissions from the aerobic reactors exhibited similar trends as the
   non-aerobic reactors with respect to the effect of temperature. Similar
   types of volatile organic compounds were detected from the chips and the
   mixed materials. Total gas emissions from the aerobic reactors were
   higher than the non-aerobic reactors. Dry matter loss and gas emissions

Abstract = {{A novel ion transport membrane laboratory reactor is introduced which
   can sample gases at the La0.9Ca0.1FeO3-delta membrane surface at high
   temperature flux conditions. Experimental data (spatial profiles and
   operating condition sensitivity) is presented and used to validate
   detailed 1D and 2D numerical models under inert (CO2 sweep) operating
   conditions; the numerical models account for mass transfer resistances
   to the membrane surface. Bypassing the mass transfer resistances
   experimentally allows for direct parameterization of a three resistance
   oxygen flux model; a unique solution method based on bespoke
   experimental datasets to find surface exchange reaction rate constants
   is demonstrated. Membrane operating regimes and oxygen
   off-stoichiometric coefficients can thus be determined highlighting the
   importance of surface exchange studies and the obvious requirement to
   reduce sweep surface P-O2 through oxyfuel reaction integration and/or
   flow field adjustments. A more complex first-order flux model is also
   proposed and tested incorporating the surface oxygen ion concentrations
   in the surface exchange reactions; this is found to give similar
   material parameters to the simpler zero-order model studied in the
   literature for this particular case. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The use of carbon (C) in SiGe base layers is an important approach to
   control the base layer dopant phosphorus (P) diffusion and thus enhance
   PNP heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) performance. This work
   quantitatively investigated the carbon impacts on P diffusion in
   Si0.82Ge0.18:C and Si:C under rapid thermal anneal conditions. The
   carbon molar fraction is up to 0.32\%. The results showed that the
   carbon retardation effect on P diffusion is less effective for
   Si0.82Ge0.18:C than for Si:C. In Si0.82Ge0.18:C, there is an optimum
   carbon content at around 0.05\% to 0.1\%, beyond which more carbon
   incorporation does not retard P diffusion any more. This behavior is
   different from the P diffusion behavior in Si: C and the B in Si: C and
   low Ge SiGe:C, which can be explained by the decreased
   interstitial-mediated diffusion fraction f(I)(P;SiGe) to 95\% as Ge
   content increases to 18\%. Empirical models were established to
   calculate the time-averaged point defect concentrations and effective
   diffusivities as a function of carbon and was shown to agree with
   previous studies on boron, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony diffusion
   with carbon. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Stretchable electronic systems can play instrumental role for
   reconfigurable macro-electronics such as distributed sensor networks for

   the predominant material for 90\% of electronics. Therefore, we report
   the design and fabrication of an all silicon based network of hexagonal
   islands connected through spiral springs to form an ultra-stretchable
   arrangement for complete compliance to highly asymmetric shapes. Several
   design parameters are considered and their validation is carried out
   through finite element analysis. The fabrication process is based on
   conventional microfabrication techniques and the measured stretchability
   is more than 1000\% for single spirals and area expansions as high as 30
   folds in arrays. The reported method can provide ultra-stretchable and

Abstract = {{We report on the synthesis of zirconium dioxide-reduced graphene oxide
   composite (ZrO2-rGO) and its application as a novel architecture for
   electrochemical sensing and biosensing purposes. ZrO2-rGO hybrid is
   synthesized through a simple one-step hydrothermal route, where the
   reduction of GO and the in-situ generation of ZrO2 nanoparticles (NPs)
   occurred simultaneously. Characterization of the resultant hybrid
   material using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), Xray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy clearly
   indicated the homogeneous dispersion of ZrO2 NPs with-particle sizes of
   similar to 5 nm on rGO sheets. The potential application of ZrO2-rGO
   modified glassy carbon electrode (ZrO2-rGO/GC) for electroanalytical
   purposes was demonstrated by using several important electroactive
   compounds as representative examples (i.e., O-2, hydrogen peroxide
   (H2O2), glucose, ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA) and uric acid (UA)).
   Electrochemical control experiments by using different composites of
   ZrO2/graphite, ZrO2/Active Carbon and ZrO2 electrodeposited on activated
   GC electrode revealed that the ZrO2-rGO composite possessed superior
   electrocatalytic activitiy towards the catalytic reduction of O-2 and
   H2O2 at more reduced overpotentials. The linear range of H2O2
   concentration was from 0.10 to 1340 mu M with the detection limit of 20
   nM (S/N = 3). Furthermore, via immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOx)
   enzyme onto the ZrO2-rGO/GC electrode surface, the ability of modified
   electrode for biosensing glucose was demonstrated. In addition, the
   modified electrode can be applied for simultaneous detection of AA, DA
   and UA, using differential pulse voltammetry as measuring technique. We
   envisage that the ZrO2-rGO hybrid may hold great promise for the
   development of electrochemical sensors and biosensors as well as other
   applications, such as supercapacitors and fuel cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Conventional pushover analyses despite of extensive applications are
   unable to estimate the general responses of asymmetric-plan tall
   buildings because of ignoring the effects of higher modes and torsion. A
   consecutive modal pushover procedure is one of the recent nonlinear
   static pushover procedures that used to analyse the seismic response of
   one-way asymmetric-plan tall buildings under one-directional seismic
   ground motions. In this paper, a modified consecutive modal pushover
   procedure (MCMP) has been proposed to estimate the seismic demands of
   two-way asymmetric-plan tall buildings under two horizontal components
   of earthquakes simultaneously. The accuracy of the MCMP procedure is
   evaluated using different buildings and comparing with the results of
   FEMA(Federal Emergency Management Agency) procedures, the practical
   modal pushover procedure and nonlinear time history analyses as an exact
   solution. The results show the proposed MCMP procedure is able to
   estimate the displacements and storey drifts accurately and introduces a
   great improvement in predicting the plastic hinge rotations. Copyright

Abstract = {{Crystalline silicon, widely used in the electronic industry, is also a
   very popular material for calibrating Raman spectrometry instruments.
   Silicon chips cut or cleaved from commercially available silicon wafers
   are low-cost monolithic monocrystalline materials that give a strong
   Raman line at 521 cm(-1) with almost no background. Such chips have at
   least one optically flat surface and can be used in place of glass
   microscope slides as sample substrates that provide an internal
   calibration standard during Raman measurements. The Raman signal
   intensity from the silicon can be selectively attenuated by depositing a
   gold layer on top of the silicon surface with variable thickness such
   that the far-field silicon Raman signal is comparable with the Raman
   signal of an investigated material adjacent to this structure. This gold
   layer provides the additional advantage of increased sensitivity of the
   spectral signal from the sample due to the reflectivity of the gold
   surface, which allows forward and backscattered analyte Raman excitation
   and signal collection. An additional thin encapsulating overlayer of
   SiO2 provides a protective and biocompatible surface to facilitate Raman
   microspectroscopic investigation of live cells.}},

Abstract = {{Water management remains a significant challenge for the Proton Exchange
   Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) with respect to performance, lifetime and
   operational flexibility. In recent years, microporous layers (MPL) have
   been widely used on the cathode side of the PEMFC in order to improve
   fuel cell performance and water management capabilities. Many modeling
   and experimental studies have with limited success attempted to analyze
   the underlying mechanisms that are responsible for the performance
   improvement due to the MPL. In this study, porous inserts along with
   various in-situ experimental techniques are used to investigate the
   MPLs. It was observed that the anode pressure drop increased when a
   cathode MPL was present, indicating water cross-over from the cathode
   towards the anode side. Further testing identified that the MPL improved
   cell performance due to the reduction of water saturation in the cathode
   catalyst layer, which resulted in enhanced oxygen diffusion. The
   influence of the MPL on the anode side was also studied with the aid of
   porous inserts and other techniques, and it was observed that the anode
   MPL improves cell voltage stability and reduces water accumulation in
   the anode catalyst layer. The present investigation provides further
   important information on the critical role of the MPL in the PEMFC.

Abstract = {{A novel production approach to the fabrication of capacitive
   micropressure sensors is reported. A magnetic fluid known as ferrofluid
   is used as the liquid-phase sacrificial layer in the microfabrication
   process, enabling extremely simple, fast, and low-cost production of the
   sensors while eliminating the need for photolithographic, bonding,
   and/or chemical processes. The entire sensor fabrication is performed
   at/near room temperature. The sensors are designed to be constructed on
   the 1.5 x 1.5-mm(2) stainless-steel chip, being micromachined to have
   capacitive cavities with 10-30 mu m depths. A Parylene-C membrane with a
   titanium electrode is formed to seal the cavity by depositing it
   directly on top of the ferrofluid filled in the cavity. The ferrofluid
   is magnetically extracted from the cavity after the formation of the
   membrane, suspending it to establish the sensing capacitor. A highly
   linear response of 12.4 fF/KPa is obtained with the fabricated device.
   The temperature dependence of the sensor capacitance is experimentally
   characterized and reported as well.}},

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{A combination of experiments and numerical analyses were used to examine
   the cooling conditions, solidification microstructure and interfacial
   heat transfer in A319 cast in a chilled wedge format. Both solid copper
   chills and water cooled chills, with and without a delay in water
   cooling, were examined in the study. Various chill preheats were also
   included. The goal of the investigation is to explore methods of
   limiting heat transfer during solidification directly beside the chill
   and increasing cooling rates during solidification away from the chill.
   Within the range of conditions examined in the study, chill preheat was
   found to have only a small effect on cooling rates between 5 and 50 mm
   from the chill/casting interface, pour superheat a moderate effect and
   water cooling a significant effect. In comparison to the results for the
   solid chill, the solidification time at 5 mm with water cooling applied
   at the beginning of mould filling is reduced from 56 to 15 s and at 50
   mm from 588 to 93.5 s.. Furthermore, the average cooling rate during
   solidification is increased from 1.9 to 7.06 degrees C s(-1) at 5 mm and
   from 0.18 to 1.13 degrees C s(-1) at 50 mm. At 50 mm, for example, the
   increased cooling rate achieved with water translates into a reduction
   in secondary dendrite arm spacing from 40 to 25 mu m or similar to 40\%.
   Delaying the water cooling by 10 s facilitated slow cooling rates at 5
   mm (similar to those achieved with a solid chill) and high cooling rates
   50 mm from the chill. A temperature based correlation was found to be
   suitable for characterising the behaviour of the interfacial heat
   transfer coefficient in the solid shill castings, whereas a time based
   correlation was needed for the water cooled castings.}},

Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{A database of 80 embankment dams has been compiled that includes 23 dams
   that are reported to have experienced some form of internal erosion. An
   assessment is made of the potential for seepage-induced internal
   instability of the filter zone in all dams, using five empirical
   criteria for shape analysis of the grain size distribution curve.
   Similarly, an assessment is made of the likelihood of core-filter
   incompatibility in all of the dams, using an empirical criterion for
   excessive erosion. These two attributes of a filter gradation, namely
   its potential for internal instability and its capacity for soil
   retention, are combined in a unified plot. Evaluation of the database
   reveals a correlation between the attributes of a filter gradation and
   deficiencies that are attributed to internal erosion. The finding
   implies the unified plot may serve as a preliminary screening tool in

Abstract = {{Base station (BS) sleeping has emerged as a viable solution to enhance
   the overall network energy efficiency by inactivating the underutilized
   BSs. However, it affects the performance of users in sleeping cells
   depending on their BS association criteria, their channel conditions
   toward the active BSs, and scheduling criteria and traffic loads at the
   active BSs. This paper characterizes the performance of cellular systems
   with BS sleeping by developing a systematic framework to derive the
   spectral efficiency and outage probability of downlink transmission to
   the sleeping cell users taking into account the aforementioned factors.
   In this context, a user association scheme is also developed in which
   sleeping cell users associate to a BS with maximum mean channel access
   probability (MMAP). The MMAP-based user association scheme adapts
   according to traffic load and scheduling criteria at the active BSs. We
   consider greedy and round-robin schemes at active BSs for scheduling
   users in a channel. We also derive the analytical results for the
   conventional maximum received signal power (MRSP)-based user association
   scheme. Finally, we derive the statistics of the received signal and
   interference power to evaluate the downlink spectral efficiency of a
   given sleeping cell user. Numerical results provide a comparison between
   two user association schemes as a function of system parameters and
   demonstrate the efficacy of the MMAP-based association scheme in
   non-uniform traffic load scenarios.}},

   derived to explicitly reveal its relation with system parameters when

Abstract = {{We consider the achievable average rates of a multiple-access system,

   information over a block fading multiple-access channel (MAC) and a base
   station (BS) that broadcasts radio frequency (RF) energy to the EHUs for
   wireless power transfer. The information (over the uplink) and power
   (over the downlink) can be transmitted either in time division duplex or
   frequency division duplex. For the case when the EHUs' battery
   capacities and the number of transmission slots are both infinite, we
   determine the optimal power allocation for the BS and the optimal rates
   and power allocations for the EHUs that maximize the achievable rate
   region of the MAC. The resulting online solution is asymptotically
   optimal and also applicable for a finite number of transmission slots
   and finite battery capacities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a high-efficiency 60-GHz on-off keying (OOK)
   transmitter (TX) designed for wireless network-on-chip applications.
   Aiming at an intra-chip communication distance of 20 mm, the TX consists
   of a drive amplifier (DA), a high-speed OOK modulator, and a
   transformer-coupled voltage-controlled oscillator. For high efficiency,
   a common-source topology with a drain-to-gate neutralization technique
   is chosen for the DA. A detailed mathematical design methodology is
   derived for the neutralization technique. The bulk-driven OOK modulator
   employs a novel dual feedthrough cancellation technique, resulting in a
   30-dB on-off ratio. Fabricated in a 65-nm bulk CMOS process, the TX
   consumes only 19 mW from a 1-V supply, and occupies an active area of
   0.077 mm(2). A maximum modulation data rate of 16 Gb/s with 0.75-dBm
   output power is demonstrated through measurements, which translates to a
   bit-energy efficiency of 1.2 pJ/bit.}},

Abstract = {{The Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence (D S theory) has been widely used
   in many information fusion systems. However, the determination of basic
   probability assignment (BPA) remains an open problem which can
   considerably influence final results. In this paper, a new method to
   determine BPA using core samples is proposed. Unlike most of existing
   methods that determining BPA in a heuristic way, the proposed method is
   data-driven. It uses training data to generate core samples for each
   attribute model. Then, helpful core samples in generating BPAs are
   selected. Calculation of the relevance ratio based on convex hulls is
   integrated into the core sample selection as a new feature of the
   proposed method. BPAs are assigned based on the distance between the
   test data and the selected core samples. Finally, BPAs are combined to
   get a final BPA using the Dempster's combination rule. In this paper,
   compound hypotheses are taken into consideration. BPA generated by the
   proposed method can be combined with some other sources of information
   to reduce the uncertainty. Empirical trials on benchmark database shows
   the efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings are often contaminated with
   muscular artifacts that strongly obscure the EEG signals and complicates
   their analysis. For the conventional case, where the EEG recordings are
   obtained simultaneously over many EEG channels, there exists a
   considerable range of methods for removing muscular artifacts. In recent
   years, there has been an increasing trend to use EEG information in
   ambulatory healthcare and related physiological signal monitoring
   systems. For practical reasons, a single EEG channel system must be used
   in these situations. Unfortunately, there exist few studies for muscular
   artifact cancellation in single-channel EEG recordings. To address this
   issue, in this preliminary study, we propose a simple, yet effective,
   method to achieve the muscular artifact cancellation for the
   single-channel EEG case. This method is a combination of the ensemble
   empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and the joint blind source
   separation (JBSS) techniques. We also conduct a study that compares and
   investigates all possible single-channel solutions and demonstrate the
   performance of these methods using numerical simulations and real-life
   applications. The proposed method is shown to significantly outperform
   all other methods. It can successfully remove muscular artifacts without
   altering the underlying EEG activity. It is thus a promising tool for
   use in ambulatory healthcare systems.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In open online communities such as e-commerce, participants need to rely
   on services provided by others in order to thrive. Accurately estimating
   the trustworthiness of a potential interaction partner is vital to a
   participant's well-being. It is generally recognized in the research
   community that third-party testimony sharing is an effective way for
   participants to gain knowledge about the trustworthiness of potential
   interaction partners without having to incur the risk of actually
   interacting with them. However, the presence of biased testimonies
   adversely affects a participant's long term well-being. Existing trust
   computational models often require complicated manual tuning of key
   parameters to combat biased testimonies. Such an approach heavily
   involves subjective judgments and adapts poorly to changes in an
   environment In this study, we propose the Actor Critic Trust (ACT)
   model, which is an adaptive trust evidence aggregation model based on
   the principles of reinforcement learning. The proposed method
   dynamically adjusts the selection of credible witnesses as well as the
   key parameters associated with the direct and indirect trust evidence
   sources based on the observed benefits received by the trusting entity.
   Extensive simulations have shown that the ACT approach significantly
   outperforms existing approaches in terms of mitigating the adverse
   effect of biased testimonies. Such a performance is due to the proposed
   accountability mechanism that enables ACT to attribute the outcome of an
   interaction to individual witnesses and sources of trust evidence, and
   adjust future evidence aggregation decisions without the need for human
   intervention. The advantage of the proposed model is particularly
   significant when service providers and witnesses strategically collude
   to improve their chances of being selected for interaction by service
   consumers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{672-684}},

Abstract = {{Dead-reckoning (DR) navigation is used when Global Positioning System
   (GPS) reception is not available or its accuracy is not sufficient. At
   sea, DR requires the use of inertial sensors, usually a gyrocompass and
   an accelerometer, to estimate the orientation and distance traveled by
   the tracked object with respect to a reference coordinate system. In
   this paper, we consider the problem of DR navigation for vessels located
   close to or on the sea surface, where motion is caused by ocean waves.
   In such cases, the vessel pitch angle is fast time varying and its
   estimation by direct measurements of orientation is prone to drifts and
   noises of the gyroscope. Regarding this problem, we propose a method to
   compensate for the vessel pitch angle using a single acceleration
   sensor. Using a constraint expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, our
   method classifies acceleration measurements into states of similar pitch
   angles. Subsequently, for each class, we project acceleration
   measurements into the reference coordinate system along the vessel
   heading direction, and obtain distance estimations by integrating the
   projected measurements. Results in both simulated and actual sea
   environments demonstrate that, by using only acceleration measurements,
   our method achieves accurate results.}},

Abstract = {{Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a ubiquitous wireless
   technology which allows objects to be identified automatically. An RFID
   tag is a small electronic device with an antenna and has a unique
   identification (ID) number. RFID tags can be categorized into passive
   and active tags. For passive tags, a standard communication protocol
   known as EPC-global Generation-2, or briefly EPC Gen-2, is currently in
   use. RFID systems are prone to transmission collisions due to the shared
   nature of the wireless channel used by tags. The EPC Gen-2 standard
   recommends using dynamic framed slotted ALOHA technique to solve the
   collision issue and to read the tag IDs successfully. Recently, some
   researchers have suggested to replace the dynamic framed slotted ALOHA
   technique used in the standard EPC Gen-2 protocol with the code division
   multiple access (CDMA) technique to reduce the number of collisions and
   to improve the tag identification procedure. In this paper, the standard
   EPC Gen-2 protocol and the CDMA-based tag identification schemes are
   modeled as absorbing Markov chain systems. Using the proposed Markov
   chain systems, the analytical formulae for the average number of queries
   and the total number of transmitted bits needed to identify all tags in
   an RFID system are derived for both the EPC Gen-2 protocol and the
   CDMA-based tag identification schemes. In the next step, the performance
   of the EPC Gen-2 protocol is compared with the CDMA-based tag
   identification schemes and it is shown that the standard EPC Gen-2
   protocol outperforms the CDMA-based tag identification schemes in terms
   of the number of transmitted bits and the average time required to
   identify all tags in the system.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of the present work is an experimental study of the behaviour
   of semi-dilute, opaque fibre suspensions during fully-developed
   pressure-driven flow in a cylindrical pipe. We measure the instantaneous
   velocity profiles across the radius R of the pipe, using ultrasound
   doppler velocimetry (UDV), as a function of the applied hydraulic
   pressure and concentration (0.75-1.75\% (wt/wt)). In total 374
   conditions were tested on three different flexible, non-Brownian fibre
   suspensions. The goal of the work was to gain insight into the role of
   the plug during transition to turbulence. From the UDV measurements, we
   estimated the radius of the plug r(p), the yield stress of the
   suspension tau(y), through knowledge of the pressure drop, as well as
   the Reynolds stress (rho u'(2)) over bar. We find that the yield stress
   varied non-monotonically with flow rate for each suspension tested. At
   slow flow, i.e. when r(p)/R -> 1, we observe that plug densification,
   i.e. a contraction of the plug created by the growth of a lubricating
   film at the wall, caused the initial increase in yield stress. Yield
   stress was found to continue to increase with flowrate and its maximum
   was reached at 0.4 < r(p)/R < 0.7. With plug sizes smaller than r(p)/R <
   0.4, the yield stress of the plug diminished with increasing flowrate
   through what we believe to be an erosion-type mechanism. We estimate the
   critical Reynolds number Re-c for the disappearance of the plug for all
   cases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Research on NOx treatment is extensive in recent years due to growing
   environmental awareness. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx, as
   a proven technology, offers higher NOx control efficiency than many
   other. NOx treatment methods. The present work reviews the recent
   development of SCR reactor technologies. Firstly, catalysts and
   mechanism of different SCRs were briefly summarized. Different SCR
   reactors, e.g. structured reactor, fluidized bed reactor and moving bed
   reactor, were then discussed. As a more advanced technology,
   multifunctional reactors were also developed for SCR process and could
   be divided into two categories: decoupled adsorption-reaction process
   and combined SCR system. The mechanism and properties of these processes
   were discussed in detail. Some recommendations were given for the future
   work in SCR reactor design. SCR reactor technology for emerging energy
   processes was also addressed, such as oxyfuel combustion and biofuel
   conversion processes, which put forward new requirements for SCR
   technologies and also open new opportunities for advanced design of SCR
   reactors. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese

Abstract = {{High-speed railway (HSR) brings convenience to peoples' lives and is
   generally considered as one of the most sustainable developments for
   ground transportation. One of the important parts of HSR construction is
   the signaling system, which is also called the ``operation control
   system,{''} where wireless communications play a key role in the
   transmission of train control data. We discuss in detail the main
   differences in scientific research for wireless communications between
   the HSR operation scenarios and the conventional public land mobile
   scenarios. The latest research progress in wireless channel modeling in
   viaducts, cuttings, and tunnels scenarios are discussed. The
   characteristics of nonstationary channel and the line-of-sight (LOS)
   sparse and LOS multiple-input-multiple-output channels, which are the
   typical channels in HSR scenarios, are analyzed. Some novel concepts
   such as composite transportation and key challenging techniques such as
   train-to-train communication, vacuum maglev train techniques, the
   security for HSR, and the fifth-generation wireless communications
   related techniques for future HSR development for safer, more

Abstract = {{This paper reports a highly simple and robust levitation method realized
   by ferrofluid for micromotor applications. A layer of ferrofluid is
   self-sustained on a permanent magnet to serve as liquid bearing that
   lifts the magnet up on the substrate, enabling low-friction movements of
   the magnet. A levitation height of similar to 500 mu m is observed with
   a 1.6-mm-sized NdFeB magnet. The load carrying capacity and friction
   force of the ferrofluid-levitated magnet are measured to be similar to
   2.9 g and 14 mu N, respectively. The levitated magnet is
   electromagnetically driven by microfabricated planar coils to
   demonstrate a linear micromotor. The dynamic responses of the magnet
   slider are characterized in detail and shown to match well with the
   results from electromagnetic simulations of the driving coil. The
   actuation force of 386 mu N or greater is obtained. Using the
   electromagnetic rail track that contains a micropatterned array of
   planar coils, continuous actuation of the slider along the array is
   achieved with the average velocity of 19 mm/s. The feasibility of
   stepping displacements between two adjacent coils is demonstrated by
   controlling power distribution to the two coils. {[}2013-0353]}},

Title = {{AAPM and GEC-ESTRO guidelines for image-guided robotic brachytherapy:
   Report of Task Group 192}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In the last decade, there have been significant developments into
   integration of robots and automation tools with brachytherapy delivery
   systems. These systems aim to improve the current paradigm by executing
   higher precision and accuracy in seed placement, improving calculation
   of optimal seed locations, minimizing surgical trauma, and reducing
   radiation exposure to medical staff. Most of the applications of this
   technology have been in the implantation of seeds in patients with
   early-stage prostate cancer. Nevertheless, the techniques apply to any
   clinical site where interstitial brachytherapy is appropriate. In
   consideration of the rapid developments in this area, the American
   Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) commissioned Task Group 192
   to review the state-of-the-art in the field of robotic interstitial
   brachytherapy. This is a joint Task Group with the Groupe Europeen de
   Curietherapie-European Society for Radiotherapy \& Oncology (GEC-ESTRO).
   All developed and reported robotic brachytherapy systems were reviewed.
   Commissioning and quality assurance procedures for the safe and
   consistent use of these systems are also provided. Manual seed placement
   techniques with a rigid template have an estimated in vivo accuracy of
   3-6 mm. In addition to the placement accuracy, factors such as tissue
   deformation, needle deviation, and edema may result in a delivered dose
   distribution that differs from the preimplant or intraoperative plan.
   However, real-time needle tracking and seed identification for dynamic
   updating of dosimetry may improve the quality of seed implantation. The
   AAPM and GEC-ESTRO recommend that robotic systems should demonstrate a
   spatial accuracy of seed placement <= 1.0 mm in a phantom. This
   recommendation is based on the current performance of existing robotic
   brachytherapy systems and propagation of uncertainties. During clinical
   commissioning, tests should be conducted to ensure that this level of
   accuracy is achieved. These tests should mimic the real operating
   procedure as closely as possible. Additional recommendations on robotic
   brachytherapy systems include display of the operational state;
   capability of manual override; documented policies for independent check
   and data verification; intuitive interface displaying the implantation
   plan and visualization of needle positions and seed locations relative
   to the target anatomy; needle insertion in a sequential order;
   robot-clinician and robot-patient interactions robustness, reliability,
   and safety while delivering the correct dose at the correct site for the
   correct patient; avoidance of excessive force on radioactive sources;
   delivery confirmation of the required number or position of seeds;
   incorporation of a collision avoidance system; system cleaning,
   decontamination, and sterilization procedures. These recommendations are
   applicable to end users and manufacturers of robotic brachytherapy
   systems. (C) 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{High-voltage direct-current (HVDC) systems play an important role in
   modern energy grids, whereas efficient and accurate models are often
   needed for system-level studies. Due to the inherent switching in HVDC
   converters, the detailed switch-level models are computationally
   expensive for the simulation of large-signal transients and hard to
   linearize for small-signal frequency-domain characterization. In this
   paper, a dynamic average-value model (AVM) of the first CIGRE HVDC
   benchmark system is developed in a state-variable-based simulator, such
   as Matlab/Simulink, and nodal-analysis-based electromagnetic transient
   program (EMTP), such as PSCAD/EMTDC. The 12-pulse converters in the HVDC
   system are modeled with a set of nonlinear algebraic functions that are
   extracted numerically. The results from the average-value models are
   compared with the results of the detailed simulation to verify the
   accuracy of the AVMs in predicting the large-signal time-domain
   transients. The developed dynamic average models are shown to have

Abstract = {{In dense femtocell networks (DFNs), one of the main issues is
   interference management since interference between femtocell access
   points (FAPs) reduces the system performance significantly. Further,
   FAPs serve different numbers of femtocell user equipments (FUEs), i.e..
   some FAPs have more than one FUE while others have one or no FUEs.
   Therefore, for DFNs, an intelligent channel assignment scheme is
   necessary considering both the number of FUEs connected to the same FAPs
   and interference mitigation to improve system performance. This paper
   proposes a two-stage dynamic channel assignment (TS-DCA) scheme for
   downlink DFNs based on orthogonal frequency division multiple
   access/frequency division duplex (OFDMA/FDD). In stage 1. using graph
   coloring algorithm, a femtocell gateway (FGW) first groups FUEs based on
   an interference graph that considers different numbers of FUEs per FAP.
   Then, in stage 2, the FGW dynamically assigns subchannels to FUE
   clusters according to the order of maximum capacity of FAP clusters. In
   addition, FAPs adaptively assign remaining subchannels in FUE clusters
   to their FUEs in other FUE clusters. Through simulations, we first find
   optimum parameters of the FUE clustering to maximize the system capacity
   and then evaluate system performance in terms of the mean FUE capacity,
   unsatisfied FUE probability, and mean FAP transmission energy
   consumption according to the different numbers of FUEs and FAPs with a
   given FUE traffic load.}},

Abstract = {{Anaerobic co-digestion of four organic waste streams; a thickened waste
   activated sludge (TWAS) and screen cake (SC) from a fruit-juice/winery
   wastewater treatment plant along with municipal sludge cake (MC) and
   landfill leachate (LL) was evaluated. A total of eight
   semi-continuously-fed single and co-digesters were operated side-by-side
   at sludge retention times (SRT) of 20 and 10 days. Co-digestion of
   industrial waste streams (TWAS and SC) with MC and LL resulted in
   increased operational stability compared to the single digestion of
   industrial TWAS at the higher organic loading (10 d SRT). Although
   digester operational temperature had no statistically significant effect
   on organics removal and biogas production, mesophilic digesters had
   consistently higher total coliform densities (8838-37,959 most probable
   number or MPN/g-dry weight) compared to the thermophilic digesters
   (41-6723 MPN/g-dry weight) at both SRTs. Coliform analysis results also
   proved that most of the thermophilic digestates could be classified as
   Class A biosolids according to regulations. Furthermore, addition of
   industrial TWAS to co-digesters enhanced the dewaterability of the
   digested streams. A cost-benefit analysis confirmed the benefits and
   indicated that a full-scale co-digester utilizing all four waste streams
   can decrease the total capital and operational cost by 22\% (\$10.52
   million). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rat models are commonly used to investigate the pathophysiological
   pathways and treatment outcomes after spinal cord injury (SCI). The high
   incidence of fall-induced SCI in older adults has created a need for
   aging models of SCI in rats to investigate potential age-related
   differences in SCI severity and outcomes. The aims of this study were to
   determine the influences of age and vertebral level on the geometries of
   the cervical spinal cord and spinal column in a rat model. Three young
   (3 months) and three aged (12 months) Fischer 344 rats were imaged in a
   high field (7 T) small-animal magnetic resonance imaging system. All
   spinal cord geometry variables (including depth, width, and axial
   cross-sectional area) and one spinal canal variable (depth) were
   significantly larger in the aged specimens by an average of 8.1\%. There
   were main effects of vertebral level on all spinal cord variables and
   four spinal canal variables with values generally larger at C4 as
   compared to C6 (average increases ranged from 5.7\% to 12.9\% in spinal
   cord measures and 5.4\% to 6.8\% in spinal canal measures). High
   inter-rater reliability between two measurers was observed with a mean
   intraclass correlation of 0.921 and percent difference of 0.9\% across
   all variables measured. This study clearly demonstrates that cervical
   spinal cord geometry changes between the ages of 3 and 12 months in
   Fischer 344 rats. This information can aid in the planning and
   interpretation of studies that use a rat model to investigate the
   influence of age on cervical SCI. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-criteria decision making process is a widely concerned issue. In
   traditional studies, it is assumed that a decision maker's behaviors are
   not affected by others. However, competitive environment is more general
   in real world where everybody maximizes his benefits and each people is
   inevitably influenced by others' behaviors. In this paper, an evidential
   game theory framework is proposed in order to address the multi-criteria
   decision making process in the competitive environment. The proposed
   framework includes five stages, namely game analysis, decision-making
   analysis, strategies evaluations, fusion of evaluations, decision based
   on equilibrium, respectively. Within the proposed framework, a
   representation form of uncertain information called belief structure
   derived from Dempster-Shafer theory is employed to model the uncertainty
   involving experts' subjective evaluations. The game theory is used to
   find the optimal combination of strategies in the interactive decision
   situations. The application of the proposed evidential game theory
   framework is given by an illustrative example. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{A tabulated, pseudo-turbulent Probability Density Function (PDF) model
   for premixed combustion is proposed. The Linear-Eddy Model (LEM) is used
   to construct the PDFs for a temperature-based progress variable in a
   premixed, turbulent methane/air V-flame produced by the Cambridge slot
   burner. As a second case study, the LEM PDFs are similarly compared to
   PDFs extracted from Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of a turbulent
   premixed flame. LEM demonstrates the ability to reproduce the salient
   features from experimental and DNS PDFs; moreover, it is able to better
   capture turbulent effects than previously suggested laminar flamelet PDF
   models. The Scalar Dissipation Rate (SDR) for premixed combustion is
   likewise investigated. The stochastic nature of LEM enables it to mimic
   the overall behaviors of turbulent reactions inexpensively and
   qualitatively. Crucially, LEM appears to be well suited for the
   preprocessing tabulation of PDF and SDR models for a number of premixed
   combustion simulation strategies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an efficient fractal method for detection and
   diagnosis of mass lesion in mammogram which is one of the abnormalities
   in mammographic images. We used 110 images that were carefully selected
   by a radiologist, and their abnormalities were also confirmed by biopsy.
   These images included circumscribed benign, ill-defined, and spiculated
   malignant masses. Firstly, we discriminated lesions automatically using
   new fractal dimensions. The results which were examined by different
   types of breast density showed that the proposed method was able to
   yield quite satisfactory detection results. Secondly, noting that
   contours of masses playing the most important role in diagnosis of
   different mass types, we defined new fractal features based on
   information extraction from the contours. This information is able to
   identify the roughness in mass contours and determines the extent of
   spiculation or smoothness of the masses. In this manner, in
   classification of the spiculated malignant masses from the circumscribed
   benign tumors, we achieved highly satisfactory results, i.e., 0.98
   measured in terms of area under ROC curve (AUC). In this paper, it is
   also shown that the roughness in contours is a suitable characteristic
   feature for diagnosis of ill-defined malignant tumors with AUC equal to
   0.94 in their classification. The extracted information was also found
   to be useful in the classification of early malignancies whereas in the
   classification of spiculated and ill-defined malignant masses in their
   early stage from those of benign tumors, we achieved high accuracy of
   0.99 and 0.90 for AUC, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The gas diffusion layer (GDL) plays an important role in the removal of
   product water from the catalyst layer to the flow plate in a fuel cell.
   Numerous studies have reported water management, especially in the GDL,
   as the limiting factor hindering convective and diffusive transport of
   reactants which results in lowering power density. In this paper, an
   experimental technique is presented to study the GDL water transport
   properties associated with the breakthrough conditions which are
   critical to overall water management. Fluorescence microscopy technique
   is used to measure the pressure and time required for water to penetrate
   and break through the surface of the GDL. The results obtained for GDLs
   produced by different manufacturers confirm that the breakthrough time
   and pressure are larger for PTFE treated hydrophobic GDLs. The results
   are analyzed in terms of the contact angle, thickness, and SEM images to
   see the effects of different structural properties. The changes in
   morphology due to compression are also presented. In addition, the
   changes in breakthrough conditions when samples are reused are
   presented. The results provide basic insights into the water transport
   properties of the GDL, leading to the design of new materials with
   enhanced water management.}},

   material transport between the cavities by introducing a passive scalar
   to represent the motion of tracer particles. A large number of unsteady
   simulations were conducted over the range of velocities and gap sizes.
   Over the range of parameters studied, we identify two characteristic

Abstract = {{The existing chatter stability prediction algorithms fail in low-speed
   machining of difficult to cut alloys, unless process damping contributed
   by the tool flank face-finish surface contact is considered. This paper
   presents a new method in predicting the material dependent process
   damping coefficient from chatter free orthogonal cutting tests. An
   equivalent process damping coefficient of the dynamic system is
   estimated from the frequency domain decomposition (FDD) of the vibration
   signals measured during stable cutting tests. Subsequently, the specific
   indentation force of the workpiece material is identified from the
   process damping coefficients obtained over a range of cutting speeds.
   The specific indentation force coefficient is used in an explicit
   formula of process damping which considers the radius and clearance
   angle of the cutting edge. It is experimentally shown that when the
   proposed process damping model is included, the accuracy of chatter
   stability predictions in turning and milling improves significantly at
   low cutting speeds.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper describes compressive creep behavior of cubic 8 mol\%
   Yttria-stabilized Zirconia, fabricated by spark plasma sintering, in the
   temperature range of 1300-1330 A degrees C at a stress level of 78-193
   MPa in vacuum. The pre- and post-creep microstructures, along with the
   values of the stress exponent (n = 1.7-2.7) and the activation energy (Q
   = 711-757 kJ/mol) suggest that a mixed mode of plastic deformation,
   dominated by grain boundary sliding, occurred in this material. The
   relatively high activation energy observed was related to the pinning of
   the grain boundaries by voids during creep, leading to microcrack
   formation, shear strain-induced grain exfoliation, and finally creation
   of new voids at grain boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a sensor-integrated telemetric stent targeted at
   wireless detection and monitoring of restenosis, a common vascular
   complication induced by stent implantation. The developed ``smart{''}
   stent incorporates the design and fabrication approaches that raise the
   practicality of the device, being tested in an in vivo study that
   validates its operating principle. The stent is produced to have a
   gold-coated helical-like structure that serves as a high-performance
   inductor/antenna and integrated with a novel capacitive pressure sensor
   chip, all based on medical-grade stainless steel. The stent device forms
   an inductor-capacitor resonant tank that enables radio-frequency (RF)
   wireless pressure sensing in an operating frequency range of 30-80 MHz.
   With an overall length of 20 mm, the device is designed to be compatible
   with standard balloon catheters and necessary crimping process. The
   balloon-expanded devices are characterized in saline and blood to
   determine selective coating of passivation layer, Parylene C, with
   tailored thicknesses in order to maximize both RF and sensing abilities.
   In vitro testing of the devices reveals a frequency sensitivity up to
   146 ppm/mmHg over a pressure range of 250 mmHg. Tests in pig models show
   wireless detection of device's resonance and frequency response to
   variations in local blood pressure, the targeted function of the device.}},

   electrical power while part of it is converted into methanol. The
   methanol is finally used to transform the vegetable oil into biodiesel.
   Through a coupled use of ASPEN PLUS (TM) and MATLAB (TM) codes, a
   rapeseed, soy and sunflower rotation, with a duration of three year, was
   simulated considering 15 ha of soil. This surface resulted sufficient to
   feed a 7 kW(el) power plant. Simulation outputs proven the system to be

Abstract = {{A transform that estimates the first and higher-order derivatives of
   images at multiple scales is proposed. The proposed transform, called
   Multi-Scale Derivative Transform (MSDT), is specially designed for image
   watermarking applications. To calculate the first and higher-order image
   derivatives, MSDT uses the detail wavelet coefficients of the image.
   Unlike traditional wavelet-based image derivative estimators that use
   only the horizontal and vertical wavelet coefficients, the proposed
   transform maps the diagonal as well as the horizontal and vertical
   wavelet coefficients to the horizontal and vertical derivatives of the
   image. The inverse transform is designed such that any change in the
   image derivative domain results in the minimum possible change in the
   wavelet coefficients. This renders a watermark, that is embedded in the
   derivative domain, less visible in the image domain. The application of
   this transform to image watermarking is discussed, and the results are
   compared with those obtained using traditional wavelet-based image
   derivative estimators. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A novel magnetic actuator design for active damping of machining tools}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS \& MANUFACTURE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{58-69}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Parts and cutting tools with large structural flexibility experience
   both forced and chatter vibrations during machining, resulting in poor
   surface finish or damage to the machine. This paper presents the design
   principles of a novel 3 degrees of freedom linear magnetic actuator
   which increases the damping and static stiffness of flexible structures
   during machining. The proposed actuator can deliver 248 N force in two
   radial (x, y) directions and 34 N x m (torque) in torsional (theta)
   direction up to 850 Hz. The force and torque reduces to 107 N and 14.5 N
   x m at 2000 Hz, hence it can actively damp a wide range of structural
   modes. The magnetic force is linearized with respect to the input
   current using magnetic configuration design strategy. Loop shaping
   controllers are designed for active damping of boring bar vibrations.
   The static and dynamic stiffnesses of the boring bar were considerably
   increased with the designed actuator, leading to a significant increase
   in chatter-free material removal rates during cutting tests. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The quiescent crystallization of several polypropylenes (PPs) was
   examined using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Polarized
   Optical Microscopy (POM). The half-times of crystallization were
   obtained from the DSC thermographs employing the Avrami/Nakamura
   equation to fit and predict crystallization kinetics under isothermal
   and nonisothermal conditions. The induction times under nonisothermal
   conditions were estimated from isothermal crystallization data and used
   in conjunction with the Nakamura model in order to capture the
   crystallization behavior of the studied PPs. The Avrami/Nakamura model
   is found to fit and predict the nonisothermal crystallization data of
   the various PPs well over a range of cooling rates supporting its use in
   the simulation of polymer processes of industrial relevance. POM was
   used in line with parallel plate rheometry (Anton Paar, MCR 502) under
   no flow conditions to study the shape and growth rate of crystals of
   various PP resins at different temperatures or cooling rates. The growth
   rate of crystals is impeded exponentially with increase of temperature.
   The various PP resins of different molecular architecture have shown
   different nucleation and growth rate characteristics behavior under
   similar processing conditions. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},
