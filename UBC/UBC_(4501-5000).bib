Abstract = {{The constitutive behavior of aluminum alloy A356 in the as-cast
   condition has been characterized using compression tests performed over
   a wide range of deformation temperatures (30-500 degrees C) and strain
   rates (similar to 0.1-10 s(-1)). This work is intended to support the
   development of process models for a wide range of conditions including
   those relevant to casting, forging and machining. The flow stress
   behavior as a function of temperature and strain rate has been fit to a
   modified Johnson-Cook and extended Ludwik-Hollomon expression. The data
   has also been assessed with both the strain-independent Kocks-Mecking
   and Zener-Hollomon frameworks. The predicted plastic flow stress for
   each expression are compared. The results indicate that the extended
   Ludwik-Hollomon is best suited to describe small strain conditions
   (stage III hardening), while the Kocks-Mecking is best employed for
   large strain (stage IV). At elevated temperatures, it was found that the
   Zener-Hollomon model provides the best prediction of flow stress. (C)

Abstract = {{A new method to model the stress-strain relationship in two dimensions
   is proposed, which is particularly suited for analyzing nearly
   incompressible materials, such as soft tissue. In most cases of soft
   tissue modeling, plane strain is reported to approximate the deformation
   when an external compression is applied. However, it is subject to
   limitations when dealing with incompressible materials, e.g., when
   solving the inverse problem of elasticity. We propose a novel 2D model
   for the linear stress-strain relationship by describing the out-of-plane
   strain as a linear combination of the two in-plane strains. As such, the
   model can be represented in 2D while being able to explain the
   three-dimensional deformation. We show that in simple cases where the
   applied force is dominantly in one direction, one can approximate the
   sum of the three principal strain components in a plane by a scalar
   multiplied by the out-of-plane strain. 3D finite-element simulations
   have been performed. The proposed model has been tested under different
   boundary conditions and material properties. The results show that the
   model parametrization is affected mostly by the boundary conditions,
   while being relatively independent of the underlying distribution of
   Young's modulus. An application to the inverse problem of elasticity is
   presented where a more accurate estimate is obtained using the proposed
   dilatation model compared to the plane-stress and plane-strain models.}},

Abstract = {{Mixing quality of liquid injection into the main stream was evaluated
   after 90 degrees-tee mixers for both water and softwood kraft pulp
   suspensions over a range of mass concentrations (0-3.0\%), mainstream
   pipe velocities (0.5-5.0 m/s), side-stream jet velocities (1.0-12.7 m/s)
   and jet-to-pipe diameter ratios (0.05-0.208) using electrical resistance
   tomography (ERT). The degree of mixing was determined from measurements
   in cross-sectional planes along the pipeline based on a modified mixing
   index derived from the coefficient of variation (CoV) of individual
   conductivity values in each image pixel. The results show significant
   differences in jet mixing of a Newtonian fluid (water) in the turbulent
   flow regime and non-Newtonian pulp suspensions due to the complex
   rheology of the pulp suspensions and different flow regimes, which play
   important roles in determining the degree of mixing in pulp suspensions.

Month = {{JUN 18}},
Abstract = {{Electrostatics in fluidized beds of glass beads and polyethylene resins
   of different physical and chemical properties were investigated in a
   fluidization column of 150 mm inner diameter and 2.0 m height. Eight
   collision ball probes at different levels and radial positions measured
   the degree of electrification. For Geldart group B particles, the degree
   of electrification increased slightly with decreasing particle size.
   Charging for group A particles was significantly greater than for group
   B particles. For binary mixtures, the degree of electrification
   increased as the proportion of small (65 mu m) particles increased.
   Bipolar charging was observed in all experiments where polyethylene
   resin particles constituted the bed materials, with large particles
   charging negatively, and fine particles positively. The effect of adding
   fine (<30 mu m) glass beads on electrostatics in a fluidized bed of
   relatively large (574 mu m) glass beads was also studied. As the
   proportion of fines increased from 0.0 to 2.0 wt\%, the degree of
   electrification decreased, charge fluctuations decreased and the bed
   exhibited smoother fluidization. Particles entrained in the freeboard
   were charged oppositely to those in the bed. The degree of
   electrification decreased as the proportion of Larostat 519 increased
   from 0.0 to 0.5 wt\%, but increased when the wt\% of Larostat reached
   1.5\%, probably due to the tendency of Larostat particles to adsorb
   water and agglomerate. Entrained Larostat particles carried the same
   charge polarity as the large particles in the bed. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Activated carbon supported iron catalysts derived from pine bark were
   prepared by different methods using a microwave reactor. The catalyst
   samples were characterized by physical adsorption of N-2, Fourier
   Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and Transmission Electron
   Microscopy (TEM). The catalyst activity was evaluated for catalytic wet
   peroxide oxidation of phenol at 50 degrees C. The results showed that
   the catalyst prepared by preloading the metal precursor to deashed
   biomass before carbonization and activation in a microwave reactor
   possessed much higher reactivity than catalyst prepared from other
   methods. The acid washing to remove ash from biomass eliminated the
   adverse effect of metals contained in the ash on catalyst, modified the
   biomass tissue which favored the catalyst dispersion on the biomass. The
   metal pre-loading to biomass led to a more uniform dispersion of
   catalyst on activated carbon. The microwave treatment saved energy,
   shortened preparation time. High catalytic activity for the catalytic
   wet peroxide oxidation of phenol was observed for catalyst samples
   prepared from pre-loading the active metal to pre-deashed bark samples.

   significantly affected by temperature, the high hardening rate at 77K
   being interpreted as resulting from a combination of texture hardening
   and reduced dynamic recovery. For conditions where slip is expected to
   be the dominant deformation mechanism, simulations and experiments are
   in excellent agreement, while agreement with twinning dominated test
   conditions are hindered by the ability to predict accurately the

Abstract = {{An indoor optical positioning technique using a differential photosensor
   device is presented. The method is based on angle of arrival information
   estimated by the differential photosensor in an indoor environment with
   fixed optical beacons. A photocurrent is generated by each of the three
   photodiodes in the photosensor by incident light from the optical
   beacons. The amplitudes of these photocurrents are a function of the
   incident angle of the light. Previously derived equations that express
   photocurrent amplitudes as a function of the azimuthal arrival angle,
   phi, and the polar arrival angle, theta , are modeled with second- and
   third-order polynomials, respectively, to determine the phi and theta
   angles from measured photocurrents. Testing with optical beacons in
   various positions with respect to a fixed photosensor resulted in a root
   mean squared error for all estimated angles phi and theta of 2.8
   degrees. A positioning accuracy of better than 4 cm is achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Semiconductor ring resonators as the core components of instruments and
   devices have found applications in the areas of telecommunications and
   sensors. In this study, the feasibility of using ring resonators as
   solid-state angular rate sensors (gyroscopes) based on the Sagnac effect
   is assessed, and an extensive analysis of the optimal values of
   resonator length, coupling, and detuning is carried out, for the drop
   port of a double-bus ring, and for an all-pass, single-bus ring, for
   different values of propagation losses, consistent with different
   available technologies. We show that for both the all-pass and the
   drop-port configurations, optimally undercoupled rings show larger
   extinction ratios and, thus, better resolutions than critically coupled
   rings of the same length, contrary to our initial intuitive assumption
   that critically coupled rings should offer the best resolutions. Our
   analysis also shows that the ring resonator gyroscopes require a
   technology-constrained optimization, with the propagation loss as the
   main factor that hinders the resolution, and that determines the optimum
   values of all other parameters, namely length, coupling, and resonance
   detuning. According to our model, standard-chip-sized racetrack
   gyroscopes are suitable for rate-and tactical-grade applications for
   selected, currently feasible low propagation loss waveguides.}},

Abstract = {{An inkjet printing procedure for depositing films of carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs) that exhibit a very high degree of long-range mutual alignment as
   well as a controlled orientation with respect to the printed geometry is
   presented. CNT self-assembly was induced by the intrinsic lyotropic
   liquid crystallinity of CNT suspensions. Sufficient concentrations are
   reached by matching the inkjet deposition rate to the numerically
   modeled local evaporation rate of the printed feature and enable the CNT
   suspension to be printed using standard inkjet printing. Surface
   alignment was verified using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   polarized light microscopy. In addition, the bulk morphology was
   investigated and found to be composed of stacked planar layers that did
   not necessarily have the same long-range orientation found on the
   surface. The bulk morphology was characterized by removing layers
   through an elastomeric peeling process and by observing cross sections
   of the films using SEM. CNT concentration and length were spanned
   experimentally, and it was found that very short and very long CNTs as
   well as low concentration suspensions did not yield long-range
   alignment.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed observations are reported for eight shear wall buildings from
   the Concepcion region that experienced severe damage during the 27
   February 2010 Chile earthquake. The repetitive nature of some of the
   damage suggests that these field observations may be applicable to
   similar buildings elsewhere, whereas other damage may be unique. Several
   shear walls experienced failures that apparently started at the
   boundaries due to the high compression in these unconfined edges, and
   propagated into the wall web. Other walls, including horizontal and
   vertical wall segments in perforated walls, experienced shear failure.
   Damage also was observed in columns, beams, and coupling slabs. In most
   cases, the percentage of damaged elements was less than 10\% of the
   lateral force-resisting elements of the building, suggesting that these
   structures were not capable of distributing damage. Several building
   indices are calculated, including vibration periods and regularity
   indices, for comparison with observed behavior. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{This paper describes modifications made to the pH-stat procedure to
   allow for maintaining constant nickel concentrations as well as constant
   pH over the course of a batch ion exchange loading test. This method
   allows for a near continuous monitoring of loading rate and produces
   data that can be analyzed assuming infinite solution volume conditions.
   It has been shown to have good repeatability and negligible interference
   from the sodium introduced as sodium hydroxide for the case of nickel
   loading onto an iminodiacetic acid resin at pH 4. Data from a series of
   experiments for the loading of nickel, cobalt, and copper onto an
   iminodiacetic chelating resin in the hydrogen form are presented. From
   this work it can be seen that film diffusion only contributes at the
   very beginning of the tests. For the majority of the data both
   intraparticle diffusion and the ion exchange reaction are contributing
   to the overall rate of loading. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   degrees C}},

Abstract = {{Copper sulfate (66-323 g/kg H2O; similar to 25-110 g/L Cu+2) and
   sulfuric acid (10-233 g/kg H2O, similar to 10-200 g/L) solutions were
   reacted with copper metal at temperatures between 50 and 95 degrees C to
   form Cu+ until equilibrium was attained. Samples were collected into an
   NH4Fe(SO4)(2)center dot 12H(2)O solution to convert cuprous to ferrous,
   which were then titrated with standard Ce(IV) using very dilute ferroin
   as the indicator. In order to estimate solution compositions in
   volumetric units (e.g. g/L) the densities of the parent CuSO4-H2SO4
   solutions at the reaction temperatures were used. Some additional
   density data, beyond that available in the literature was needed.
   Density as a function of temperature and masses of CuSO4 and H2SO4 per
   kg of water was fitted to an empirical equation. Density was also
   estimated based on known concentrations of Cu+2 and H2SO4 in g/L and
   temperature using an alternative correlation. Cuprous concentrations
   were determined as mol/kg of sample. Cuprous concentrations in g/L were
   fitted to an expression of the form:
   {[}Cu+] = Ve(-W/T) {[}Cu+2](X) (Y{[}H2SO4](2) + Z{[}H2SO4]+ 1)
   where {[}Cu+], {[}Cu+2] and {[}H2SO4] are in g/L at specified
   temperature T (K) and V-Z are empirical constants. The empirical
   expression simulated the measured {[}Cu+] to within +/- 3.6\%. The
   cuprous concentrations were also fitted to the same type of equation
   using concentrations on the molal scale. These matched the experimental
   values to within +/- 3.5\%. Varying sulfuric acid concentrations were
   found to have only a modest influence on the equilibrium cuprous
   concentrations. With 10-200 g/L H2SO4 and a given {[}Cu+2] the
   difference between the highest and lowest {[}Cu+] was 7\% at most. At 95
   degrees C with a solution containing 107-109 g/L Cu+2 and 10-200 g/L
   H2SO4, the {[}Cu+] was 1.70-1.75 g/L. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   multiple multi-antenna relays. Adopting the minimum mean squared error
   as optimality criterion, the optimal frequency-domain linear
   equalization (LE) and decision-feedback equalization (DFE) receivers are
   derived and corresponding objective functions for relay BF matrix
   optimization are specified. For a sum relay power constraint, we obtain
   the structure of the optimal relay BF matrices in closed form. While the
   structure of the optimal relay BF matrices is identical for LE and DFE
   as well as for an idealized matched filter receiver, the solution of the
   remaining power allocation problem depends on the adopted receiver. The
   power allocation problem is shown to be convex for all considered
   receivers and an efficient numerical algorithm for finding the optimal
   power allocation is provided. Furthermore, to reduce complexity, two
   suboptimal power allocation schemes assigning identical powers to all
   relays and/or frequencies are proposed and shown to lead to only a small

Abstract = {{This paper estimates the availability of agricultural crop residue
   feedstocks in Canada for cellulosic ethanol production. Canada's major
   field crops generate 100.6 million dry mega grams (Mg) of crops per year
   while non-forage crops produce 67 million dry Mg, leaving abundant
   agricultural residues for use as second generation feedstock for
   cellulosic ethanol production. This study used crop production and
   livestock data from Statistics Canada for a 10-year period (2001-2010),
   as well as tillage data from Statistics Canada census years 2001 and
   2006, to estimate crop residue availability by province and soil zone.
   Total residue yield from crops is calculated by incorporating straw to
   grain ratios. Total agricultural residues available for ethanol
   production are computed by deducting soil conservation and livestock
   uses. An average of 48 million dry Mg of agricultural residues is
   available per year, with a minimum of 24.5 million dry Mg in drought
   year 2002. This implies an average yearly potential ethanol production
   of 13 billion litres from crop residues over the 2001-2010 period, with
   a minimum of 6.6 billion litres in 2002. Ontario, Manitoba,
   Saskatchewan, and Quebec have enough agricultural residue supply to set
   up ethanol plants using agricultural crop residues as primary
   lignocellulosic feedstocks. There is great variability in agricultural
   residue production between the provinces and by soil zone. Understanding
   variability in feedstock supply is important for the economics and
   operational planning of a cellulosic ethanol biorefinery. Factors such
   as residue yield per hectare and soil zone will influence cellulosic
   ethanol plant establishment in order to exploit the abundance of
   lignocellulosic biomass for an ethanol plant. Crown Copyright (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The particle size effect on torrefaction of pine particles and formation
   of torrefied pellets has been studied in a thermogravimetric analyzer
   (TGA) and a tubular fixed bed reactor. The fixed bed reactor was also
   used to produce torrefied samples for a single-die press unit for the
   densification test. Both the TGA and fixed bed reactor torrefaction test
   results showed that the torrefaction rate was affected by the particle
   size, especially at high temperatures. Although the temperature gradient
   inside particles smaller than I mm is very small during torrefaction,
   the internal diffusion of generated vapors inside particles imposes an
   impact on the global torrefaction reaction rate. The hard core or
   nonshrinkage particle model with a first order torrefaction reaction can
   predict the reaction data reasonably well, with the data-fitted
   effective vapor diffusivity coefficient. The densification tests showed
   that more energy was required to make pellets from larger torrefied
   particles, while the water uptake and Meyer hardness tests of pellets
   revealed that good quality torrefied pellets could be obtained from fine
   torrefied sawdust particles.}},

Abstract = {{Spectral efficiency has improved significantly with the deployment of
   beyond third generation (3G) cellular air interfaces. However, the
   scarcity of unallocated radio spectrum bands, coupled with the need to
   provide ubiquitous wireless data services with different Quality of
   Service (QoS) requirements to a large number of users, has continued to
   drive extensive research efforts in radio resource management (RRM). In
   order to adapt to the changing wireless channel conditions and meet the
   varying and diverse QoS requirements, much of the published work in RRM
   has focused on exploiting multi-user and multi-channel diversities and
   more recently on exploiting multi-application diversity to take
   advantage of the mechanisms and optimization features introduced in the
   air interfaces. In this paper, we propose a bitQoS-aware resource
   allocation framework to increase the flexibility and granularity of the
   resource allocation algorithms by adaptively matching the QoS
   requirements of the user application bits to the characteristics of the
   Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers in a
   mixed-traffic environment. We show through an adaptive joint subcarrier,
   power and bit allocation algorithm, that with the finesse control of
   bitQoS-aware scheduling, it is possible to simultaneously achieve both
   an increase in user throughput and a reduction in user packet drop
   probability by accepting a within scheduling delay threshold increase in
   user latency. The performance gains obtainable are quantified in terms
   of system throughput, user throughput, user latency, user jitter and
   user packet drop probability for systems under different traffic loads.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic emission (AE) sensors are a reliable tool in detecting
   fracture; however they have not been used to differentiate between
   compressive osseous and tensile ligamentous failures in the spine. This
   study evaluated the effectiveness of AE data in detecting the time of
   injury of ligamentum flavum (LF) and vertebral body (VB) specimens
   tested in tension and compression, respectively, and in differentiating
   between these failures. AE signals were collected while LF (n = 7) and
   VB (n = 7) specimens from human cadavers were tested in tension and
   compression (0.4 m/s), respectively. Times of injury (time of peak AE
   amplitude) were compared to those using traditional methods (VB: time of
   peak force, LF: visual evidence in high speed video). Peak AE signal
   amplitudes and frequencies (using Fourier and wavelet transformations)
   for the LF and VB specimens were compared. In each group, six specimens
   failed (VB, fracture; LF, periosteal stripping or attenuation) and one
   did not. Time of injury using AE signals for VB and LF specimens
   produced average absolute differences to traditional methods of 0.7 (SD
   = 0.2) ms and 2.4 (SD = 1.5) ms (representing 14\% and 20\% of the
   average loading time), respectively. AE signals from VB fractures had
   higher amplitudes and frequencies than those from LF failures (average
   peak amplitude 87.7 (SD = 6.9) dB vs. 71.8 (SD = 9.8) dB for the
   inferior sensor, p < 0.05; median characteristic frequency from the
   inferior sensor 97 (interquartile range, IQR, 41) kHz vs. 31 (IQR 2)
   kHz, p < 0.05). These findings demonstrate that AE signals could be used
   to delineate complex failures of the spine. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Various anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), based on 10 mol\%
   Dy-doped La2Mo2O9 (LDM) electrolyte, are prepared analytically and
   operated under single chamber conditions to explore the connections
   between electrode and power performance. The cathode of tested SOFCs is
   compositionally graded with three composites of samarium strontium
   cobaltite and Gd-doped ceria (GDC) to relax the thermal stress, because
   of sizable thermal expansion differences above 400 C. We focus the
   research attention on varying the anode pore structure and composition
   to promote the power performance in methane/air mixture at 700 C. For
   the one-layer support of GDC+NiO+LDM anode, addition of 10 wt\% graphite
   minimizes its mass transport resistance through creating 8-5 mu m long
   and similar to 1 gm wide slit-shaped pores. The graphite pore former
   raises the peak power value by 80 mW cm(-2). Adopting a more porous and
   active outer layer, the double-layer support further enhances the cell
   power. The peak power was first raised by 48 mW cm(-2), using an outer
   layer that was prepared with 63 wt\% NiO. Dosing 3\% Pd on this outer
   layer uplifts another 59 mW cm(-2). In this study, with an improved
   anode, the peak power value reaches 437 mW cm(-2). Copyright (C) 2012,

Abstract = {{We report an experimental study on shearing a monolayer of monodisperse
   bubbles floating on liquid in a narrow-gap Couette device. The bubbles
   in such a ``bubble raft{''} coalesce only if the shear rate exceeds a
   threshold value. This is in contrast to the conventional wisdom that
   bubbles and drops coalesce for gentler collisions, at shear rates below
   a critical value. Furthermore, the threshold shear rate increases with
   the bubble size and the viscosity of the suspending liquid, contravening
   reasoning based on capillary number. Through visualization and scaling
   arguments, we investigate several plausible mechanisms for the anomalous
   coalescence. None explains all aspects of the observations. The most
   promising model is one based on inertial forces that compress the
   bubbles radially inward and accelerate film drainage.}},

Abstract = {{Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been found at high levels,
   up to 7.6 x 10(6) pg/g, in biosolids commonly applied to agricultural
   soils. A field investigation was carried out in this study to measure
   concentrations of PBDEs in biosolid-amended agricultural soils in which
   various amounts of biosolids (20 and 80 t/ha) had been applied.
   Concentrations of PBDEs in surface soils that had received a single
   application of 80 t/ha biosolids were one to two orders of magnitude
   greater than that in soil, which had received a single application of 20
   t/ha of biosolids. Assessment of PBDEs levels at different depths,
   between 0.05 and 1.05 m, in soils that received 80 t/ha biosolids,
   showed that PBDEs were mobilized from the surface soil to lower depths.
   Total PBDEs concentrations decreased from 10,250 pg/g dry weight basis
   (dw) in the 0.05 m soil layer to 220 pg/g dw at a depth of 1 m. The
   distribution of PBDEs with depth and cation exchange capacity of the
   soil could be described as exponential functions. The coefficients of
   correlation ranged from 0.47 to 0.57 and 0.47 to 0.67, respectively.
   Despite the deviation in the experimental measurements induced by
   variables, such as non-uniform biosolid application, heterogeneity of
   the soil, and the uneven surface of the field, variations of PBDEs along
   the soil profile in the biosolid-amended soil were clearly demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Ideomotor actions are behaviours that are unconsciously initiated and
   express a thought rather than a response to a sensory stimulus. The
   question examined here is whether ideomotor actions can also express
   nonconscious knowledge. We investigated this via the use of implicit
   long-term semantic memory, which is not available to conscious recall.
   We compared accuracy of answers to yes/no questions using both
   volitional report and ideomotor response (Ouija board response). Results
   show that when participants believed they knew the answer, responses in
   the two modalities were similar. But when they believed they were
   guessing, accuracy was at chance for volitional report (50\%), but
   significantly higher for Ouija response (65\%). These results indicate
   that implicit semantic memory can be expressed through ideomotor
   actions. They also suggest that this approach can provide an interesting
   new methodology for studying implicit processes in cognition. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Estimation of the covariance matrix and its inverse, the precision
   matrix, in high-dimensional situations is of great interest in many
   applications. In this paper, we focus on the estimation of a class of
   sparse precision matrices which are assumed to be approximately
   inversely closed for the case that the dimensionality can be much larger
   than the sample size n, which is fundamentally different from the
   classical case that p < n. Different in nature from state-of-the-art
   methods that are based on penalized likelihood maximization or
   constrained error minimization, based on the truncated Neumann series
   representation, we propose a computationally efficient precision matrix
   estimator that has a computational complexity of O(p(3)). We prove that
   the proposed estimator is consistent in probability and in L-2 under the
   spectral norm. Moreover, its convergence is shown to be rate-optimal in
   the sense of minimax risk. We further prove that the proposed estimator
   is model selection consistent by establishing a convergence result under
   the entry-wise infinity-norm. Simulations demonstrate the encouraging
   finite sample size performance and computational advantage of the
   proposed estimator. The proposed estimator is also applied to a real
   breast cancer data and shown to outperform existing precision matrix

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop an image-based technique capable of detection and
   grading of prostate cancer, which combines features extracted from
   multiparametric MRI into a single parameter map of cancer probability.
   Materials and Methods: A combination of features extracted from
   diffusion tensor MRI and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI was used to
   characterize biopsy samples from 29 patients. Support vector machines
   were used to separate the cancerous samples from normal biopsy samples
   and to compute a measure of cancer probability, presented in the form of
   a cancer colormap. The classification results were compared with the
   biopsy results and the classifier was tuned to provide the largest area
   under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Based solely on
   the tuning of the classifier on the biopsy data, cancer colormaps were
   also created for whole-mount histopathology slices from four radical
   prostatectomy patients. Results: An area under ROC curve of 0.96 was
   obtained on the biopsy dataset and was validated by a
   leave-one-patient-out procedure. The proposed measure of cancer
   probability shows a positive correlation with Gleason score. The cancer
   colormaps created for the histopathology patients do display the
   dominant tumors. The colormap accuracy increases with measured tumor
   area and Gleason score. Conclusion: Dynamic contrast enhanced imaging
   and diffusion tensor imaging, when used within the framework of
   supervised classification, can play a role in characterizing prostate
   cancer. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2012;. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

   lacking. This may be partially attributed to differences in anatomy,
   physiology, and scale between humans and rodent models. One potentially
   important difference between the rodent and human spinal cord is the
   presence of a significant CSF volume within the intrathecal space around
   the human cord. While the CSF may ``cushion{''} the spinal cord,
   pressure waves within the CSF at the time of injury may contribute to
   the extent and severity of the primary injury. The objective of this
   study was to develop a model of contusion SCI in a miniature pig and
   establish the feasibility of measuring spinal CSF pressure during
   injury.
   Methods. A custom weight-drop device was used to apply thoracic
   contusion SCI! to 17 Yucatan miniature pigs. Impact load and velocity
   were measured. Using fiber optic pressure transducers implanted in the
   thecal sac, CSF pressures resulting from 2 injury severities (caused by
   50-g and 100-g weights released from a 50-cm height) were measured.
   Results. The median peak impact loads were 54 N and 132 N for the 50-g
   and 100-g injuries, respectively. At a nominal 100 mm from the injury
   epicenter, the authors observed a small negative pressure peak (median
   -4.6 mm Hg {[}cranial] and -5.8 mm Hg {[}caudal] for 50 g; -27.6 mm Hg
   {[}cranial] and -27.2 mm Hg {[}caudal] for 100 g) followed by a larger
   positive pressure peak (median 110.5 mm Hg {[}cranial] and 77.1 mm Hg
   {[}caudal] for 50 g; 88.4 mm Hg {[}cranial] and 67.2 mm Hg {[}caudal]
   for 100 g) relative to the preinjury pressure. There were no significant
   differences in peak pressure between the 2 injury severities or the
   caudal and cranial transducer locations.
   Conclusions. A new model of contusion SCI was developed to measure
   spinal CSF pressures during the SCI event. The results suggest that the
   Yucatan miniature pig is an appropriate model for studying CSF, spinal
   cord, and dura interactions during injury. With further development and
   characterization it may be an appropriate in vivo large-animal model of
   SCI to answer questions regarding pathological changes, therapeutic
   safety, or treatment efficacy, particularly where humanlike dimensions
   and physiology are important.

Abstract = {{Micro arc oxidation technique was employed to grow zirconia-alumina
   porous layers. Considering XPS, XRD, and EDX results, the layers mainly
   consisted of alpha-Al2O3, gamma-Al2O3, monoclinic ZrO2, tetragonal ZrO2.
   Fractions of these phases were observed to change based on the
   fabrication conditions. Zirconia phases formed not only on the surface,
   but also in the layers depth. Increasing the voltage as well as
   utilizing thicker electrolytes resulted in higher zirconium
   concentration. The average crystalline size of the ZrO2 and the Al2O3
   phases was determined as about 57 and 75 nm. AFM studies revealed that
   the surface roughness increased with voltage and electrolyte
   concentration. Morphological evaluations, performed by SEM, showed that
   the microstructure of the layers strongly depended on the synthesis
   conditions. The layers revealed a porous structure with a pores size of
   40-300 nm. Microcracks were observed to appear when the electrolyte
   concentration and the applied voltage increased. Finally, a formation
   mechanism was put forward with emphasis on the chemical and the
   electrochemical foundations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A critical review and comparison of existing seismic vulnerability
   assessment techniques for buildings are carried out to evaluate their
   suitability for use in seismic risk assessment. The methods considered
   are ``Hybrid{''} vulnerability assessment method, FEMA 154 (Rapid Visual
   Screening), Euro Code 8, New Zealand Guidelines, Modified Turkish method
   and NRC Guidelines. A scoring system is proposed to select the suitable
   vulnerability assessment technique to be utilized for three different
   case studies conducted in different seismicity and geological zones,
   that is, Dhaka, and Rangamati cities, in Bangladesh, and Kelowna, in
   Canada. The ranking considers general description of vulnerability,
   building response factors, variance in output, applicability and ease of
   use, which are identified as the key characteristics required for
   vulnerability scales used in seismic risk evaluation. A sensitivity
   analysis has been carried out for the different methods with regard to
   different weighting criteria. Furthermore, a multi-criteria
   decision-making tool AHP has also been utilized to find out the suitable
   alternatives for seismic vulnerability assessment of buildings. It was
   observed that the Hybrid method adequately satisfies all the criteria
   necessary for their use in seismic risk assessment. Vulnerability maps
   of different study areas using Hybrid method have been integrated into a
   GIS framework to visualize the building vulnerabilities in a spatial
   manner, which will facilitate the authority to manage effective seismic
   hazard risk reduction measures, including upgrading, repairing and

Abstract = {{Local feature points have been widely investigated in solving problems
   in computer vision, such as robust matching and object detection.
   However, its investigation in the area of image hashing is still
   limited. In this paper, we propose a novel shape-contexts-based image
   hashing approach using robust local feature points. The contributions
   are twofold: 1) The robust SIFT-Harris detector is proposed to select
   the most stable SIFT keypoints under various content-preserving
   distortions. 2) Compact and robust image hashes are generated by
   embedding the detected local features into shape-contexts-based
   descriptors. Experimental results show that the proposed image hashing
   is robust to a wide range of distortions and attacks, due to the
   benefits of robust salient keypoints detection and the
   shape-contexts-based feature descriptors. When compared with the current
   state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed scheme yields better
   identification performances under geometric attacks such as rotation
   attacks and brightness changes, and provides comparable performances
   under classical distortions such as additive noise, blurring, and
   compression. Also, we demonstrate that the proposed approach could be
   applied for image tampering detection.}},

Title = {{Kinematic evaluation of one- and two-level Maverick lumbar total disc
   replacement caudal to a long thoracolumbar spinal fusion}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Adjacent level degeneration that occurs above and/or below long
   fusion constructs is a documented clinical problem that is widely
   believed to be associated with the considerable change in stiffness
   caused by the fusion. Some researchers have suggested that early
   degeneration at spinal joints adjacent to a fusion could be treated by
   implanting total disc replacements at these levels. It is thought that
   further degeneration could be prevented through the disc replacement's
   design aims to reproduce normal disc heights, kinematics and tissue
   loading. For this reason, there is a clinical need to evaluate if a
   total disc replacement can maintain both the quantity of motion (i.e.
   range) and the quality of motion (i.e. center of rotation and coupling)
   at segments adjacent to a long spinal fusion. The purpose of this study
   was to experimentally evaluate range of motion (ROM-the intervertebral
   motion measured) and helical axis of motion (HAM) changes due to one-and
   two-level Maverick total disc replacement (TDR) adjacent to a long
   spinal fusion.
   Methods Seven spine specimens (T8-S1) were used in this study (66 +/- 19
   years old, 3F/4 M). A continuous pure moment of +/- 5.0 Nm was applied
   to the specimen in flexion-extension (FE), lateral bending (LB) and
   axial rotation (AR), with a compressive follower preload of 400 N. The
   5.0 Nm data were analyzed to evaluate the operated segment biomechanics
   at the level of the disc replacements. The data were also analyzed at
   lower moments using a modified version of Panjabi's proposed
   ``hybrid{''} method to evaluate adjacent segment kinematics
   (intervertebral motion at the segments adjacent to the fusion) under
   identical overall (T8-S1) specimen rotations. The motion of each
   vertebra was monitored with an optoelectronic camera system. The
   biomechanical test was completed for (1) the intact condition and
   repeated after each surgical technique was applied to the specimen, (2)
   capsulotomy at L4-L5 and L5-S1, (3) T8-L4 fusion and capsulotomy at
   L4-L5 and L5-S1, (4) Maverick at L4-L5, and (5) Maverick at L5-S1. The
   capsulotomy was performed to allow measurement of facet joint loads in a
   companion study. Paired t tests were used to determine if differences in
   the kinematic parameters measured were significant. Holm-Sidak
   corrections for multiple comparisons were applied where appropriate.
   Results Under the 5.0 Nm loads, L4-L5 ROMs tended to decrease in all
   directions following L4-L5 Maverick replacement (mean = 22 \%, compared
   to the fused condition). Two-level Maverick implantation also tended to
   reduce L4-S1 ROM (mean 18, 7 and 31 \% in FE, LB and AR, respectively,
   compared to the fused condition without TDR). Following TDR replacement,
   the HAM location tended to shift posteriorly in FE (at L5-S1),
   anteriorly in AR, and inferiorly in LB. However, although the
   above-mentioned trends were observed, neither one-nor two-level TDR
   replacement showed statistically significant ROM or HAM change in any of
   the three directions. At the identical T8-S1 posture identified by the
   modified hybrid analysis, the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels underwent
   significant larger motions, relative to the overall specimen rotation,
   after fusion. In the hybrid analysis, there were no significant
   differences between the ROM after fusion with intact natural discs at
   L4-L5 and L5-S1 and the motions at those levels with one or two TDRs
   implanted.
   Conclusions The present results demonstrated that one or two Maverick
   discs implanted subjacent to a long thoracolumbar fusion preserved
   considerable and intact-like ranges of motion and maintained motion
   patterns similar to the intact specimen, in this ex vivo study with
   applied pure moments and compressive follower preload. The hybrid
   analysis demonstrated that, after fusion, the TDR-implanted levels are
   required to undergo large rotations, relative to those necessary before
   fusion, in order to achieve the same motion between T8 and S1.
   Additional clinical and biomechanical research is necessary to determine
   if such a kinematic demand would be made on these levels clinically and
   the biomechanical performance of these implants if it were.}},

Abstract = {{In the nanometer era of VLSI design, high power consumption is
   considered to be a ``show-stopper{''} for many applications. Voltage
   island design has emerged as a popular method for addressing this issue.
   This technique requires multiple supply voltages on the same chip with
   blocks assigned to different supply voltages. Implementation challenges
   force blocks with similar supply voltages to be placed contiguous to one
   another, thereby creating ``islands{''}. Classical floorplanners assume
   a single supply voltage in the entire chip and thus require additional
   design steps to realize voltage islands. In this paper we present a new
   multi-objective floorplanning algorithm based on the sequence pair
   representation that can floorplan blocks in the form of islands. Given
   the possible supply voltage choices for each block, the floorplanner
   simultaneously attempts to reduce power and area of the chip. Our
   floorplanner integrates the tasks of assigning blocks to different
   supply voltages and the placing of the blocks in the chip. Compared to
   previous work, the proposed floorplanner on average reduces the area
   overhead of the chip by 13.5\% with 34\% runtime improvement. As power
   and area are jointly optimized, we also explore the trade-off between
   these cost functions. Experimental results show that equal weight to
   area and power cost function do not provide the best floorplan solution.

Abstract = {{We introduce MMTrack (max-margin tracker), a single-target tracker that
   linearly combines constant and adaptive appearance features. We frame
   offline single-camera tracking as a structured output prediction task
   where the goal is to find a sequence of locations of the target given a
   video. Following recent advances in machine learning, we
   discriminatively learn tracker parameters by first generating suitable
   bad trajectories and then employing a margin criterion to learn how to
   distinguish among ground truth trajectories and all other possibilities.
   Our framework for tracking is general, and can be used with a variety of
   features. We demonstrate a system combining a variety of appearance
   features and a motion model, with the parameters of these features
   learned jointly in a coherent learning framework. Further, taking
   advantage of a reliable human detector, we present a natural way of
   extending our tracker to a robust detection and tracking system. We
   apply our framework to pedestrian tracking and experimentally
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two real-world data sets,
   achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art tracking systems. (C)

Abstract = {{The vibration analysis of an Euler-Bernoulli beam with an attached
   rotary unit is first carried out assuming no unbalance. For comparison
   purposes, two different beam end boundary conditions are considered: a
   simply-supported and a clamped-clamped condition. The problem is then
   extended to the vibration behavior of the initial beam when subjected to
   a harmonic load due to an unbalance in the rotary unit. To absorb the
   ensuing vibrations, a secondary passive beam system is suspended from
   the primary beam which consists of two continuous leaf springs and three
   discrete masses. The absorption frequency is obtained by exploring the
   deflection norm of the primary beam versus dimensionless frequencies of
   the system. To ensure the appropriateness of the procedure for similar
   multi-beam absorber systems, an experimental set-up is established and
   analytical results are verified.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new and robust approach for the accurate
   evaluation of minimum-zone spatial straightness error from a set of
   coordinate measurement data points. The algorithm iteratively searches
   for the specific data points that define the minimum bound of the
   spatial straightness zone using combinatorial optimization. It is based
   on the fact that the minimum circumscribed cylinder of a point set,
   which is equivalent to the minimum spatial straightness zone of the
   measurement data, will pass through three, four, or five of the data
   points that constitute the convex hull vertices of the entire data set.
   Computed results have shown that although the presented approach may
   lead to increased computational time, it is robust and able to construct
   the exact minimum circumscribed cylinder for a given point set. The
   minimum-zone spatial straightness error can thus be evaluated with the
   best possible accuracy. The advantage of the presented algorithm is
   demonstrated via comparison with published computed results of existing
   algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term weight loss, ion release and surface composition of AISI
   316L, the Co-28Cr-6Mo and Ti-6Al-4V alloys were investigated in
   phosphate buffered solutions (PBS) with various bovine serum albumin
   (BSA) concentrations. All the samples lost weight up to 14 weeks and
   then started to gain weight. This can be explained by precipitation of
   dissolved ions on the surface after 14 weeks of immersion. The
   quantities of the dissolved ions were measured in immersed solution for
   8, 14 and 22 weeks by induced coupled plasma-optical emission
   spectrometer (ICP-OES). The amounts of Fe released from 316L, and Co and
   Mo released from the Co-28Cr-6Mo alloy decreased after 14 weeks of
   immersion in PBS and BSA solutions. This observation coincides with the
   weight change of the samples. The oxide layer composition and
   concentration of the specimens exposed to solutions for 22 weeks were
   identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The XPS
   results revealed that chromium is the main component of the 316L and
   Co-28Cr-6Mo alloy. The high Cr concentration of the 316L and Co-Cr-Mo
   oxide layer corresponds with the slow dissolution rate of Cr compared to
   other alloying elements of the 316L and Co-28Cr-6Mo alloy. Crown

   sampling techniques is used to approximate these posterior density
   functions. Both MetropolisHastings algorithm and Gibbs sampling are used

Abstract = {{This paper presents a high efficiency (similar to 3.8\%) inverted
   organic photovoltaic devices based on a P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction
   (BHJ) blend with improved electron-and hole-selective contact layers.
   Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticle films with different thicknesses are
   deposited on the transparent electrodes as a nano-porous
   electron-selective contact layer. A thin gold film is used between the
   BHJ photoactive layer and the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
   poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), which improves the wettability and
   significantly enhances the stability of the device (>50 days of air
   exposure). Photovoltaic device parameters such as power conversion
   efficiency (PCE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are
   systematically examined for inverted devices with different thicknesses
   of ZnO and gold layers in comparison to the non-inverted and reference
   inverted devices with no contact layers. The optimized organic devices
   with ZnO and Au contact layers show exceptional short circuit currents
   (in excess of 13 mA/cm(2)), in comparison to the reference devices,
   which is related to increased quantum efficiency of the device observed
   in measured EQE experiments. These results are important for development
   of high efficiency and stable all-printed organic solar cells and point
   out the role of contact layers, in particular, ZnO conductivity and
   morphology in the device performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Abstract = {{Free-space optical (FSO) communication enables high rate data
   transmission over the atmospheric channel. However, turbulence-induced
   fading poses severe challenges for operating these systems. Employing
   spatial diversity has been proposed as an effective measure to improve
   system performance. In this paper, we first develop a comprehensive
   model for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) coherent and
   differential FSO systems with heterodyne detection taking into account
   all relevant signal and noise terms. For the sake of comparison, a
   similar model is also developed for direct detection. An asymptotic
   performance analysis is presented for MIMO FSO systems employing
   coherent and differential space-time codes (STCs) over Gamma-Gamma
   fading channels. We consider the practically important case of two
   transmit and an arbitrary number of receive apertures and provide a
   simple STC design criterion for coherent and differential FSO systems.
   Our results reveal that, in contrast to FSO systems with intensity
   modulation and direct detection (IM/DD), for coherent and differential
   FSO systems, orthogonal space-time block codes previously introduced in
   the RF literature, are preferable over repetition STCs, which do not
   yield full diversity. We quantify the asymptotic performance gain of
   coherent space-time coded FSO systems compared to IM/DD systems and show
   that this gain is mainly caused by the superiority of heterodyne
   detection compared to direct detection rather than the different STC and
   modulation designs.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, different compositions of nearly monodispersed diblock
   copolymers of DL-lactide or D-lactide and L-lactide were synthesized by
   living ring-opening polymerization with a dinuclear indium catalyst. The
   effects of molecular weight and block length ratio on the rheological
   behavior of DL and L-lactide diblock copolymers in the disordered state
   were investigated. For comparison, blends of PDLLA and PLLA homopolymers
   of equivalent molecular weights to the diblock copolymers were prepared.
   We found that the time-temperature (t-T) superposition principle is
   applicable to the diblock copolymers PLLA-b-PDLLA and blends in the
   disordered state. However, the t-T superposition failed at low
   temperatures close to the temperature of crystallization. In contrast,
   diblock copolymers PLLA-b-PDLA formed stereocomplex crystallites of high
   melting point (slightly above 200 degrees C) that causes a viscosity
   enhancement. The failure of t-T superposition was found due to existing
   of micro homo or stereocomplex crystallites. The nonisothermal
   crystallization behavior was investigated using differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC). The DSC thermograms of blends exhibited a single
   glass transition at 50-60 degrees C followed by melting point of PLLA at
   177 degrees C. With decreasing of the PLLA content in the blends, the
   intensity of the melting peak decreased. In addition, different
   crystallization behavior was observed for diblock copolymers compared to
   their equivalent blends. Specifically, low temperatures and enthalpies
   of melting peaks were observed for diblock copolymers. These also show
   improvement in elongation at break and tensile strength as compared to
   their counterpart homopolymer blends. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A high-order algorithm of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)
   method, H-DSMC, has been developed to simulate rarefied flow regimes.
   The mth order Taylor series expansion has been employed to obtain a more
   generalized form of the time discretization for the collision part of
   Boltzmann equation. In the purposed algorithm, the higher order
   collision terms are introduced as well as higher order terms in the time
   step of the probabilistic coefficients. These newly implemented higher
   order terms improve the accuracy and efficiency of the solution and
   enhance the convergence rate quite significantly. Comparison between
   results of the classic DSMC method and the H-DSMC method shows the
   promising performance of the introduced technique. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We present a programmable droplet-based microfluidic device that
   combines the reconfigurable flow-routing capabilities of integrated
   microvalve technology with the sample compartmentalization and
   dispersion-free transport that is inherent to droplets. The device
   allows for the execution of user-defined multistep reaction protocols in
   95 individually addressable nanoliter-volume storage chambers by
   consecutively merging programmable sequences of picoliter-volume
   droplets containing reagents or cells. This functionality is enabled by
   ``flow-controlled wetting,{''} a droplet docking and merging mechanism
   that exploits the physics of droplet flow through a channel to control
   the precise location of droplet wetting. The device also allows for
   automated cross-contamination-free recovery of reaction products from
   individual chambers into standard microfuge tubes for downstream
   analysis. The combined features of programmability, addressability, and
   selective recovery provide a general hardware platform that can be
   reprogrammed for multiple applications. We demonstrate this versatility
   by implementing multiple single-cell experiment types with this device:
   bacterial cell sorting and cultivation, taxonomic gene identification,
   and high-throughput single-cell whole genome amplification and
   sequencing using common laboratory strains. Finally, we apply the device
   to genome analysis of single cells and microbial consortia from diverse
   environmental samples including a marine enrichment culture, deep-sea
   sediments, and the human oral cavity. The resulting datasets capture
   genotypic properties of individual cells and illuminate known and
   potentially unique partnerships between microbial community members.}},

Abstract = {{Optical microscopy is a simple, yet essential, imaging technology.
   Conventional laboratory-grade optical microscopes are bulky and costly,
   confining their use to within laboratory settings and restricting their
   accessibility in regions of limited resources. With the aim of
   overcoming these limitations, we have realized a portable, low-cost, and
   highly automated optical microscope that integrates mass-manufactured
   components, including light-emitting diodes, a web camera, optical disk
   drives, and a microcontroller. Our implementation is capable of
   bright-field and fluorescence imaging with micrometer-scale resolution
   and controlled mechanical actuation of both the lens and sample. We
   interface the lighting, image capture, and mechanical actuators of the
   microscope into a single software environment, enabling automation of
   common microscope operations, such as image focusing and large-area
   sample visualization. Combination of mechanical actuation and software
   automation into a compact, low-cost microscope system is an important
   initial step toward the goal of making optical microscopy universally
   accessible, portable, and easy to use. (C) 2012 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{We develop a technique that now enables surface plasmon polaritons
   (SPPs) coupled by nano-patterned slits in a metal film to be detected
   using conventional optical microscopy with standard objective lenses.
   The crux of this method is an ultra-thin polymer layer on the metal
   surface, whose thickness can be varied over a nanoscale range to enable
   controllable tuning of the SPP momentum. At an optimal layer thickness
   for which the SPP momentum matches the momentum of light emerging from
   the slit, the SPP coupling efficiency is enhanced about six times
   relative to that without the layer. The enhanced efficiency results in
   distinctive and bright plasmonic signatures near the slit visible by
   naked eye under an optical microscope. We demonstrate how this
   capability can be used for parallel measurement through a simple
   experiment in which the SPP propagation distance is extracted from a
   single microscope image of an illuminated array of nano-patterned slits
   on a metal surface. We also use optical microscopy to image the focal
   region of a plasmonic lens and obtain results consistent with a
   previously-reported results using near-field optical microscopy.
   Measurement of SPPs near a nano-slit using conventional and
   widely-available optical microscopy is an important step towards making
   nano-plasmonic device technology highly accessible and easy-to-use. (C)

   unbalanced forces when the braces buckle. A probabilistic seismic
   performance comparison for a three-story office building located in
   Berkeley, California designed using these two structural systems is

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative radial flow field design for PEMFC
   cathode flow plates. This new design, which is in the form of a radial
   flow field, replaces the standard rectangular flow channels in exchange
   for a set of flow control rings. The control rings allow for better flow
   distribution and use of the active area. The radial field constructed of
   aluminum and plated with gold for superior surface and conductive
   properties. This material was selected based on the results obtained
   from the performance of the standard flow channels of serpentine and
   parallel designs constructed of hydrophilic gold and typical hydrophobic
   graphite materials. It is shown that the new flow field design performs
   significantly better compared to the current standard parallel channels
   in a dry-air-flow environment. The polarization curves for a dry flow,
   however, show excessive membrane drying with the radial design.
   Humidifying the air flow improves the membrane hydration, and in the
   meantime, the fuel cell with the innovative radial flow field produces
   higher current compared to other channel designs, even the serpentine
   flow field. The water removal and mass transport capacity of the radial
   flow field was proven to be better than parallel and serpentine designs.
   This performance increase was achieved while maintaining the pressure
   drop nearly half of the pressure drop measured in the serpentine flow
   field. Crown Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Red blood cells (RBC) flowing in microcapillaries tend to associate into
   clusters, i.e., small trains of cells separated from each other by a
   distance comparable to cell size. This process is usually attributed to
   slower RBCs acting to create a sequence of trailing cells. Here, based
   on the first systematic investigation of collective RBC flow behavior in
   microcapillaries in vitro by high-speed video microscopy and numerical
   simulations, we show that RBC size polydispersity within the
   physiological range does not affect cluster stability. Lower applied
   pressure drops and longer residence times favor larger RBC clusters. A
   limiting cluster length, depending on the number of cells in a cluster,
   is found by increasing the applied pressure drop. The insight on the
   mechanism of RBC clustering provided by this work can be applied to
   further our understanding of RBC aggregability, which is a key parameter
   implicated in clotting and thrombus formation. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{A mathematical model was developed to simulate the precipitation
   kinetics during heat treatment of multicomponent aluminum alloys. The
   model is based on the general numerical framework proposed by Kampmann
   and Wagner, and features a full coupling with CALPHAD software for the
   evaluation of the Gibbs-Thomson effect. It also does not rely on the
   assumption that precipitate phase composition is stoichiometric or
   uniform, and is therefore applicable for predicting complex
   precipitation kinetics encountered in industrial practices. Applications
   of the model to various aging treatments of binary Al-Sc alloys and a
   ternary Al-Sc-Zr alloy were conducted. It was found that the model
   predictions for extended time coarsening kinetics are in good agreement
   with the analytical Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner coarsening theory. Its
   ability to reproduce the complex precipitation pathways in
   multicomponent alloys was demonstrated by simulation of the
   precipitation kinetics for an Al-0.09 at.\% Sc-0.03 at.\% Zr alloy.
   Comparison of the simulation results with experimental measurement has
   also highlighted research directions that require further effort. (C)

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional (3-D) granular model which simulates fluid flow
   within solidifying alloys with a globular microstructure, such as that
   found in grain refined Al alloys, is presented. The model geometry
   within a representative volume element (RVE) consists of a set of
   prismatic triangular elements representing the intergranular liquid
   channels. The pressure field within the liquid channels is calculated
   using a finite elements (FEs) method assuming a Poiseuille flow within
   each channel and flow conservation at triple lines. The fluid flow is
   induced by solidification shrinkage and openings at grain boundaries due
   to deformation of the coherent solid. The granular model predictions are
   validated against bulk data calculated with averaging techniques. The
   results show that a fluid flow simulation of globular semi-solid
   materials is able to reproduce both a map of the 3-D intergranular
   pressure and the localization of feeding within the mushy zone. A new
   hot cracking sensitivity coefficient is then proposed. Based on a mass
   balance performed over a solidifying isothermal volume element, this
   coefficient accounts for tensile deformation of the semi-solid domain
   and for the induced intergranular liquid feeding. The fluid flow model
   is then used to calculate the pressure drop in the mushy zone during the
   direct chill casting of aluminum alloy billets. The predicted pressure
   demonstrates that deep in the mushy zone where the permeability is low
   the local pressure can be significantly lower than the pressure
   predicted by averaging techniques. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{47-54}},

Abstract = {{An investigation of the simultaneous precipitation of iron oxide and
   silica species from acidic solutions was conducted, simulating the
   paragoethite process, an iron-removal stage employed in zinc
   hydrometallurgy. Laboratory-based continuous crystallisation experiments
   were carried out under the primary conditions employed in industry, with
   pH (at 85 degrees C) maintained at 2.65, the combined Fe and Si
   concentration at 0.1128 M (unless otherwise stated) and Si:Fe molar
   ratios varied from 0 to 0.43. The crystal structure of the residues
   produced was characterised, with the extent of iron and silicate removal
   quantified and properties relating to aggregate structure also measured.
   It is shown that the degree of silica polymerisation prior to the
   precipitation reaction dictates the mechanism of co-precipitation and
   thereby the properties of the residue. In the presence of polymerised
   silica, less dense aggregates of finer mean particle size are formed,
   which has negative implications for dewatering. Conversely, where silica
   is allowed to polymerise prior to the iron precipitation reaction, a
   greater proportion of silica is removed from the solution. As these
   effects are key to an effective precipitation stage in the process, the
   influence of silica polymerisation must figure in considerations when
   handling high-silicate concentrates. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Pages = {{1278-1290}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We study the effect of outdated channel state information on the outage
   and error rate performance of amplify-and-forward (AF) relay selection,
   where only one out of the set of available relays is activated. We
   consider two variations of AF relay selection, namely best relay
   selection and partial relay selection, when the selection is based upon
   outdated channel estimates. For both these variations, closed-form
   expressions for the outage probability are obtained, along with
   approximate expressions for the symbol error rate in the medium to high
   signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. The diversity gain and coding gain
   of the above schemes are also explicitly derived. Numerical results
   manifest that the outage performance of AF relay selection is highly
   dependent on the level of correlation between the actual channel
   conditions and their corresponding (outdated) estimates. This result has
   a significant impact on the deployment of relay selection in practical
   applications, implying that a high feedback rate may be required in
   practice in order to attain the full benefits of relay selection. It is
   further shown that it may be preferable, in terms of outage and symbol
   error probability, not to include links in the relay selection process
   that experience a sufficiently high maximum Doppler shift, since in
   those cases partial relay selection outperforms best relay selection.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we formulate a joint optimization problem for resource
   allocation and scheduling in full-duplex multiple-input multiple-output
   orthogonal frequency division multiple access (MIMO-OFDMA) relaying
   systems with amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF)
   relaying protocols. Our problem formulation takes into account
   heterogeneous data rate requirements for delay sensitive and non-delay
   sensitive users. We also consider a theoretically optimal hybrid
   relaying scheme as a performance benchmark, which allows a dynamic
   selection between AF relaying and DF relaying protocols with full-duplex
   and half-duplex relays. We show that under some mild conditions the
   optimal transmitter precoding and receiver post-processing matrices
   jointly diagonalize the MIMO-OFDMA relay channels for all considered
   relaying protocols transforming the resource allocation and scheduling
   problem into a scalar optimization problem. Dual decomposition is
   employed to solve this optimization problem and a distributed iterative
   resource allocation and scheduling algorithm with closed-form power and
   subcarrier allocation is derived. Simulation results not only illustrate
   that the proposed distributed algorithm converges to the optimal
   solution in a small number of iterations, but also demonstrate the
   potential performance gains achievable with full-duplex relaying

Abstract = {{Fair allocation of resources is an important consideration in the design
   of wireless networks. In this paper, we consider the setting of multihop
   wireless networks with multiple routing paths and develop an online flow
   control and scheduling algorithm for packet admission and link
   activation that achieves high aggregate throughput while providing
   different data flows with a fair share of network capacity. For fairness
   provisioning, we seek to maximize the minimum throughput provided to
   flows in the network. To cope with different degrees of data reliability
   among the different links in the network, we use different channel code
   rates as appropriate. While we expect performance improvement using
   channel coding and multipath routing, the main contribution of our work
   is a joint treatment of network stability, multipath routing and
   link-level reliability in meeting the overarching goal of maxmin
   fairness. We develop a decentralized, and hence practical, scheduling
   policy that addresses various concerns and demonstrate, via simulations,
   that it is competitive with respect to an optimal centralized rate
   allocator. We also evaluate the fairness provisioning under the proposed
   algorithm and show that channel coding improves the performance of the
   network significantly. Finally, we show through simulations that the
   proposed algorithm outperforms a class of existing approaches on

Abstract = {{Energy consumption in wireless communication system is rapidly
   increasing due to growing wireless multimedia access. Combating adverse
   effects of excessive energy consumption demands for energy-aware system
   design, leading to a new research paradigm called green communication.
   In this paper, we propose user selection and power allocation schemes
   for a multi-user, multi-relay cooperative cellular system in order to
   minimize the cost of transmission. In the proposed schemes, the cost
   function is first formulated to optimize the weighted sum powers of base
   and relay stations. It is then extended to a more general
   multi-objective scheme which jointly optimizes the sum power and
   throughput keeping a balance between them. In both of the schemes,
   quality-of-service is guaranteed in terms of end-to-end signal-to-noise
   ratio. To make the proposed schemes realistic, we assume the presence of
   estimation errors in channel state information. An algorithm to enhance
   fairness among users in these schemes is also presented. Simulation
   results are presented to confirm the performance of proposed schemes in
   terms of energy efficiency, system throughput, outage probability, and
   fairness to end users.}},

Abstract = {{Best relay selection (BRS) has received considerable attention in the
   literature as it makes efficient use of the system resources and
   achieves full diversity. Partial relay selection (PRS) is an alternative
   to BRS and performs relay selection based on local channel state
   information (CSI) only at the expense of a loss in diversity. Although,
   in practice, relays may be deployed in unfavorable environments exposing
   them to non-Gaussian impairments, existing analyses and design
   guidelines for BRS and PRS are limited to additive white Gaussian noise
   channels. In this paper, we analyze the error rate of BRS and PRS in the
   asymptotic regime of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for
   amplify-and-forward (AF) relays and impairment by generic noise and
   interference. The derived analytical results are valid for Gaussian and
   non-Gaussian noises with finite moments, independent and non-identically
   distributed Rayleigh fading, and arbitrary linear modulation schemes. In
   order to reduce the signaling overhead required for CSI acquisition, we
   propose a relay subset selection scheme for BRS and PRS. Furthermore, to
   guarantee fairness in energy resource usage across the relays, we
   introduce a fair and flexible power allocation scheme with energy
   consumption constraints which does not affect the achievable diversity
   gain. The proposed relay subset selection and power allocation schemes
   only require knowledge of the average CSI of the links and certain
   moments of the noises impairing the relays and the destination.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the cooperative spectrum sensing problem in cognitive radio
   with energy detection. Secondary users with non-identical sensing
   channels make 1-bit sensing decisions that are reported to the secondary
   base station over non-identical noisy fading channels. The base station
   has reporting channel knowledge and combines the decisions with an
   M-out-of-K rule. We allow the secondary users to trade sensing time
   samples for additional reporting time slots to increase the reporting
   signal-to-noise ratios. We derive the false alarm and missed detection
   probabilities as functions of the secondary sensor decision thresholds
   and the durations for sensing and reporting. Furthermore, we bound these
   probabilities and impose practical constraints that enable convex
   optimization to minimize the false alarm probability for a target missed
   detection probability. We compare knowing the instantaneous reporting
   channels for optimization with knowing the average channels. Allowing
   secondary users to trade sensing time samples for additional reporting
   time slots is shown to significantly improve sensing performance, even
   with poor sensing and reporting channels and a small number of secondary
   users.}},

Abstract = {{The hydroconversion of cold lake vacuum residue (CLVR) in a semibatch,
   slurry-phase reactor was studied at 415-445 degrees C, 13.8 MPa, and a
   reaction time of 1 h, using MoS2 catalysts prepared from Mo-octoate and
   Mo-micelle precursors. Both precursors yielded MoS2 with the same
   activity in terms of coke suppression, residue conversion, and hydrogen
   uptake. The coke yield decreased from 22 wt \% in the absence of a
   catalyst, to 4.8 wt \% in the presence of 100 ppm Mo. A Mo concentration
   of 600 ppm was found to be optimum in terms of maximizing the residue
   conversion (84 wt \%) and minimizing the coke yield (2.9 wt \%). The
   characteristics of the recovered coke as a function of catalyst
   concentration and age in the reactor were also investigated. At high
   catalyst concentrations (>600 ppm Mo) and short reaction times, the
   generated coke was relatively amorphous, with a high H/C ratio. The
   solid catalyst-coke recovered from the reactor was recycled without
   further treatment. The catalytic activity of the recycled catalyst was
   the same as the fresh catalyst, and no catalyst deactivation was
   observed under the hydroconversion conditions of the present study.}},

Abstract = {{Studying uncertainties in hydrological modeling is necessary because of
   data scarcity or abundance and quality issues. These uncertainties can
   have significant effects on environmental decision making.
   Traditionally, probabilistic methods have been used to study
   uncertainties; however, recently, more comprehensive methods are used in
   the treatment of uncertainty. These methods are capable of addressing
   uncertainty in the form of vagueness, ambiguity, and conflict, which
   cannot be studied efficiently using probabilistic frameworks. The
   Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence (DST) is one of the popular methods
   that can provide a unified platform to address data conflict and
   incompleteness. In this paper, the use of DST to model and propagate the
   uncertainty arising from two snow water equivalent data sets with a high
   degree of conflict (DST conflict k = 0.74) is demonstrated. In DST, on
   the basis of the nature of data, e.g., the degree of conflict, different
   combination rules are applicable. Here, four DST combination rules are
   applied including Dempster-Shafer, Yager, mixture, and the proportional
   conflict redistribution rule number 6 (PCR6). The outcomes from these
   rules are compared, and their effects on subsequent decision-making are
   discussed. Considering the specific condition of the data used, i.e.,
   high-conflict data with limited quality information, results indicate
   that mixture and PCR6 rules are more appropriate. The resultant
   uncertainty-driven data set is subsequently used as input into an
   illustrative hydrologic model demonstrating a method for propagating
   uncertainty. In addition, the issues of resolving conflict for less
   contradicting data sets, the dependency between bodies of evidence, and
   modeling incompleteness are also discussed. DOI:

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Communities developing plans for response to tsunami require
   site-specific estimates of the hazard, elements at risk, and potential
   losses, and an assessment of the effectiveness of mitigations and
   protective actions. Citizens want to know whether they can reach safe
   havens in sufficient time and whether recommended safe haven locations
   can offer sufficient protection. This paper investigates how flood,
   loss, and evacuation predictive models can be used to develop baseline
   estimates of potential losses without mitigations in place, with the
   goal of helping communities assess and improve response plans. A case
   study is presented for the District of Ucluelet, British Columbia, which
   is susceptible to the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) earthquake and
   tsunami hazard. Approximately 58\% of the community's buildings and key
   elements of the critical infrastructure are in a tsunami hazard zone.
   Depending upon the time of day and year, between one-half and two-thirds
   of the resident and tourist population are at risk, and depending on the
   evacuation strategy, between one-fifth and one-third of the
   population-at-risk could be lost. These mortality rates are comparable
   to observed rates for a rapid-onset, high-intensity tsunami. Alternative
   emergency response plans are simulated and assessed for their
   effectiveness in terms of the potential for loss reduction and for
   increases in evacuation rates. The importance of self-activation and
   rapid protective action is confirmed, and pedestrian-based evacuation to
   an expanded set of proximal safe havens is recommended. Tourists form a
   large proportion of the population-at-risk during high season and could
   experience significant proportional losses. Future research is needed to
   assess the community's understanding of tsunami risk and whether
   community preparedness has actually improved. This study also confirms
   the need for broader initiatives to estimate populations at risk, to
   conduct evacuation modeling studies, and to assess whether evacuation on
   foot, in vehicles, or in combination is most effective. DOI:

Title = {{Maximum Principal Strain Correlates with Spinal Cord Tissue Damage in
   Contusion and Dislocation Injuries in the Rat Cervical Spine}},

Abstract = {{The heterogeneity of the primary mechanical mechanism of spinal cord
   injury (SCI) is not currently used to tailor treatment strategies
   because the effects of these distinct patterns of acute mechanical
   damage on long-term neuropathology have not been fully investigated. A
   computational model of SCI enables the dynamic analysis of mechanical
   forces and deformations within the spinal cord tissue that would
   otherwise not be visible from histological tissue sections. We created a
   dynamic, three-dimensional finite element (FE) model of the rat cervical
   spine and simulated contusion and dislocation SCI mechanisms. We
   investigated the relationship between maximum principal strain and
   tissue damage, and compared primary injury patterns between mechanisms.
   The model incorporated the spinal cord white and gray matter, the dura
   mater, cerebrospinal fluid, spinal ligaments, intervertebral discs, a
   rigid indenter and vertebrae, and failure criteria for ligaments and
   vertebral endplates. High-speed (similar to 1m/sec) contusion and
   dislocation injuries were simulated between vertebral levels C3 and C6
   to match previous animal experiments, and average peak maximum principal
   strains were calculated for several regions at the injury epicenter and
   at 1-mm intervals from +5mm rostral to -5mm caudal to the lesion.
   Average peak principal strains were compared to tissue damage measured
   previously in the same regions via axonal permeability to 10-kD
   fluorescein-dextran. Linear regression of tissue damage against peak
   maximum principal strain for pooled data within all white matter regions
   yielded similar and significant (p < 0.0001) correlations for both
   contusion (R-2 = 0.86) and dislocation (R-2 = 0.52). The model enhances
   our understanding of the differences in injury patterns between SCI
   mechanisms, and provides further evidence for the link between principal
   strain and tissue damage.}},

   The behaviour exhibited a cathodic dependence on bicarbonate and

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study random access in a drive-thru scenario, where
   roadside access points (APs) are installed on a highway to provide
   temporary Internet access for vehicles. We consider vehicle-to-roadside
   (V2R) communications for a vehicle that aims to upload a file when it is
   within the APs' coverage ranges, where both the channel contention level
   and transmission data rate vary over time. The vehicle will pay a fixed
   amount each time it tries to access the APs, and will incur a penalty if
   it cannot finish the file uploading when leaving the APs. First, we
   consider the problem of finding the optimal transmission policy with a
   single AP and random vehicular traffic arrivals. We formulate it as a
   finite-horizon sequential decision problem, solve it using dynamic
   programming (DP), and design a general dynamic optimal random access
   (DORA) algorithm. We derive the conditions under which the optimal
   transmission policy has a threshold structure, and propose a monotone
   DORA algorithm with a lower computational complexity for this special
   case. Next, we consider the problem of finding the optimal transmission
   policy with multiple APs and deterministic vehicular traffic arrivals
   thanks to perfect traffic estimation. We again obtain the optimal
   transmission policy using DP and propose a joint DORA algorithm.
   Simulation results based on a realistic vehicular traffic model show
   that our proposed algorithms achieve the minimal total cost and the
   highest upload ratio as compared with some other heuristic schemes. In
   particular, we show that the joint DORA scheme achieves an upload ratio
   130\% and 207\% better than the heuristic schemes at low and high
   traffic densities, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Two types of combined multiphoton microscopy and optical coherence
   tomography (MPM/OCT) are compared for multimodal optical imaging.
   Single-scale multiphoton microscopy and optical coherence microscopy
   (MPM/OCM) is shown to acquire multiple contrasts from MPM and OCT
   simultaneously. Multi-scale MPM/OCT is shown to provide multiple
   field-of-views (FOVs), where OCT provides tissue level imaging and MPM
   provides cellular level imaging. In both types, the MPM includes two
   channels which are two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and second
   harmonic generation (SHG). Representative images using each system are
   demonstrated on biological specimens. A detailed comparison of the two
   types of MPM/OCT shows that each system has its own pros and cons.
   MPM/OCM is high-resolution but with limited FOV, and OCM may or may not
   provide additional information than MPM depending on the samples.
   Multi-scale MPM/OCT can change FOV but need both low and high NA
   objectives. For future development, the two types of MPM/OCT can be
   further integrated to achieve both functions on a single system. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: Vertebral compression fracture repair aims to relieve pain
   and improve function by restoring vertebral structure and biomechanics,
   but is still associated with risks arising from polymethylmethacrylate
   cement extravasation. The Kiva (R) Vertebral Compression Fracture
   Treatment System, a stacked coil implant made of polyetheretherketone
   and delivered over a guide-wire, is a novel device designed to provide
   height restoration and mechanical stabilization, while improving cement
   containment and minimizing disruption of cancellous bone. The objective
   of this study was to determine whether the Kiva system is as effective
   as balloon kyphoplasty at restoring mechanical properties in
   osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
   Methods: Wedge fractures were created in the middle vertebra of fourteen
   osteoporotic three-vertebra spine segments and then repaired with either
   the Kiva or kyphoplasty procedure. Height, stiffness and displacement
   under compression of the spine segments were measured for four
   conditions: intact, fractured, augmented, and post-cyclic eccentric
   loading (50,000 cycles, 200-500 N, 30 mm anterior lever arm).
   Findings: No significant differences were seen between the two
   procedures for height restoration, stiffness at high or low loads, or
   displacement under compression. However, the Kiva System required an
   average of 66\% less cement than kyphoplasty to achieve these outcomes
   (mean 2.6 (SD 0.4) mL v. mean 7.5 (SD 0.8) mL 0; P<0.01). Extravasations
   and excessive posterior cement flow were also significantly lower with
   Kiva (0/7 v. 4/7; P<.05).
   Interpretation: Kiva exhibits similar biomechanical performance to
   balloon kyphoplasty, but may reduce the risk of extravasation through
   the containment mechanism of the implant design and by reducing cement
   volume. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analytical approach to design a continuous
   time-invariant two-level control scheme for asymptotic stabilization of
   a desired period-one trajectory for a hybrid model describing walking by
   a planar biped robot with noninstantaneous double-support phase and
   point feet. It is assumed that the hybrid model consists of both
   single-and double-support phases. The design method is based on the
   concept of hybrid zero dynamics. At the first level, parameterized
   continuous within-stride controllers, including single-and
   double-support-phase controllers, are employed. These controllers create
   a family of 2-D finite-time attractive and invariant submanifolds on
   which the dynamics of the mechanical system is restricted. Moreover,
   since the mechanical system during the double-support phase is
   over-actuated, the feedback law during this phase is designed to be
   minimum norm on the desired periodic orbit. At the second level,
   parameters of the within-stride controllers are updated by an
   event-based update law to achieve hybrid invariance, which results in a
   reduced-order hybrid model for walking. By these means, stability
   properties of the periodic orbit can be analyzed and modified by a
   restricted Poincare return map. Finally, a numerical example for the
   proposed control scheme is presented.}},

Abstract = {{The tubing extrusion-forming process of a fluoropolymer (PEP) melt was
   studied both experimentally and numerically. The flow behaviour of a FEP
   resin was determined by using a tubular die used in industrial-scale
   operations and these data were compared with simulation results using
   (i) a viscous model (Cross) and (ii) a viscoelastic one (the
   Kaye-Bernstein, Kearsley, Zapas/Papanastasiou, Scriven, Macosko or
   K-BKZ/PSM model) in order to assess the viscoelastic effects. In all
   simulations, compressibility, thermal and pressure effects on viscosity
   were taken into account. It was found that the viscoelastic results for
   the pressure, and hence the stresses at the wall, were always higher
   than the viscous results. Both were higher than the experimental
   results. A quadratic slip model plus viscoelasticity was found necessary
   to reproduce the experiments. The smooth flow curves resulting from this
   industrial tubular-coating die are a further manifestation that this is
   an appropriate design for coating fluoropolymers at very high apparent
   shear rates, exceeding 5000 s(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Vast amounts of oil \& gas (O\&G) are consumed around the world everyday
   that are mainly transported and distributed through pipelines. Only in
   Canada, the total length of O\&G pipelines is approximately 100,000 km,
   which is the third largest in the world. Integrity of these pipelines is
   of primary interest to O\&G companies, consultants, governmental
   agencies, consumers and other stakeholder due to adverse consequences
   and heavy financial losses in case of system failure. Fault tree
   analysis (ETA) and event tree analysis (ETA) are two graphical
   techniques used to perform risk analysis, where ETA represents causes
   (likelihood) and ETA represents consequences of a failure event.
   `Bow-tie' is an approach that integrates a fault tree (on the left side)
   and an event tree (on the right side) to represent causes, threat
   (hazards) and consequences in a common platform. Traditional `bow-tie'
   approach is not able to characterize model uncertainty that arises due
   to assumption of independence among different risk events. In this
   paper, in order to deal with vagueness of the data, the fuzzy logic is
   employed to derive fuzzy probabilities (likelihood) of basic events in
   fault tree and to estimate fuzzy probabilities (likelihood) of output
   event consequences. The study also explores how inter-dependencies among
   various factors might influence analysis results and introduces fuzzy
   utility value (FUV) to perform risk assessment for natural gas pipelines
   using triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability criteria, namely, social,
   environmental and economical consequences. The present study aims to
   help owners of transmission and distribution pipeline companies in risk
   management and decision-making to consider multi-dimensional
   consequences that may arise from pipeline failures. The research results
   can help professionals to decide whether and where to take preventive or
   corrective actions and help informed decision-making in the risk
   management process. A simple example is used to demonstrate the proposed
   approach. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a low-phase-noise 67-GHz CMOS oscillator is presented.
   This inductorless voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) employs a
   combination of standing-wave and travelling-wave oscillators to generate
   multi-phase outputs. A filtering technique is used to reduce the phase
   noise of the VCO. The oscillator achieves a tuning range of 5.2 GHz
   using a combination of coarse and fine tuning methods. The proposed
   multi-phase oscillator is designed and fabricated in a 0.13-mu m CMOS
   process. Operating at 67 GHz, the VCO consumes 14 mW from a 1.2-V supply
   and achieves an output phase noise of -95.66 dBc/Hz (-107.89 dBc/Hz) at
   a 1 MHz (10 MHz) offset. The chip area is 0.9 mm(2). As an application
   example for the presented multi-phase oscillator, a polar transmitter
   structure is proposed. The transmitter is designed for systems that use
   a circular quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) constellation. A
   specific example of a 16-QAM transmitter is presented. The desired
   output phase is chosen by an 8-to-1 multiplexer, and a variable gain
   amplifier (VGA) is used to achieve the desired amplitude. Based on
   post-layout simulations, the 60-GHz 16-QAM transmitter consumes 43.2 mW
   from a 1.2-V supply.}},

Abstract = {{Encapsulation of insulin-producing cells in alginate beads could improve
   the treatment of type 1 diabetes by reducing or eliminating the need for
   immunosuppression. We have recently adapted an emulsion and internal
   gelation process to beta-cell encapsulation. This process has the
   advantages of being well suited for m3/h production rates and allowing
   the use of increased alginate concentrations. Compared with 1.5\%
   alginate beads generated by a standard extrusion process, 5\% alginate
   emulsion-generated beads demonstrated greater in vitro stability and
   greater volumetric exclusion of antibody-sized pullulan. When beta TC3
   cells were transplanted into streptozotocin-induced allogeneic diabetic
   mice, a significant decrease in the blood glucose levels was seen within
   2 days with the 5\% emulsion-generated beads but not until >16 days with
   the 1.5\% extrusion-generated beads. This was correlated with higher
   cell survival and lower graft-specific plasma immunoglobulin levels.
   These results suggest that higher-concentration alginate beads generated
   by emulsion and internal gelation have improved graft immunoprotection.
   The emulsion process is a promising and scalable technology for cellular
   therapies requiring immune isolation. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Abstract = {{Ultrasound treatment has been shown to enhance the uptake of both
   hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds into PC3 and Huvec cell lines
   using an insonation regimen of a single 10-s burst of high-frequency (4
   MHz), moderate intensity (32 W/cm(2)) ultrasound. The purpose of this
   work was to evaluate the effect of this ultrasound regimen on the
   cellular accumulation of paclitaxel (PTX) loaded in copolymer micellar
   of methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(D, L-lactide)
   (MePEG-b-PDLLA) in both drug-sensitive (MDCKII and MCF-7) and
   P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-expressing (MDCKII-MDR and NCI-ADR) cell lines.
   There were no effects of ultrasound on hydrodynamic diameters of
   micelles and the release of FRET pairs, indicating the integrity of
   micelles was maintained. There was a two-fold increase in intracellular
   PTX for all ultrasound-treated drug-sensitive cell lines and their
   respective drug-resistant counterparts compared with no ultrasound.
   Significant decreases in drug efflux rates were observed at 20, 40 and
   60 min for both drug-sensitive and -resistant cell lines receiving
   ultrasound. The enhanced accumulation and retention of PTX by ultrasound
   resulted in greater cytotoxicity in both MDCKII and MDCKII-MDR cell
   lines, as indicated by the MTS assay. These data suggest that ultrasound
   may facilitate the uptake of intact paclitaxel-loaded micelles into
   cells, allowing greater retention of drug in both Pgp and
   non-Pgp-expressing cells. (E-mail: helen.burt@ubc.ca) (C) 2012 World

Abstract = {{Dynamic high-fidelity magnetic equivalent circuits (HFMEC) are viable
   tool for accurate, physics-based modeling of magnetic components.
   However, such model formulation typically requires hundreds or thousands
   of state variables to accurately represent the eddy current dynamics. A
   reduced-order HFMEC modeling approach has been recently introduced for
   single-winding systems, e. g., inductors. This letter extends the HFMEC
   approach to multiple-winding power-electronic transformers. First, a
   general full-order HFMEC model of the multiple-winding system is
   developed that incorporates magnetic saturation and the eddy current
   dynamics. Then, multiple-input/multiple-output linear and nonlinear
   order-reduction techniques are used to extract the desired essential
   system dynamics while preserving the model accuracy and gaining
   computational efficiency. The proposed methodology is validated on a
   typical power electronic transformer with both pulse width modulation
   and sinusoidal excitations using numerical simulations and experimental
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Past published research on the storage of fresh woody biomass has rarely

   dry matter losses and gaseous emissions from stored logging residues.
   Lab-scale vessels were set up to study the concentration of off gases at
   15 degrees C and 35 degrees C. Results showed that the maximum
   concentrations of CO2, CO and CH4 were 13.8\%, 0.16\%, and 0.15\%,
   respectively over a period of 35 days. The oxygen level decreased to 0\%
   at the end of storage. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were
   qualitatively detected by GC/MS technique. The major chemical compounds
   identified were alcohols, terpenes, aldehydes, acids, acetone, benzene,
   ethers and esters. The total VOC concentration reached 85 ppm at 35
   degrees C storage temperature at the end of the storage period. Dry
   matter loss ranged from 0.78\% to 2.0\% increasing with storage

Abstract = {{We propose a set of postulates to describe the mechanical interaction
   between a plane-wave electromagnetic pulse and a dispersive, dissipative
   slab having a refractive index of arbitrary sign. The postulates include
   the Abraham electromagnetic momentum density, a generalized Lorentz
   force law, and a model for absorption-driven mass transfer from the
   pulse to the medium. These opto-mechanical mechanisms are incorporated
   into a one-dimensional finite-difference time-domain algorithm that
   solves Maxwell's equations and calculates the instantaneous force
   densities exerted by the pulse onto the slab, the momentum-per-unit-area
   of the pulse and slab, and the trajectories of the slab and system
   center-of-mass. We show that the postulates are consistent with
   conservation of global energy, momentum, and center-of-mass velocity at
   all times, even for cases in which the refractive index of the slab is
   negative or zero. Consistency between the set of postulates and
   well-established conservation laws reinforces the Abraham momentum
   density as the one true electromagnetic momentum density and enables,
   for the first time, identification of the correct form of the
   electromagnetic mass density distribution and development of an explicit
   model for mass transfer due to absorption, for the most general case of
   a ponderable medium that is both dispersive and dissipative. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Study Design. Mathematical model, combined with and verified using human
   subject data.
   Objective. (1) To develop and verify a lumped-parameter mathematical
   model for prediction of spine forces during backward falls; (2) to use
   this model to evaluate the effect of floor stiffness on spine forces
   during falls; and (3) to compare predicted impact forces with forces
   previously measured to fracture the spine.
   Summary of Background Data. Vertebral fractures are the most common
   osteoporotic fractures and commonly result from falls from standing
   height. Compliant flooring reduces the force at the ground during a
   backward fall from standing; however, the effect on spine forces is
   unknown.
   Methods. A 6-df model of the body was developed and verified using data
   from 10 human subjects falling from standing onto 3 types of compliant
   floors (soft: 59 kN/m, medium: 67 kN/m, and firm: 95 kN/m). The
   simulated ground forces were compared with those measured
   experimentally. The model was also used to assess the effect of floor
   stiffness on spine forces at various intervertebral levels.
   Results. There was less than 14\% difference between model predictions
   and experimentally measured peak ground reaction forces, when averaged
   over all floor conditions. When compared with the rigid floor, average
   peak spine force attenuations of 46\%, 43\%, and 41\% were achieved with
   the soft, medium, and firm floors, respectively (3.7, 3.9, 4.1 kN vs.
   6.9 kN at L4/L5). Spine forces were lower than those at the ground and
   decreased cranially (4.9, 3.9, 3.7, 3.5 kN at the ground, L5/S1, L4/L5,
   and L3/L4, respectively, for the soft floor).
   Conclusion. Lowering the floor stiffness (from 400 to 59 kN/m) can
   attenuate peak lumbosacral spine forces in a backward fall onto the
   buttocks from standing by 46\% (average peak from 6.9 to 3.7 kN at
   L4/L5) to values closer to the average tolerance of the spine to
   fracture (3.4 kN).}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the construction, operation and predictive modeling
   of a molecular machine, functioning as a high sensitivity biosensor.
   Embedded gramicidin A (gA) ionchannels in a self-assembled tethered
   lipid bilayer act as biological switches in response to target molecules
   and provide a signal amplification mechanism that results in high
   sensitivity molecular detection. The biosensor can be used as a rapid
   and sensitive point of care diagnostic device in different media such as
   human serum, plasma and whole blood without the need for pre and post
   processing steps required in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The
   electrical reader of the device provides the added advantage of
   objective measurement. Novel ideas in the construction of the molecular
   machine, including fabrication of biochip arrays, and experimental
   studies of its ability to detect analyte molecules over a wide range of
   concentrations are presented. Remarkably, despite the complexity of the
   device, it is shown that the response can be predicted by modeling the
   analyte fluid flow and surface chemical reactions. The derived
   predictive models for the sensing dynamics also facilitate determining
   important variables in the design of a molecular machine such as the ion
   channel lifetime and diffusion dynamics within the bilayer lipid
   membrane as well as the bio-molecular interaction rate constants. (c)

   inclined close to horizontal. Using a combination of experimental,
   computational and analytical methods, we characterize the transitions in
   the flow regimes between inertial- and viscous-dominated regimes, and as
   the displacement flow rate is gradually increased. Three dimensionless
   groups largely describe these flows: densimetric Froude number Fr,
   Reynolds number Re and duct inclination beta. Our results show that the
   flow regimes collapse into regions in a two-dimensional (Fr, Re cos
   beta/Fr) plane. These regions are qualitatively similar between pipes
   and plane channels, although viscous effects are more extensive in
   pipes. In each regime, we are able to give a leading-order estimate for
   the velocity of the leading displacement front, which is effectively a
   measure of displacement efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is thought to protect the spinal cord from
   physiologic loading; however, it is unclear whether this protective role
   extends to traumatic events in which bone fragments enter the canal at
   high velocity. A synthetic model of the spinal neural anatomy, with
   mechanical properties similar to native tissues, was constructed to
   determine if the thickness of the CSF layer (0, 12.8, 19.2 and 24.8 mm,
   10 mm cord) and the velocity (1.2, 2.4, 3.7 and 4.8 m/s) of a 20 g
   impactor affect mechanical predictors of spinal cord injury (SCI)
   severity. Cord compression was directly proportional to impact velocity,
   inversely proportional to CSF dimension and zero for the largest dura
   size. The cord was compressed by more than 18\% of its original diameter
   for the ``no CSF{''} condition and the small dura size for all
   velocities. Impact loads were directly proportional to velocity, and
   inversely proportional to the thickness of the CSF layer. Peak cord
   tension increased with dura size and velocity. Peak CSF pressure
   decreased with distance from the impact epicenter for all dura sizes;
   attenuation was proportional to the velocity and greatest for the
   smallest dura. Increased CSF dimension led to reduced CSF pressure near
   the impact epicenter but had little effect at the remote sites. The
   results suggest that a thicker CSF layer may reduce the stress induced
   in the cord, and therefore metrics of SCI risk may be improved by
   incorporating thecal sac dimensions. Computational, synthetic, cadaveric
   and animal models may better simulate the biomechanics of human SCI if
   fluid interaction is incorporated. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study presents a technoeconomic analysis of wheat straw
   densification in Canada's prairie province of Manitoba as an integral
   part of biomass-to-cellulosic-ethanol infrastructure. Costs of wheat
   straw bale and pellet transportation and densification are analysed,
   including densification plant profitability. Wheat straw collection
   radius increases nonlinearly with pellet plant capacity, from 9.2 to 37
   km for a 2-35 tonnes h(-1) plant. Bales are cheaper under 250 km, beyond
   which the cheapest feedstocks are pellets from the largest pellet plant
   that can be built to exploit economies of scale. Feedstocks account for
   the largest percentage of variable costs. Marginal and average cost
   curves suggest Manitoba could support a pellet plant up to 35 tonnes
   h(-1). Operating below capacity (75-50\%) significantly erodes a plant's
   net present value (NPV). Smaller plants require higher NPV break-even
   prices. Very large plants have considerable risk under low pellet prices
   and increased processing costs. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by

Abstract = {{The impacts of ozone (0-8 mg O-3 L-1) and filtration with biological
   activated carbon on membrane fouling by surface waters were investigated
   using three low-pressure membranes (two ceramics-UF or MF-and one
   polymeric-UF). The unified membrane fouling index (UMFI) was used to
   quantify the reversibility and irreversibility of membrane fouling.
   Minimum UMFI were calculated and repeatability assays were performed in
   order to evaluate the analytical detection limit and the precision of
   the method, respectively. The lowest ozone dose tested (1 mg O-3 L-1)
   reduced the total fouling by 44, 63, and 41\% for the polymeric
   membrane, the UF ceramic membrane, and the MF ceramic membrane,
   respectively. Further increase of the dose led to minor or no
   improvement, except for the ceramic MF membrane. For the ceramic
   membranes, a similar trend to that observed for total fouling was
   observed for hydraulically irreversible fouling. For the polymeric
   membrane, the hydraulically and chemically irreversible fouling were too
   low to be measured. Although biofiltration reduced the average dissolved
   organic carbon and turbidity by 25 and 50\%, respectively, no
   significant fouling reduction was observed. The results indicate that
   irreversible fouling measurements are highly variable and most of the
   time below the analytical detection limit.}},

Abstract = {{Despite its relevance to public health, presence and concentrations of
   Campylobacter spp. in biofilms in natural aquatic environments has not
   been investigated. This study examined the occurrence of Campylobacter
   spp. in biofilms on a variety of surfaces (river rock, slate rock, wood,
   Lexan (TM), sandpaper, and sediment) and in water from December 2005 to
   December 2006 to find a substratum that facilitated campylobacters
   detection in natural aquatic environments. Samples were collected at
   four sites in an agricultural watershed (Elk Creek, British Columbia).
   Campylobacter spp. presence was determined using culturing methods.
   Correlations between chemical, physical and microbiological water
   quality parameters and Campylobacter spp. distribution on different
   surface types were also investigated. Campylobacter spp. had a
   prevalence of 13\% in the wet season, but was not recovered in the dry
   season. Its prevalence was highest in sediment (27\%), followed by slate
   rock (22\%), Lexan and wood (13\%), river rock (9\%) and water (8\%),
   respectively. No Campylobacter spp. was found in sandpaper biofilms.
   Several other criteria were used to assess substrata effectiveness, such
   as correlation amongst Campylobacter spp., indicator bacteria and water
   quality parameters, cost and availability of substratum, potential for
   standardizing substratum, ease of biofilm removal and probability of
   substratum loss in situ. Results show that sediment, slate rock or wood
   could be used as substrata for Campylobacter spp. monitoring. The study
   also highlights the potential use of nitrates and enterococci as faecal
   contamination indicators to protect public health. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Particulate fouling by corrosion products reduces the efficiency of heat
   transport systems. This paper examines particle-wall interactions during
   the course of deposition. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was
   employed to evaluate the interaction of submicron magnetite and hematite
   particles with a platinum electrode at acidic, near-neutral and alkaline
   conditions. It was observed that changes in double-layer capacitance on
   the platinum surface could be used to detect deposition at different
   conditions. It was observed from impedance data that double layer
   capacitance at pH = 3 did not change with particle mass loading.
   Modeling suggests that strong electrostatic repulsion at this pH keeps
   particles above the surface at equilibrium distances large enough that
   EIS cannot detect them. Significant changes in the double layer
   capacitance at pH = 10 were ascribed to surface blockage by particles.
   At pH = 5, a cathodic potential of -1 V vs. Ag/AgCl was utilized for
   particle detection. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{1-3}},

Abstract = {{The present study characterized the surface shear forces induced by
   sparging for different sparging conditions (i.e. continuous, alternating
   and pulse) and the membrane module configurations (i.e. spacing). The
   root mean square (RMS) of surface shear forces induced by gas sparging,
   which has been reported to be related to the extent of fouling control
   in membrane systems, were relatively similar for continuous, alternating
   and pulse sparging. Considering that pulse sparging uses approximately
   half of the volume of sparged gas than continuous or alternating
   sparging, the results suggest that pulse sparging is the best sparging
   approach. The RMS of surface shear forces were substantially higher for
   the wide module spacing than for the standard (i.e., narrow) module
   spacing, indicating that fouling control can likely be significantly
   improved by simply increasing the distance between the membrane modules.
   Because of the heterogeneous distribution of surface shear forces and
   sparged bubbles, it is essential to consider the hydrodynamic conditions
   throughout the system, rather than just those at the periphery, to
   optimize the sparging conditions and the module spacing.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The problem of best matching two point cloud data sets or,
   mathematically, identifying the best rigid-body transformation matrix
   between them, arises in many application areas such as geometric
   inspection and object recognition. Traditional methods establish the
   correspondence between the two data sets via the measure of shortest
   Euclidean distance and rely on an iterative procedure to converge to the
   solution. The effectiveness of such methods is highly dependent on the
   initial condition for the numerical iteration. This paper proposes a new
   robust scheme to automatically generate the needed initial matching
   condition. The initial matching scheme undertakes the alignment in a
   global manner and yields a rough match of the data sets. Instead of
   directly minimizing the distance measure between the data sets, the
   focus of the initial matching is on the alignment of shape features.
   This is achieved by evaluating Delaunay pole spheres for the point cloud
   data sets and analyzing their distributions to map out the intrinsic
   features of the underlying surface shape. The initial matching result is
   then fine-tuned by the final matching step via the traditional iterative
   closest point method. Case studies have been performed to validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed initial matching scheme.

Abstract = {{A systematic study of fly ash electrostatic beneficiation in a
   free-falling separation system was carried out to provide fundamental
   understanding of the separation efficiency for the design of a suitable
   process for industrial applications. The parameters investigated
   included feeding position, electric field strength, particle size and
   moisture content. Particles larger than 10 mu m presented the best
   separation efficiency among four different size fractions, whereas
   particles smaller than 44 mu m showed minimal separation. However.
   sonication treatments helped separation by liberating more carbon from
   ash particles, although particle sizes were reduced as well. Experiments
   also showed that exposure to moisture significantly altered charging
   behavior of fly ash and its subsequent separation due to more free
   mobile ion-induced charge exchanges. The optimal feeding position was
   found to be slightly on the side of the negative electrode, leading to a
   30\% reduction in loss-on-ignition (LOI) and a 45\% recovery in a single
   pass. A simplified mechanical model based on trajectory analysis for
   charged particles in an electrical field was in reasonable agreement
   with experimental results. (C) 2011 Chinese Society of Particuology and

Abstract = {{In this paper the operational and architectural flexibilities of a
   membraneless direct liquid fuel cell were demonstrated under aerobic and
   anaerobic configurations at 60 degrees C and 1 atm. The aerobic
   membraneless direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) was fed an anolyte
   solution of 1 M CH3OH/0.5 M H2SO4 and an air oxidant. The anaerobic
   membraneless direct methanol redox fuel cell (DMRFC) was fed an anolyte
   solution of 1 M CH3OH/0.1 M HClO4 and a catholyte solution of 2 M
   Fe(ClO4)(3) and 0.22 M Fe(ClO4)(2) oxidant. For both cases the
   membraneless architecture performed significantly better than for the
   conventional PEM architecture with Nafion (R) 117. The maximum power
   density for the membraneless and Nafion (R) 117 based DMFC was 52
   mW.cm(-2) and 41 mW.cm(-2) respectively. The maximum power density for
   the membraneless and Nafion (R) 117 based DMRFC was 46 mW.cm(-2) and 34
   mW.cm(-2) respectively. In addition, anaerobic operation using a
   Fe2+/Fe3+ catholyte gave similar performance to that for air as an
   oxidant. Both membraneless and anaerobic operation can result in
   significant cost reduction with improved operational flexibility. (C)

Abstract = {{This work presents new data to further develop the hydrate-based process
   for the separation of CH4 from the low-concentration coal mine methane
   gas (30 mol \% CH4/N-2) through the formation of tetra-n-butyl ammonium
   bromide (TBAB) semiclathrate hydrate. The TBAB semiclathrate hydrate
   formed from the 30 mol \% CH4/N-2 gas mixture has more favorable
   equilibrium conditions than the gas hydrate formed from the same gas
   mixture. The incipient equilibrium conditions at 0.17, 0.29, and 0.62
   mol \% TBAB were experimentally determined and reported. The experiments
   of forming TBAB semiclathrate hydrate from the 30 mol \% CH4/N-2 gas
   mixture were performed in both semibatch and batch operation under a
   fixed driving force of 3.5 MPa. The results indicate that CH4 is
   preferentially encaged into the TBAB hydrate. The use of a 0.29 mol \%
   TBAB solution is preferred over the 0.17 and 0.62 mol \% TBAB solutions.
   The semibatch operation is more effective than the batch operation for
   the separation of CH4 from the 30 mol \% CH4/N-2 gas mixture. The CH4
   recovery was found to be approximately 25\% at 0.29 mol \% TBAB
   concentration in the semibatch operation and the corresponding CH4
   concentration released from the TBAB hydrate was nearly 43 mol \%. A
   CH4-rich stream (70 mol \% CH4/N-2) was obtained after two stages of
   TBAB semiclathrate hydrate formation.}},

   secondary link may occasionally suffer from low signal levels, as if it
   is in deep fading. Employing space time coding for diversity does not
   help this situation. We show that a beamformer that is mutually
   orthogonal in time domain across the antennas is effective in mitigating
   the low signal effects. Further, N antennas provide an equivalent (N -
   1) x 1 Rayleigh channel due to the function of this beamformer. The
   effect of a non-orthogonal beamformer is also analyzed and shown by

   by appropriate response surfaces. These, in turn, are used to formulate
   explicit performance functions for the reliability analysis. Performance
   is studied in terms of peak inter-story drift, and polynomial functions
   are used to represent the seismic response surfaces. Non-performance
   probabilities are evaluated with respect to different performance
   expectations, using FORM and importance sampling methods. Case studies

Title = {{Modeling air pollutant emissions from Indian auto-rickshaws: Model
   development and implications for fleet emission rate estimates}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Chassis dynamometer tests were conducted on 40 Indian auto-rickshaws
   with 3 different fuel engine combinations operating on the Indian Drive
   Cycle (IDC). Second-by-second (1 Hz) data were collected and used to
   develop velocity-acceleration look-up table models for fuel consumption
   and emissions of CO2, CO, total hydrocarbons (THC), oxides of nitrogen
   (NOx) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) for each fuel engine
   combination. Models were constructed based on group-average vehicle
   activity and emissions data in order to represent the performance of a
   `typical' vehicle. The models accurately estimated full-cycle emissions
   for most species, though pollutants with more variable emission rates
   (e.g., PM2.5) were associated with larger errors. Vehicle emissions data
   showed large variability for single vehicles ('intra-vehicle
   variability') and within the test group ('inter-vehicle variability'),
   complicating the development of a single model to represent a vehicle
   population. To evaluate the impact of this variability, sensitivity
   analyses were conducted using vehicle activity data other than the IDC
   as model input. Inter-vehicle variability dominated the uncertainty in
   vehicle emission modeling. `Leave-one-out' analyses indicated that the
   model outputs were relatively insensitive to the specific sample of
   vehicles and that the vehicle samples were likely a reasonable
   representation of the Delhi fleet. Intra-vehicle variability in
   emissions was also substantial, though had a relatively minor impact on
   model performance. The models were used to assess whether the IDC, used
   for emission factor development in India, accurately represents
   emissions from on-road driving. Modeling based on Global Positioning
   System (GPS) activity data from real-world auto-rickshaws suggests that,
   relative to on-road vehicles in Delhi, the IDC systematically
   under-estimates fuel use and emissions; real-word auto-rickshaws consume
   15\% more fuel and emit 49\% more THC and 16\% more PM2.5. The models
   developed in this study can be used to further explore the impact of
   varying vehicle activity patterns on emissions in efforts to manage air
   quality and mitigate air pollution exposure and air pollution related
   health impacts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Vacuum-UV (VUV) photoinduced degradation of a model micropollutant,
   herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), was studied using a
   flow-through VUV photoreactor, operating in batch mode under kinetic
   control. Fast degradation rates were obtained using the VUV process,
   with 2,4-D concentrations lower than 1.5 mg L-1 being degraded by 90\%
   after receiving a total UV/VUV fluence of 938 mJ cm(-2). Experimental
   results showed that the initial degradation rate of 2,4-D in ultrapure
   water was independent of the initial concentration of the contaminant.
   The presence of alkalinity and NOM reduced the degradation rate by up to
   72\% due to the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect of
   carbonates/bicarbonates and NOM as well as their absorption of VUV
   radiation. The kinetics of the VUV induced degradation of 2,4-D in
   ultrapure water was also investigated through a kinetic model developed
   in this study. This model took into account the propagation and
   absorption of radiative energy in the reactor, generation of hydroxyl
   radicals via water photolysis, and interaction between photogenerated
   radicals and 2,4-D. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although titania is one of the most important metal oxide
   photocatalysts, its practical applications are to some extent limited by
   its relatively wide band gap. Doping TiO2 by metallic species has been
   expressed as a promising solution to decrease its band gap energy and
   enhance its photocatalytic performance. In this research, we employed
   micro arc oxidation technique to grow Ag-doped TiO2 porous layers where
   influence of the electrolyte composition and the applied voltage on the
   surface morphology, topography, phase structure, chemical composition,
   and optical properties was investigated for the first time. The
   photocatalytic efficiency of the layers was studied using different
   model materials namely methylene blue and 4-chlorophenol solutions as
   well as gaseous benzene. A porous morphology with a rough surface was
   revealed by the SEM and AFM techniques. The pore size varied depending
   on the voltage and the electrolyte concentration. Compositional studies,
   conducted by XRD and XPS methods, showed that the fabricated layers
   mainly consisted of anatase phases. A small amount of rutile phase was
   also detected at high voltages, i.e. 500 V. Considering the XRD
   patterns, the anatase average crystalline size was determined as 67.8
   and 21.5 nm for the pure TiO2 and silver doped TiO2 layers,
   respectively. A red-shift was observed in the absorbance edge of the
   layers when Ag was introduced into the titania lattice giving rise to a
   visible-light response. Comparing photocatalytic reaction rate constants
   of pure and Ag-doped titania, the doped layers exhibited more favorable
   potential to decompose the pollutants in aqueous phase under ultraviolet
   and visible lights. Moreover, the doped layers were useful to decompose
   the pollutants in gaseous phase under ultraviolet light. (C) 2011

   unidirectional carrier acceleration over the illuminated areas. We
   determine the characteristics of the generated CW-THz beam and show that
   the divergence of this beam is dependent on the spot size of the pump
   beams focused on the large-area photomixer. An illuminated area with
   dimensions much larger than the THz wavelength helps to eliminate the
   focusing optics for the THz beam. Additionally, we demonstrate that the
   THz beam radiated from the large-area photomixer is steerable by
   changing the incidence angles of the CW laser beams, as a result of
   which the phase distribution of the photocurrent along the contact
   stripes varies. In our experimental setup, the generated THz beam is
   steerable in the range of -30 to +30 degrees. (C) 2012 Optical Society

Abstract = {{Parameters like strength, moisture content, density and grain direction
   are important when sorting wood according to their individual
   properties. All those parameters can be correlated to microwave
   measurements of phase shift and attenuation. Measurements of phase shift
   and attenuation are, however, affected by the vicinity of a board edge.
   In this article a simulation of the measurement system is used to create
   a compensation function for the measurements taken close to edges as if
   those were taken where no effects of the board edge could be noticed. It
   is shown, by comparison with real measurements, that by doing this the
   deviation between the values measured close to the board edges and those
   measured in the middle of the board is decreased, meaning a higher
   accuracy can be achieved by using the compensating function. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{A method for registration of speckle-tracked freehand 3D ultrasound (US)
   to preoperative CT volumes of the spine is proposed. We register the US
   volume to the CT volume by creating individual US ``sub-volumes{''},
   each consisting of a small section of the entire US volume. The
   registration proceeds incrementally from the beginning of the US volume
   to the end, registering every sub-volume, where each sub-volume contains
   overlapping images with the previous sub-volume. Each registration is
   performed by generating simulated US images from the CT volume. As a
   by-product of our registration, the significant drift error common in
   speckle-tracked US volumes is corrected for. Results are validated
   through a phantom study of plastic spine phantoms created from clinical
   patient CT data as well as an animal study using a lamb cadaver. Results
   demonstrate that we were able to successfully register a speckle-tracked
   US volume to CT volume in four out of five phantoms with a success rate
   of greater than 98\%. The final error of the registered US volumes
   decreases by over 50 percent from the speckle tracking error to
   consistently below 3 mm. Studies on the lamb cadaver showed a mean
   registration error consistently below 2 mm. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The attainable resolution of inertial sensors is ultimately limited by
   the cumulated noise level generated in both the mechanical domain
   (mechano-thermal noise) and the frontend of the electrical readout
   circuit, provided that deterministic errors, such as quadrature errors
   in the case of gyroscopes. are kept under control. Improving the
   resolution performance of MEMS structures mounts to being able to either
   increase the minimum detectable signal through an increased sensitivity,
   or to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This paper reports on
   parametric amplification and damping employed in a MEMS gyroscope.
   Experiments confirm that parametric modulation through
   electro-mechanical coupling leads to both an increase in spectral
   selectivity and a reduction of the equivalent input noise angular rate
   (from 0.0046 degrees/(s root Hz) to 0.0026 degrees/(s root Hz) for a
   parametric gain of 5). In a more general analysis of a MEMS resonant
   structure, electro-mechanical parametric amplification decreases the
   mechano-thermal noise associated with the resonant mode motion - the
   equivalent input noise acceleration was diminished from 0.033 m s(-2) to
   0.022 m s(-2) for a parametric gain of 5. Either signal amplification or
   an attenuation of undesired signal components can be achieved by tuning
   the phase difference between the driving force and the parametric
   coupling. Therefore, the technique can be applied as well to reduce the
   quadrature error signal, which strongly constrains the maximum gain of
   the sensing circuit. Our experiments show a 2.2 improvement factor in
   SNR using a parametric amplification with a gain of 25. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The fate of inflows into lakes has been extensively studied during
   summer stratification but has seen relatively little focus during the
   weak winter stratification, with or without ice-cover. Field
   observations are presented of groundwater inflow into a shallow bay of a
   subarctic lake. Atmospheric forcing of the bay during the study period
   was extremely variable and coincided with spring ice-cover break-up. Two
   dominant wind regimes were identified; (1) weak wind-forcing (wind speed
   <5 m s(-1) or land-fast ice-cover), and (2) strong wind-forcing (wind
   speed >5 m s(-1) and open water). At a relatively constant temperature
   of similar to 3.3 degrees C, the groundwater inflow was closer to the
   temperature of maximum density than the water in the main body of the
   lake, which during the observed winter stratification is similar to 1.2
   degrees C. During weak wind-forcing, the stratification within Silfra
   Bay approximated two-layers as this denser groundwater formed a
   negatively buoyant underflow. A calculated underflow entrainment rate of
   2.8 x 10(-3) agrees well with other underflow studies. During strong
   wind-forcing, the water column out to the mouth of the bay became weakly
   stratified as the underflow was entrained vertically by wind-stirring.
   Observed periods of mixing can be predicted to occur when turbulent
   kinetic energy (TKE) production by wind stirring integrated over the
   underflow hydraulic residence time in the bay exceeds the potential
   energy associated with the stratification. A decrease of ice cover, as
   observed in the studied subarctic lake over the last decade, will result
   in the underflow being more frequently exposed to the strong
   wind-forcing regime during winter, thereby altering the winter
   distribution of groundwater inflow within the lake.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrodynamics of FLUID COKING (TM) units are investigated with
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The vaporisation of liquid feed is
   simulated by introducing limiting assumptions to simplify and bound the
   process: (a) liquid feed entirely vaporised at the entrance of the
   column; (b) liquid feed vaporised immediately upon contact with the coke
   particles; and (c) liquid coated uniformly on the particles, with vapour
   generated uniformly throughout the bed. Results predicted under these
   extreme scenarios are compared. Then, two cases with a relatively
   realistic description of liquidsolid interaction and feed vaporisation
   are simulated. The vaporisation rate is found to play an important role
   in affecting the flow hydrodynamics. Based on the local liquid-to-solid
   ratio and shear stress distribution, an agglomeration index is
   introduced to characterise the stability of agglomerates in the reactor.
   The vaporisation rate of liquid film on particles is shown to affect the
   distribution of the agglomeration index. The results indicate that a
   high vaporisation rate tends to decrease both agglomeration and stripper

Abstract = {{A model has been developed to predict the energy efficiency and annual
   operation cost for filters installed in an HVAC air handling system
   using filter data from standard ASHRAE 52.2-2007 filter tests. Thirty
   filters from six manufacturers were investigated to determine the most
   energy efficient and cost effective filtration solutions for an airport
   installation in Vancouver. Canada. A comparison of the output of the
   proposed model with the `kep' and Wattage methods was performed to
   highlight the possible differences in filter choice that would be made
   using alternative approaches. The outcomes have been shown to differ due
   to data not incorporated in the older models such as filtration
   efficiency and particulate concentration. The sensitivity of filter cost
   to model parameters was also studied. It was found that the
   concentration of particles in the air stream and the cost of electricity
   had the largest effect on annual cost of operation. Increasing the
   concentration of particles in the air stream increases the cost of
   operating the filter and causes the installation of a prefilter upstream
   of the primary filter to be more economically attractive. Increasing
   electricity cost also increases the operation cost but has the reverse
   effect on attractiveness of prefilter installations. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, a hierarchical optimal robust controller is presented for
   the power system load-frequency control problem. In this approach, the
   multi-area power system is first decomposed into several sub-systems
   (areas). Then by using a two-level control strategy, the overall optimal
   solution is obtained. At the first level, the optimal control of each
   area is obtained with respect to local information and also considering
   interactions coming from other areas. At the second level, by using a
   coordination strategy, the local controllers will converge to global
   solution and optimal robust controller is achieved. This approach is
   applicable to both single-area and multi-area interconnected power
   systems. Simulation results show the effectiveness and optimality of the
   proposed robust controller in power systems.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of permeability in Al-4.5 wt\% Cu during equiaxed
   dendritic solidification has been determined through physical and
   numerical modelling for solid fractions from 0.35 to 0.8. Cast samples
   solidified with a variety of cooling rates and quenched at different
   stages during dendritic solidification were used to generate 3D
   geometries of solidifying microstructure using x-ray microtomography.
   The permeability was then characterized (i) physically by passing
   glycerin through large-scale analogues of the microstructure and (ii)
   numerically by solving the continuity and momentum equations for the
   corresponding unstructured meshes of the 3D geometries used for the
   physical models. The numerically determined values of permeability are
   in good agreement with those measured and within the scatter of related
   studies. The permeability results have been compared with the
   Carman-Kozeny expression to determine the value of the Carman-Kozeny
   constant. Moreover, the correlation of secondary dendrite arm spacing
   and solid/liquid interfacial area per unit volume of solid with
   solidification time has been investigated for use as a practical means

Abstract = {{The melt fracture instabilities of two broad molecular weight
   distribution (MWD) high-density polyethylenes (one Ziegler-Natta and one
   metallocene HDPEs) are studied as functions of the temperature and
   geometrical details and type of die (cylindrical, slit, and annular). It
   is found that sharkskin and other melt fracture phenomena are distinctly
   different for these resins, despite their almost identical rheology. It
   is also found that the critical conditions for the onset of various melt
   fracture phenomena depend significantly on the type of die used for
   their study. For example, sharkskin melt fracture in slit and capillary
   extrusion was obtained at much small critical shear stress values
   compared with those found in annular extrusion. Moreover, the
   metallocene HDPE shows significant slip at the die wall in the sharkskin
   flow regime. On the other hand, the Ziegler-Natta HDPE has shown no sign
   of slip. These differences are discussed on the basis of differences in
   their MWDs that influence their melt elasticity. POLYM. ENG. SCI.,

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{There is considerable experimental evidence that the classical no-slip
   boundary condition of fluid mechanics is not always a valid assumption
   for the flow of high molecular weight molten polymers. In fact, molten
   polymers slip macroscopically at solid surfaces when the wall shear
   stress exceeds a critical value. Moreover, for linear polymers there
   exists a second critical wall shear stress value at which a transition
   from a weak to a strong slip occurs. These two modes of slip (weak and
   strong) are due to flow-induced chain detachment/desorption at the
   polymer/wall interface and to chain disentanglement of the polymer
   chains in the bulk from a monolayer of polymer chains adsorbed at the
   interface. In this review, the two physical mechanisms of slip are
   discussed and validated on the basis of published experimental data. The
   slip velocity of molten polymers is a complex function and has been
   reported to depend on wall shear and normal stresses, temperature, and
   molecular characteristics of polymers (molecular weight and its
   distribution). Proposed slip models, static and dynamic, are also
   reviewed and their significance on the rheology and flow simulations of
   molten polymers is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effects of shear, uniaxial extension and temperature on the

   Shear and uniaxial extension experiments were performed at temperatures
   below and well above the peak melting point of the polyethylenes in
   order to characterize their flow-induced crystallization behavior at
   rates relevant to processing (elongational rates up to 30 s (-aEuro
   parts per thousand 1) and shear rates 1 to 1,000 s (-aEuro parts per
   thousand 1) depending on the application). Generally, strain and strain
   rate found to enhance crystallization in both shear and elongation. In
   particular, extensional flow was found to be a much stronger stimulus
   for polymer crystallization compared to shear. At temperatures well
   above the melting peak point (up to 25A degrees C), polymer crystallized
   under elongational flow, while there was no sign of crystallization
   under simple shear. A modified Kolmogorov crystallization model

Abstract = {{The wall slip and melt fracture behaviour of several commercial
   polylactides (PLAs) as well as their rheological properties under shear
   and extensional have been investigated. The PLAs have had weight-average
   molecular weights in the range of 10(4)-10(5) g/mol and studied in the
   temperature range of 160-200A degrees C. The solution properties and
   linear viscoelastic behaviour of melts indicate linear microstructure
   behaviour. PLAs with molecular weights greater than a certain value were
   found to slip, with the slip velocity to increase with decrease of
   molecular weight. The capillary data were found to agree well with
   linear viscoelastic envelope once correction for slip effects was
   applied. The onset of melt fracture for the high molecular weight PLAs
   was found to occur at about 0.2 to 0.3 MPa, depending on the geometrical
   characteristics of the dies and independent of temperature. Addition of
   0.5 wt.\% of a polycaprolactone (PCL) into the PLA that exhibits melt
   fracture was found to be effective in eliminating and delaying the onset
   of melt fracture to higher shear rates. This is due to significant

Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{443-450}},

Abstract = {{The use of shrinkage reducing admixture (SRA) at various concentrations
   was investigated in fiber reinforced cementitious composites. Both
   mortar and high strength concrete (HSC) matrices were tested. Two types
   of fibers-steel and polypropylene-were assessed. The effect of SRA was
   measured on the fundamental properties such as surface tension of the
   bulk fluids and the contact angle developed between the fibers and the
   bulk fluids, on the fresh properties such as the air content and the
   density, and finally on the hardened mechanical properties, specially
   the flexural behaviors. It was noted that SRA enhances the wettability
   of fibers and reduces the air content of fiber reinforced cement
   mortars, while critical SRA concentrations are existing. SRA with
   critical concentration can significantly improve the flexural toughness
   and residual strength of steel fiber reinforced cement mortar. In the
   case of polypropylene fiber, SRA is not as effective in enhancing the
   flexural behaviors as it is in the case of steel fiber. SRA is generally
   ineffective in reducing the air content of HSC and the properties of
   steel fiber reinforced HSC with SRA are inferior to those without SRA.

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Object. To avoid the cost of bone graft substitutes and the morbidity of
   iliac crest bone graft retrieval, locally harvested vertebral body bone
   has been used to fill interbody cages. When marginal hypertrophic
   osteophytes are used, there is little impact on the adjacent vertebrae,
   but when cancellous bone is removed from the central part of the
   vertebral body, it is not clear how significantly this procedure weakens
   the vertebra. The objective of this study was to investigate the
   immediate mechanical response of the cervical spine after removing bone
   from the central vertebral body.
   Methods. Fourteen cervical functional spinal units (FSUs) (mean age 73.3
   years, range 63-90 years) were used. For each FSU, bone mineral density
   (BMD) was determined using lateral-view dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
   studies. The FSUs were assigned to 1 of 2 groups (test group or control
   group) with an equal distribution of BMD. All specimens received a cage
   placed into the cleaned disc space. The specimens from the test group
   had a 5-mm-diameter bone plug removed from the vertebral bodies superior
   and inferior to the cage-fitted disc. The specimens were loaded in
   flexion-compression until failure via an eccentric compressive force at
   0.25 mm/second.
   Results. The yield compression strength was 1149 +/- 523 N for the test
   group and 1647 +/- 962 N for the control group (p = 0.25). The ultimate
   compression strength was 1699 +/- 498 N for the test group and 2450 N
   +/- 835 N for the control group (p = 0.06). Force at 4 mm displacement
   was 1064 N for the test group and 1574 N for the control group (p =
   0.15). Displacement at yield compression strength was 4.4 mm for the
   test group and 4.2 mm for the control group (p = 0.78). There was no
   significant intergroup difference for any of the studied parameters.
   Conclusions. There does not appear to be a significant early
   biomechanical weakening of adjacent vertebrae caused by aforementioned
   technique of local bone harvest.

Abstract = {{The corrosion behaviour of Nb was studied in phosphate buffered saline
   (PBS) solutions at a presence of 0-6 g L-1 bovine serum albumin (BSA).
   Addition of BSA to PBS solutions lowered the open circuit potential
   (OCP). OCP, polarization resistance and impedance increased over
   immersion time. The adsorption process of BSA on Nb surface was found to
   be faster than that of the PO43-. According to X-ray Photoelectron
   Spectroscopy (XPS) a competitive adsorption between PO43- and BSA was in
   effect during the immersion process. Based on the analysis of effective
   capacitances, a surface distribution of time-constants was proposed. (C)

Abstract = {{In a digital motion control system, there exist timing variations in
   feedback sampling and control updating, often referred to as sampling
   jitter and control jitter. Although jitter has been studied in prior
   art, no equations or quantitative experimental results have been
   reported which relate jitter to positioning error in a motion control
   system. To investigate the effect of jitter on positioning error, this
   paper presents a simplified discrete model that captures sampling and
   control jitter's interaction with other system inputs as disturbances to
   the control system. Based on this model, analyses are carried out for
   the scenarios of position regulation and cominand tracking, each
   resulting in an equation to predict jitter's effect on positioning error
   using measured or analytical frequency responses of the system. Further.
   an easily implementable add-on jitter compensator is proposed to
   mitigate the regulation error due to jitter without affecting the
   existing controller. Through experiments performed on a fast-tool servo
   machine tool, the model and analyses are validated and the positioning
   degradation due to jitter is clearly demonstrated. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Over a 7 month period, temperatures were monitored in six large scale
   (approximately 4500 metric tons) silos for wood pellet storage. Each
   silo had 124 temperature sensors mounted on cables for an even
   distribution within the volume. During the study, silos were charged and
   discharged several times, creating different scenarios. Under certain
   circumstances, pellet temperatures increased vertically from bottom to
   top in an additive way, and temperatures around 65-70 degrees C were
   reached at the top of the silos. At some occasions, temperatures were
   increasing uncontrollably and silos were emptied due to the risk of
   fire. In an additive scenario, a maximum heat front velocity of 12 cm/h
   and a maximum temperature increment for a specific sensor of 2.4 degrees
   C/h was found. To avoid condensation of moisture from the ventilation
   air on stored pellets fan operation is suggested to be controlled by a
   dew point algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Influence of zirconia framework thickness on residual stress profile in
   veneering ceramic: Measurement by hole-drilling}},
Journal = {{DENTAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{378-384}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. Framework design is reported to influence chipping in
   zirconia-based restorations, which is an important cause of failure of
   such restorations. Residual stress profile in the veneering ceramic
   after the manufacturing process is an important predictive factor of the
   mechanical behavior of the material. The objective of this study is to
   investigate the influence of framework thickness on the stress profile
   measured in zirconia-based structures.
   Methods. The stress profile was measured with the hole-drilling method
   in bilayered disc samples of 20 mm diameter with a 1.5 mm thick
   veneering ceramic layer. Six different framework thicknesses from 0.5 mm
   to 3 mm were studied. Two different cooling procedures were also
   investigated.
   Results. Compressive stresses were observed in the surface, and tensile
   stresses in the depth of most of the samples. The slow cooling procedure
   was found to promote the development of interior tensile stresses,
   except for the sample with a 3 mm thick framework. With the tempering
   procedure, samples with a 1.5 mm thick framework exhibited the most
   favorable stress profile, while thicker and thinner frameworks exhibited
   respectively in surface or interior tensile stresses. Significance: The
   measurements performed highlight the importance of framework thickness,
   which determine the nature of stresses and can explain clinical failures
   encountered, especially with thin frameworks. The adequate ratio between
   veneering ceramic and zirconia is hard to define, restricting the range
   of indications of zirconia-based restorations until a better
   understanding of such a delicate veneering process is achieved. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Recent traffic safety research has advocated the use of the Full Bayes
   (FB) approach to conduct controlled before-after safety evaluations. The
   FB approach was shown to offer both methodological and data advantages.
   However, there is still a lack of complete understanding of the role
   that the model parameters play in the formulation of treatment
   effectiveness. This paper offers a novel approach to compute components
   related to direct and indirect treatment effects under a linear
   intervention model for the Safety Performance Function (SPF). The
   isolation of a component corresponding to the direct treatment effects
   enables the analyst to assess the effectiveness of the countermeasures
   apart from local (site-related) environmental factors. Two case studies
   are used to demonstrate the approach. The first case study is based on
   the results published from a previous safety evaluation in Iowa and the
   second uses a new data set from British Columbia based on the Insurance
   Corporation of British Columbia Road Improvement Program. The various
   direct and indirect components have yielded valuable insight into the
   effects of the model parameters on treatment impacts. Moreover, the
   calculation of the treatment effectiveness indices have been simplified
   by providing straightforward equations in terms of model parameters for
   the computation of their components without resorting to additional
   algorithms. More importantly, the results can have a significant impact
   on the economic evaluation of safety programs and countermeasures by
   allowing the calculation of collision modification factors (CMFs) that
   vary with time. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new method for stability analysis of a
   bidirectional dual full-bridge dc-dc converter with triple phase-shift
   control under arbitrary parameter changes. The present analysis makes
   the stability determination of these power converters more systematic
   and precise than the existing methods in this field, which are largely
   based on simulation. Nonlinear and periodic operation of the
   bidirectional converter is presented including the control circuit.
   Using the working theory, the converter operation is separated into
   several stages. Equivalent circuits and state equations are developed
   for each stage. The Lyapunov function method is used to determine the
   stability of the converter in every stage. Justification is provided for
   the absence of abrupt changes of the state variables or infinite noise
   at the interface of different stages. The stability of the bidirectional
   converter is determined theoretically by integrating these concepts.
   Some simulation results are provided to validate the developments.}},

Abstract = {{Unsupported, high surface area MoP was synthesized by adding citric acid
   (CA) to solutions of ammonium heptamolybdate and diammonium hydrogen
   phosphate followed by drying (397 K), calcination (773-973 K), and
   reduction in H-2 (923 K). A tetrameric Mo citrate precursor was formed
   after drying which decomposed into a monomer of the form,
   Mo(C4H5O3CN)O-2 center dot HPO4 following calcination. Reduction of this
   monomer produced CH4, CO, CO2, NH3, H2O, and MoP. The C content of the
   reduced MoP-CA catalysts decreased from 12.8 to 4.0 wt\% as the
   calcination temperature increased from 773 to 973 K, whereas the surface
   area decreased from 136 m(2)/g to 53 m(2)/g and the MoP particle size
   increased from 5 to 9 nm, respectively. The residual C acted as a
   structural promoter of the calcined samples, limiting agglomeration of
   the MoP crystallites during reduction so that nanoparticles (5-9 nm) of
   MoP were produced. The HDO of 4-methylphenol over the MoP-CA catalysts
   was found to be structure insensitive with an initial turnover frequency
   (TOF) of 0.079 s(-1) at 623 K and 4.4 MPa H-2. The ratio of
   hydrogenation to direct deoxygenation of 4-methylphenol (TOFHYD:TOFDDO =
   0.78:1) was independent of the MoP particle size and greater than that

Abstract = {{The scale-up of thickening parameters from laboratory to industrial

   none is free of criticism. In order to clarify these issue, in this work
   flotation tailings from one of the major Chilean copper mines was
   subjected to flocculation-settling tests with Orifloc-2010
   polycarylamide in a Couette type reactor. By varying the shear rate from
   100 to 2000 {[}s(-1)] the solid concentration from 1 to 15 {[}\% by
   volume] and the flocculant dosage from 0 to 20 {[}g/ton] it was shown
   that an important interaction exists between these variables. At the
   optimal flocculant dosage, the optimal suspension concentration and the
   optimal flocculation time, an increase by 50\% in the solid flux density
   function is possible when the shear rate of gamma = 100{[}s(-1)] is
   changed to the optimum value of around gamma approximate to
   400{[}s(-1)]. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of pancreatic duct-like CK19+ cells has implications
   for multiple disease states including pancreatic cancer and diabetes
   mellitus. The in vitro study of this important cell type has been
   hampered by their limited expansion compared to fibroblast-like
   vimentin+ cells that overgrow primary cultures. We aimed to develop a
   screening platform for duct cell mitogens after depletion of the
   vimentin+ population. The CD90 cell surface marker was used to remove
   the vimentin+ cells from islet-depleted human pancreas cell cultures by
   magnetic-activated cell sorting. Cell sorting decreased CD90+ cell
   contamination of the cultures from 34 +/- 20\% to 1.3 +/- 0.6\%,
   yielding purified CK19+ cultures with epithelial morphology. A
   full-factorial experimental design was then applied to test the
   mitogenic effects of bFGF, EGF, HGF, KGF and VEGF. After 6 days in test
   conditions, the cells were labelled with BrdU, stained and analyzed by
   high-throughput imaging. This screening assay confirmed the expected
   mitogenic effects of bFGF, EGF, HGF and KGF on CK19+ cells and
   additionally revealed interactions between these factors and VEGF. A
   serum-free medium containing bFGF, EGF, HGF and KGF led to CK19+ cell
   expansion comparable to the addition of 10\% serum. The methods
   developed in this work should advance pancreatic cancer and diabetes
   research by providing effective cell culture and high-throughput
   screening platforms to study purified primary pancreatic CK19+ cells.}},

   dominant longitudinal mode with a side-mode suppression ratio of 8 dB
   has been obtained across a broad spectral range of over 130 nm. The
   selected mode shows an out-of-band-rejection ratio of 19 dB and a

   grating-assisted couplers for mode selectivity can be applied to other

Abstract = {{We use constant energy, constant volume (NVE) molecular dynamics
   simulations to study the dissociation of the fully occupied structure I
   methane hydrate in a confined geometry between two hydroxylated silica
   surfaces between 36 and 41 angstrom apart, at initial temperatures of
   283, 293, and 303 K. Simulations of the two-phase hydrate/water system
   are performed in the presence of silica, with and without a 3 angstrom
   thick buffering water layer between the hydrate phase and silica
   surfaces. Faster decomposition is observed in the presence of silica,
   where the hydrate phase is prone to decomposition from four surfaces, as
   compared to only two sides in the case of the hydrate/water simulations.
   The existence of the water layer between the hydrate phase and the
   silica surface stabilizes the hydrate phase relative to the case where
   the hydrate is in direct contact with silica. Hydrates bound between the
   silica surfaces dissociate layer-by-layer in a shrinking core manner
   with a curved decomposition front which extends over a 5-8 angstrom
   thickness. Labeling water molecules shows that there is exchange of
   water molecules between the surrounding liquid and intact cages in the
   methane hydrate phase. In all cases, decomposition of the methane
   hydrate phase led to the formation of methane nanobubbles in the liquid
   water phase.}},

Abstract = {{Coupling of dehydrogenation of ethylbezene with hydrogenation of
   nitrobenzene in a catalytic membrane reactor can lead to a significant
   improvement in the conversion of ethylbenzene and production of styrene.
   In this work, the homogeneous reactor model for a cocurrent flow
   configuration is compared to two heterogeneous models based on the
   Fickian diffusion model and the dusty gas model for both isothermal and
   non-isothermal pellets. It is observed that both heterogeneous models
   predict a significant drop in yield and conversion compared to the
   homogeneous model, indicating the importance of heterogeneity. This drop
   is generally less severe for the dusty gas model than for the Fickian
   diffusion model. The assumption of isothermality causes larger
   deviations than the assumption of Fickian diffusion. The deviations in
   the predictions of the homogenous model and the heterogeneous models
   from those of the dusty gas model for non-isothermal pellets are similar
   to 6\% and similar to 11\%, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Wood pellets made from sawdust and shavings are white in color and low

   pellets. Both wet (steam) and dry thermal (torrefaction) treatments of
   biomass darken the pellets. The off-color pellets have a lower
   commercial value than white wood pellets in residential applications. In
   this research, ground white wood (western Douglas fir, Pseudotsuga
   menziesii L.) was treated with saturated steam at 200 degrees C and 220
   degrees C for 5 and 10 min. The colors of the treated and untreated
   powders and pellets were evaluated. The Hunter color coordinates L{*},

   Compared to untreated samples, the steam-treated samples became darker;
   the hues shifted from red to green and from blue to yellow Multi-linear
   regression models of three color coordinates with elemental composition

Abstract = {{The behavior of ascending bubbles is of fundamental importance for
   understanding many natural and artificial phenomena. In this study, the
   unsteady motion of a single spherical air bubble rising in a stationary
   viscous liquid has been studied for low Reynolds numbers. Bubble rising
   under the in?uence of gravitational force is one of the most common
   gasliquid flow phenomena. Understanding the dynamic interaction between
   the phases is an important key for the design and operation of
   industrial applications. A particular instance of this situation occurs
   in gasliquid column reactors. The equation of motion included an
   additional mass term and neglected the Basset term. An exact solution is
   derived for instantaneous velocity using a series-based technique,
   called the differential transformation method (DTM), and the
   acceleration and position of the bubble were determined. A general
   solution of the equation was obtained, and also for several practical
   conditions with air as the gas phase and glycerin solutions of different
   concentrations as liquid phase. The results obtained demonstrate the
   effectiveness of using DTM and promote a new application of this
   powerful analytical tool for solving nonlinear problems in two-phase
   flows. Copyright (C) 2010 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley

Abstract = {{Vertically orientated TiO2 nanotube array with diameters ranging from 60
   up to 80 nm and length of 4 mu m was grown on titanium by anodization.
   Crack initiation, propagation and saturation were studied using the

   modifies the interfaces. With the increase of tensile strain, cracks in
   TiO2 nanotube films propagate rapidly and reach the saturation within a
   narrow strain gap. Interfacial shear strengths of TiO2 nanotube films
   without annealing, with 250 degrees C annealing and with 400 degrees C
   annealing can be estimated as 163.3, 370.2 and 684.5 MPa, respectively.
   The critical energy release rates of TiO2 nanotube films are calculated

Abstract = {{The quality of channel state information (CSI) plays a significant role
   in the performance of relay selection (RS) schemes in cooperative
   communications. Particularly in a highly mobile environment when there
   exists delay between the selection and data transmission instants, the
   quality of CSI often degrades, given to what is known as outdated CSI
   phenomena. In this paper, we first outline several single RS schemes
   that achieve full diversity when using perfect CSI and prove that the
   diversity order of these schemes reduces to unity if outdated CSI
   exists. To deal with the performance deterioration due to the outdated
   CSI phenomena, we propose a new multiple RS scheme for both
   amplify-and-forward (AaF) and decode-and-forward (DaF) relay systems,
   namely, the N plus normalized threshold opportunistic RS (N + NT-ORS).
   In particular, we first opportunistically select N best relays from all
   candidate relays with respect to end-to-end signal-to-noise ratios
   (SNRs) for AaF and relay-to-destination SNRs for DaF. Then, the ratios
   of the SNRs on the rest of the candidate relays to that of the Nth
   highest SNR are tested against a normalized threshold mu is an element
   of {[}0, 1], and only those relays passing this test are selected in
   addition to the N best relays. The performance of the scheme is
   theoretically analyzed in terms of outage probability, and its
   asymptotic diversity order is also examined. In addition, we outline a
   distributed N + NT-ORS selection protocol that makes no assumption of
   the global CSI at each relay. Numerical results confirm the analysis and
   show the advantage of the proposed scheme against existing counterparts
   in highly dynamic networks.}},

Abstract = {{Transmit antenna selection with receive maximal-ratio combining
   (TAS/MRC) and transmit antenna selection with receive selection
   combining (TAS/SC) are two attractive multiple-input-multiple-output
   (MIMO) protocols. In this paper, we present a framework for the
   comparative analysis of TAS/MRC and TAS/SC in a two-hop
   amplify-and-forward relay network. In doing so, we derive exact and
   asymptotic expressions for the symbol error rate (SER) in Nakagami-m
   fading. Using the asymptotic expressions, the SNR gap between the two
   protocols is quantified. Given that the two protocols maintain the same
   diversity order, we show that the SNR gap is entirely dependent on the
   array gain. Motivated by this, we derive the SNR gap as a simple ratio
   of the respective array gains of the two protocols. This ratio
   explicitly takes into account the impact of the number of antennas and
   the fading severity parameter m. In addition, we address the fundamental
   question of ``How to allocate the total transmit power between the
   source and the relay in such a way that the SER is minimized?{''} Our
   answer is given in the form of new compact expressions for the power
   allocation factor, which is a practical design tool that optimally
   distributes the total transmit power in the network.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the outage probability and average bit error rate (BER)
   of a dual-hop fixed gain relaying system in the presence of interference
   and noise at the relay and destination. Our analysis assumes Nakagami-m
   fading for the source-relay, relay-destination, and interfering
   channels. We present new closed-form/series expressions for the outage
   probability, as well as the average BER. It is concluded that the
   presence of interference results in a floor point in both outage and BER
   performance. This floor point holds for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   values higher than a certain threshold such that the larger the
   difference between the received powers of the useful and interfering
   signals, the higher the SNR value at which this floor point commences.
   Moreover, it is shown that the performance is practically not affected
   by the Nakagami-m shape parameter of the fading at the interfering link.}},

Abstract = {{Raman microspectroscopy is a quantitative instrumental method with
   considerable promise for the nondestructive analysis of living
   biological samples. Amongst samples of particular interest are human
   embryonic stem cells because of their therapeutic potential and because
   examination using Raman microspectroscopy does not appear to adversely
   affect this potential. However, it can be difficult to compare different
   spectra obtained with this technique and to quantify the native cellular
   constituents of such samples because their characteristic dimensions are
   difficult to establish or may vary from point to point. We present here
   a method to normalize spectra and estimate sample thicknesses based on a
   reference component present in the basal cell culture medium when we
   perform spectroscopy on colonies of living cells. Because more basal
   medium is displaced from the sampling volume as the cell layer increases
   in thickness, and because this component is present in the medium but
   excluded from cells, a concomitant decline therefore occurs in the
   intensity of the Raman scattering from the reference component. This
   permits comparisons between samples because their spectra can be scaled
   in inverse relation to their excluded volumes. Furthermore, estimations
   of sample thicknesses can also be obtained based on the same concept.
   Thus, the absolute quantification of cellular components becomes
   possible because cell sample volumes can be determined. Although applied
   to human embryonic stem cells, the approach is sufficiently general to
   be adapted for use with other samples. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{We aim to compute the movement of permanent stranded implant
   brachytherapy radioactive sources (seeds) in the prostate from the
   planned seed distribution to the intraoperative fluoroscopic
   distribution, and then to the postimplant computed tomography (CT)
   distribution. We present a novel approach to matching the seeds in these
   distributions to the plan by grouping the seeds into needle tracks.
   First, we identify the implantation axis using a sample consensus
   algorithm. Then, we use a network flow algorithm to group seeds into
   their needle tracks. Finally, we match the needles from the three stages
   using both their transverse plane location and the number of seeds per
   needle. We validated our approach on eight clinical prostate
   brachytherapy cases, having a total of 871 brachytherapy seeds
   distributed in 193 needles. For the intraoperative and postimplant data,
   99.31\% and 99.41\% of the seeds were correctly assigned, respectively.
   For both the preplan to fluoroscopic and fluoroscopic to CT
   registrations, 100\% of the needles were correctly matched. We show that
   there is an average intraoperative seed displacement of 4.94 +/- 2.42 mm
   and a further 2.97 +/- 1.81 mm of postimplant movement. This information
   reveals several directional trends and can be used for quality control,
   treatment planning, and intraoperative dosimetry that fuses ultrasound
   and fluoroscopy.}},

   assumption, we propose hybrid relay selection (HRS) for relays with
   buffers of finite size. HRS is a combination of conventional best relay
   selection (BRS) and MMRS and takes into account both the channel state
   and the buffer state for relay selection. We provide a comprehensive
   analysis of the outage and symbol error probabilities of both MMRS and
   HRS for a decode-and-forward protocol in Rayleigh fading. This analysis
   reveals that BRS, HRS, and MMRS achieve the same diversity gain.
   However, for N relays, MMRS achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain
   of 3(1-1/N) dB compared to BRS, and HRS closely approaches the SNR gain
   of MMRS for moderate buffer sizes (e. g. 30 transmission intervals).}},

   typically applied to three-dimensional data to obtain the input
   two-dimensional data set used in many inversion algorithms. The improved
   transfer function uses a uniform expansion that directly includes the

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a before-after (BA) safety evaluation
   of a newly proposed design for channelized right-turn lanes. The new
   design, termed ``Smart Channels{''}, decreases the angle of the
   channelized right turn to approximately 70 degrees. The implementation
   of these modified right-turn channels is usually advocated to allow for
   safer pedestrian crossing. However, the benefits also extend to
   vehicle-vehicle interactions since the new approach angle affords
   drivers a better view of the traffic stream they are to merge with. The
   evaluation is conducted using a video-based automated traffic conflict
   analysis. There are several advantages that support the adoption of
   traffic conflict techniques in BA safety studies. Traffic conflicts are
   more frequent than road collisions and are of marginal social cost, they
   provide insight into the failure mechanism that leads to road
   collisions, and BA studies based on traffic conflicts can be conducted
   over shorter periods. As well, the use of automated conflict analysis
   overcomes the reliability and repeatability problems usually associated
   with manual conflict observations. Data for three treatment
   intersections and one control intersection in Penticton, British
   Columbia, are used in this study. The results of the evaluation show
   that the implementation of the right-turn treatment has resulted in a
   considerable reduction in the severity and frequency of merging,
   rear-end, and total conflicts. The total average hourly conflict was
   reduced by about 51\% while the average conflict severity was reduced by
   41\%. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Measuring safety treatment effects using full Bayes non-linear safety
   performance intervention functions}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{152-163}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Full Bayes linear intervention models have been recently proposed to
   conduct before-after safety studies. These models assume linear slopes
   to represent the time and treatment effects across the treated and
   comparison sites. However, the linear slope assumption can only furnish
   some restricted treatment profiles. To overcome this problem, a
   first-order autoregressive (AR1) safety performance function (SPF) that
   has a dynamic regression equation (known as the Koyck model) is
   proposed. The non-linear `Koyck' model is compared to the linear
   intervention model in terms of inference, goodness-of-fit, and
   application. Both models were used in association with the
   Poisson-lognormal (PLN) hierarchy to evaluate the safety performance of
   a sample of intersections that have been improved in the Greater
   Vancouver area. The two models were extended by incorporating random
   parameters to account for the correlation between sites within
   comparison-treatment pairs. Another objective of the paper is to compute
   basic components related to the novelty effects, direct treatment
   effects, and indirect treatment effects and to provide simple
   expressions for the computation of these components in terms of the
   model parameters. The Koyck model is shown to furnish a wider variety of
   treatment profiles than those of the linear intervention model. The
   analysis revealed that incorporating random parameters among matched
   comparison-treatment pairs in the specification of SPFs can
   significantly improve the fit, while reducing the estimates of the
   extra-Poisson variation. Also, the proposed PLN Koyck model fitted the
   data much better than the Poisson-lognormal linear intervention (PLNI)
   model. The novelty effects were short lived, the indirect (through
   traffic volumes) treatment effects were approximately within 10\%,
   whereas the direct treatment effects indicated a non-significant 6.5\%
   reduction during the after period under PLNI compared to a significant
   12.3\% reduction in predicted collision counts under the PLN Koyck
   model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1093-1100}},

Abstract = {{Bone is a tough biological material. It is generally accepted that
   bone's toughness arises from its unique hierarchical structure, which in
   turn facilitates distributed microcracking prior to fracture. Yet, there
   has been limited progress on the detailed roles of the structural
   elements in the microcracking process. The present study examines the
   structure-microcracking relations at the lamellar and sub-lamellar
   levels of human cortical bone subjected to compressive loading. Laser
   scanning confocal microscopy revealed a clear influence of the local
   structure and porosity of the Haversian systems' lamellae on microcrack
   development. In particular, crack initiation and growth under transverse
   compression were associated with stress concentration at canaliculi.
   Later stages of microcracking showed extensive sub-lamellar cracks
   forming cross-hatched patterns and regularly spaced 0.5-1.7 mu m apart.
   The density, size and regularity of the crack patterns suggest enhanced
   inelastic deformation capacity through cracking control at the level of
   mineralized collagen fibril bundles. The present study thus improves the
   current understanding of the nature of inelastic deformation and
   microcracking in bone and further suggests that bone's resistance to
   fracture is achieved through microcrack control at multiple length
   scales. (c) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A new two-dimensional (2D) optimum distribution of carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs) in the longitudinal and thickness directions of a polymer
   composite micro-beam is obtained to achieve its highest fundamental
   natural frequency given a weight percent (wt.\%) of CNTs. To this end,
   optimum distribution patterns are first studied individually in the
   longitudinal and the thickness directions by dividing the micro-beam
   into multiple segments and multiple layers, respectively. It is assumed
   that each segment/layer is made of low-viscosity, thermosetting
   polyester epoxy/amine resin LY-5052 and reinforced by multi-walled
   carbon nanotubes. A user-defined code, written in the Python language,
   is compiled with ABAQUS to generate a three-dimensional finite element
   model of the micro-beam and subsequently to evaluate the optimum CNT
   distributions under various boundary conditions. It is found that
   fundamental frequencies of the clamped-free, clamped-guided and
   clamped-clamped micro-beams can be enhanced up to 19.5\%, 16.8\% and
   14.8\%, respectively, by choosing the 2D optimum CNT distribution
   profile along the longitudinal and the thickness directions of the
   micro-beam. The results also reveal that the 1D through-axis and 2D
   optimal CNT distribution patterns depend on the type of boundary
   condition applied. However, the optimum through-thickness distribution
   pattern is found to be independent of the type of boundary condition,
   which can be of high value for practical applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Lack of corrosion resistance of structural steel has resulted in many
   structural failures. Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) bar is emerging as a
   viable solution to replace steel to mitigate corrosion problems. Since
   FRP is a brittle material, it can bring about catastrophic sudden
   structural failures. Conversely, post-earthquake recovery of structures
   is another prime objective for performance based seismic design. Shape
   memory alloy (SMA) has the unique ability to undergo large inelastic
   deformation and regain its undeformed shape through stress removal. Here
   a hybrid reinforced concrete (RC) column configuration is presented in
   order to reduce permanent damages, and enhance its corrosion resistance
   capacity where the plastic hinge region will be reinforced with SMA or
   stainless steel and the remaining regions with FRP or stainless steel
   rebar. An analytical investigation has been carried out to develop such
   hybrid RC columns and analyze them under seismic loadings. The results
   are compared in terms of base shear-tip displacement, base shear
   demand/capacity ratio, ductility, residual displacement, and energy
   dissipation capacity to those of a similar RC column reinforced with
   stainless steel. The results indicate that such corrosion resistant
   hybridized column can substantially reduce the residual displacement
   with adequate energy dissipation capacity during earthquakes. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The effect of the spatial distribution of crystallographic orientations
   on roping amplitude and wavelength in ferritic stainless steel has been
   evaluated. The through-thickness mechanical behaviour of a sheet
   deformed in tension has been tested experimentally and simulated using a
   full-field viscoplastic fast Fourier transform formulation. These
   crystal plasticity simulations use orientation imaging microscopy data
   as input, allowing for large-scale simulation domains to be investigated
   while accounting for the clustering of orientations with similar
   deformation behaviour. The simulations predict both the local
   deformation response as well as the macroscopic surface roughness. The
   latter is compared quantitatively with experimental measurements and is
   shown to predict both the wavelength and amplitude of the observed
   roping. The results of these simulations have also been compared with
   previously proposed mean-field crystal plasticity simulations of roping,
   performed using the viscoplastic self-consistent code, in which each
   crystal orientation is, at most, influenced by the behaviour of a
   homogenized matrix, but not by its local neighbourhood. Comparison
   between these two kinds of approaches thus allows us to assess the
   significance of the local neighbourhood on the macroscopic prediction of
   roping.}},

Abstract = {{To facilitate the design of seismic remediation for Tuttle Creek Dam in
   east central Kansas, a seismic finite difference analysis of the dam was
   performed using the software FLAC and the UBCSAND and UBCTOT soil
   constitutive models. The FLAC software has a key advantage because it
   can use calibrated site-specific constitutive models. Earlier
   deformation analyses using a hyperbolic constitutive model for the
   foundation fine-grained materials did not properly represent the modulus
   and strength reduction and predicted extremely large permanent
   deformations. Cyclic triaxial laboratory tests using high-quality
   samples and in situ vane shear tests were used to calibrate the FLAC
   constitutive model herein. The resulting FLAC analysis of the
   unremediated dam predicted an upstream slope toe deformation of about
   0.6 m, a crest settlement of about 0.6 m, and a downstream slope toe
   deformation of about 1.5 m using the design ground motion. Based on the
   estimated permanent deformations and other factors, it was decided that
   the anticipated upstream slope and crest deformations were tolerable and
   only the downstream slope had to be remediated to protect the downstream
   seepage control system.}},

Title = {{Effects of Oxygen and Sulfate Concentrations on the Corrosion Behavior
   of Zinc in NaCl Solutions}},
Journal = {{CORROSION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Galvanized steel is one of the most common materials used in the
   construction industry for its relatively low cost paired with an
   acceptable corrosion resistance. Nevertheless, the early failure of a
   number of structures around the world that use galvanized steel as
   reinforcement has raised some controversy on the understanding of the
   corrosion behavior of zinc. The purpose of this paper was to study the
   effect of variable oxygen concentration on the corrosion performance of
   zinc. High-purity zinc was immersed in solutions with varied
   concentrations of sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, 1 wt\% to 4 wt\%), a fixed
   concentration of sodium chloride (NaCl, 3.5 wt\%), and different
   concentrations of oxygen to simulate the conditions found in soils and
   groundwater. Differential oxygen access can promote corrosion macrocells
   that will compromise the performance of the protected structure. The
   electrochemical corrosion behavior of zinc was studied using
   potentiodynamic polarization testing and electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray
   diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the corroded samples.
   Results indicate an increase on the corrosion rate with an increasing
   amount of Na2SO4, as well as a potential difference between samples in
   oxygen saturated, aerated, and deaerated conditions, indicating the
   possibility for macrocell formation under the studied conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The capillary flow of a commercial low-density polyethylene (LDPE) melt
   was studied both experimentally and numerically. The excess pressure
   drop due to entry (Bagley correction), the compressibility, the effect
   of pressure on viscosity, and the possible slip effects on the capillary
   data analysis have been examined. Using a series of capillary dies
   having different diameters, D, and length-to-diameter L/D ratios, a full
   rheological characterization has been carried out, and the experimental
   data have been fitted both with a viscous model (Carreau-Yasuda) and a
   viscoelastic one (the KayeBernstein, Kearsley, Zapas/Papanastasiou,
   Scriven, Macosko, or K-BKZ/PSM model). Particular emphasis has been
   given on the pressure-dependence of viscosity, with a pressure-dependent
   coefficient beta p. For the viscous model, the viscosity is a function
   of both temperature and pressure. For the viscoelastic K-BKZ model, the
   time-temperature shifting concept has been used for the non-isothermal
   calculations, while the timepressure shifting concept has been used to
   shift the relaxation moduli for the pressure-dependence effect. It was
   found that only the viscoelastic simulations were capable of reproducing
   the experimental data well, while any viscous modeling always
   underestimates the pressures, especially at the higher apparent shear
   rates and L/D ratios. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 2012. (c) 2012 Society of

Title = {{University of Queensland Vital Signs Dataset: Development of an
   Accessible Repository of Anesthesia Patient Monitoring Data for Research}},
Journal = {{ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{584-589}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Data recorded from the devices used to monitor a patient's
   vital signs are often used in the development of displays, alarms, and
   information systems, but high-resolution, multiple-parameter datasets of
   anesthesia monitoring data from patients during anesthesia are often
   difficult to obtain. Existing databases have typically been collected
   from patients in intensive care units. However, the physical state of
   intensive care patients is dissimilar to those undergoing surgery, more
   frequent and marked changes to cardiovascular and respiratory variables
   are seen in operating room patients, and additional and highly relevant
   information to anesthesia (e.g., end-tidal agent monitoring, etc.) is
   omitted from these intensive care databases. We collected a set of
   high-quality, high-resolution, multiple-parameter monitoring data
   suitable for anesthesia monitoring research.
   METHODS: Vital signs data were recorded from patients undergoing
   anesthesia at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Software was developed to
   capture, time synchronize, and interpolate vital signs data from Philips
   IntelliVue MP70 and MP30 patient monitors and Datex-Ohmeda Aestiva/5
   anesthesia machines into 10 millisecond resolution samples. The recorded
   data were saved in a variety of accessible file formats.
   RESULTS: Monitoring data were recorded from 32 cases (25 general
   anesthetics, 3 spinal anesthetics, 4 sedations) ranging in duration from
   13 minutes to 5 hours (median 105 min). Most cases included data from
   the electrocardiograph, pulse oximeter, capnograph, noninvasive arterial
   blood pressure monitor, airway flow, and pressure monitor and, in a few
   cases, the Y-piece spirometer, electroencephalogram monitor, and
   arterial blood pressure monitor. Recorded data were processed and saved
   into 4 file formats: (1) comma-separated values text files with full
   numerical and waveform data, (2) numerical parameters recorded in
   comma-separated values files at 1-second intervals, (3) graphical plots
   of all waveform data in a range of resolutions as Portable Network
   Graphics image files, and (4) graphical overview plots of numerical data
   for entire cases as Portable Network Graphics and Scalable Vector
   Graphics files. The complete dataset is freely available online via
   doi:102.100.100/6914 and has been listed in the Australian National Data
   Service Collections Registry.
   DISCUSSION: The present dataset provides clinical anesthesia monitoring
   data from entire surgical cases where patients underwent anesthesia,
   includes a wide range of vital signs variables that are commonly
   monitored during surgery, and is published in accessible, user-friendly
   file formats. The text and image file formats let researchers without
   engineering or computer science backgrounds easily access the data using
   standard spreadsheet and image browsing software. In future work,
   monitoring data should be collected from a wider range and larger number
   of cases, and software tools are needed to support searching and
   navigating the database. (Anesth Analg 2012;114:584-9)}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new monitor-decoupled model of propofol
   pharmacodynamics (PD) using the state entropy (SE) as the clinical
   endpoint of interest. In our model, the dynamics of the entropy monitor
   are separated from the PD response of the patient by explicitly
   accounting for the model of the entropy monitor in the PD identification
   process. The monitor model was then excluded from the identified PD
   model for the patient. The PD model, thus, obtained is distinct from its
   traditional counterpart in that it reflects the PD response of a patient
   with the dynamic effects of the monitor included as a specific entity.
   System identification trials using SE data of 31 pediatric subjects show
   that the PD models derived from the proposed approach are an improvement
   on the traditional approach. For the Paedfusor pharmacokinetic (PK)
   model, population-averaged effect site equilibration rate constant k(e)0
   was 5.4 and 3.0 for the proposed and traditional PD models (p < 0.001),
   respectively. For the Kataria PK model, population-averaged k(e)0 was
   2.3 and 1.4 (p < 0.01). This significant difference suggests that the
   effects of the monitor must be considered when searching for the
   intrinsic PD of a patient that is free from the bias induced by the
   monitor characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a flexible and scalable motion estimation processor
   capable of supporting the processing requirements for high-definition
   (HD) video using the H. 264 Advanced Video Codec, which is suited for
   FPGA implementation. Unlike most previous work, our core is optimized to
   execute all existing fast block matching algorithms, which we show to
   match or exceed the inter-frame prediction performance of traditional
   full-search approaches at the HD resolutions commonly in use today.
   Using our development tools, such algorithms can be described using a
   C-style syntax which is compiled into our custom instruction set. We
   show that different HD sequences exhibit different characteristics which
   necessitate a flexible and configurable solution when targeting embedded
   applications. This is supported in our core and toolset by allowing
   designers to modify the number of functional units to be instantiated.
   All processor instances remain binary compatible so recompilation of the
   motion estimation algorithm is not required. Due to this optimization
   process, it is possible to match the processing requirements of the
   selected motion estimation algorithm to the hardware microarchitecture
   leading to a very efficient implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Machining along continuous circular tool-path trajectories avoids tool
   stoppage and even feed rate variation. This helps particularly in
   high-speed milling by reducing the effect of the machine tool mechanical
   structure and cutting process dynamics. With the increase in popularity
   of this machining concept, the need for detailed study of a valid chip
   formation in circular end milling is becoming necessary for accurate
   kinematic and dynamic modeling of the cutting process. In this paper,
   chip formation during circular end milling is studied with a major focus
   on feed per tooth and undeformed chip thickness along with their
   analytical derivations and numerical solutions. At first, the difference
   in the feed per tooth formulation for end milling along linear and
   circular tool-path trajectories is presented. In the next step, valid
   formulation of the undeformed chip thickness in circular end milling is
   derived by considering an epitrochoidal tooth trajectory with a wide
   range of the tool-path radius. The complex transcendental equations
   encountered in the derivation are dealt with, by a case-based approach
   to obtain closed-form analytical solutions. The analytical solutions of
   undeformed chip thickness are validated with results of numerical
   simulations of tool and tooth trajectories for circular end milling and
   also compared to the linear end milling. The close resemblance between
   analytical and numerical calculations of the undeformed chip thickness
   in circular end milling suggests validity of the proposed analytical
   formulations. As a case study, the cutting forces in circular end
   milling are calculated based on the derived chip thickness formulations
   and an existing mechanistic model. The calculation results reiterate the
   need of taking into account adjusted feed per tooth and valid chip
   thickness formulations in circular end milling, especially for small
   tool-path radii, for more realistic process modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal transport characteristics of electroosmotic flow of power-law
   fluids in the presence of pressure gradient through a slit microchannel
   are studied in this paper. Considering a fully developed flow with a
   constant wall heat flux as the boundary condition, the governing
   equations are numerically solved by means of the finite difference
   method. A complete parametric study is done in order to investigate the
   effects of different flow parameters on the thermal behaviors of the
   flow. The results show that the non-Newtonian characteristic of the
   fluid can influence the thermal behaviors of the flow by affecting the
   rate of heat convection and viscous dissipation: however, its influence
   diminishes at higher values of the dimensionless Debye-Huckel parameter.
   It is also found that the zeta potential, whose value is dependent on
   the channel wall and the electrolyte solution characteristics, can
   highly affect the thermal behaviors of the flow, especially at smaller
   values of the dimensionless Debye-Huckel parameter. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Five different compositions of brownmillerite materials, Ce- and
   La-doped, and uncloped Ba2In2O5 were synthesized via the solid-state
   reaction and the glycine-nitrate combustion process. Properties of the
   materials were characterized using XRD, HR-TEM, and TGA/DSC techniques.
   Conductivity measurements by AC impedance spectroscopy, performed in air
   and hydrogen-containing atmospheres, in the temperature range from 100
   degrees C to 500 degrees C, were correlated to the properties of the
   materials and revealed the effects of dopant, microstructure,
   temperature and atmosphere on the total electrical conductivity of the
   materials. All compositions showed low conductivity in air. In
   hydrogen-containing atmospheres, while Ce- and La-doped Ba2In2O5 showed
   low conductivity (4 x 10(-6)-3 x 10(-6) S cm(-1) at 500 degrees C),
   undoped Ba2In2O5 demonstrated a surprisingly high conductivity (between
   0.02 S cm(-1) and 0.7 S cm(-1) in the temperature range from 300 degrees
   C to 500 degrees C), especially samples produced by the glycine-nitrate
   process. This finding creates potential opportunity for using Ba2In2O5
   as a proton-conductive material in intermediate temperature fuel cells.

Abstract = {{Metal cleanliness is one of the most critical parameters affecting
   microporosity formation in aluminum alloy castings. It is generally
   acknowledged that oxide inclusions in the melt promote microporosity
   formation by facilitating pore nucleation. In this study, microporosity
   formation under different casting conditions, which aimed to manipulate
   the tendency to form and entrain oxide films in small directionally cast
   A356 samples was investigated. Castings were prepared with and without
   the aid of argon gas shielding and with a varying pour surface area. Two
   alloy variants of A356 were tested in which the main difference was Sr
   content. Porous disc filtration analysis was used to assess the melt
   cleanliness and identify the inclusions in the castings. The porosity
   volume fraction and size distribution were measured using X-ray
   micro-tomography analysis. The measurements show a clear increment in
   the volume fraction, number density, and pore size in a manner
   consistent with an increasing tendency to form and entrain oxide films
   during casting. By fitting the experimental results with a comprehensive
   pore formation model, an estimate of the pore nucleation population has
   been made. The model predicts that increasing the tendency to form oxide
   films increases both the number of nucleation sites and reduces the
   supersaturation necessary for pore nucleation in A356 castings. Based on
   the model predictions, Sr modification impacts both the nucleation
   kinetics and the pore growth kinetics via grain structure.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of variation of permeability in liquefiable soil under
   earthquake loading}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{74-88}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Liquefaction phenomenon is usually accompanied by large amounts of
   settlement owing to disruption of soil structure. In addition to that,
   large settlement also occurs by a significant increase in soil
   permeability during seismic excitation. To properly simulate the
   post-liquefaction settlement, it is important to take the
   compressibility properties of the liquefied sand as well as the
   permeability increase into account. Using initial permeability
   coefficient in the course of simulation of liquefaction leads to
   underestimation of settlement. In addition to that, using unrealistic
   values for permeability may cause erroneous predictions of other aspects
   of soil behavior. Therefore, an accurate simulation of pore pressure
   generation and dissipation and consequent settlement during liquefaction
   requires incorporating the actual variation of permeability in the
   numerical model. In this paper, variation of soil permeability during
   liquefaction and its effects on soil seismic response is studied using a
   fully coupled dynamic analysis. Having a realistic mechanism for
   simulation of soil skeleton response using a well-calibrated critical
   state two-surface plasticity model, the focus of attention in this paper
   is on the effects of permeability variation on the behavior of liquefied
   grounds. Numerical simulations are performed using parts of Modified
   OpenSees Services (MOSS) library, a set of coupled finite elements,
   constitutive integration procedures, and material models from the UC
   Davis toolset along with a novel implementation of variable
   permeability. Two relationships are proposed for considering the
   variations of permeability coefficient in the process of liquefaction.
   The proposed relationships have been implemented into the model and
   applied for simulation of a centrifuge experiment. Comparison of the
   numerical results and experimental measurements reveals that there is a
   direct relationship between (variable) permeability coefficient and
   excess pore pressure ratio in all buildup, liquefaction, and dissipation
   phases. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Using JAVASCRIPT and dynamic DOM manipulation on the client side of Web
   applications is becoming a widespread approach for achieving rich
   interactivity and responsiveness in modern Web applications. At the same
   time, such techniques-collectively known as AJAX-shatter the concept of
   webpages with unique URLs,on which traditional Web crawlers are based.
   This article describes a novel technique for crawling AJAX-based
   applications through automatic dynamic analysis of user-interface-state
   changes in Web browsers. Our algorithm scans the DOM tree, spots
   candidate elements that are capable of changing the state, fires events
   on those candidate elements, and incrementally infers a state machine
   that models the various navigational paths and states within an AJAX
   application. This inferred model can be used in program comprehension
   and in analysis and testing of dynamic Web states, for instance, or for
   generating a static version of the application. In this article, we
   discuss our sequential and concurrent AJAX crawling algorithms We
   present our open source tool called CRAWLJAX, which implements the
   concepts and algorithms discussed in this article. Additionally, we
   report a number of empirical studies in which we apply our approach to a
   number of open-source and industrial Web applications and elaborate on
   the obtained results.}},

Abstract = {{As a key component of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) charger
   system, the front-end ac-dc converter must achieve high efficiency and
   power density. This paper presents a topology survey evaluating
   topologies for use in front end ac-dc converters for PHEV battery
   chargers. The topology survey is focused on several boost power factor
   corrected converters, which offer high efficiency, high power factor,
   high density, and low cost. Experimental results are presented and
   interpreted for five prototype converters, converting universal ac input
   voltage to 400 V dc. The results demonstrate that the phase shifted
   semi-bridgeless PFC boost converter is ideally suited for automotive
   level I residential charging applications in North America, where the
   typical supply is limited to 120 V and 1.44 kVA or 1.92 kVA. For
   automotive level II residential charging applications in North America
   and Europe the bridgeless interleaved PFC boost converter is an ideal
   topology candidate for typical supplies of 240 V, with power levels of
   3.3 kW, 5 kW, and 6.6 kW.}},

Abstract = {{There are two main approaches, static and dynamic, to broadcast
   algorithms in wireless ad hoc networks. In the static approach, local
   algorithms determine the status (forwarding/nonforwarding) of each node
   proactively based on local topology information and a globally known
   priority function. In this paper, we first show that local broadcast
   algorithms based on the static approach cannot achieve a good
   approximation factor to the optimum solution (an NP-hard problem).
   However, we show that a constant approximation factor is achievable if
   (relative) position information is available. In the dynamic approach,
   local algorithms determine the status of each node ``on-the-fly{''}
   based on local topology information and broadcast state information.
   Using the dynamic approach, it was recently shown that local broadcast
   algorithms can achieve a constant approximation factor to the optimum
   solution when (approximate) position information is available. However,
   using position information can simplify the problem. Also, in some
   applications it may not be practical to have position information.
   Therefore, we wish to know whether local broadcast algorithms based on
   the dynamic approach can achieve a constant approximation factor without
   using position information. We answer this question in the positive-we
   design a local broadcast algorithm in which the status of each node is
   decided ``on-the-fly{''} and prove that the algorithm can achieve both
   full delivery and a constant approximation to the optimum solution.}},

Volume = {{109}},

Abstract = {{The Zonal Rate Model (ZRM) has previously been shown to accurately
   account for contributions to elution band broadening, including external
   flow nonidealities and radial concentration gradients, in ion-exchange
   membrane (IEXM) chromatography systems operated under nonbinding
   conditions. Here, we extend the ZRM to analyze and model the behavior of
   retained proteins by introducing terms for intra-column mass transfer
   resistances and intrinsic binding kinetics. Breakthrough curve (BTC)
   data from a scaled-down anion-exchange membrane chromatography module
   using ovalbumin as a model protein were collected at flow rates ranging
   from 1.5 to 20?mL?min-1. Through its careful accounting of transport
   nonidealities within and external to the membrane stack, the ZRM is
   shown to provide a useful framework for characterizing putative protein
   binding mechanisms and models, for predicting BTCs and complex elution
   behavior, including the common observation that the dynamic binding
   capacity can increase with linear velocity in IEXM systems, and for
   simulating and scaling separations using IEXM chromatography. Global
   fitting of model parameters is used to evaluate the performance of the
   Langmuir, bi-Langmuir, steric mass action (SMA), and spreading-type
   protein binding models in either correlating or fundamentally describing
   BTC data. When combined with the ZRM, the bi-Langmuir, and SMA models
   match the chromatography data, but require physically unrealistic
   regressed model parameters to do so. In contrast, for this system a
   spreading-type model is shown to accurately predict column performance
   while also providing a realistic fundamental explanation for observed
   trends, including an observed increase in dynamic binding capacity with
   flow rate. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012; 109:615629. (C) 2011 Wiley

Abstract = {{Repeated injections of psychostimulants, such as o-amphetamine (D-AMPH),
   provide a well-validated model of progressive cellular and systems-level
   alterations in brain function and behavior associated with addiction.
   The present study employed quantitative measures of both power spectral
   density and synchrony from local field potentials (LFPs) recorded
   simultaneously from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), parietal cortex (PAR),
   and hippocampus (HPC) in awake, behaving rats to assess changes in
   oscillations during different stages of D-AMPH-induced sensitization.
   The induction and development of sensitization altered the power of
   multiple frequency bands in a brain region-specific manner, whereas no
   changes were observed in animals treated with chronic saline.
   Specifically, the induction of sensitization to D-AMPH was accompanied
   by alterations in delta (2-5 Hz) and theta (5-11 Hz) oscillations
   similar to those observed in EEG recordings from addicted individuals
   describing craving and hedonic experience of the drug. Sensitization was
   also related to increased theta coherence between the PFC and HPC, along
   with suppression of cross-frequency correlations between theta and
   fast-gamma (65-100 Hz) in both the HPC and the PFC. Collectively, the
   present findings indicated the induction of a state in which the timing
   and synchronizing effects of oscillations are altered by sensitization
   to D-AMPH and are especially pronounced in the PFC. Furthermore,
   numerous LFP-derived measures were characterized that may serve as
   objective physiological correlates of pathological states observed in
   addiction. (C) 2011 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{111}},

Abstract = {{An interdiffusivity model was established for SiGe interdiffusion under
   tensile or relaxed strain over the full Ge content (x(Ge)) range (0 <=
   x(Ge) <= 1), which is based on the correlations between
   self-diffusivity, intrinsic diffusivity, and interdiffusivity. It
   unifies available interdiffusivity models over the full Ge range and
   applies to a wider temperature range up to 1270 degrees C at the x(Ge) =
   0 end and to 900 degrees C at the high x(Ge) = 1 end. Interdiffusion
   experiments under soak and spike rapid thermal annealing conditions were
   conducted to verify the model. Literature interdiffusion data under
   furnace annealing conditions were also used for the same purpose. The
   interdiffusivity model of this work has been implemented in major
   process simulation tools, and the simulation results showed good
   agreement with experimental data under furnace annealing and soak and
   spike rapid thermal annealing conditions. This work demonstrated a new
   approach in studying SiGe interdiffusion, which has the advantage of
   studying interdiffusion under non-isothermal annealing conditions. (C)

Abstract = {{We have developed a combined ionic conductivity and temperature sensor
   package for multiphase chemical reactors, key elements of SmartChip, a
   flow following, data logging sensor. The initial application of the
   sensor is to monitor the process inside the hot and caustic chemical
   environment of a kraft pulp digester (pH similar to 13, temperatures
   from 25 to 175 degrees C, reaching a maximum of 180 degrees C and
   pressures up to 2 MPa). The sensor package consists of a 1000 Omega
   platinum resistance temperature detector (RTD) enclosed in a stainless
   steel container and a four-electrode conductivity sensor consisting of
   stainless steel electrodes and installed on a polyetheretherketone
   (PEEK) package. The sensor package is designed ultimately to move within
   the kraft pulp digester and record sensor data. The sensors were tested
   at temperatures of up to 140 degrees C in NaOH concentrations of 10-100
   g/L as Na2O with and without the presence of wood chips. Changes in
   concentration were clearly discernible as changes in conductivity. The
   presence of chips reduced conductivity as expected, and this reduction
   depended on the degree of cooking. Although further calibration work is
   needed to quantitatively determine concentration inside a digester,
   process variations should be readily detectable. The average power
   consumption of the sensors is 5 mW, which is sufficiently low to enable
   autonomous operation of the sensor under battery power. The sensor
   packages were tested for a full kraft pulping cycle and survived with no
   signs of corrosion. The demonstration of conductivity measurements
   represents an important step toward the successful implementation of
   flow following measurements in the kraft pulping processes to aid
   process optimization and design.}},

Abstract = {{Seismic resiliency of new buildings has improved over the years due to
   enhancements in seismic codes and design practices. However, existing
   buildings designed and built under earlier codes are vulnerable and
   require a performance-based screening and retrofit prioritization. The
   performance modifiers considered are soft story, weak story, and the
   quality of construction, which are collated through a walk down survey.
   The building evaluation is performed through a pushover analysis, and
   performance objective are obtained through initial stiffness of the
   pushover curve. Using a design of experiments technique, a reliable
   system input-output relation has been identified and used to evaluate
   the performance criteria at untried design points (i.e., buildings with
   different modifier values). The proposed method of performance based
   evaluation is illustrated through consideration of the different
   structural deficiencies on a typical six-storey reinforced concrete
   building in Vancouver. Through the designed experiments, the main and
   interaction effects of the performance modifiers have also been studied.

Abstract = {{We present results from a study of buoyant miscible displacements flows
   at moderate viscosity ratios in near-horizontal ducts. Low Atwood
   numbers are considered. Inertial effects are significant although the
   flow regimes are laminar. Pipe and plane channel geometries are
   considered using a mix of experimental, computational and analytical
   techniques. The main focus of the study is on the effects of the
   viscosity ratio between the fluids. We show that small viscosity ratios
   lead to more efficient displacements, as is intuitive. In each geometry
   we find a mix of viscous and inertial flows, in broadly the same pattern
   as for the iso-viscous displacements studied extensively in Taghavi et
   al. (submitted for publication). Predictive models are proposed for the
   viscous regime, in the case of the plane channel, and for the inertial
   exchange flow regime, in both geometries. We also study displacement
   flows with shear-thinning fluids, over a more restrictive range of
   parameters. We show that with an appropriate definition of the effective
   viscosity the scaled front velocities fit well with the results from the
   Newtonian displacements, in both pipe and plane channel geometries. The
   main role of ratio m of displaced fluid viscosity to displacing
   viscosity is in line with our intuition. For m > 1 displacement
   efficiencies are reduced and the front velocities are larger. However,
   the main increase in front velocity is achieved for modest viscosity
   ratios of 3 or 4 to 1, with little increase afterwards. The reverse
   situation, m < 1, shows significant improvements in displacement
   efficiency, with front velocity <(V)over cap>(f) reduced down towards
   the imposed mean velocity (V) over cap (0), as m decreases. A viscosity
   ratio of around 1-4 appears to achieve quite efficient displacements,
   and to be able to compensate for the effects of buoyancy (which in our
   case are always destabilising). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{A model for carbon nanotube (CNT)/polymer composite conductivity is
   developed, considering the effect of inter-tube tunnelling through the
   polymer. The statistical effects of inter-tube distance and alignment on
   the tunnelling are investigated through numerical modelling, to
   highlight their role in the conductance and piezoresistance of the
   composite film. The impact of critical parameters, including the
   concentration, alignment and aspect ratio of the CNTs and the tunnelling
   barrier height of the polymer is statistically evaluated using a large
   number of randomly generated CNT/polymer composite films. A numerical
   model is presented for the tunnelling resistance as a function of CNT
   concentration and polymer properties, which provides good agreement with
   the reported conductance in the literature. In particular, for a low
   concentration of CNTs close to the percolation threshold, we demonstrate
   how tunnelling dominates the conductance properties and leads to
   significant increase in the piezoresistance of the composite. This is
   important for gaining insight into the optimum concentration and
   alignment of the CNTs in the composite film for applications such as
   strain sensors, anisotropic conductive films, transparent electrodes and
   flexible electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Low power consumption and high data rate are the most important
   requirements for the communication system. Especially, very low power
   consumption modulation method is required for the short range
   communication systems such as the medical implantable communication
   devices or capsule endoscope, and so on. For the higher data rate, we
   like to combine the OFDM system into the QAPM since the OFDM system has
   higher bandwidth efficiency than a single-carrier system. In this paper,
   we like to propose a QAPM (Quadrature amplitude position modulation)
   method combined with the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing
   (OFDM) system. Next, we analyze the performance of three
   low-power-consumption modulation schemes: the phase shift position
   modulation (PSPM), phase silence shift keying (PSSK), and QAPM using
   orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system in the
   multi-path channel. These schemes have lower bandwidth efficiency and
   the higher power efficiency than the existing phase-shift keying (PSK)
   and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes. It can be shown that
   they can achieve greater power efficiency because every modulation
   symbol has a zero-envelope period as in pulse-position modulation (PPM)
   techniques. Finally, we compare the performances of the PSPM, PSSK, and
   QAPM modulation combined with the OFDM system with regard to bit error
   rate performance and throughput.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive Radio (CR) is an essential technique for the future generation
   green communication paradigm owing to its inherent advantages of
   adaptability and cognition. The compulsory spectrum sensing is a
   critical component to facilitate systems co-existence. In this paper, we
   propose a new Time-Division Energy Efficient (TDEE) sensing scheme in
   which the sensing period is divided into an optimal number of timeslots
   and each Secondary User (SU) is assigned to detect a different channel
   in one time-slot. An important advantage of TDEE is that the SUs do not
   need to exchange the control messages for the acknowledgement of a
   successful cooperation, leading to substantial energy saving without
   compromising sensing accuracy. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous
   networks are investigated with respect to the intrinsic trade-off
   between spectrum efficiency and energy-efficiency. Illustrative results
   demonstrate that the proposed TDEE is able to achieve much lower energy
   consumption and higher throughput, compared to the existing mechanisms.}},

Title = {{Prostate brachytherapy postimplant dosimetry: Seed orientation and the
   impact of dosimetric anisotropy in stranded implants}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: In postimplant dosimetry for prostate brachytherapy, dose is
   commonly calculated using the TG-43 1D formalism, because seed
   orientations are difficult to determine from CT images, the current
   standard for the procedure. However, the orientation of stranded seeds
   soon after implantation is predictable, as these seeds tend to maintain
   their relative spacing, and orient themselves along the implant
   trajectory. The aim of this study was to develop a method for
   determining seed orientations from reconstructed strand trajectories,
   and to use this information to investigate the dosimetric impact of
   applying the TG-43 2D formalism to clinical postimplant analysis.
   Methods: Using in-house software, the preplan to postimplant seed
   correspondence was determined for a cohort of 30 patients during routine
   day-0 CT-based postimplant dosimetry. All patients were implanted with
   stranded-seed trains. Spline curves were fit to each set of seeds
   composing a strand, with the requirement that the distance along the
   spline between seeds be equal to the seed spacing within the strand. The
   orientations of the seeds were estimated by the tangents to the spline
   at each seed centroid. Dose distributions were then determined using the
   1D and 2D TG-43 formalisms. These were compared using the TG-137
   recommended dose metrics for the prostate, prostatic urethra, and
   rectum.
   Results: Seven hundred and sixty one strands were analyzed in total.
   Defining the z-axis to be cranial-positive and the x-axis to be
   left-lateral positive in the CT coordinate system, the average seed had
   an inclination of 21 degrees +/- 10 degrees and an azimuth of -81
   degrees +/- 57 degrees. These values correspond to the average strand
   rising anteriorly from apex to base, approximately parallel to the
   midsagittal plane. Clinically minor but statistically significant
   differences in dose metrics were noted. Compared to the 2D calculation,
   the 1D calculation underestimated prostate V100 by 1.1\% and D90 by 2.3
   Gy, while overestimating V150 and V200 by 1.6\% and 1.3\%, respectively.
   Urethral and rectal dose quantifiers tended to be underestimated by the
   1D calculation. The most pronounced differences were in the urethral D30
   and rectal D2cc, which rose by 3.8 and 1.9 Gy, respectively, using the
   2D calculation. The total volume of the 100\% isodose region as a
   percentage of the prostate volume was found to increase by 0.4\%.
   Conclusions: Stranded seeds in the supine patient are not oriented in a
   uniformly random manner, nor are they aligned along the axis of the CT
   scanner. Instead, this study identified a consistent anterior pitch that
   is likely attributable to differences in patient pose between implant
   and CT imaging. The angle of the ultrasound probe with respect to the
   patient during implant may have also been a contributing factor. The
   dose metrics derived using the 1D formalism were found to be within 2\%,
   on average, of those derived using the 2D formalism. For greater
   accuracy, 2D dosimetry can be pursued using the strand-fitting method
   described in this work. If a 1D representation is used, integrating over
   the empirically determined seed orientation density reported here may be
   more appropriate than assuming that seed inclinations are distributed
   uniformly. (C) 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Abstract = {{Using a novel laser ultrasonics technique in situ measurements of
   austenite grain growth were conducted during continuous heating (10
   degrees C s(-1)) and subsequent isothermal holding at various
   temperatures in the range 950-1250 degrees C in a microalloyed linepipe
   steel. Based on the experimental results, a grain growth model was
   developed, which includes the pinning effect of precipitates present in
   the steel. Analyzing the grain growth behaviour and using the advanced
   thermo-kinetic software MatCalc, an approach was developed to estimate
   the initial distribution of precipitates in the as-received material and
   their dissolution kinetics. The evolution of the volume fractions and
   mean particle sizes of NbC and TiN leads to a time-dependent pinning
   pressure that is coupled with the proposed grain growth model to
   successfully describe the observed kinetics of austenite grain growth.
   The predictive capabilities of the model are illustrated by its
   application to independent grain growth data for rapid heat treatment
   cycles that are typical of the weld heat affected zone. (C) 2011 Acta

Volume = {{113}},

Abstract = {{A dramatic improvement in the leaching kinetics of chalcopyrite in
   ferric sulfate media was observed upon the addition of silver-enhanced
   pyrite. In this process, pyrite samples are pretreated with a miniscule
   amount of silver and used as a catalyst in atmospheric leaching of
   chalcopyrite. The aim of this study was to understand the mechanism of
   this process and to reveal the role of silver and pyrite in accelerating
   the rate of chalcopyrite leaching. It is shown that this process, known
   as Galvanox (TM), is the galvanically assisted leaching of chalcopyrite,
   where pyrite provides an alternative surface for ferric reduction. As
   the leaching reaction proceeds, in the absence of silver-enhanced
   pyrite, a non-conductive sulfur layer forms on the surface of
   chalcopyrite. This layer prevents electrical contact between pyrite and
   chalcopyrite particles in the slurry. However, it is observed that, in
   the presence of silver-enhanced pyrite, a small proportion of the added
   silver to the pyrite dissolves and reacts with the elemental sulfur
   around chalcopyrite particles to form silver sulfide. In spite of the
   very low silver level in this layer, its conductivity increases
   significantly and allows the transfer of electrons from chalcopyrite to
   pyrite. In this study, it is shown that pyrite and silver have critical
   roles in enhancing the kinetics of chalcopyrite leaching. Pyrite
   provides an alternative surface area for ferric reduction. Silver
   increases the catalytic properties of pyrite and therefore, the rate of
   ferric reduction on the surface of silver-enhanced pyrite is faster than
   this rate on the surface of natural pyrite. Another role of silver is to
   decrease the resistivity of the sulfur product layer and to facilitate
   the electrical contact between pyrite and chalcopyrite. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The rate of chalcopyrite leaching in ferric sulfate media during the
   Galvanox (TM) process increases significantly in the presence of
   silver-enhanced pyrite. The increase in the kinetics of leaching is
   attributed to the galvanic interaction between pyrite and chalcopyrite.
   Pyrite provides an additional surface area for the cathodic reaction.
   The oxidation reaction rate increases to compensate for the increased
   consumption of electrons. Pyrite is more noble than chalcopyrite; hence
   chalcopyrite leaches preferentially under oxidizing conditions. This
   leads to the acceleration of the rate of copper extraction. However, an
   insulating product layer of elemental sulfur forms on the surface of
   chalcopyrite as leaching proceeds. Formation of this non-conductive
   layer limits the electrical contact between pyrite and unleached
   chalcopyrite. In the presence of silver-enhanced pyrite, a very small
   proportion of the added silver to pyrite dissolves in the leaching
   solution and reacts with chalcopyrite particles to form silver sulfide.
   In this study, increases in the conductivity of the sulfur layer
   sufficient to allow the rapid transfer of electrons are observed, in
   spite of very low levels of silver in the sulfur product layer (60-100
   ppm). Hence, it is shown that in the presence of silver-enhanced pyrite,
   the resistivity of the sulfur layer is lowered, allowing the electrical
   contact between pyrite and chalcopyrite to be maintained. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The complete recovery of the H-2 stored on dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole
   was achieved at 443 K and 101 kPa using Pd catalysts prepared by
   incipient wetness impregnation and calcination in He rather than air.
   Over a 4 wt\% Pd/SiO2 catalyst, the reaction proceeded to complete
   conversion within 22 mm and complete H-2 recovery (5.8 wt\%) within 1.6
   h. The dehydrogenation rate of dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole and
   selectivity to the completely dehydrogenated product, N-ethylcarbazole,
   were dependent upon the Pd particle size. The dehydrogenation rate of
   dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole was compared to that of
   dodecahydrocarbazole and dodecahydrofluorene. The lower turn-over
   frequency (TOF) for dodecahydrocarbazole was attributed to a strong
   adsorption of the dehydrogenated products to Pd through the N atom,
   whereas the ethyl group in dodecahydro-N-ethyl-carbazole prevented a
   strong N interaction with the surface. Density functional theory (DFT)
   results showed that dodecahydrocarbazole and dodecahydrofluorene were
   more strongly adsorbed on Pd than dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole leading
   to a significant decrease in their TOFs for H-2 recovery. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{In an effort to open up new opportunities in individualized anesthesia
   care, this paper presents a dynamic dose-response model of propofol that
   relates propofol dose (i.e., infusion rate) directly to a clinical
   effect. The proposed model consists of a first-order equilibration
   dynamics plus a nonlinear Hill equation model, each representing the
   transient distribution of propofol dose from the plasma to the effect
   site and the steady-state dose-effect relationship. Compared to
   traditional pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models, the proposed
   model has structural parsimony and comparable predictive capability,
   making it more attractive than its PKPD counterpart for identifying an
   individualized dose-response model in real-time. The efficacy of the
   direct dynamic dose-response model over a traditional PKPD model was
   assessed using a mixed effects modeling analysis of the
   electroencephalogram (EEG)-based state entropty (SE) response to
   intravenous propofol administration in 34 pediatric subjects. An
   improvement in the mean-squared error and r(2) value of individual
   prediction, as well as the Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was seen
   with the direct dynamic dose-response model.}},

Title = {{Design of Pre-Rake DS-UWB Downlink with Pre-Equalization}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{400-410}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We consider the design of ultra-wideband (UWB) systems that enable high
   data rate communications for short-range wireless applications. In
   particular, we consider the downlink of a direct sequence UWB (DS-UWB)
   system in which the base station is equipped with multiple antennas and
   employs pre-rake combining, while each user employs a simple single
   antenna receiver. We propose the use of multiuser filters for the
   purpose of pre-equalization at the transmitter in order to mitigate the
   combined effects of intersymbol interference (ISI) and multiuser
   interference (MUI) that are generated at the receivers as a result of
   the wideband nature of the users' channels. For this system, we study
   the joint design of the transmitter's pre-equalization filters and each
   receiver's scalar gain under two design criteria. The first design
   minimizes the total transmitted power from the base station subject to
   achieving physical layer quality of service requirements of different
   users. For this design, we show that the calculation of the
   pre-equalization filters and the receiver gains can be formulated as an
   efficiently solvable convex optimization problem. In the second design,
   we consider the minimization of a weighted sum of each user's
   mean-square error. In order to obtain a computationally tractable
   solution for this design criterion, we exploit the dual DS-UWB uplink
   that employs rake combining and post-equalization filters at a central
   receiver. The numerical studies for each design criterion under
   realistic models of UWB channel propagation demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed multiuser pre-equalization filter designs
   in mitigating ISI and MUI, and thus their ability to enable reliable
   pre-rake DS-UWB downlink transmission.}},

Abstract = {{The flow behavior of three different classes of granular materials -

   polypropylene beads (type-D) - is numerically investigated based on
   computational fluid dynamics. Three elbow geometries - square and
   circular (RID = 1.5 and 3.0) - are employed to investigate turbulent
   gas-particulate flow in dilute and dilute-to-dense phase modes of
   pneumatic conveying. The unsteady Eulerian-Discrete phase approach with
   renormalized group (RNG) k-epsilon model is adopted, with the effects of
   particulate phase velocity on the gas flow, turbulent dispersion, lift
   forces, and particle-wall collisions incorporated in the model. The
   phenomenon of particle roping is well captured by the computations.
   Significant phase separation and particle segregation are observed in
   the vicinity of the lower wall of the pipe. Different classes of
   particles exhibit very distinct flow dynamics in terms of particle
   roping, particle segregation, turbulent dispersion, and particle
   velocity fluctuations. Numerical predictions for pressure drop,
   particle, and gas velocity profiles are in satisfactory agreement with

Abstract = {{This study evaluates a new automated patient-specific method for
   epileptic seizure detection using scalp electroencephalogram (EEG). The
   method relies on a normalized wavelet-based index, named the combined
   seizure index (CSI), and requires a seizure example and a nonseizure EEG
   interval as reference. The CSI is derived for every epoch in each EEG
   channel and is sensitive to both the rhythmicity and relative energy of
   that epoch and the consistency of EEG patterns among different channels.
   Increasing significantly as seizures occur, the CSI is monitored using a
   one-sided cumulative sum test to generate appropriate alarms in each
   channel. A seizure alarm is finally generated according to channel-based
   information. The proposed method was evaluated using the scalp EEG test
   data of approximately 236 hours from 26 patients with a total of 79
   focal seizures, achieving a high sensitivity of approximately 91\% with
   a false detection rate of 0.33 per hour and a median detection latency
   of 7 seconds. In addition, statistical analysis revealed that the
   average CSI around the onset on the side of the focus in patients with
   temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is significantly greater than that of the
   opposite side (P < 0.001), indicating the capability of this index in
   lateralizing the seizure focus in this type of epilepsy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a structural model called ``PB3D{''} to perform
   nonlinear time history analyses of post and beam timber buildings under
   seismic loads. The model treats the three-dimensional structure as an
   assembly of roof/floor diaphragms and wall subsystems. The roof/floor
   diaphragms are modeled by beam elements and diagonal brace elements in
   order to take into account the in-plane stiffness. The wall system
   consists of vertical beam elements, for wall posts, as well as nonlinear
   shear springs to consider the contribution of diagonal wall bracing
   members or sheathing panels. The hysteretic characteristics of the shear
   springs are represented by a simplified, mechanics-based model named a
   ``pseudo-nail{''}. Standard finite element procedure is used to
   construct the system's equation of motion, which is solved by Newmark's
   integration. The model was verified against shake test results of a
   three-story post and beam building subjected to strong ground motions
   scaled to the 1995 Kobe earthquake. Model predictions agreed very well
   with the test results in terms of base shear forces and inter-story
   drift responses. This model provides a robust and efficient tool to
   study the seismic behavior of post and beam timber buildings.}},

Abstract = {{Lead-zirconate-titanate Pb(Zr,Ti)O-3 (PZT)-based actuators are being
   evaluated by the automotive industry for advanced fuel injection
   systems, including injection of hydrogen. However, hydrogen can
   penetrate PZT lattice with deleterious effects on the functionality and
   properties of PZT. The effect of long-term (200-1200 h) high-pressure
   (100 bar) hydrogen exposure on the microstructure and electrical
   properties of PZT has been investigated in the present work. It is found
   that while the hydrogen atmosphere has only superficial effects on the
   microstructure of bare PZT plates, it has considerable deleterious
   effects on the microstructure of electrode/PZT/electrode assembly. The
   degradation consisted of the development of a porous layer just beside
   the electrodes on the PZT surface, detachment of the electrodes from the
   PZT, and extensive damage to the Ag/Pd electrodes. The effect of
   hydrogen on the capacitance of the electrode/PZT/electrode assembly was
   also studied by online monitoring of the changes in capacitance in H-2;
   no noticeable changes were observed in capacitance during the hydrogen
   treatment under the given conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper advances a novel approach that facilitates the location of

   improves scalability and reduces packet traffic overhead by advancing a

   migration of a single directory through the network. This investigation
   demonstrates that modelling the directory replication problem as a
   Semi-Markov Decision Problem solved by means of a Reinforcement Learning
   technique known as Q-learning improves the performance of SDPP. Computer
   simulations validate the feasibility of the proposed scheme that enables
   packet overhead reductions between 15 and 75 \%, whereas the directory
   location success rate improves by up to 11\% when compared with pure
   broadcast flooding and other existing approaches in wireless networks

Abstract = {{Although hollow microneedles have been proposed as an effective and
   convenient method for transdermal drug delivery, their expensive
   fabrication techniques to date have prevented their mass fabrication as
   a viable option. A novel method, based on solvent casting, is presented
   for inexpensive fabrication of hollow out-of-plane polymer microneedles.
   Microneedles are formed during a solvent evaporation process, which
   leaves a polymer layer around pillars in a prefabricated mold. The mold
   is fabricated using photolithography and can be used for consecutive
   solvent casting of microneedles. Arrays of microneedles with lengths up
   to 250 mu m have been fabricated from clay-reinforced polyimide. Several
   mechanical tests were performed on solvent cast solid structures to find
   the optimum clay percentage in the polyimide that would lead to the
   highest compressive strength. The fabricated needles were tested for
   robustness, and it was observed that the needles were capable of
   withstanding on average compressive loads of up to 0.32 N. The
   suitability of the microneedles for skin penetration and drug delivery
   was demonstrated by injection of fluorescent beads into a skin sample.

Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The reaction of CH3OH in the presence of CO at 101 kPa over K- or
   Cs-promoted Cu-MgO is reported. The selectivity to methyl formate was
   >92 C-atom\% whereas selectivity to CO2 and C-2 species (ethanol and
   acetic acid) was <8 C-atom\% at 498 and 523 K over the promoted 5 wt\%
   Cu-MgO catalyst. The activity increased as the Cu loading was increased
   from 5 wt\% to 40 wt\%, whereas at the same conversion, the product
   distribution was almost the same over both the 0.5 wt\% Cs-5 wt\% Cu-MgO
   and the 0.5 wt\% Cs-40 wt\% Cu-MgO catalysts. At approximately constant
   specific basicity, an increase in Cu-0 surface area of the promoted
   Cu-MgO catalysts correlated with an increased methyl formate yield,
   whereas no correlation between Cu2+ surface area and methyl formate
   yield was observed. The results suggest that methyl formate is formed on
   Cu-0 sites as opposed to Cu2+ sites. The mechanism of methyl formate
   formation from CH3OH over the promoted Cu-MgO catalysts is discussed in
   view of these results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a powerful tool for
   monitoring brain functional activities. Due to its non-invasive and
   non-restraining nature, fNIRS has found broad applications in brain
   functional studies. However, for fNIRS to work well, it is important to
   reduce its sensitivity to motion artifacts. We propose a new
   wavelet-based method for removing motion artifacts from fNIRS signals.
   The method relies on differences between artifacts and fNIRS signal in
   terms of duration and amplitude and is specifically designed for spike
   artifacts. We assume a Gaussian distribution for the wavelet
   coefficients corresponding to the underlying hemodynamic signal in
   detail levels and identify the artifact coefficients using this
   distribution. An input parameter controls the intensity of artifact
   attenuation in trade-off with the level of distortion introduced in the
   signal. The method only modifies wavelet coefficients in levels
   adaptively selected based on the degree of contamination with motion
   artifact. To demonstrate the feasibility of the method, we tested it on
   experimental fNIRS data collected from three infant subjects. Normalized
   mean-square error and artifact energy attenuation were used as criteria
   for performance evaluation. The results show 18.29 and 16.42 dB
   attenuation in motion artifacts energy for 700 and 830 nm wavelength
   signals in a total of 29 motion events with no more than -16.7 dB
   distortion in terms of normalized mean-square error in the artifact-free
   regions of the signal.}},

Abstract = {{In cognitive radio (CR) networks, cooperative relaying is emerging as a
   key technology to improve the performance of secondary users (SUs),
   while ensuring the quality of service of primary transmissions. Most
   previous work in CR relay networks concentrates on maximizing physical
   layer data rate as a design criterion. However, the end-to-end
   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) performance perceived by SUs is
   largely ignored. In this paper, we take a cross-layer approach to
   jointly consider best-relay selection, power allocation, adaptive
   modulation and coding and data-link layer frame size to maximize the TCP
   throughput over CR relay networks based on the underlay paradigm, while
   guaranteeing that the primary link is provided with a minimum-rate for a
   certain percentage of time. Specifically, we formulate the CR relay
   network as a restless bandit system. The objective is to maximize TCP
   throughput as well as prolong network lifetime. Simulation results are
   presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{We study a cellular system scenario where multiple data streams
   originating from a base station (BS) targeted to multiple cell-edge
   mobile stations (MSs) are transmitted via pre-installed cooperative
   relay stations (RSs) with multiple antennas. Our objective is to
   guarantee quality-of-service (QoS) in terms of predefined
   signal-to-noise ratio at such users within the transmit power budgets at
   BS and RSs while minimizing total transmit power. We propose a novel
   precoder design method for power allocation between multiple data
   streams at BS and RS by using joint zero-forcing strategy in order to
   avoid multiuser interference (MUI) in the signal received by MSs via
   both the direct and relay links. We also propose low-complexity
   suboptimal power allocation algorithm. We focus on analyzing the
   significance of direct link transmission in providing QoS to cell-edge
   MSs specially when RS is not situated directly between BS and MSs.
   Simulation results show that considering direct link and using the
   proposed scheme in such case significantly improves system outage
   performance compared to existing schemes in the literature which do not

Abstract = {{This paper formulates and solves a sequential detection problem that

   that the optimal decision is characterized by a monotone policy on the

   monotone structure implies that numerically efficient algorithms can be
   designed to estimate and implement monotone parametrized decision
   policies. The sequential detection problem is motivated by applications
   in radar scheduling where the aim is to maintain the mutual information

   studied in detail. The damping function of these PCLs was also
   determined in order to model their viscoelastic behaviour. The classic
   Wagner constitutive equation was found to represent the rheology of all
   PCL polymers quite well. Finally, the PCL processing instabilities were
   studied by capillary extrusion using a number of capillary dies having
   various diameter and length-to-diameter ratios. Sharkskin and gross melt
   fracture was observed at different shear rates depending on the
   molecular characteristics of the resins and the geometrical details of

Title = {{Influence of veneer thickness on residual stress profile in veneering
   ceramic: Measurement by hole-drilling}},
Journal = {{DENTAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{160-167}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. The veneering process of frameworks induces residual
   stresses and can initiate cracks when combined with functional stresses.
   The stress distribution within the veneering ceramic as a function of
   depth is a key factor influencing failure by chipping. This is a
   well-known problem with Yttria-tetragonal-zirconia-polycrystal based
   fixed partial dentures. The objective of this study is to investigate
   the influence of veneer thickness on the stress profile in zirconia-and
   metal-based structures.
   Methods. The hole-drilling method, often used for engineering
   measurements, was adapted for use with veneering ceramic. The stress
   profile was measured in bilayered disc samples of 20 mm diameter, with a
   1 mm thick zirconia or metal framework. Different veneering ceramic
   thicknesses were performed: 1 mm, 1.5 mm, 2 mm, 2.5 mm and 3 mm.
   Results. All samples exhibited the same type of stress vs. depth
   profile, starting with compressive at the ceramic surface, decreasing
   with depth up to 0.5-1.0 mm from the surface, and then becoming
   compressive again near the framework, except for the 1.5 mm-veneered
   zirconia samples which exhibited interior tensile stresses. Stresses in
   the surface of metal samples were not influenced by veneer thickness.
   Variation of interior stresses at 1.2 mm from the surface in function of
   veneer thickness was inverted for metal and zirconia samples.
   Significance. Veneer thickness influences in an opposite way the
   residual stress profile in metal-and in zirconia-based structures. A
   three-step approach and the hypothesis of the crystalline transformation
   are discussed to explain the less favorable residual stress development
   in zirconia samples. (C) 2011 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by

Abstract = {{Peri-implant infections have been reported as one of the major
   complications that lead to the failure of orthopedic implants. An ideal
   solution to the peri-implant infection is to locally deliver
   antimicrobial agents through the implant surface. The rising problem of
   infections caused by multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria makes
   traditional antibiotics less desirable for the prevention of
   peri-implant infections. One of the promising alternatives is the family
   of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In this study, we report the local
   delivery of AMPs through the nanotubular structure processed on titanium
   surface. Self-organized and vertically oriented TiO2 nanotubes, about 80
   nm in diameter and 7 mu m thick, were prepared by the anodization
   technique. HHC-36 (KRWWKWWRR), one of the most potent broad-spectrum
   AMPs, was loaded onto the TiO2 nanotubes via a simple vacuum-assisted
   physical adsorption method. Antimicrobial activity testing against
   Gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, demonstrated that this
   AMP-loaded nanotubular surface could effectively kill the bacteria
   (99.9\% killing) and reduce the total bacterial number adhered to the
   surface after 4 h of culture. In vitro AMP elution from the nanotubes
   was investigated using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
   The release profiles strongly depended on the crystallinity of the TiO2
   nanotubes. Anatase TiO2 nanotubes released significantly higher amounts
   of AMP than amorphous nanotubes during the initial burst release stage.
   Both followed almost the same slow release profile from 4 h up to 7
   days. Despite the differences in release kinetics, no significant
   difference was observed between these two groups in bactericidal
   efficiency. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A,

Abstract = {{SENSitivity Encoding (SENSE) is a mathematically optimal parallel
   magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging technique when the coil sensitivities
   are known. In recent times, compressed sensing (CS)-based techniques are
   incorporated within the SENSE reconstruction framework to recover the
   underlying MR image. CS-based techniques exploit the fact that the MR
   images are sparse in a transform domain (e.g., wavelets).
   Mathematically, this leads to an l(1)-norm-regularized SENSE
   reconstruction.
   In this work, we show that instead of reconstructing the image by
   exploiting its transform domain sparsity, we can exploit its rank
   deficiency to reconstruct it. This leads to a nuclear norm-regularized
   SENSE problem. The reconstruction accuracy from our proposed method is
   the same as the l(1)-norm-regularized SENSE, but the advantage of our
   method is that it is about an order of magnitude faster. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The present study is concerned with the free vibration analysis of a
   horizontal rectangular plate, either immersed in fluid or floating on
   its free surface. The governing equations for a moderately thick
   rectangular plate are analytically derived based on the Mindlin plate
   theory (MPT), whereas the velocity potential function and Bernoulli's
   equation are employed to obtain the fluid pressure applied on the free
   surface of the plate. The simplifying hypothesis that the wet and dry
   mode shapes are the same, is not assumed in this paper. In this work, an
   exact-closed form characteristics equation is used for the plate
   subjected to a combination of six different boundary conditions. Two
   opposite sides are simply supported and any of the other two edges can
   be free, simply supported or clamped. To demonstrate the accuracy of the
   present analytical solution, a comparison is made with the published
   experimental and numerical results in the literature, showing an
   excellent agreement. Then, natural frequencies of the plate are
   presented in tabular and graphical forms for different fluid levels,
   fluid densities, aspect ratios, thickness to length ratios and boundary
   conditions. Finally, some 3-D mode shapes of the rectangular Mindlin
   plates in contact with fluid are illustrated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Most machine tools rely on precision ball screw drives to accurately
   position the workpiece relative to the tool. The quality of the
   machining outcome depends significantly on the tracking performance of
   the workpiece position over a desired trajectory. This paper addresses
   the minimization of the tracking error in a ball screw drive system in
   the presence of dynamic variations. Three sources of dynamic variations
   are considered: mechanical flexibility, runout of the ball screw shaft,
   and workpiece mass change during operations. Dynamic variations due to
   flexibility and runout are related to the workpiece position which is
   continuously measurable, while the variation caused by the workpiece
   mass change is uncertain. The ball screw drive system affected by
   dynamic variations is expressed as an uncertain linear model with
   time-varying parameters. Based on this model, servo controllers are
   designed such that their parameters are adjusted in real time by the
   measurable workpiece position to improve the tracking performance and
   that their performance is maintained robustly over uncertain mass
   variation. The importance of taking into account flexibility and runout
   of the shaft, as well as mass variation, explicitly in controller design
   is demonstrated through a ball screw drive experimental setup.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of a novel mathematical model that
   describes spray injection and spreading into a fluidized bed of solid
   particles. The model also includes the gas-liquid flow through the
   nozzle followed by the gas-assisted atomization. An Eulerian approach
   that is independent of the nature of the continuous phase is adopted for
   all phases, which are gas (or bubbles), liquid (or droplets), and solid
   particles that may be covered with a liquid layer. Variation in sizes of
   bubbles and droplets is represented by the particle number density
   approach that takes into account both break-up and coalescence. The
   atomization is considered as a catastrophic phase inversion triggered by
   a critical local volume fraction. New relationships were obtained for
   liquid spreading due to wet particle collisions and for heat conduction
   between a solid particle and a surrounding liquid layer. The model is
   applied to simulate liquid injection into the fluidized bed for
   conditions that were previously experimentally studied and published.
   The comparison reveals a reasonable agreement in prediction of the
   cumulative liquid distribution for two experimental cases. In addition,
   we evaluated a jet penetration distance with the model to compare it
   with the one measured in another set of experiments. This comparison
   also yields a good qualitative agreement. Finally, we evaluated the
   influence of the fluidization velocity on liquid distribution in the

Abstract = {{The performance of two gas/liquid contact modes was evaluated in
   relation to the rate of gas hydrate formation. Hydrate formation
   experiments were conducted for several gas mixtures relevant to natural
   gas hydrate formation in the earth (CH(4), CH(4)/C(3)H(8),
   CH(4)/C(2)H(6) and CH(4)/C(2)H(6)/C(3)H(8)) and two CO(2) capture and
   storage (CO2. CO(2)/H(2)/C(3)H(8)). One set of experiments was conducted
   in a bed of silica sand, saturated with water (fixed fed column) while
   the other experiment was conducted in a stirred vessel for each gas/gas
   mixture. Both sets of experiments were conducted at a constant
   temperature. The rate of hydrate formation is customarily correlated
   with the rate of gas consumption. The results show that the rate of
   hydrate formation in the fixed bed column is significantly greater and
   thereby resulted in a higher percent of water conversion to hydrate in
   lesser reaction time for all the systems studied. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The separate anodic and cathodic overpotentials in a proton exchange
   membrane fuel cell (activation, ohmic, concentration and mass transport)
   were measured in conventional and segmented hardware via reference
   electrodes, and multi-component gas analysis. The results show that the
   anodic overpotentials cannot be ignored, even when the operating
   conditions are changed at the cathode only.
   Under drying conditions the difference in the current density across the
   active area creates in-plane thermal gradients due to inhomogeneous
   reaction rates, and water phase changes. The resulting inhomogeneous
   temperature distributions can result in membrane and electrode
   degradation.
   The combination of reference electrodes and multi-component gas analysis
   enables the measurement and calculation of kinetic and diffusion
   parameters that can be used for modeling, and improved fuel cell design,
   efficiency, and durability. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by

   explain the particle attrition mechanisms and to build an attrition
   model. Fines generation processes differed for limestone particles of
   different initial sizes, especially in the initial stage, because of the
   effects of rough surfaces and cumulative damage needed for attrition. In
   the model, the fines generation rates in the initial stage was well
   fitted by an exponential function with an index inversely proportional
   to the particle volume until stable stages were reached, whereas the
   rate of fines generation during the stable stage appeared to be constant

Abstract = {{Highly ordered arrays of Co1-xZnx (0 <= x <= 0.74) nanowires (NWs) with
   diameters of similar to 35 nm and high length-to-diameter ratios (up to
   150) were fabricated by co-electrodeposition of Co and Zn into pores of
   anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) templates. The Co and Zn contents of the
   NWs were adjusted by varying the ratio of Zn and Co ion concentrations
   in the electrolyte. The effect of the Zn content, electrodeposition
   conditions (frequency and pH) and annealing on the structural and
   magnetic properties (e.g., coercivity (Hc) and squareness (Sq)) of NW
   arrays were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning
   electron microscopy, electron diffraction, and alternating gradient
   force magnetometer (AGFM). XRD patterns reveal that an increase in the
   concentration of Zn ions of the electrolyte forces the hcp crystal
   structure of Co NWs to change into an amorphous phase, resulting in a
   significant reduction in Hc. It was found that the magnetic properties
   of NWs can be significantly improved by appropriate annealing process.
   The highest values for Hc (20500e) and Sq (0.98) were obtained for NWs
   electrodeposited using 0.95/0.05 Co:Zn concentrations at 200 Hz and
   annealed at 575 degrees C. While the pH of electrolyte is found to have
   no significant effect on the structural and magnetic properties of the
   NW arrays, the electrodeposition frequency has considerable effects on
   the magnetic properties of the NW arrays. The changes in magnetic
   property of NWs are rooted in a competition between shape anisotropy and
   magnetocrystalline anisotropy in NWs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Estimating the bending modulus of a FtsZ bacterial-division protein
   filament}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{1, 1}},
Month = {{JAN 3}},
Abstract = {{FtsZ, a cytoskeletal protein homologous to tubulin, is the principle
   constituent of the division ring in bacterial cells. It is known to have
   force-generating capacity in vitro and has been conjectured to be the
   source of the constriction force in vivo. Several models have been
   proposed to explain the generation of force by the Z ring. Here we
   re-examine data from in vitro experiments in which Z rings formed and
   constricted inside tubular liposomes, and we carry out image analysis on
   previously published data with which to better estimate important model
   parameters that have proven difficult to measure by direct means. We
   introduce a membrane-energy-based model for the dynamics of multiple Z
   rings moving and colliding inside a tubular liposome and a fluid model
   for the drag of a Z ring as it moves through the tube. Using this model,
   we estimate an effective membrane bending modulus of 500-700 pN nm. If
   we assume that FtsZ force generation is driven by hydrolysis into a
   highly curved conformation, we estimate the FtsZ filament bending
   modulus to be 310-390 pN nm(2). If we assume instead that force is
   generated by the non-hydrolysis-dependent intermediate curvature
   conformation, we find that B(f) > 1400 pN nm(2). The former value sits
   at the lower end of the range of previously estimated values and, if
   correct, may raise challenges for models that rely on filament bending
   to generate force.}},

Abstract = {{Can sophisticated global behavior be achieved by individual players
   locally optimizing their payoff functions and sharing information with
   neighbors? We present a novel regretbased stochastic approximation
   algorithm that is employed by individual players to achieve such a goal
   in a noncooperative game with neighborhood structure. Within
   neighborhoods, players receive local payoffs and observe the action
   profile of neighbors. Players also acquire global payoffs due to global
   interaction with players outside neighborhood, however, are oblivious to
   their action profile. Motivated by engineering applications such as
   cognitive radio and smart sensor systems, the parameters of the game
   model (e.g. payoff functions, neighborhood structure) may evolve with
   time according to a Markov process. It is proved that the global
   behavior emergent by all players following the adaptive algorithm
   properly tracks the time-evolving set of correlated epsilon-equilibrium

Abstract = {{This paper investigates a novel method for estimating the direction of
   arrival of acoustic waves for ultrasound imaging arrays using the
   asymmetric mode components of CMUTs. The method is based on the
   correlation between the amplitude of resonant asymmetric mode of the
   CMUT membrane and the arriving angles of the acoustic waves. The
   asymmetric mode can be extracted by subtracting the signals received by
   a multi-electrode CMUT cell and filtering in the frequency domain. FEM
   and acoustic field simulations show that the sensitivity of
   distinguishing the angles is higher using the asymmetric mode of a
   single CMUT cell than simple subtraction of neighboring cells. An
   experimental analysis was performed of a multi-electrode CMUT cell and
   asymmetric behavior was demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Design tools to simulate the manufacturing processes applied to aluminum
   components require computationally efficient finite element methods.
   While static processes such as casting employ implicit techniques,
   dynamic processes such as forging may only be modeled with explicitly. A
   commonplace practice to expedite explicit simulations is to employ time
   or mass scaling, which can lead to unexpected thermal-mechanical
   behaviour in coupled analyses. In both cases, the development of fully
   coupled thermo-mechanical simulations necessitates the use of a
   constitutive model that is capable of defining the flow stress as a
   function of temperature, strain, and strain rate. In this work, a
   material model for as-cast A356 is presented and applied in a range of
   fully coupled deformation models. Implicit and unsealed explicit models
   will be compared to explicit models with large amounts of scaling.
   Strategies for applying a material model to minimize error and maximize
   computational effort are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The Flexcaster (R) is a strip casting technology that transforms liquid
   aluminum into a directly rollable cast ingot that is not subject to
   scalping or homogenization processing. This technology is characterized
   by relatively high solidification and cooling rates and was used to
   lab-produce AlMg-based alloys with minor additions of Sc and/or Zr. The
   presence of these is known to develop strengthening phases that also
   influence other metallurgical phenomena such as recovery and
   recrystallization. Aging experiments were performed on as-cast and
   cold-rolled samples to study the evolution of strengthening precipitates
   and their impact on recovery and recrystallization. Two Al-3\% Mg alloys
   were cast, one Sc-free and the other containing 0.4\% Sc. Both alloys
   were artificially aged following casting at 300 and 400 degrees C for
   times ranging from 30s to 72h. The samples were characterized by
   hardness and electrical resistivity measurements. Results show enhanced
   strengthening in the Sc-containing alloy and superior high temperature
   microstructural stability.}},

   exchanger systems is a growth area. This work involves the development
   of a series of linked mathematical models which describe microstructure

   is necessary to link the processes and track microstructure through the

   step is critical to control the morphology, shape and spatial
   distribution of second phase particles, i.e. dispersoids and constituent
   particles. The results of i) a chemistry dependent finite difference
   model for homogenization, ii) a finite element based hot extrusion model

   extrusion of AA3xxx aluminum alloys, which are used in heat exchanger

   conditions for AA3003 was conducted using a laboratory scale fully
   instrumented extrusion press. Billets previously homogenized at
   different conditions were extruded with a variety of extrusion ratios
   and ram speeds. Extrusion samples were characterized with the use of
   optical microscopy. A full range of microstructures from recrystallized
   to unrecrystallized, with a wide range of final grain sizes and spatial
   variation were obtained. The results have been rationalized in
   comparison with processing conditions from the trials. It has been found
   that the extent of recrystallization is related to the homogenization
   treatment, with regards to the dispersoids number density of the
   structure, and ram speed.}},

Abstract = {{Due to an excellent combination of strength, formability, corrosion
   resistance and material cost, extruded Al-Mn alloys (e. g. AA3003) are
   widely used in heat exchanger applications for automotive and off road
   applications. Grain size control is essential, as it affects important
   properties such as corrosion resistance, strength and formability. The
   present work describes experimental observations on the microstructure
   resulting from different homogenization practices of AA3003 which modify
   the dispersoid distribution and the initial grain size. This work
   considers deformation by cold rolling to reductions of 10-80 pct
   followed by annealing at the temperature range of 350 to 600 degrees C.
   Preliminary results show that there is a critical temperature below
   which concurrent precipitation of Mn-bearing dispersoids retards
   recovery and static recrystallization giving rise to different
   recrystallized grain sizes. The effect of initial grain size was
   observed to be significant when there were almost no dispersoids with
   cold reductions of 10-20 pct.}},

   has potential uses in the design of new tankhouses as well as in the

   models of a single cell have been adapted to the industrial dynamic
   process simulation software, CADSIM Plus. Based on the inlet
   concentration, current density, and electrode setup, the simulation can
   predict many parameters, including outlet concentrations, flow rates,
   current efficiency and energy consumption. Multiple cells have been
   simulated simultaneously, allowing for an entire hypothetical tankhouse
   to be modeled. The simulation can be used to dynamically predict the
   conditions in a zinc tanldiouse throughout an operation time scale.
   Further applications of this model include, tracking impurity buildup,
   modeling of recycle streams and the development of new flow regimes

   polarization (CPP), have been employed to study the kinetics of ferric
   reduction on chalcopyrite in aqueous Fe(II)-Fe(III)-H2SO4 solution at 25
   degrees C and 70 degrees C. Results from the calculation of speciation
   in the above solution reveal that, at both 25 degrees C and 70 degrees
   C, the real Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio is much lower than the nominal ratio, which
   leads to smaller values for the reversible potential of the
   ferric/ferrous couple based on the Nernst equation. Exchange current
   densities of the ferric/ferrous couple were obtained by extrapolating
   the cathodic linear Tafel line to the reversible potential and are on
   the order of 10(-7)-10(-6)A/cm(2) at 25 degrees C and
   10(-6)-10(-5)A/cm(2) at 70 degrees C, respectively. The transfer
   coefficients were about 0.35-0.38 at 25 degrees C and 0.35-0.45 at 70
   degrees C. Polarization plots of CPC and CPP under different nominal
   Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios are in good agreement at 25 degrees C and at 70 degrees

   The potentiodynamic and potentiostatic polarizations of chalcopyrite
   revealed the formation of a passive film on the surface of chalcopyrite.
   From the potentiostatic study in the passive potential region, a
   decrease in the dissolution current density by increasing the potential
   was observed. From this, it was concluded that the passive film is an
   n-type semiconductor and cation interstitial defects or anion vacancies
   are the charge carriers. From multi-cyclic voltammetry studies, four
   cathodic peaks at similar to 0.37, 0.30, -0.10 and -0.20 V-SHE were
   detected on the surface of a passivated chalcopyrite electrode. The
   cathodic peaks at 0.37 and 0.30 V were connected to ferric to ferrous
   reduction and copper sulfide formation, respectively. The peaks at -0.10
   and -0.20 were related to chalcopyrite reduction. The products of the
   chalcopyrite reduction reactions were suggested to be Cu2S, Cu9Fe8S16
   and Cu5FeS4 and evolution of hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S).}},

Abstract = {{Gold and silver nanoparticles (NPs) were deposited on pyrite at ambient
   temperature from colloidal solutions prepared by reduction of hydrogen
   tetrachloroaurate or silver nitrate by sodium sulfide or sodium
   tetrahydridoborate. The nanoparticles were characterized using
   Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy and the experimental spectra
   were fitted using Mie - Gans modeling. The modified pyrite was
   investigated using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS).
   Electrodes were prepared from both natural and modified pyrite samples
   and were modeled using an equivalent circuit (EC) based on the EIS data.
   The comparison of the results revealed a decrease in charge transfer
   resistance for the ferric ferrous redox couple associated with the
   modified pyrite. From this behavior it is concluded that the electronic
   transport between the nanoparticles and the electrode surface over
   distances in nanometer scale is enhanced. Nanoparticles below a certain
   size act as quantum dots due to electronic confinement. Decreased
   charged transfer resistance at the nanometer scale may be caused by
   electron transport through tunneling mechanism via quantum dots.}},

   Tellurium oxidation occurs at a similar potential in water and cyanide,

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose TCP Vegas with online network coding (TCP
   VON), which incorporates online network coding into TCP. It is shown
   that the use of online network coding in transport layer can improve the
   throughput and reliability of the end-to-end communication. Compared to
   generation based network coding, in online network coding, packets can
   be decoded consecutively instead of generation by generation. Thus,
   online network coding incurs a low decoding delay. In TCP VON, the
   sender transmits redundant coded packets when it detects packet losses
   from acknowledgement. Otherwise, it transmits innovative coded packets.
   We establish a Markov chain to analytically model the average decoding
   delay of TCP VON. We also conduct ns-2 simulations to validate the
   proposed analytical model. Finally, we compare the delay and throughput
   performance of TCP VON and automatic repeat request (ARQ) network coding
   based TCP (TCP ARQNC). Simulation results show that TCP VON outperforms
   TCP ARQNC in terms of the average decoding delay and network throughput.}},

Abstract = {{Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a ubiquitous wireless
   technology which allows objects to be identified automatically. An RFID
   tag is a small electronic device with an antenna and has a unique
   identification number. RFID tags can be categorized into passive and
   active tags. For passive tags, there exists a standard communication
   protocol called EPC-global Generation-2, or briefly EPC Gen-2 {[}1]. In
   this paper, we investigate the EPC Gen-2 protocol and model it using an
   absorbing Markov chain. We formulate the proposed model and calculate
   the expected number of queries required to identify all tags in the
   system. Extensive simulations validate and confirm the accuracy of our
   proposed analytical model. Without this model, one has to run
   simulations and average the results to obtain the expected number of
   required queries for any given number of tags in the system. Using the
   mathematical formulations provided, there is no need to rely on
   simulations for studying the behavior of the EPC Gen-2 protocol and we
   are able to calculate the number of required queries directly. Our
   proposed analytical model is also useful in studying and comparing other
   RFID protocols, and in deploying better protocols for RFID systems.}},

Abstract = {{A learning strategy for distributed channel selection in Cognitive Radio
   networks is proposed. This strategy helps quality of service (QoS)
   provisioning such that competing secondary users cooperatively converge
   to their rank-optimal channels while channel availability statistics are
   initially unknown. By this convergence, collision reaches zero since
   users eventually work on their own orthogonal channels. The proposed
   learning strategy, k(th) = M AB, is inspired from the Multi-Armed Bandit
   problem but it converges to the k(th) best arm. The rank-optimal channel
   for each user is identified based on the user's QoS demands. We believe
   that this learning and allocation policy provides a better level of QoS
   for secondary users since evaluation results represent order optimality
   in terms of the average throughput.}},

Abstract = {{In cognitive radio (CR) systems, harmful interference from the secondary
   system degrades the data rate of the primary system. However, this
   interference may be beneficial to the primary system in terms of the
   secrecy rate, when unauthorized users eavesdrop on the primary link.
   This paper explores multiple-input single-output (MISO) CR systems where
   the secondary system secures the primary communication in return for
   permission to use the spectrum. In this context, the optimal
   transmission strategy has to be found which provides the best tradeoff
   between the useful and harmful effects of interference on the secrecy
   rate of the primary system. Considering the cases of perfect and
   imperfect channel state information of the eavesdroppers we formulate
   optimization problems for maximizing the primary secrecy rate under
   secondary data rate requirements. The resulting non-convex optimization
   problems are solved through a sequence of convex semidefinite programs.
   The simulation results reveal that the proposed schemes improve the
   secrecy level of the primary system while meeting the data rate
   requirements of the secondary system.}},

   frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE). We first derive the optimal
   minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) frequency-domain linear equalization
   filter at the destination and the associated stream-wise MSEs at the
   output of the equalizer. Subsequently, we optimize the source and relay
   precoding matrices for various optimality criteria by minimizing a
   general function of the MSEs subject to separate source and relay power
   constraints. The structures of the optimal source and relay precoding
   matrices are obtained in closed form and the remaining power allocation
   problems are solved using an alternating optimization algorithm.
   Simulation results show that the proposed SC-FDE designs outperform
   orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing based MIMO relay systems in

Abstract = {{Video sensor networks (VSNs) offer an alternative to several existing
   surveillance technologies. However, unlike in conventional sensor
   network, video processing and transmission requires large amount of
   resources both in signal processing, i.e., encoding, and transmission of
   the encoded data. For such networks, an optimal encoding power and rate
   allocation method based on a power-rate-distortion (PRD) analysis has
   previously been proposed, where the power consumption of video encoding
   can be controlled by managing some encoding parameters. However, these
   parameters are currently obtained offline by examining the stored video,
   an approach which may not be suitable for surveillance applications. In
   this paper, a distance based heuristic for encoding power and rate
   allocation of VSNs is proposed. The proposed technique is a practical
   solution since the video coding parameter is controlled by the node's
   location in the network. Although the proposed technique offers a
   sub-optimal solution, in some scenarios it achieves performance up to
   94\% of the optimal solution in terms of network lifetime.}},

Abstract = {{Body Area Networks (BANs), targeting everywhere anytime health
   monitoring, operate in license-exempt frequency bands. They require a
   cross layer design that jointly considers the requirements of (1) access
   delay to the medium and (2) packet delivery ratio (PDR). In this paper,
   we experimentally evaluate the PDR of a BAN under static and dynamic
   scheduling schemes. Investigations show that static multi-hop routing
   enhances PDR with the help of packet relaying, but at the cost of using
   more transmission slots in the shared medium, which may compromise
   access delay. To reduce this cost, we propose a dynamic scheduling
   approach that adapts to BAN topology changes resulting from body
   movements. Our extensive experimental results indicate that for BANs
   colloccated with other wireless systems, our dynamic multi-hop
   scheduling is mandatory for satisfaction of the PDR constraint.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative communication when other mobile nodes could act as potential
   relays, poses significant challenge in designing relay selection
   algorithms due to the information asymmetry between the source and the
   potential relays. The potential relays in this case are better informed
   about their channel conditions than the source. Therefore, the source
   must provide them with incentive to reveal their information and hence
   for their participation in relaying. In this paper, we study the problem
   of relay selection under a budget constraint when there is such an
   information asymmetry. By leaving the bargaining power only to the
   source, we propose a simple relay selection mechanism that requires
   limited interaction with potential relays and their participation is
   also voluntary. We will first use contract theory to formulate incentive
   compatible contracts that can be broadcasted to nearby mobile nodes
   which can act as potential relays. Once these mobile nodes notify the
   contracts they are willing to accept, source then optimally selects a
   set of relays based on this information. We analyze the performance of
   this mechanism by simulations and discuss the effect of information
   asymmetry.}},

Abstract = {{During modeling of the friction stir welding (FSW) process, the
   prediction of strain range experienced by the material is important as
   it affects the microstructure and mechanical properties of the final
   weld {[}1-7]. For aluminum alloys, this range has been reported very
   scarcely and/or scattered widely in the literature (the range of the
   maximum equivalent plastic strain has been reported to be from 2.4 to
   184 {[}8-24]). A new approach is proposed in this article for measuring
   strain during friction stir welding using visioplasticity. In this
   approach, strains are calculated from changes in the boundaries of a
   small cylindrical Al- 30 \% SiC composite marker mounted in the
   advancing side of mid-plane of adjacent plates during welding. The
   marker shape change is observed by a ``stop action{''} (freeze-in)
   technique midway the process. COMSOL numerical modeling is then used to
   compute the strain distribution using the observed boundary changes
   compared to the initial marker boundaries. As an illustrative example,
   the method is applied to the results reported by London et al. {[}25]
   for the friction stir welding of 6.35 mm thick 7050 aluminum plates,
   welded with tool RPM of 350, welding speed of 1.69 mm/sec, tool pin
   diameter of 8 mm, tool shoulder diameter of 24 mm, and tool tilt angle
   of 3 degrees. A lower and upper bound of cumulative equivalent plastic
   strain of 14.1 and 20.3, respectively, were found to be in the
   neighborhood where the marker enters the severe deformation zone at
   mid-plane of plates in front of the leading edge of the pin.}},

Abstract = {{Popularity and application of composite materials are increasing in
   several industries including transportation, construction and aerospace.
   The mechanical properties of these materials should be known to
   engineers to be able to design/select new products. Impact resistance is
   one of the properties which have been studied extensively over the past
   years and still is an ongoing topic in composites research. Since
   analytical solutions have not been fully developed for the impact
   characterization of anisotropic materials, researchers often perform
   mechanical testing in conjunction with visual inspection methods to
   investigate the impact behavior of composite materials. The present
   study shows that flexural toughness can be used as a parameter in the
   design/material selection stage in the evaluation of pre- and post-
   impact damage of composite laminates. A series of drop-weight impact
   tests, using a 200J energy level, were performed on specimens made of
   four different stacking configurations of TWINTEX (R) and unidirectional
   laminates (polypropylene and glass fiber commingled composites)
   according to ASTM D7136. The damaged areas of the impacted specimens
   were measured using image analysis. Four-point flexural testing was then
   carried out, based on ASTM D7264, on both non-impacted and impacted
   specimens. Damaged area and flexural toughness, along with a set of
   other commonly used mechanical properties, were selected as measures for
   damage evaluation. Comparison of results before and after impact and
   under different criteria showed that in the present case study, visual
   inspection is not sufficient in predicting the post-impact properties of
   the tested specimens and can be misleading. On the other hand, flexural
   toughness could give a much clearer perspective on the extent of
   post-impact resistance of the specimens.}},

Abstract = {{The amount of the liquid water present at the gas diffusion layer (GDL)
   has an impact on the diffusivity, capillary pressure and the
   permeability which in turn influences convective and diffusive
   transport. A prodigious amount of research has been conducted to study
   and measure the different properties (time of breakthrough and capillary
   pressure versus saturation) associated with the breakthrough condition.
   However, most of the reported data ignored the impact of expansion of
   different components in the set-up (such as tubing) and the condition
   after the time of breakthrough. The focus of this study is to measure
   the breakthrough pressure and time of breakthrough and hence determine
   the liquid water content inside the GDL before the time of breakthrough.
   The measurements are performed for different samples to study the effect
   of the thickness and hydrophobic contents. The results show that
   expansion has significant difference in the determination of water

Abstract = {{Automatic and reliable reconstruction of sharp features remains an open
   research issue in triangle mesh surface reconstruction. This paper
   presents a new feature sensitive mesh reconstruction method based on
   dependable neighborhood geometric information per input point. Such
   information is derived from the matching result of the local umbrella
   mesh constructed at each point. The proposed algorithm is different from
   the existing post-processing algorithms. The proposed algorithm
   reconstructs the triangle mesh via an integrated and progressive
   reconstruction process and features a unified multi-level inheritance
   priority queuing mechanism to prioritize the inclusion of each candidate
   triangle. A novel flatness sensitive filter, referred to as the normal
   vector cone filter, is introduced in this work and used to reliably
   reconstruct sharp features. In addition, the proposed algorithm aims to
   reconstruct a watertight manifold triangle mesh that passes through the
   complete original point set without point addition and removal. The
   algorithm has been implemented and validated using publicly available
   point cloud data sets. Compared to the original object geometry, it is
   seen that the reconstructed triangle meshes preserve the sharp features
   well and only contain minor shape deviations.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric stack actuators are commonly used in a number of different
   position control applications due to their compactness, high resolution,
   speed and dynamic properties. For accurate position control, position
   feedback has traditionally been employed since the parameters of the
   constitutive equations change with temperature and age. In addition, the
   identification of constitutive parameters is complicated by the presence
   of hysteresis voltage that is not accounted for in the linear
   constitutive equations.
   Recently, there has been a push towards sensor less control. This
   approach requires an accurate identification technique of the
   constitutive parameters. For this purpose, the constitutive equations
   used to identify the piezoelectric parameters are usually considered
   linear under a low electric field. However, at larger driving voltages
   hysteresis effect become significant and the parameters identified at
   lower excitation levels are no longer valid. This is traditionally
   addressed by providing constitutive parameters as a function of applied
   voltage. However, this is usually done for the ascending hysteresis
   branch only. The changes due to the descending hysteresis branch are
   commonly ignored. As a result, it is often difficult to match the
   constitutive equations to experimental data.
   We propose a new identification procedure that is based on online
   capacitance measurements of the piezo actuators. These measurements
   indicate, that the piezo capacitance is not constant, but a linear
   function of linearized piezo voltage. Using this result, we are able to
   construct values for the remaining constitutive parameters that are
   largely independent of piezo voltage. The resulting constitutive
   equations match our experimental actuator performance well no matter
   where they are applied in the hysteresis loop.
   This new identification technique then provides more accurate piezo
   models that are very useful for developing sensor less control
   strategies for piezo actuators.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrodynamics of impingement flow is a key partner of heat transfer
   analysis of run-out table (ROT) cooling. The long circular free-surface
   water jets with industrial parameters (e.g. Re = 16,000-50,000) were
   numerically simulated by laminar and two variants of turbulent k-epsilon
   and k-omega models where the effect of gravity is significant. The
   development of water impingement film was computed and compared with the
   experimental data which obtained from the ROT facility. The propagation
   of water flow over the impingement surface is better simulated by Shear
   Stress transition k-omega (SST) model. The impingement flow features
   such as jet deceleration before hitting wall and velocity and pressure
   profiles were compared with short jet data to explore common flow
   characteristics between the short and long jets. The effect of target
   surface on retardation of long turbulent liquid jet before incident is
   pronouncing as jet Reynolds number increased. However, the velocity
   reduction is not noticeable until where the speed of short jet starts
   decreasing. In impingement zone, the flow radial velocity varies
   linearly similar to short liquid jets which gravity effect is neglected.
   But, the velocity gradient was found higher which shows enhanced heat
   transfer for a long turbulent water jet. The dimension of impingement
   zone as an influential region in boiling heat transfer analysis is found
   smaller respect to the estimation which used in ROT modeling. The effect
   of local impingement pressure on saturation temperature is found
   important in stagnation zone which influences the prediction of heat
   fluxes by boiling heat transfer correlations up to 9\%. This has to be
   considered in ROT modeling where the heat flux can be as high as 10
   Mw/m(2).}},

Abstract = {{As microprocessors become more complex, finding errors in their design
   becomes more difficult. Most design errors are caught before the chip is
   fabricated, however, some make it into the fabricated design. One
   challenge in determining what is wrong with a new design after
   fabrication is the lack of observability into the state of the
   fabricated chip. To address this challenge, BackSpace {[}1], {[}2]
   proposes generating a trace of the states that lead up to an erroneous
   state. To add one state to the trace, BackSpace first generates a set of
   possible predecessor states (the pre-image), then tests them one at a
   time to find one that is reached during execution. In this paper, we
   propose an improved algorithm called Progressive-BackSpace. It does not
   enumerate every state in the pre-image. Instead, it first finds a
   reachable candidate state, and then determines if it is a predecessor
   state. This results in a practical implementation of BackSpace by
   greatly reducing the time needed to find predecessor states. The
   hardware overhead is also reduced by 94.4\% relative to a recently
   proposed implementation of BackSpace {[}3]. These algorithms were
   implemented and evaluated on a RTL model of an out-of-order processor,
   that models non-deterministic effects.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-layer shear flows of viscous fluids are frequently vulnerable to
   interfacial instabilities. In the case of a duct flow, it is known that
   use of a yield stress fluid as the lubricating fluid, coupled with
   maintaining a plug region at the interface, can lead to flows that are
   hydrodynamically stable: linearly and nonlinearly, both theoretically
   and in laboratory experimental studies; see {[}1],{[}2], and {[}3].
   Whether the same technique is effective in stabilizing multi-layer duct
   flows with a visco-elastic core fluid is unknown and also relevant to
   many potential applications. In this paper we provide an experimental
   study by using viscoelastic fluid (Polyethylene Oxide solution) in the
   core region and visco-plastic fluid (Carbopol Solution) with yield
   stress as lubricant. The experiments have been carried out in
   axisymmetric configuration with different size of inner pipes. Via
   control of the individual fluid flow rates, it is also possible to vary
   the inner fluid radius over a significant range, which suggests utility
   for various industrial processes.}},

   circular water jet is conducted to explore experimentally the wetting
   region and the hydraulic jump as the front of wetted zone. The effects
   of surface motion on the wetting zone and the formation and location of
   hydraulic jump upstream the impingement point is examined by changing
   systematically the surface velocity and the jet flow rates. The surface
   motion impacted the radial evolution of wetted zone in all direction and
   decreased the radius of non-circular hydraulic jump. However, higher jet
   flow rate suppressed its effect. Both surface velocity and jet velocity
   or their velocity ratio has to be considered in adjusting jet space

Abstract = {{A Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation of near-field cough and sneeze
   droplet dispersion and heat and mass transfer is developed. In this
   study various sources of variability in cough and sneeze processes are
   considered. These are variations in injection volume (0.5l, 2.5l, and
   5.0l) and ambient relative humidity (20\%, 40\% and 60\%). There are a
   total of 9 simulations for coughs and sneezes in a quiescent background.
   A large ensemble (5000) of droplets are tracked with diameters in the
   range 1-500micron. Evaporation and dispersion are predicted as a
   function of droplet size. Generally, fine droplets evaporate faster than
   large droplets. Higher relative humidities slow the evaporation process.
   Larger droplets have greater axial penetration. They also exhibit
   greater vertical drop due to the effect of gravity. Sideway penetration
   is increased by higher injection volumes. The buoyancy effect due to
   thermal energy of the injection is very weak, at least for the 10-second
   computation duration.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations of the governing Navier-Stokes equations are used
   to predict the rupture and liquid distribution of stretching liquid
   bridges between two equal-sized solid spherical particles with different
   liquid-solid contact angles. A commercial computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) tool FLUENT - is used. The effects of the capillary number and
   contact angle on the rupture distance and liquid transfer fraction are
   studied.
   The simulation results show that for particles with different contact
   angles, the rupture distance increases as the capillary number is
   increased; this is similar to the case of particles with identical
   contact angles. Also, it is shown that for quasi-static conditions, the
   rupture distance decreases as the difference between the contact angles
   is increased. Plots of the variations of the liquid transfer fraction
   with respect to the capillary number show three zones: (1) for high
   capillary numbers, liquid is almost equally distributed (dynamic zone);
   (2) for low capillary numbers, the liquid transfer fraction depends on
   the contact angles and more liquid is transferred to the particle with
   the smaller contact angle (quasi-static zone); (3) at intermediate
   capillary numbers, the curve connecting the above limiting conditions
   resembles an S-shape (transition zone), showing the dependency of the
   liquid distribution on both capillary number and contact angles. The
   trends are consistent with the experimental findings published in the
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{Gas-assisted atomization is used in many industries to produce finely
   dispersed droplets. Knowledge about the droplet size distribution guides
   the design and development of the nozzle as well as of the whole
   processes. This knowledge can be obtained through experimental and
   modeling works that usually complement each another. In this paper we
   present an application of the mathematical model previously developed
   for gas-assisted atomization to the prediction of the average droplet
   diameter distribution in a spray and compare the results with
   experimental findings. The model is based on a two-fluid
   Eulerian-Eulerian treatment of the motion of the phases with a
   catastrophic phase inversion (atomization). It also includes the
   compressibility effects for the gaseous phase and can be applied to both
   the flow through the nozzleatomizer and to the dispersion of the spray.
   The model accounts for the break-up and coalescence of bubbles and
   droplets due to interfacial shear and collisions. The diameter of the
   particle (bubble or droplet) is represented by its local mean average
   value that varies throughout the flow field. Simulations are conducted
   for the flow of air and water through the convergent-divergent nozzle,
   which is similar to the one used in commercial fluid cokers, a bitumen
   upgrading apparatus, for steam-assisted atomization of bitumen. It is
   found that while there are wide experimentally observed local
   distributions of the particle diameter, the concept of the average
   diameter still allows for satisfactory predictions of its average values
   and spatial variations. In agreement with the experiments, the numerical
   model demonstrated that the largest droplet diameter is located in the
   axial area, and the diameter values reduce towards the periphery of the
   jet. In addition, the average diameter increases slightly and its radial
   variation becomes more uniform as the distance from the nozzle orifice
   increases.}},

Abstract = {{The human immune system is a network of cells, tissues, and other organs
   that defend the body against foreign invaders called antigens. Jerne's
   Idiotypic network theory concerns how an antibody in the immune system
   stimulates or suppresses another antibody and recognizes an antigen.
   Based on the principles of the human immune system and Jerne's idiotypic
   network theory this paper presents a method for cooperation among robots
   in a multi-robot system. The developed cooperative multi-robot system is
   fully autonomous and distributed. In the present paper, cooperation is
   not assumed a priori. If a robot is unable to complete a task alone, the
   system autonomously chooses the appropriate number of suitable and most
   capable robots in the fleet to cooperate with each other in carrying out
   a global task. The approach developed in the paper incorporates
   robustness and fault tolerance in immune system based multi-robot
   cooperation}},

Abstract = {{In cooperative multi-robot object transportation, several autonomous

   environment to transport an object to a goal location and orientation.
   The environment may consist of both fixed and removable obstacles and it

   environment. More than one robot may be required for handling heavy and
   large objects. This paper presents a modified Q-learning approach for
   object transportation utilizing cooperative and autonomous multiple
   mobile robots. A modified version of Q-learning is presented, which
   employs for effective robot coordination. A solution to the action

   the real time performance and robustness of the system. As required in
   the task, the paper presents an algorithm for object pose estimation, by

Abstract = {{The capabilities of humans and robots naturally compliment each other
   Humans excel at spatial problem solving and fine manipulation tasks,
   whereas robots are good at supporting and stabilizing heavy loads.
   However; the typical impedance control strategy employed in this domain
   does not communicate any of a robot's underlying physical constraints to
   its user In this work, we propose j-strips, an anthromimetic haptic cue
   designed to convey stress in a robot manipulator to its human user We
   hypothesize that when warned via j-strips that the robot is nearing a
   joint limit in this way, the human user will modify the path of the
   robot to avoid the limit. We present the results of a pilot study of
   three human subjects manipulating a robot arm that uses j-strips to warn
   its user when its elbow position limit is approached. Two of the
   subjects were found to significantly modify the manner in which they
   manipulated the robot, and both verbally reported that j-strips conveyed

Abstract = {{A novel method of modal analysis for vibration modeling of systems is
   presented in this paper. In the developed method, first, mode shapes of
   the structure that is being analyzed are approximated. The approximate
   mode shapes are expressed by fuzzy sets where approximate deflections or
   displacement magnitudes of the mode shapes are described by fuzzy
   linguistic terms such as Zero, Medium, and Large. Fuzzy membership
   functions provide a means of dealing with the imprecisely defined system
   and it gives access to a large repertoire of tools available in the
   field of fuzzy reasoning. Second, fuzzy representations of the
   approximate mode shapes, called Fuzzy Mode Shapes in this paper, are
   updated using modal analysis data as obtained through experimentation.
   Finally, artificial neural networks are used as a tool to obtain an
   accurate version of the mode shape data by learning the target set of
   the data. An appropriate analogy of the application of Fuzzy Mode Shapes
   in the first step is the Starting Mode Shape Vectors in numerical
   eigenvector problem where the starting vector is updated through an
   iterative process. In this paper iterative updating process of mode
   shapes is carried out for the application of experimental modal testing.
   In this approach the differences between the fuzzy mode shapes and the
   corresponding measured modal testing data are minimized through an
   iterative process.
   In validating the developed technique for vibration modeling of
   one-dimensional and two-dimensional elastic bodies and structures,
   modeling of elastic beams, a clamped-free-clamped-free plate and a frame
   are used as illustrative examples. The solutions of the corresponding
   simulations are compared with the results from finite element
   computations and analytical model solutions. The good agreement of the
   results obtained for these models justifies the application of the
   developed method in experimental vibration modeling of systems. Use of
   the fuzzy-neural approach as developed in the paper expands the coverage
   of experimentally measured data, which is normally limited to a small
   number of measurement sets due to the limited number of available
   vibration sensors in the analyzed system. Neural networks provide a
   satisfactory interpolation of two sets of data including a) modal test
   data, which is accurate but is normally available only for a few
   measured points, and b) Fuzzy Mode Shapes, which are available for large
   number of points but are approximate.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile cloud-based video gaming (MCVG) is an emerging trend in moving
   the online entertainment industry into the cloud era. In MING, the game
   engines are hosted in the cloud, and the rendered gaming videos are
   transmitted over wireless networks to the mobile devices. In reverse,
   game players' interactions on screens are sent to the cloud server over
   the same networks. flow to compress and transmit the real-time gaming
   video, so that during the gaming session, the expected server
   transmission rate over the bandwidth-limited wireless network is
   minimized while satisfying the quality of experience demanded by the
   players, is a great technical challenge that is addressed in this paper
   in a multi-player gaming context. We exploit the correlations between
   the gaming videos for distinct players in the same gaming scene to
   propose a cloud gaming system with cooperative video sharing, in which
   the cloud game server is able to efficiently encode and transmit
   multiple video streams to a group of players, while those players are
   able to decode their video in a cooperative manner by sharing contents
   via a secondary network such as ad hoc wireless local area network.
   Experimental results show that the expected server transmission rate can
   be significantly reduced compared to the conventional video encoding

Abstract = {{Air pollution has a significant impact of human health. As modem
   individuals spend most of the day in tightly insulated buildings, there
   is a strong need for strategies to improve the quality of indoor air. A
   number of air cleaning methods ranging from simple filtration to
   photonic technologies have been used in commercial and residential air
   purifiers. Recently, a novel technology called Nano-Confined Catalytic
   Oxidation (NCCO) has been developed. In this study, the potential of
   NCCO versus two other commonly-used air purifiers to reduce odor
   nuisances caused by ammonia, toluene and hydrogen sulfide is evaluated.
   Twenty volunteers are asked to evaluate the odor levels before and after
   air purification, in a safe, controlled environment. The changes in
   odorant concentrations are also measured. The findings suggest that the
   NCCO-based air purifier outperforms the two other common residential air

Abstract = {{Acoustic emission (AE) signals generated from defects in rolling element
   bearings are investigated analytically and experimentally in this paper.
   Roller element bearings are crucial parts of many machines and there has
   been an increasing demand for effective and reliable health monitoring
   of these data elements and for finding optimum procedures for the signal
   processing of the measured data to detect and diagnose the size and
   location of incipient defects in rolling element bearings. This paper
   describes a novel signal processing algorithm designed to diagnose
   localized defects on rolling element bearings components which has
   recently been tested for different operating speeds and loadings. The
   algorithm is based on optimizing the ratio of Kurtosis and Shannon
   entropy to obtain the optimal band pass filter utilizing wavelet packet
   transforms and envelope detection. Results show the superiority of the
   developed algorithm and its effectiveness in extracting bearing
   characteristic frequencies from the raw acoustic emission signals under
   different operating conditions. Also, the effects of defect size,
   operating speed, and loading conditions on AE burst duration have also
   been investigated to estimate the fault size on the outer race.}},

Abstract = {{The polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell is a zero emission
   power generation system that has long been considered as a replacement
   for conventional fossil fuel combustion systems. However, before
   constituting a viable market for commercial use, the fuel cell
   efficiency and reliability need to be improved significantly. It has
   been shown that water management has significant effect on the power and
   reliability of the cell as the electrolyte membrane must be well
   hydrated to allow for ion transfer while excess water blocks the
   activation sites on the cathode side. The latter effect is known as
   flooding which occurs at large current densities and compromises the
   normal operation of the fuel cell. To enhance water management, a
   prodigious amount of numerical models and experimental studies have been
   conducted to optimize the properties and structures of different layers.
   One of the key results of these studies has been the design of the flow
   field patterns on relatively hydrophobic surface of a graphite plate
   which is believed to provide a better mechanism for removing water
   droplets from the cathode flow channel. However, the wettability
   gradient between the catalyst layer (i.e., hydrophilic) and the flow
   channel (which is currently hydrophobic) introduces problems as the
   water droplets formed at the catalyst layer will not likely detach and
   hence create a film of liquid that will block the activation sites. If
   the flow channel is made out of a material that is more hydrophilic than
   the catalyst layer, water removal and transport will be enhanced as
   water naturally moves from low surface energy to high surface energy
   sites. Another major factor in controlling water in the PEM fuel cell is
   the flow field architecture. There has also been a large amount of
   research on different types of the flow field architectures. However,
   there have been no studies on the relative performance gains provided by
   changing the surface properties and the architecture separately. This
   paper presents an experimental analysis comparing two different flow
   fields with different surface properties, i.e., a hydrophilic gold flow
   channel and a hydrophobic graphite flow channel. The paper will also
   compare three different hydrophilic flow channel architectures: an open
   gold parallel flow channel, an aluminum foam filled parallel flow
   channel, and a woven wick filled parallel flow channel. This work will
   result in finding the optimum geometry and surface properties for
   achieving maximum performance in the flooding regime.}},

Abstract = {{A microfabrication technology with real-time polymer processing control
   is introduced in this work. The technique is titled electro-dispensing,
   as it employs a metal microdispensing tip that is biased with a
   user-defined voltage. The in-situ voltage directs an electric field
   through the underlying dispensed polymer structure. Polymer droplets are
   dispensed directly onto a chip with precise (pL) volumes, and the
   in-situ micro-dispensing tip voltage is varied to adjust the polymer
   droplet morphology during the microfabrication process. The technique is
   carried out within a glycerol ambient filler solution, to create an
   initial high contact angle (160 degrees) on the polymer microdroplets,
   and voltage tunability is applied to control the microdroplet shapes.
   Ultraviolet curing is subsequently employed to solidify the
   micro-spheroid structures on the desired locations across the chip. The
   electro-dispensing process is demonstrated in this work for numerous
   microdroplets, with a variety of polymer morphologies and diameters down
   to 150 mu m.
   The capabilities of the electro-dispensing process are also demonstrated
   in this work for a specific application relating to integrated photonic
   circuitry. Polymer microdroplets in the past have been limited to use as
   lenses for vertical beam focusing (through the plane of the chip),
   because of their exceedingly low contact angles on solid surfaces. In
   this work, polymer micro-droplets are introduced for lateral beam
   focusing and retroreflection (above and parallel to the plane of the
   chip). These new technologies for on-chip optical beam dispersion
   management are brought about by the capabilities of electro-dispensing:
   the use of an ambient filler allows the dispensing process to create
   high-contact-angle near-spherical microdroplets; the electro-dispensing
   process then allows this droplet to be tuned for its specific role
   within the integrated photonic chip (e.g. as a spherical element for
   in-plane focusing or an elliptical element for in-plane
   retroreflection). Ray-based analyses and electromagnetic models are used
   to characterize the optical responses of the micro-spheroid structures,
   and the results are compared to experimental measurements with on-chip
   laser beam control.}},

Abstract = {{Using internal temperature measurements from inside a solid to determine
   the initial or boundary conditions or material properties is a common
   inverse heat conduction problem. These problems are ill-posed in nature
   and a robust mathematical solution is not available for them.
   Stochastical search algorithms like Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle
   Swarm Optimization (PSO) have been found to be very effective in dealing
   with some of the challenges in solving inverse problems, such as time
   step size limit and sensitivity to the measurement errors. However,
   these methods normally require large population size and do not use the
   gradient information and, therefore, their computational costs are
   generally higher than their gradient based alternatives. This is
   especially true when using a computationally expensive high-fidelity
   method like finite element analysis as the direct solver in the core of
   the inverse algorithm. The inherent inefficiency of this procedure is
   even more obvious when we notice that an algorithm like PSO is
   rank-based, i.e. the actual magnitude of cost function is not important,
   and only their relative ordering is used. In a typical implementation of
   PSO, most of the objective function evaluations are discarded, unless
   when it is improving the local memory of the particle. A computationally
   cheaper substitute for full analysis methods is using metamodels also
   known as surrogate models. They construct an approximation to the direct
   problem using a set of available data and the underlying physics of the
   problem. In this research, an inexact pre-evaluation of the boundary
   heat flux components using a simplified physics and data fitting is used
   to find the more promising solutions, and then an accurate but
   computationally expensive three-dimensional finite element
   discretization of the heat conduction problem is applied only to these
   elite members of the population. The result is an inverse heat
   conduction analysis method that has the stability and effectiveness of
   PSO, and at the same time has a much lower computational cost. In this
   research, we use a sequential implementation of PSO in dealing with the
   transient boundary heat flux, and a future time step regularization
   method is used to create a more stable algorithm. The focus of the test
   cases in this research paper will be the inverse heat conduction problem
   in the controlled cooling of steel strips on a run-out table, but the
   algorithm is readily applicable to other applications of inverse heat
   conduction analysis.}},

   Simulations and experimental tests are carried out in order to validate

   those observed experimentally. Furthermore, it is observed that the
   mechanical vibrations are considerably reduced in the redesigned FFVA
   system. As a result, current levels and ohmic losses in the electric

   more reliable valve motion and better efficiency than the previously

Abstract = {{Traditionally, cam profiles have been described in terms of harmonic
   functions or splines that are optimized to provide low residual
   oscillations and avoid constraints such as pressure angle. For
   automotive cams used in internal combustion engines, the designer
   usually manually manipulates the control points of the spline functions
   and checks for constraint violations by feeding the obtained cam profile
   through a dynamic simulation of the valve train. This is a lengthy and
   iterative process that cannot guarantee that the obtained cam profile is
   truly optimal, since constraint boundaries are usually only met at a few
   distinct points along the cam profile. However, a truly time optimal cam
   profile will need to follow constraints during the complete motion. This
   paper then shows a reverse design procedure, where cam profiles are
   defined in terms of the constraint functions. A valve lift profile is
   assembled that moves along the boundary of the feasible valve lift
   space. The resulting cam motion is constrained at all times and
   represents a time optimum cam profile in terms of the selected
   constraints. The proposed methodology is computationally efficient and
   runs effectively on standard office computers. Automotive cam designers
   can use the results of this approach as an initial starting point for
   their cam shape optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Digital microfluidic systems (DMS), where liquid droplets are
   manipulated on a planar surface, are the recent generation of
   microfluidic systems. Specifically, the systems where electrowetting
   force is employed for the actuation of droplets on a 2-D array of
   electrodes are capable of performing many of the basic fluidic
   operations. In these systems, the actuation force on the liquid droplet
   is a function of the applied voltage and its frequency, dielectric
   properties of the liquid and the insulating material, and finally the
   instantaneous position of the droplet between two adjacent electrodes.
   At lower frequencies the applied voltage is dropped almost entirely in
   the insulating layer for droplets of aqueous liquids. The unit area
   capacitance of the insulating layer depends linearly on the dielectric
   constant and inversely on the thickness. Therefore, for a given voltage
   and frequency, stronger actuation force can be generated if a thinner
   layer of material with high dielectric Strength is used. However, the
   electric-field strength of the material poses the limitation on reducing
   the thickness of insulating layer. Typical insulators, with high
   electric field strength, used in microelectromechanical systems require
   quite sophisticated equipment for their deposition on the substrates. On
   the other hand, spin-coating of polymer insulators have been adopted as
   an economic and faster alternative technique for the fabrication of DMS.
   Polymer insulators possess reasonable dielectric strength and lower
   thickness can be achieved from higher spin speeds. However, low
   electric-field strengths of these materials prohibit working with
   thinner layers. As a result, actuation of droplets in DMS, fabricated
   using these materials as insulators, requires higher voltages. Higher
   applied voltages are not desirable for portable systems dealing with
   sensitive liquid samples. This paper presents an investigation on
   different insulating materials in terms of the ease of fabrication and
   the minimum voltage requirements for operation. The results can be
   useful in choosing the insulating material that will result in the
   expected level of performance while meeting the resource constraints. As
   a result, this paper specifies the material, based on the comparative
   study, that can be used to avoid the need for a sophisticated deposition
   system and the fabricated DMS can be operated with much lower voltages.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the simulation, fabrication, and experimental
   results of a vibration-based electromagnetic power (EMPG) generator. A
   novel, low cost, one mask technique is used to fabricate the planar
   coils and the planar spring. This fabrication technique can provide an
   alternative for processes such as Lithographie Galvanoformung Abformung
   (LIGA) or SU-8 molding and MEMS electroplating. Commercially available
   copper foils of 20 mu m and 350 mu m thicknesses are used for the planar
   coils and planar spring, respectively. The design with planar coils on
   either side of the magnets provides enhanced power generation for the
   same footprint of the device. The device overall size is 1 cm(3).
   Simulations of the modal analysis of the spring-mass system and the
   magnetostatic analysis of the magnetic field generated by the magnets
   are performed with COMSOL multiphysics (R). Excitation of the EMPG at
   the fundamental frequency of 371 Hz and at 13.5 g base acceleration
   (base amplitude 24.4 mu m) yields an open circuit voltage of 60.1 mV, as
   well as 46.3 mV load voltage and 10.7 mu W power for a 100 Omega load
   resistance. At matching impedance of 7.5 Omega the device produced a
   maximum power of 23.56 mu W and a power density of 23.56 mu W/cm(3).}},

Abstract = {{Design and analysis of an embedded nanoelectromechanical capacitive
   sensor for vibration monitoring is presented in this paper. In this
   sensor, vibration sensing is carried out by detecting the oscillations
   of a Single Walled Carbon Nanotube (SWCNT). The SWCNT is excited when it
   is subjected to a base motion corresponding to the measured vibration.
   Acquisition of the sensor signal is performed by a capacitance circuit,
   using the electric charge generated in the Carbon Nanotube (CNT). A
   modulation in the charge in the CNT, due to change in the capacitance,
   leads to a modulation in the CNT's conductance and is used in measuring
   the input vibration. Vibration properties of the CNTs are obtained by
   molecular mechanics and finite element analysis where atoms are modeled
   as particles with an equilibrium distance equal to the bond length, and
   the bonded interactions of atoms are modeled as flexible beams.
   Stiffness coefficients of the atomic bonds are modeled using Morse
   atomic potential. A bridge circuit is utilized in this sensor to
   compensate for temperature and other environmental effects. When the CNT
   is in the vicinity of the gate underneath the tube, at a distance in the
   range of 1 nanometer to 1 micrometer, Casimir pressure, due to quantum
   fluctuations in the zero point electromagnetic field, can attract the
   CNT to the gate. This unwanted applied force on the tube may lead to
   inaccurate measurement of the vibration. In order to study the effect of
   Casimir pressure on the CNT a simplified model of the Casimir effect,
   for parallel surfaces, is adopted. This model can assist in achieving
   better accuracy in vibration measurement, and the sensor can be
   calibrated accordingly to account for the Casimir attractive force. The
   paper presents the physical and operational details of the sensor. This
   device is particularly useful for precise and effective sensing of
   vibration for machinery and structural condition monitoring and fault
   diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a simple, low cost technique using new materials to
   bond capacitance pressure sensors. The old methods have difficult
   processes when a metal trace on the bonding area perturbs the sealing.
   The new method uses a polymeric gap-controlling block between glass and
   silicon wafers and a heat curing adhesive which penetrates between them
   due to capillary force. We used two different materials including SU8
   (TM) and UV (ultraviolet) curing adhesive in order to control the gap.
   The technique allows us to generate a small gap between the chips due to
   low viscosity of the heat curing adhesive, align and bond chips
   immediately, make a strong bond, and easily seal the sensor. Also, the
   high temperature, strong heat curing adhesive makes the sensor suitable
   for high temperature and high pressure applications. The sensors Were
   tested up to 2 MPa and 170 degrees C in a nitrogen chamber. The maximum
   thermal error of +/- 1.74\% and +/- 1\% full scale output (FSO) were
   measured for SU-8 and UV sensors, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Capacitance measurement has been identified as an effective technique
   for droplet position sensing in digital microfluidic systems mainly due
   to its non-intrusive nature. In essence, this technique relies on the
   correlation between the capacitance of two top-bottom electrodes with
   the amount of droplet overlap on the electrode. This paper describes an
   experimental setup used to gather capacitance data from a set of
   electrodes with varying droplet overlap to determine the droplet
   position. A prototype closed digital microfluidic (DMF) system
   consisting of an array of electrodes in the form of a 2 x 2 matrix was
   fabricated. A circular droplet was positioned on the DMF system, and
   capacitance measurements for each of the four electrodes were taken
   using a fast data acquisition device. A sufficiently accurate
   approximation of the droplet position was made using the four
   capacitance measurements. The paper presents the experimental results
   and also discusses the sources of error, viability of the experimental
   setup and manufacturing procedure for use in the development of
   capacitance measurement droplet position sensing techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic simulation of a Casimir Oscillator is presented in this
   paper. This oscillator is composed of a flat boundary of semiconducting
   oscillator parallel to a fixed plate separated by vacuum. In this system
   the oscillating surface is attracted to the fixed plate by the Casimir
   effect, due to quantum fluctuations in the zero point electromagnetic
   field. Motion of the oscillating boundary is opposed by a spring. The
   stored potential energy in the spring is converted into kinetic energy
   when the spring force exceeds the Casimir force, which generates an
   oscillatory motion of the moving plate. Casimir Oscillators are used as
   micro-mechanical switches, sensors and actuators. In the present paper,
   a stochastic simulation of a Casimir oscillator is presented for the
   first time. In this simulation, Stochastic Variational Integrators using
   a Langevin equation, which describes Brownian motion, is considered.
   Formulations for Symplectic Euler, Constrained Symplectic Euler,
   Stormer-Verlet and RATTLE integrators are obtained and the Symplectic
   Euler case is solved numerically.
   When the moving parts in a micro/nano system travel in the vicinity of
   10 nanometers to 1 micrometer range relative to other parts of the
   system, the Casimir phenomenon is in effect and should be considered in
   analysis and design of such system. The simulation in this paper
   considers modeling such uncertainties as friction, effect of surface
   roughness on the Casimir force, and change in environmental conditions
   such as ambient temperature. In this manner the paper explores a
   realistic model of the Casimir Oscillator. Furthermore, the presented
   study of this system provides a deeper understanding of the nature of
   the Casimir force.}},

Abstract = {{Features were extracted from seismocardiogram (SCG) data to correlate
   with stroke volume changes, estimated from arterial pressure recorded
   from the finger. Stroke volume was gradually reduced in twenty nine
   human subjects using lower body negative pressure. Twenty three features
   were extracted from SCG amplitudes and timings. There was at least one
   feature in every subject with correlation coefficient of 0.87or greater
   (P-value <0.01). The ratio of left ventricular pre-ejection interval to
   left ventricular ejection time (LVPEI/LVET) proved to correlate the most
   with stroke volume (r=-0.92 +/- 0.06) compared to the other features.
   The second most correlated SCG feature, with stroke volume, was LVPEI
   with (r=0.90 +/- 0.12). The findings of this paper suggest that with
   simple processing of SCG it should be possible to detect a sudden drop

Abstract = {{Media streaming applications have recently attracted large number of
   users in the Internet. With the advent of these bandwidth-intensive
   applications, it is difficult to provide streaming distribution with
   guaranteed QoS relying only on central resources at the content
   provider. Cloud computing offers an elastic infrastructure that media
   content providers (e.g., VoD provider) can use to obtain resources
   on-demand. Since a media content provider is charged for amount of
   resources (bandwidth) rented from the cloud, an open problem is to
   decide on the right amount of resources allocated in the cloud and their
   reservation time such that the financial cost on the content provider is
   minimized. We consider a practical pricing model that is based on a
   non-linear tariff (i.e., a pricing scheme that depends non-linearly on
   the resources purchased or time reserved). We formulate the optimization
   problem based on prediction of future streaming demand. We then propose
   a simple (easy to implement) algorithm for resource allocation that
   exploits the non-linearity in the price contract, while ensuring that
   sufficient resources is reserved in the cloud without incurring wastage.
   The results of our numerical evaluation and simulations show that the
   proposed algorithm mimics the optimum solution very well.}},

Abstract = {{The main function of rolling element bearings is to provide low friction
   conditions for supporting and guiding a rotating shaft. The rolling
   element bearing includes both ball bearings and roller bearings. Rolling
   element bearings operate with a rolling action whereas plain bearings
   operate with a sliding action. In various applications, these bearings
   are considered as critical mechanical components since defect in these
   components may lead to malfunction and catastrophic failure in some
   cases. Vibration analysis is one of the most established methods used to
   evaluate the condition of bearings in operating machines. In this paper,
   an abnormal detection structure, in which different types of abnormal
   detection routines can be applied, is proposed. Bearing fault modes and
   their effects on the bearing vibration are discussed. In order to
   achieve this purpose, a feature extraction method is developed to
   overcome the limitation of time domain features. Experimental data from
   bearings under different operating conditions are used to verify the
   proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new tolerance-based method to generate the
   optimum layer setup required to build layered manufacturing (LM)
   end-user parts for maximized efficiency. To achieve this, the deviation
   between the final polished LM part geometry and the original design
   model are formulated and controlled. Maximized layer thicknesses are
   then realized through optimization of each layer position with respect
   to the design and final geometry and maximization of the allowable
   deviation for each layer, which consequently leads to minimization of
   the build time. Current LM layer setup methods do not take into account
   of the final part during layer setup generation, rendering layer
   thickness selection to operator-deemed-best. Without the ability to
   predict the final geometry and to optimize the layer setup accordingly,
   layer thickness selection is often overly conservative, causing more
   layers than necessary to be used. Since the LM build time increases
   exponentially with an increase in the number of layers, efficiency is
   greatly reduced with conservative layer setup. To achieve maximum
   efficiency, this paper proposes a new method based on error compensation
   and minimization to solve for the optimum layer setup necessary to allow
   the resulting final physical part to reliably approximate the design
   model geometry according to a user specified tolerance limit. Case
   studies have been performed in order to validate that the proposed
   method is able to minimize the number of layers for constructing an LM
   part while controlling the maximum error for tolerance conformance.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, microdroplet motion in the electrocapillary-based
   digital microfluidic systems is modeled accurately, and the combined
   effects of the biomolecular adsorption and microdroplet evaporation on

   approach is used to model the driving and resisting forces, and Fick's
   law and Gibbs equation are used to calculate the microdroplet
   evaporation and adsorption rate. Effects of the adsorption and
   evaporation rates are then implemented into the microdroplet dynamics by
   adding new terms into the force balance equation. It is shown that mass
   loss due to the evaporation tends to increase the protein concentration,
   and on the other hand, the increased concentration due to the mass loss
   increases the biomolecular adsorption rate which has a reverse effect on
   the concentration. The modeling results indicate that evaporation and

Abstract = {{Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) is a highly efficient technology to
   perform biological and medical analyses through the manipulation of
   pico- to nano-liter droplets on digital microfluidic systems (DMS).
   Droplet splitting is one of the basic fluidic operations that play a
   vital role in microscale mixing and concentration control. This paper
   presents the results of numerical investigation of unequal droplet
   splitting. In order to gain insight into the mechanism of droplet
   splitting, a three-electrode splitting system is simulated in FLOW-3D
   (R) for given geometry and material properties. When unequal voltages
   are applied to the adjacent electrodes on both sides of a droplet the
   distribution of electric field exerts spatially varying stress causing
   the deformation of the interface. The resulting unequal fluid flow rates
   towards the activated electrodes are determined by the coupled
   electro-hydrodynamics. The results of multiple simulation runs in terms
   of liquid flow rates with different ratios of the applied voltage will
   be very useful in developing the open-loop model of droplet splitting
   that can be later adopted to design a controller for unequal splitting
   in DMS.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of electrophoresis (i.e., applying uniform electric field to
   use the natural charge of particles) on the transport of a sample (like
   biomolecules) in active microreactors is numerically investigated.
   Navier-Stokes equations are solved along with the equations of
   electrostatics, species mass transport in the buffer and chemical
   reaction kinetics at reactive surfaces. Unlike previous studies, in
   which the effect of the charge of the sample bulk on the electric field
   has been neglected (i.e., the assumption of electroneutrality), here
   space charge density is assumed to be nonzero. As a result, the
   governing equations become fully coupled. The efficiency of the
   microreactor device is analyzed for two different geometries commonly
   used in biomolecule separation (i.e., open channel and microcylinders).
   It is shown that the electroneutrality assumption can drastically
   influence the final adsorbed concentration depending on the device
   configuration. Average adsorbed surface concentration is compared for
   each case as a measure of the performance of the device. The plots
   depicting the influence of the electric field and nonzero space charge
   density on the bulk concentration profile and the velocity field are

Abstract = {{The polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell is a zero emission
   power generation system that has long been considered as a replacement
   for conventional fossil fuel combustion systems. However, before
   constituting a viable market for commercial use, the fuel cell's
   efficiency and reliability need to be improved significantly. It has
   been shown that water management has a significant effect on the power
   and reliability of the cell as the electrolyte membrane must be well
   hydrated to allow for ion transfer while excess water blocks the
   activation sites on the cathode side. The latter effect is known as
   flooding which occurs at large current densities and compromises the
   normal operation of the fuel cell. To enhance water management, a
   prodigious amount of studies have been conducted to optimize the
   properties and structures of different layers. One of the key results of
   these studies has been the design of a flow field pattern on the
   relatively hydrophobic surface of a graphite plate which is believed to
   provide a better mechanism for removing water droplets from the cathode
   flow channel. However, the wettability gradient between the catalyst
   layer (i.e., hydrophilic) and the flow channel (which is currently more
   hydrophobic) introduces problems as the water droplets formed at the
   catalyst layer will not likely detach, and hence create a film of liquid
   that will block the activation sites. If the flow channel is made out of
   a material that is more hydrophilic than the catalyst layer, water
   removal and transport will be enhanced as water naturally moves from low
   surface energy to high surface energy sites. However, recent numerical
   studies conducted on simulation of water transport in the channels show
   that removing the water film formed on the hydrophilic channels is
   limited due to the pressure of the gas flow in the channels. To resolve
   this problem, the use of compact aluminum foams in the flow channels is
   studied in this paper. It is shown that the hydrophilicity of the
   foam-filled flow channel helps the transport of the water droplets at
   the catalyst layer to the channel in which a liquid film is formed. This
   film is then removed due to the increased pressure developed in the
   porous media of the foam (as opposed to the regular open flow channel).
   The paper includes the experimental results obtained for the fuel cell
   performance using the new geometry with and without the gas diffusion
   layers (GDLs). These results will be compared to a similar flow channel
   that does not include the compressed aluminum porous structure. This
   work will result in finding the optimum geometry for achieving maximum
   performance in the flooding regime.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional road safety analysis has often been undertaken with
   historical collision records. However, limitations on the quality and
   completeness of collision data gave rise to surrogate ways of measuring
   safety, especially the traffic conflict technique. Traditionally,
   traffic conflict techniques have relied on field observations, which
   have some reliability and repeatability problems. Therefore,
   successfully automating conflict detection with data extracted from
   video sensors could have considerable benefits for traffic safety
   studies. Before-and-after safety evaluations could greatly benefit from
   automated analysis of traffic conflicts, and the main objective of this
   paper is to demonstrate the use of this analysis technique for such
   evaluations. A right-turn safety improvement was implemented at an
   intersection in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, in 2009 to mitigate the high
   rate of rear-end and merging collisions. The right-turn ramp was closed,
   and all right-turning vehicles were brought to the right-turn lane at
   the intersection, where a ``No-Right-Turn-on-Red{''} sign was installed.
   In this study, video sensors were the primary source of conffict data.
   The video data were analyzed and traffic conflicts were measured with an
   automated traffic safety tool. The distributions of the calculated
   conflict indicators before and after the treatment showed a considerable
   reduction in the frequency and severity of traffic conflicts. This
   result suggests significant positive changes in rear-end, merging, and
   total conflicts. The results of this study show the potential benefit of
   adopting automated conflict analysis for before-and-after safety
   studies.}},

   Evaluation of Shoulder Rumble Strips}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2280}},
Pages = {{28-37}},
Abstract = {{Recent research has advocated the use of linear intervention models
   developed within a hierarchical full Bayes context to conduct road
   safety evaluations. These models acknowledge that the effects of a
   safety treatment (intervention) do not occur instantaneously but are
   spread over future time periods. Despite the demonstrated advantages of
   such models, the manner in which the implemented countermeasures affect
   safety at the treated locations according to their novelty, direct
   effects, and indirect effects is not completely understood. A novel
   nonlinear intervention model was proposed to better understand how
   safety countermeasures work. To demonstrate the proposed model's
   capabilities, linear and nonlinear (Koyck) models were applied to
   estimate the effectiveness of the installation of shoulder rumble strips
   on a number of highway segments in the province of British Columbia,
   Canada. In addition to providing the best fit, the nonlinear Koyck model
   provided valuable insight into the effectiveness of shoulder rumble
   strips. This model showed an immediate 24.9\% reduction of
   off-road-right collisions after 1 year that decreased with time and a
   19.2\% reduction in collisions as a result of permanent treatment.
   Overall, the findings from this study can have a significant impact on
   the economic evaluation of safety programs and countermeasures.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effect of collision aggregation on safety
   evaluation through a case study from the 2001 Signal Head Upgrade
   Program of the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, Canada. Three
   types of evaluations were performed. Bivariate intervention models were
   used in the first two evaluations to assess the impacts of different
   collision severity levels {[}severe and property damage only (PDO)] and
   the impact of the time of the collision (daytime and nighttime) on
   safety. In the third evaluation, multivariate intervention models were
   used to determine the safety impacts of the program on each combination
   of collision severity and time of occurrence (i.e., severe daytime,
   severe nighttime, PDO daytime, PDO nighttime). Overall, the results
   indicated that the program was effective in improving the safety of the
   treated intersections. However, the results revealed that aggregate
   analyses could lead to misleading results. Aggregation of collisions
   over time of day indicated that the treatment resulted in significant
   reductions in PDO collisions but not in severe collisions.
   Alternatively, aggregation of collisions over severity levels indicated
   that the treatment resulted in significant reductions in both daytime
   and nighttime collisions. These results were different from the results
   of the disaggregate analysis, in which significant reductions were found
   for all collision types, except for severe collisions during the
   daytime.}},

Abstract = {{The experiment is carried out in a 13-meter-high circulating fluidized
   bed(CFB) to investigate gas-solid two-phase flow by pressure sensor. The
   axial pressure and pressure fluctuation are measured in different solid
   mass fluxes. With the solid mass flux increasing, pressure gradually
   increases, and pressure gradually decreases along the riser upwards. The
   characteristic of pressure fluctuation in the riser is analyzed, which
   indicates that pressure fluctuation in the riser originates from the
   inlet. The intensity of the pressure fluctuation decreases along the
   riser upwards. This pressure fluctuation is composed of two types: one
   is of low frequency and high amplitude, which is resulted from unstable
   feeding to the riser and keeps coherent along the axial direction. And
   the other is of high frequency and low amplitude, which is the result of
   a variety of factors, such as cluster movement, gas-solid interaction
   and gas velocity fluctuation.}},

Abstract = {{FPGA-based emulation has emerged as an important tool in the overall
   validation process for an increasing number of large integrated
   circuits. Emulation gives the ability to validate a design using
   long-running, realistic tests, which are infeasible to perform using
   simulation. Traditionally, however, FPGA-based emulation has been used
   to validate only the functional behavior of an integrated circuit, since
   circuit-level properties (e. g., timing, noise margins, etc.) are
   obviously different between the FPGA emulation and the final integrated
   circuit. In this paper, we show that emulation can also be used as an
   important tool to assist validation of more than just functional
   behavior. In particular, we show how FPGA-based emulation can be used to
   evaluate the critical-path timing coverage of a validation plan, and
   show that the area and timing overheads are acceptable. We demonstrate
   this technique to measure the critical-path coverage of a complex SoC
   using common post-silicon validation tests - including booting Linux,
   and running targeted and random programs - giving valuable insight into
   the quality of such tests in covering the timing paths in a design
   post-silicon.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper an efficient object correspondence algorithm is presented
   for tracking multiple objects in dynamic environments is proposed. It is
   assumed that objects can be added to the scene, removed from the
   environment, or occluded by other objects. The proposed algorithm
   benefits from two key features including a confidence measure and a
   two-way matching mechanism to improve the correspondence accuracy.
   Unlike the traditional methods which solve the correspondence problem by
   matching new objects and then removing the incorrect ones, our algorithm
   avoids establishing invalid correspondences considering a confidence
   measure. Also, we introduce a two-way correspondence algorithm
   consisting of forward matching and backward matching. As a result, the
   track of objects is expanded both from the head and tail using new
   objects and previous unmatched objects respectively. The proposed method
   has been applied to synthetic data, and the results show the efficiency
   and reliability of the method against a large number of objects.}},

   algorithmically generates emotional music to match the expressive state
   of the partner and plays the music to the user in a non-disruptive

   augments the emotional response generated by visual cues.}},

Abstract = {{Through a participatory design (PD) process with therapists at a
   neurological chronic care hospital that has no ICT based workflow
   processes we identified three main components where NUI technology can
   be deployed for physical therapy: patient stimulation, on-demand patient
   therapy tool control, and data logging and visualization. Based on our
   study, we created a scenario that encompasses these components for a
   specific physical therapy activity targeting head and torso movement for
   children suffering neurological disorders. The scenario includes a
   Kinect, large screen and mobile pervasive technologies controlling a
   game-like activity including data logging and visualization in a shared
   social intranet. Hospital staff liked the game-activity and logging, but
   expressed concerns about parallel use of technology. They also wanted to
   expand the use of the NUI technology in the therapy room leading to new
   scenarios that we are pursuing. We are using our participatory design
   process with therapists that are not tainted by the use of graphical
   user interfaces (GUIs) to establish scenarios where NUI designs can
   provide access to ICT tools to help us develop better NUI design

Abstract = {{It has been shown that for multi-carrier signals with n subcarriers, the
   peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) of a random codeword generated
   from a symmetric spherical, QAM or PSK constellation is log(n)
   asymptotically. Motivated by this result, recently a coding scheme with
   a rate of 1-log(q) (2) over a symmetric q-ary constellation has been
   proposed that achieves a PMEPR less than c log(n), where c is a
   constant. The idea of this coding scheme is to adjust the sign of
   subcarriers using so-called Chernoff bound-based derandomization
   algorithm. In this paper, using Chernoff bound and second order
   exponential Markov bound in conjunction with Gaussian approximation, two
   new variations of the derandomization algorithm are presented that yield
   roughly the same statistical PMEPR at the same rate. Moreover, it is
   rigorously established that the asymptotic PMEPR of both these
   algorithms is exactly the same as that of the original derandomization
   algorithm. Given a fixed amount of memory, our new algorithms can reduce
   the complexity up to one order, i.e. from O(n(3)) to O(n(2)). On the
   other hand, given a fixed computational complexity, our algorithms can
   reduce the required memory down to half.}},

Abstract = {{Most recent analyses on IEEE802.11e quality of service (QoS)-aware
   enhanced distributed coordination function (EDCA) require a large degree
   of complexity, making it difficult to apply them to a wide range of
   parameter settings for the evaluation of service differentiation
   mechanisms supported in EDCA, including the Contention Window (CW) and
   Arbitration Inter-Frame Space (AIFS) mechanisms. In this paper, we
   propose an improved analytical model to analyze the throughput of EDCA
   with AIFS and CW differentiation schemes. The model is simplified by
   decomposing the problem into two easily solved Markov chains that can
   jointly be solved by numerical method. We present simulation and
   analytical results over a broad range of system parameters to
   demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model. The model is simple to
   implement and can be applied to general configuration circumstances for
   the evaluation of EDCA. The results are valuable to facilitate proper
   design of parameters in 802.11e enhanced distributed channel access for
   the QoS support required by specific applications.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the most widely used protocol for
   end-to-end data transmissions over inter-networks. However, the
   congestion control algorithm of TCP was not created to match the special
   characteristics of satellite links, resulting in a drastically
   performance degradation. The employment of TCP split connections coupled
   with link level retransmissions and satellite link tailored TCP versions
   has been proven effective in hiding corruption losses from TCP to
   improve end-to-end performance. Using NS-2 simulations, this paper
   evaluates and compares popularly used TCP versions such as New Reno,
   Hybla, Vegas, DVegas and Westwood+ over GEO VSAT- and LEO-based
   satellite links employing performance enhancement proxy (PEP) based on
   snoop. Simulation results show that with the use of snoop proxy, TCP
   Hybla outperforms the rest of TCP versions, improving the usage of
   satellite links that are affected by losses not due to congestion. The
   second good candidate is DVegas over satellite PEP. When the Explicit
   Control Protocol (XCP) is employed as TCP PEPs, it would improve TCP
   performance to get high transfer rates and respond to congestion in a
   correct and scalable way.}},

Abstract = {{Many applications in vehicular networks are context-aware in that the
   observations of sensing nodes, potentially vehicles, at a target
   location should be made available to the requesting node possibly at a
   different location. In order to provision such applications, two phases
   of packet routing between the requesting node and the target location
   and packet dissemination within the target location need to be
   implemented. In this paper, we focus on the second phase and propose an
   efficient reliable packet dissemination mechanism, Request-adaptive
   Packet Dissemination Mechanism (RPDM), in target location. RPDM allows
   for different applications to generate request packets based on their
   exclusive observation needs and delay requirements and adapts the
   dissemination mechanism in target location to specific needs of the
   request packet received. Besides, RPDM also takes the intrinsic
   characteristics of vehicular environments into account to make sure
   roadmap and connectivity constraints are considered and broadcast storm
   is prevented. Finally, RPDM is compared with a best-known
   state-of-the-art data dissemination mechanism, COR, and the results show
   that RPDM outperforms COR in terms of both resolution time and packet
   overhead traffic.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a low-power 10-bit 50-MS/s successive approximation
   register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). To reduce power and
   area, the monotonic switching procedure is combined with a
   parasitic-compensated split-capacitor DAC that also has an improved
   capacitor matching. The nonlinearity of the conventional split-capacitor
   DAC due to parasitic capacitance and capacitor mismatch is improved by
   modifying the capacitor bank so that the bridge capacitor is an integer
   multiple of the unit capacitor (as opposed to fractional multiple in the
   conventional circuit) and by including two dummy unit capacitors
   connected to ground. The proposed 10-bit ADC is designed and simulated
   using a 90-nm CMOS technology. Post-layout simulation results show that
   at 1.0-V supply and 50 MS/s, the ADC achieves a
   signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 60.10 dB and consumes
   0.32 mW with an input capacitance of 0.48 pF, resulting in a figure of

Abstract = {{Identity-Based Cryptography (IBC) was originally introduced by A. Shamir
   in 1984 in a signature scheme. IBC was first applied in the encryption
   and decryption of messages in the Boneh and Franklin model presented in
   2001, which forms the basis of our design. In this model, the system has
   to undergo private key refreshment procedure as part of the key
   management, which requires multiple control packets that increase the
   communication overhead. In this paper, we propose Enhanced Identity-Base
   Cryptography (EIBC), an efficient key management mechanism that
   minimizes control packets communications. Furthermore, we elucidate how
   EIBC can be employed in multicast group key managements. We present
   analysis to show that EIBC simultaneously achieves a high level of
   system security while handling system key management in an efficiently
   manner. EIBC can be utilized and implemented in various platforms, e.
   g., in our efficient authentication and key management schemes for Smart

   acoustic sensor is used to determine the humidity-dependent material
   parameters of a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) affinity layer as a sample
   analyte-affinity layer system. The Young's modulus, volumetric swelling,
   mass change, and vapour/solid partition coefficient of drop cast PVA are
   determined through a set of vapour absorption experiments and numerical
   regression fitting. The low stiffness of the substrate and the high
   sensitivity of the antisymmetric flexural plate wave modes to stiffness
   effects allow for contributions of stiffness and mass changes to the
   sensor response. These experimental results are compared with reference
   measurements to examine the effectiveness of this method.}},

   matrix inversion algorithm using fast inverse square root based on

   the most costly computational module within MIMO-LTE receivers. We have
   demonstrated a novel approach of matrix inverse to reduce the MIMO
   receiver module cost in terms of latency and complexity. The cost is
   reduced by implementing a 4x4 matrix inverse in Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA by
   optimizing the module for speed and power by pipelining and achieving a
   better throughput. The results are compared with state of art techniques

Abstract = {{As the capacity of integrated circuits increases, it is becoming
   increasingly difficult to ensure that a chip is free of design errors.
   Designers are increasingly turning to FPGA prototyping platforms to
   validate their designs much more extensively than is possible using
   simulation. A key challenge is one of visibility; signals can only be
   observed if they can be driven to pins of a chip. To enhance visibility
   during debug, designers regularly instrument their design with on-chip
   circuitry to record a small subset of signals at-speed for later
   off-chip analysis. The selection of which signals should be recorded
   critically affects the effectiveness of this approach. In this paper, we
   present an algorithm that ranks all signals in a design based on their
   predicted importance during validation. Compared to previous techniques,
   which analyze the circuit at the gate level, our algorithm works
   directly on the parse-tree representation of the circuit, and hence is
   orders of magnitude faster than these previous techniques. Our algorithm
   has been implemented as an integral part of Tektronix Certus, a
   commercial validation suite.}},

Abstract = {{Static power consumption is an important component of the total power
   consumption in FPGAs built using 90nm and smaller technology nodes. A
   previous study proposed powering down regions of logic blocks in an FPGA
   when idle to reduce the static power dissipation. This previous work did
   not consider powering down the switch blocks (SBs). However, the static
   power of SBs constitute more than 50\% of an FPGA's static power. In
   this paper, we present an architecture that enables selectively powering
   down SBs along with the logic blocks during their idle periods. The
   potential power savings from this architecture depends on the proportion
   of SBs that can be powered down. We present modifications to our CAD
   flow to maximize the number of such SBs, and we experimentally estimate
   their proportion using a set of synthetic benchmark circuits. Our
   estimation results show that 53\% to 83\% of the SBs can be powered down
   in a functional module of size 2 4 x 2 4 tiles and an architecture power
   gating regions of size 4 x 4 tiles, leading to overall static power
   reductions of 70\% to 84\% compared to an architecture that does not
   support power gating.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents VersaPower, a tool capable of modelling the power
   usage of many different field programmable gate array (FPGA)
   architectures.
   The latest release of the academic FPGA CAD tool, Versatile Place and
   Route 6.0 (VPR), supports new architecture features such as fracturable
   look-up tables and complex logic blocks. Past FPGA power models do not
   support these new features. VersaPower is designed to work closely with
   VPR to provide power estimation for any architecture supported by this
   new CAD flow. This allows researchers to investigate the effects on
   power usage of both new FPGA architectures, as well as new CAD
   algorithms. VersaPower is designed to operate with modern CMOS
   technologies, and is validated against SPICE using 22 nm, 45nm and 130nm
   technologies.
   Results show that for common architectures, roughly 60\% of power
   consumption is due to the routing fabric, 30\% from logic blocks and
   10\% from the clock network. Architectures supporting fracturable LUTs
   require 5-10\% more power, as each CLB has additional I/O pins,
   increasing the sizes of local interconnect crossbars and connection
   boxes.}},

   focused on the use of graphics in technical documentation, but how do
   engineering students work with photographs to construct a visual
   narrative of a problem as it affects people they may never meet in a
   culture unfamiliar to them? This question has implications for
   engineering educators as they prepare students to work in a globalized
   world where they may have little or no contact with clients. Related
   questions are explored within an interdisciplinary course called
   ``Technology and Development: The Global Engineer,{''} in which students
   use photographs to work on authentic sociotechnical problems identified
   by rural artisans in India with whom they do not have contact. Two
   written assignments, a visual assignment, and a brief survey provide
   qualitative and quantitative data of student decision-making in the
   visual learning process, suggesting that photographic work in the
   engineering curriculum may present an untapped source of contextual
   information that can enable engineering students to develop
   human-centered design skills.}},

Abstract = {{In order to increase the reliability of data transmission, using
   multiple antennas in radio frequency identification (RFID) systems has
   been investigated by researchers, mainly through measurements and
   simulations. The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) RFID
   backscattering channel exhibits a special type of cascaded structure
   rather than that of other better-studied cascaded channels such as the
   keyhole fading and the double scattering fading. In this article, we
   analytically study the bit error rate performances of the MIMO RFID
   channel under two transmission schemes, the identical signaling
   transmission scheme and the orthogonal space-time coding scheme (OSTBC).
   We show that the diversity order of the MIMO RFID channel is min(N,L)
   under the identical transmission scheme, and the diversity order is L
   under the OSTBC scheme, where L is the number of tag antennas and N is
   the number of reader receiving antennas. A performance bottleneck is
   also observed in the MIMO RFID channel. Our results can provide useful
   guidance on designing an RFID system with multiple antennas.}},

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional velocity field in the single phase approach flow
   to a multiple layer woven forming fabric was measured using PIV. The
   measurements were conducted on a scaled-up model of a forming fabric in
   a water/glycerin flow loop. Each strand on the paper side of the model
   forming fabric had a filament diameter (d) of 15 mm, and the flow loop
   test section was 310 mm squared, permitting the measurement of detailed
   velocity distributions over multiple strands of the fabric. The flow
   speed in the loop test section was varied to achieve screen Reynolds
   numbers between 12 and 65.
   PIV measurements showed that when the distance to the paper side of the
   fabric changes from 0.25d to 1.5d, the normalized ZD, CMD and MD
   velocity deviation decreases from 19.7\% to 4.2\%, 15.3\% to 1.9\% and
   14.5\% to 2.3\%, respectively; the ratio between maximum and minimum ZD
   velocity decreases from 3.3 to 1.2. These findings indicate that the
   flow non-uniformity caused by the fabric weave is confined to a short
   distance above the fabric. CFD simulations of the same flow were
   consistent with the PIV measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Recent development in the inference of brain connectivity from
   neuroimaging data such as functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI)
   provides better understanding of brain activities and functions. The
   group analysis of fMRI data usually focuses on functional connectivity,
   while exploratory graphical modeling of effective connectivity is
   generally designed for the single-subject case. In this paper, a new
   group-level network learning method, the group PCfdr algorithm, is
   proposed by combining group inference with exploratory graphical
   modeling for estimating brain connectivity, with inter-subject variances
   taken into consideration. The simulation results demonstrate that this
   group method can accurately recover underlying group-level structures
   and steadily control the false discovery rate at the user specified
   level. It is also applied to a real fMRI dataset of normal subjects and
   Parkinson's Disease patients to infer the brain connectivity at the
   group level.}},

Abstract = {{Intraoperative transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) has the potential to
   improve the outcomes of robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical
   prostatectomy (RALRP), a common treatment for prostate cancer.
   Intraoperative TRUS is currently difficult to implement in RALRP because
   a dedicated assistant with access to the patient is required. Previously
   described robotic TRUS probe manipulators overcome this limitation but
   require the surgeon to frequently interrupt their operation to
   reposition the TRUS probe under remote control. A new method for
   automatically tracking existing da Vinci surgical instruments with a
   TRUS imaging plane is presented, based on a rigid registration of the
   kinematic frames of the da Vinci system and the robotic TRUS probe
   manipulator. This registration is accomplished by identifying fiducial
   points on a tissue surface using the tip of a da Vinci manipulator, and
   does not require any external tracking system. Phantom validation shows
   an average registration error of 0.95 perpendicular to 0.38 mm based on
   manually locating the manipulator tips in TRUS images. This corresponds
   to an average tracking error of approximately 1 degree when rotating a
   parasagittal TRUS imaging plane to track a da Vinci manipulator.}},

Title = {{Automated Collection of Pedestrian Data Through Computer Vision
   Techniques}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},

Pages = {{121-127}},
Abstract = {{New urban planning concepts are being redefined to emphasize walkability
   (a measure of how walker-friendly an area is) and to accommodate the
   pedestrian as a key road user. However, the availability of reliable
   information on pedestrian traffic remains a major challenge and inhibits
   a better understanding of many pedestrian issues. Therefore, the
   importance of developing new techniques for the collection of pedestrian
   data cannot be overstated. This paper describes the use of computer
   vision techniques for the automated collection of pedestrian data
   through several applications, including measurement of pedestrian
   counts, tracking, and walking speeds. An efficient pedestrian-tracking
   algorithm, the MMTrack, was used. The algorithm employed a large-margin
   learning criterion to combine different sources of information
   effectively. The applications were demonstrated with a real-world data
   set from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The data set included
   1,135 pedestrian tracks. Manual counts and tracking were performed to
   validate the results of the automated data collection. The results show
   a 5\% average error in counting, which is considered reliable. The
   results of walking speed validation showed excellent agreement between
   manual and automated walking speed values (root mean square error =
   0.0416 m/s, R-2 = .9269). Further analysis was conducted on the mean
   walking speed of pedestrians as it related to several factors. Gender,
   age, and the group size were found to influence the pedestrian mean
   walking speed significantly. The results demonstrate that computer
   vision techniques have the potential to collect microscopic data on road
   users at a degree of automation and accuracy that cannot be feasibly
   achieved by manual or semiautomated techniques.}},

   incorporating the radiologic localization of the tumor which can be
   acquired from multiparametric MRI. To enable this integration, we
   propose and compare two solutions for registration of T2 weighted MR
   images with transrectal ultrasound. Firstly, we propose an innovative
   and practical approach based on deformable registration of binary label
   maps obtained from manual segmentation of the gland in the two
   modalities. This resulted in a target registration error of 3.6 +/- 1.7
   mm. Secondly, we report a novel surface-based registration method that
   uses a biomechanical model of the tissue and results in registration
   error of 3.2 +/- 1.3 mm. We compare the two methods in terms of
   accuracy, clinical use and technical limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Spinal needle injection procedures are used for anesthesia and
   analgesia, such as lumbar epidurals. These procedures require careful
   placement of a needle, both to ensure effective therapy delivery and to
   avoid damaging sensitive tissue such as the spinal cord. An important
   step in such procedures is the accurate identification of the vertebral
   levels, which is currently performed using manual palpation with a
   reported 30\% success rate for correct identification. Methods: An
   augmented reality system was developed to help identify the lumbar
   vertebral levels. The system consists of an ultrasound transducer
   tracked in real time by a trinocular camera system, an automatic
   ultrasound panorama generation module that provides an extended view of
   the lumbar vertebrae, an image processing technique that automatically
   identifies the vertebral levels in the panorama image, and a graphical
   interface that overlays the identified levels on a live camera view of
   the patient's back. Results: Validation was performed on ultrasound data
   obtained from 10 subjects with different spine arching. The average
   success rate for segmentation of the vertebrae was 85\%. The automatic
   level identification had an average accuracy of 6.6 mm. Conclusion: The
   prototype system demonstrates better accuracy for identifying the
   vertebrae than traditional manual methods.}},

Abstract = {{Many neurological disorders can change patterns of brain activity
   observed in functional imaging studies. These functional differences may
   be useful for classification of individuals into diagnostic categories.
   However, due to the high dimensionality of the input feature space and
   small set of subjects that are usually available, classification based
   on fMRI data is not trivial. Here, we evaluate the use of a Sparse
   Representation Analysis method within a Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD)
   classification method, taking functional patterns characteristic of
   different cognitive tasks as the data input. As a test dataset, with a
   clear `gold-standard' classification, we attempt to classify individuals
   as young, or older, based only on functional activation patterns in a
   speech listening task. Thirty two young (age: 19-26) and older (age:
   57-73) adults (16 each) were scanned while listening to noise and to
   sentences degraded with noise, half of which contained meaningful
   context that could be used to enhance intelligibility. Different
   functional contrast images were used within K-SVD to generate basis
   activation sources and their corresponding sparse modulation profiles.
   Sparse modulation profiles were used in a FLD framework to classify
   individuals into the young and older categories. The results demonstrate
   the feasibility of the general approach, and confirm the potential
   applicability of the proposed method for real-world diagnostic problems.}},

Abstract = {{Pulse oximeters non-invasively measure heart rate and oxygen saturation
   and have great potential for predicting critical illness. The
   photoplethysmogram (PPG) recorded from pulse oximetry is often corrupted
   with artifacts. These artifacts render the derived vital signs
   inaccurate.
   We present a novel real-time algorithm for segmentation of the PPG into
   pulses and for the classification of artifacts. The Incremental-Merge
   Segmentation (IMS) algorithm operates in the time domain and extracts
   morphological features of the PPG. These features are line segments that
   are classified as pulses or artifacts using adaptive thresholds.
   The IMS algorithm was evaluated using the Complex System Laboratory
   (CSL) Benchmark dataset. A sensitivity of 98.93\% and positive
   predictive value of 96.68\% have been obtained, which compares very
   favorably with the CSL benchmark algorithm. The novel algorithm is
   currently being implemented into mobile phone pulse oximeters.}},

Abstract = {{In angioplasty with stent placement, re-narrowing of the artery within
   the stent site may occur due to the body's natural response to
   ``heal{''} the stented area. This renarrowing, also known as ``in-stent
   restenosis{''}, usually occurs within 6 months after surgery. To monitor
   and diagnose in-stent restenosis, passive telemonitoring using smart
   stents has been already proposed. In this paper, we present a
   feasibility study and advocate the use of an alternative method, namely
   active telemonitoring, which uses an integrated circuit embedded on the
   smart stent. Electromagnetic simulations and in-vitro measurements are
   presented to find the suitable range of frequency to wirelessly transfer
   power to the active device embedded on the smart stent. Furthermore, the
   range of induced power levels are simulated and experimentally verified.}},

Abstract = {{As the characteristics of EEG signals change over time, updating the
   classifier of a brain computer interface, BCI, (over time) would improve
   the performance of the system. Developing an adaptive classifier for a
   self-paced BCI however is not easy because the user's intention (and
   therefore the true labels of the EEG signals) are not known during the
   operation of the system. For certain applications, it may be possible to
   predict the labels of some of the EEG segments using some information
   about the user's state (e.g., the error potentials or gaze information).
   This study proposes a method that adaptively updates the classifier of a
   self-paced BCI in a supervised or semi-supervised manner, using those
   EEG segments whose labels can be predicted. We employ the eye position
   information obtained from an eye-tracker to predict the EEG labels. This
   eye-tracker is also used along with a self-paced BCI to form a hybrid
   BCI system. The results obtained from seven individuals show that the
   proposed algorithm outperforms the non-adaptive and other unsupervised
   adaptive classifiers. It achieves a true positive rate of 49.7\% and
   lowers the number of false positives significantly to only 2.2
   FPs/minute.}},

   proposed autonomic-cardiac regulation model by considering
   neuromechanical and mechanical coupling of cardiovascular and
   respiration systems including lung stretch-receptor reflex and venous
   return variation. We also introduced a differential equation describing
   respiration rate regulation which mainly originates in the medullary
   respiratory center. The results of simulation experiments suggest that
   the venous return variation generates a higher perturbation on heart
   rate and blood pressure than lung stretch-receptor reflex. The proposed
   model is also powerful in determining and removing direct respiratory
   impacts on parasympathetic activation tone to accurately extract
   parasympathetic activity caused by emotional states and environmental

Abstract = {{Heart rate variability (HRV) may provide anesthesiologists with a
   noninvasive tool for monitoring nociception during general anesthesia. A
   novel real-time cardiorespiratory coherence (CRC) algorithm has been
   developed to analyze the strength of linear coupling between heart rate
   (HR) and respiration. CRC values range from 0 (low coherence, strong
   nociception) to 1 (high coherence, no nociception). The algorithm uses
   specially designed filters to operate in real-time, minimizing
   computational complexity and time delay. In the standard HRV high
   frequency band of 0.15 - 0.4 Hz, the real-time delay is only 5.25 - 3.25
   s. We have assessed the algorithm's response to 60 anesthetic bolus
   events (a large dose of anesthetics given over a short time; strongly
   antinociceptive) recorded in 47 pediatric patients receiving general
   anesthesia. Real-time CRC responded strongly to bolus events, changing
   by an average of 30\%. For comparison, three traditional measures of HRV
   (LF/HF ratio, SDNN, and RMSSD) responded on average by only 3.8\%, 14\%,
   and 3.9\%, respectively. Finally, two traditional clinical measures of
   nociception (HR and blood pressure) responded on average by only 3.9\%
   and 0.91\%, respectively. CRC may thus be used as a real-time
   nociception monitor during general anesthesia.}},

Abstract = {{To study the effects of different feedback error amplification methods
   on a subject's upper-limb motor learning and affect during a
   point-to-point reaching exercise, we developed a real-time controller
   for a robotic manipulandum. The reaching environment was visually
   distorted by implementing a thirty degrees rotation between the
   coordinate systems of the robot's end-effector and the visual display.
   Feedback error amplification was provided to subjects as they trained to
   learn reaching within the visually rotated environment. Error
   amplification was provided either visually or through both haptic and
   visual means, each method with two different amplification gains.
   Subjects' performance (i.e., trajectory error) and self-reports to a
   questionnaire were used to study the speed and amount of adaptation
   promoted by each error amplification method and subjects' emotional
   changes. We found that providing haptic and visual feedback promotes
   faster adaptation to the distortion and increases subjects' satisfaction
   with the task, leading to a higher level of attentiveness during the
   exercise. This finding can be used to design a novel exercise regimen,
   where alternating between error amplification methods is used to both
   increase a subject's motor learning and maintain a minimum level of
   motivational engagement in the exercise. In future experiments, we will
   test whether such exercise methods will lead to a faster learning time
   and greater motivation to pursue a therapy exercise regimen.}},

   The addition of ankle rotation is shown to provide both quantitative and

   to when the ankle joint is referenced to the motion of the balance
   simulator. Eight out of ten subjects reported that balancing on the
   simulator with ankle motion required less conscious effort. This

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of energy consumption in sharing a viral file
   between peers over a wireless community network (e. g., students in
   campus). Wireless community networks such as Wireless Mesh Networks
   (WMNs) have been accepted as a new communication approach that enables
   users to share the network resources and reduce the cost of the Internet
   access. The common paradigm for sharing content between users in a
   community network is through the use of a centralized server. Another
   scheme is to exploit the upload capacity of peers who are interested in
   the same content (e. g., Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file sharing). In this
   paper, we consider a content distribution setting in a wireless mesh
   network wherein a number of infrastructure nodes (mesh routers) support
   the P2P content sharing and act as caches and participants. We model the
   performance of this content distribution scheme, and analytically
   compute the energy that is consumed in the network when a viral P2P
   object is shared between the peers in a WMN. We compare the energy
   consumption with the centralized server scheme using both numerical
   results and detailed simulations. The results shows significant
   reduction in energy consumption (more than an order of magnitude) when
   only few replicas of the object is cached at the infrastructure nodes.}},

Abstract = {{In Multicast, since almost simultaneous communication take place along
   several branches of a Multicast distribution tree, these branches tend
   to mutually block each other due to interference. We utilized a model of
   scheduling in automobile production line called GORBY to divide the
   nodes in the Multicast distribution tree into three groups (GORby-Group
   or GG). We calculate the SINR of the node based on interferences caused
   by all the nodes within that GG, assuming when the given node is in the
   transmit state then all the nodes within its GG will also be in the
   transmit state. Finally we use the computed SINRs in our join Multicast
   group algorithm to achieve the most SINR, which we call it GORby
   Interference-Aware (GIA) metric in case of a node, and Path GIA (PGIA)
   in case of a path.}},

Abstract = {{With the use of energy harvesting technologies, the lifetime of a
   wireless sensor network (WSN) can be prolonged significantly. Unlike a
   traditional WSN powered by non-rechargeable batteries, the energy
   management policy of an energy harvesting WSN needs to take into account
   the energy replenishment process. In this paper, we study the energy
   allocation for sensing and transmission in an energy harvesting sensor
   node with a rechargeable battery and a finite data buffer. The sensor
   node aims to maximize the total throughput in a finite horizon subject
   to time-varying energy harvesting rate, energy availability in the
   battery, and channel fading. We formulate the energy allocation problem
   as a sequential decision problem and propose an optimal energy
   allocation (OEA) algorithm using dynamic programming. We conduct
   simulations to compare the performance between our proposed OEA
   algorithm and the channel-aware energy allocation (CAEA) algorithm from
   {[}1]. Simulation results show that the OEA algorithm achieves a higher
   throughput than the CAEA algorithm under different settings.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider smart grid system demands on remote

   high-demand appliance in case of crisis and emergency, or manage a
   plug-in electric vehicles recharging. Hence a Home Area Network (HAN)
   controller should be prevented from superimposing or differing caused by
   decryption and re-encryption these packets. Comparing to X.1035
   standard, we use only one hash function and utilize a primitive password
   between the appliance and HAN controller, and state four individual
   consensus password-authenticated symmetric key establishments between
   the appliance and upstream controllers during only 12 packets. We
   improve security process data delivery time by 50\% to 75\% while

   the most important and challenging issues in smart grid networks. To
   secure data communications, strong authentication and key management

   improving key management overhead cost by reducing network bandwidth.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the use of intra-session random linear network
   coding (RLNC) in wireless sensor networks. In RLNC, intermediate nodes
   buffer the packets received from upstream nodes. Using intra-session
   RLNC, intermediate nodes transmit coded packets by performing coding on
   the packets of various flows. The main challenge in using intra-session
   RLNC is to determine how many coded packets each node requires to
   transmit for each flow such that the sink can decode the packets of all
   the flows. We analytically find the time at which a node can stop
   transmission of packets for a particular flow without interrupting the
   decoding process at the sink. Using this analysis, we design a
   link-by-link feedback mechanism to acknowledge the packets of a
   particular flow. An intermediate node generates feedback packets for its
   upstream nodes. The upstream node stops transmission of a flow when it
   receives an acknowledgment for that flow. Simulation results show that
   the link-by-link feedback mechanism with intra-session RLNC achieves
   lower power consumption compared to RLNC without intra-session coding
   and also the CCACK algorithm {[}1].}},

Abstract = {{The gas diffusion layer (GDL) of the proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel
   cell is a vital component in water management since humidification and
   water removal are both achieved through the GDL. Capillary action in the
   GDL porous structure enhances water removal from the cathode catalyst
   layer, and hence prevents flooding which blocks the pathways of the
   reactants to the activation sites. To improve the transport of water and
   reactants, GDL properties are varied by changing the geometry and the
   PTFE loading of the carbon fiber paper (CFP), both changing the internal
   wettability of the GDL. In essence, the wettability describes the
   interaction of water with the porous structures inside the GDL. The
   knowledge of the surface properties and pore structure is important to
   enhance water management in the cell. In this work, two ex-situ
   techniques are used to measure transport characteristics of GDLs, such
   as the internal wettability, pore size distribution and permeability.
   These measurements have been applied to different types of GDLs with
   different structures and PTFE loadings. The comparison between the
   results will determine the effect of material and treatment on the
   properties of GDLs which can provide basic insight into the two-phase
   flow in this porous layer. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Selection

Abstract = {{Water management is one of the major areas of interest in the fuel cell
   research community. Previous studies have shown enhancement in water
   management and fuel cell performance using a parallel flow field design
   including a metallic foam structure in the channels of the cathode flow
   field {[}1]. In this paper, metallic foams are used in a new geometry
   and are applied to both cathode and anode flow fields to improve water
   removal, reduce production costs, and enhance the overall performance.
   The metallic foam increases turbulent mixing in the flow fields which
   prevents the formation of a laminar boundary layer at the surface of the
   gas diffusion layer (GDL). The foam also serves as a moisture wick
   removing liquid water away from the GDL while maintaining the level of
   moisture required avoiding dehydration of the membrane. In this study,
   the performance tests are conducted at a variety of dew point
   temperatures to determine the water management properties of the
   metallic foam in the new geometry. The performance of the metallic foam
   will be compared to that of a standard serpentine graphite flow field.
   The major criteria will include performance at nominal voltage and
   current and high current stability. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A wavelet-based image gradient transform is proposed. The proposed
   transform, called multi-scale gradient transform (MSGT), obtains the
   first order derivative of an image in terms of the wavelet detail
   coefficients. While traditional methods estimate the image gradients at
   each wavelet scale in terms of the horizontal and vertical wavelet
   coefficients only, the proposed transform obtains the gradients in terms
   of the diagonal, as well as the horizontal and vertical wavelet
   coefficients. The proposed MSGT is designed to be invertible,
   non-redundant and computationally efficient. We demonstrate the
   potential applications of the proposed transform in texture feature
   extraction, multi-scale edge detection, image quality assessment and
   image watermarking.}},

Abstract = {{Corticomuscular coupling analysis based on multiple datasets such as
   electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals provides
   a useful tool for understanding the underlying mechanisms of human motor
   control systems. In this work, we propose a tridirectional statistical
   modeling and analysis method to identify the coupling relationships
   between three types of datasets. Different from conventional approaches
   where only two datasets are considered and the interest is to interpret
   one dataset by another in a unidirectional fashion, the goal in this
   paper is to model three data spaces simultaneously in a tridirectional
   fashion. To address the intersubject variability concern in real-world
   medical applications, we further propose a group analysis framework
   based on the proposed method and apply it to concurrent EEG, EMG and
   behavior signals collected from 8 normal subjects and 9 patients with
   Parkinson's disease (PD) performing a dynamic motor task. The results
   demonstrate highly correlated temporal patterns among the three types of
   signals and meaningful spatial activation patterns. The proposed
   approach is a promising technique for performing multi-subject and
   multi-modal data analysis.}},

Abstract = {{It is of great importance to investigate the domain adaptation problem
   as vision data is now available from a variety of sources. For adapting
   a classifier, the first problem is how to choose `source' domain. The
   key issue here is measuring domain similarity. In this paper, we present
   one of the first studies on `domain similarity' measure in the context
   of object recognition. We introduce an output kernel divergence as a
   similarity measure between different data domains, and propose using it
   as a criterion for domain selection for better recognition accuracy. We
   also propose a novel domain adaptation method using a vector-valued
   function with learned output kernels. Fundamentally different from
   existing work, we focus on the shift in the output kernel space, instead
   of handling the distribution shift in the input feature space. In
   addition, those previous methods could also be applied together with
   ours to improve the performance further. We demonstrate the ability of
   the proposed model to select and adapt between different domains, and
   report the state-of-art results on a benchmark data set.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed Video Coding (DVC) in transform domains could yield
   significant coding gains over the pixel domain. While employing
   different coding modes in DVC, it is still difficult to fully compress
   the source data without increasing the complexity at the encoder side.
   In this paper, we first propose a particular Run-Length-Coding (RLC)
   coding mode to efficiently compress the continuous zero symbols to
   improve coding efficiency. Then a hybrid codec scheme for WZ frames by
   combining Turbo and RLC coding is introduced, where the mode decision is
   determined at the decoder side to maintain the encoder-side complexity
   simplicity. Simulation results show that the proposed method gains up to
   1 dB when compared with the Transform domain Wyner-Ziv Coding (TDWZ).}},

Abstract = {{High dynamic range (HDR) video content is able to provide superior
   picture quality. This is because the representation of HDR signals
   requires more bits than the 8-bit low dynamic range (LDR) video.
   Tone-mapping is the process that converts HDR to LDR signals. Most
   tone-mapping methods are derived only for the luminance component. This
   mapping function is then used in each of the R, G and B components to
   generate the LDR color image. This color tone mapping correction
   approach, however, cannot be directly applied to most videos since they
   are usually encoded in the YCbCr color space. This paper addresses this
   problem and proposes a tone-mapping method that is applied directly on
   the YCbCr signals. Experimental results show that the Cb and the Cr
   signals generated by our method are almost identical to those produced
   with the conventional pipeline up to round-off errors, with average PSNR
   at about 55 dB and average SSIM at 0.991. By avoiding all the round-off
   errors introduced in the conventional method, our approach provides a
   more accurate LDR picture. Moreover, the proposed solution has
   significantly lower complexity because it bypasses the processes such as
   color space transformation and up-sampling which are required by the
   conventional method.}},

Abstract = {{We present a decentralized adaptive filtering algorithm in a clustered
   network of agents. Agents receive payoffs partly due to performing
   localized tasks in clusters and partly due to strategic interaction with
   agents outside clusters. Each agent is only aware of the actions of
   others within its cluster and is oblivious to the actions, or even
   existence, of agents outside the cluster. We show that the global
   behavior of the network converges to the set of correlated
   epsilon-equilibria if the agents follow the proposed algorithm. Thus
   simple behavior by individual agents can result in sophisticated global
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a new approach to video based face recognition.
   Our work is based on the Sparse Classification approach which assumes
   that each test sample can be formed by a linear combination of the
   training samples of the correct class. Based on this assumption, we
   formulate the classification problem as one of joint sparse recovery of
   Multiple Measurement Vectors (MMV). This requires solving an NP hard
   problem. This problem has not been solved earlier; thus we derive an
   algorithm for solving it. The experimental evaluation is carried on the
   VidTIMIT database. The proposed method is compared against an HMM based
   method for video based face recognition and the modified Sparse
   Classification method. The results show that the proposed method
   outperforms both these methods.}},

Abstract = {{A duplication-deletion random graph is presented in this paper to model
   social networks which change over time. The paper analyzes the dynamics
   of this duplication-deletion random graph where at each time instant,
   one node can either join or leave the network. A degree distribution
   analysis is provided for this graph and an expression is derived to
   compute the power law component. Also a Markov-modulated random graph is
   analyzed where the the growth of the network evolves according to a slow
   Markov chain. An upper bound is derived for the mean square error
   between the estimated degree distribution and the asymptotic one. Using
   the fact that the duplication-deletion graph satisfies a power law, an
   upper bound is presented for the most significant singular value of the
   adjacency matrix of the graph.}},

   estimated using an array of biosensors. The concentration evolves
   according to an advection-diffusion partial differential equation which
   is coupled with chemical reaction equations on the biosensor surface. An
   approximate characterization of the system is developed as a system of
   ordinary differential equations by exploiting the multiple-time scale
   behaviour of the system and using the divergence theorem. The estimate
   of target molecules is then obtained by solving a non-linear least
   squares problem. An explicit expression for the asymptotic variance of
   the estimation error is obtained. To demonstrate the accuracy of
   proposed method, we illustrate our results on a novel biosensor built

Abstract = {{A high-resolution, high dynamic range capacitive accelerometer based on
   pull-in time measurement is described in this paper. The high
   sensitivity of pull-in time can be used to implement high performance
   accelerometers, but non-linearity and low dynamic range compromise
   device performance. A closed-loop approach using an electrostatic
   actuation mechanism to control the duration of the pull-in time is
   presented, which addresses the low dynamic range problem. Capacitive
   parallel-plates structures were used and the preliminary experimental
   results of closed-loop operation under several acceleration values
   confirm the potential of this technique and the overall accelerometer
   concept. The results show an accelerometer with high sensitivity (better
   than 6 mu V/mu g) and improved linearity over a large dynamic range. (C)

Abstract = {{Waste activated sludge (WAS) is a waste by-product that is generated in
   large quantities in air-activated sludge or UNOX effluent treatment
   plants (ETPs) in pulp and paper mills. Currently, WAS is managed as a
   waste and is either burned (in spite of its high water content and
   negative fuel value), landfilled, or land-applied. However, WAS has both
   economic and environmental value: it is a potential source of both
   renewable energy and nutrients that can reduce the net costs of sludge
   management as well as a pulp mill's environmental footprint. Anaerobic
   digestion converts only a small portion of untreated WAS to form biogas,
   and the process is slow. Aerobic stabilization of raw WAS occurs in ETPs
   during long solids retention times, but results in high aeration costs.
   MicroSludge is a sludge pre-treatment process that ruptures the
   microbial cell membranes of WAS. This study shows that MicroSludge
   significantly increases the rate of anaerobic digestion of pulp and
   paper WAS, reduces the amount of waste sludge for disposal, and enables
   recovery of fertilizer that otherwise would need to be purchased to
   operate the ETP. This study also indicates that aerobic stabilization of
   MicroSludge-processed WAS results in rapid destruction of the sludge for
   disposal.}},

Abstract = {{A novel methodology for estimating the area and perimeter of
   intersection between two or more intersecting surfaces, without having
   to determine or order the points of intersection, is presented. No
   restriction is placed on complexity of the intersecting geometry except
   that it must represent a closed region. This method is well-suited for
   cases in which the area and perimeter of intersection are complicated,
   are not strongly peaked in a very small region, and when relatively low
   accuracy is tolerable. In this study, we examine the time-dependent
   evolution of the area and number of bar crossings for 320 different low
   consistency refiner plate configurations with similar geometrical
   patterns for stator plate and rotor plate using this methodology.
   Empirical correlations are presented to relate the plate parameters to
   bar intersection area. Finally, we interpret our findings in terms of
   the industrially accepted parameters used to characterize the action of
   refiner plates.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to characterise and compare the
   development of fibre and fines properties in high consistency (HC) and
   low consistency (LC) refining of mechanical pulp. Primary refined pulp
   was produced using the Advanced Thermo-Mechanical Pulp (ATMP) refining
   process. Pulps were characterized to evaluate external and internal
   fibrillation, fibre shape and dimensions, surface area of fines and the
   proportion of split fibres.
   Based on the results, a different mode of fibre development was proposed
   for LC and HC refining. The LC refining resulted in a greater reduction
   in the shives content and R30 Bauer-McNett fibre fraction. The reduced
   R30 fraction considerably increased the middle fibre fractions; however
   it showed no further development in terms of surface fibrillation. While
   HC refining resulted in a significant reduction in fibre wall thickness
   associated with fibre collapse and increase in external fibrillation, LC
   refining mainly generated structural changes, seen in fibre
   straightening and increased flexibility.
   The HC and LC refined pulps had different property profiles compared at
   equal handsheet tensile index. The LC refined pulps contained less long
   fibres and fines but significantly more middle fraction particles.
   Extensive internal fibrillation of the straighter LC refined fibres
   appeared to have compensated for lower fines content and external
   fibrillation, producing well bonded sheets with good tensile strength.}},

Abstract = {{Light-weight fibre mats were made in a handsheet former using a variety
   of different furnishes. With 3D X-ray microtomography, high resolution
   volume images of the fibre mat and forming fabric were obtained. A
   surface map of the fabric-side surface of the fibre mat is created using
   image analysis techniques. The surface roughness of the mat is studied
   as a function of fibre coarseness and fibre length. Increasing fibre
   coarseness decreases the surface smoothness of paper. For constant fibre
   coarseness, increasing the fibre length causes the surface roughness to
   decrease slightly. Both fine and coarse forming fabric were used for
   sheet forming. As one would anticipate, the fibre mat surface generated
   by a finer forming fabric is smoother.}},

Abstract = {{A two-state Self-paced Brain Computer Interface (SBCI) system enables
   users to control external devices at any time they desire by
   intentionally switching their mental states. In order to accurately
   control devices, distinguishing features representing different brain
   states must be present in the EEG signals. This paper introduces a novel
   feature generation method for EEG motor imagery data, based on
   Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEMD), the Hilbert Transform
   and a phase synchronization index. Novelties of our approach are (1)
   MEMD is applied for decomposing an EEG signal into its narrow-band
   frequency components, from which features of the different brain states
   are calculated, and (2) a phase synchronization index is calculated
   without averaging over trials or time. We used a simple and fast
   classification scheme that employed an empirical threshold value
   obtained from the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of the
   training data. Applying the proposed method on only two mono-polar EEG
   channels, the SBCI system with the selected features yields a 93\% True
   Positive rate, and a 5.8\% False Positive rate using the BCI competition
   III data set Iva.}},

   remain virtually intact. A 0.13-mu m CMOS proof-of-concept prototype is
   implemented which operates at radio frequency (RF) of 2.4 GHz with an
   intermediate frequency (IF) of 50 MHz and draws 2.25 mA from a 1.2-V

Abstract = {{Random linear network coding (RLNC) can improve the reliability of
   end-to-end communication in the presence of erasure channels. In RLNC
   with intra-session coding, an intermediate node creates coded packets by
   combining the packets of various sources destined for a destination.
   Each transmitted packet contains information of multiple sources. In
   this paper, we study the decoding delay of RLNC with intra-session
   coding for a line network with S sources and a destination. Given the
   generation size K, we show that the expected decoding delay is
   upper-bounded by root eta K-2 log(S) + K eta(1) + eta, where eta,
   eta(1), eta(2) are constants. The analytical results are validated via
   simulations. We also compare the results with the case where
   intra-session coding is not used.}},

Abstract = {{Facial expressions are a valuable source of information that accompanies
   facial biometrics. Early detection of physiological and psycho-emotional
   data from facial expressions is linked to the situational awareness
   module of any advanced biometric system for personal state
   re/identification. In this article, a new method that utilizes both
   texture and geometric information of facial fiducial points is
   presented. We investigate Gauss-Laguerre wavelets, which have rich
   frequency extraction capabilities, to extract texture information of
   various facial expressions. Rotation invariance and the multiscale
   approach of these wavelets make the feature extraction robust. Moreover,
   geometric positions of fiducial points provide valuable information for
   upper/lower face action units. The combination of these two types of
   features is used for facial expression classification. The performance
   of this system has been validated on three public databases: the JAFFE,
   the Cohn-Kanade, and the MMI image.}},

   Telescope baseline concept assumes the new facility is built on the
   existing Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope telescope pier and enclosure
   pier and occupies the same three dimensional exterior ``footprint{''}.
   Three technical studies have been planned to examine the validity of
   these assumptions. The technical studies are executed in series as they
   represent technical decision points in a logical sequence. The three
   technical studies in succession are: 1. Telescope Pier Study - Load
   Capacity and Structural Interface, 2. Enclosure Fixed Base Study -
   Telescope and Enclosure Configuration and Load Capacity and 3.
   Aero-Thermal Study - Dome Thermal Seeing and Air Flow Attenuation over
   the Enclosure Aperture Opening. The paper outlines the baseline facility
   (telescope, spectrograph and enclosure) concept and the status of these
   studies, and discusses the proposed telescope and enclosure
   configuration in terms of the redevelopment assumptions. A consolidated
   feasibility study report will be submitted to the CFHT Board and Science
   Advisory Committee in the Fall of 2012, with first light for the
   facility aiming to be in the early 2020s.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a method to detect surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) launched
   by a sub-wavelength slit structure using optical microscopy. The
   mechanism relies on an ultra-thin layer of polymer, whose thickness is
   varied with nano-scale precision to enable matching between the momentum
   of incident light and that of SPPs on the metal surface adjacent to the
   slit exit. At an optimal layer thickness, the SPP coupling efficiency is
   enhanced about six times relative to that without the layer. The
   enhanced efficiency results in distinctive and bright signatures visible
   under a far-field optical microscope. We show how this method can be
   used for parallel measurement of SPPs through a simple experiment in
   which the SPP propagation distance is extracted from a single microscope
   image. We also use optical microscopy to image SPPs focussed by a curved
   array of holes, obtaining results that are consistent with previous
   measurements using near-field optical microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{The new generation of supercritical cooled water reactors (SCWR) are
   susceptible to particulate fouling as a result of corrosion product
   sedimentation. Iron oxides are a major component of corrosion products
   and are also known to catalyze hydrogen peroxide decomposition. This
   work aimed to investigate the rate of H2O2 decomposition on the surface
   of a magnetite bulk electrode by using electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy. A magnetite bulk electrode was immersed in a suspension of
   various concentrations of magnetite particles and initial H2O2
   concentration of 10(-2) M. It was observed that the electrochemical
   response of the magnetite surface (which is partially oxidized to gamma
   - Fe+3 species) is a function of H2O2 concentration. Therefore, at
   different time intervals EIS was used to obtain charge transfer
   resistance as a proxy variable for hydrogen peroxide concentration.
   These measurements were compared to results obtained by permanganate
   titration. It was observed that the changes of decomposition current
   density extracted from the EIS data fitting process for various
   conditions were in good agreement with the titration results. H2O2
   decomposition in the presence of iron oxide particles was found lobe a
   second-order reaction with rate constants of 0.015 and 0.017 min(-1)
   g(-1)L (obtained from EIS and titration methods, respectively). (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The anodic tantalum oxide films were grown in 5mU98\% H2SO4 electrolyte
   saturated with additional H-2. Discharge currents were collected
   immediately after growth. The optical properties of these films were
   studied with a J. V. Woollam Co., Inc., Spectroscopic Ellipsometer,
   VASE, over a wide range of frequencies from the UV to the IR. It was
   established that films for which the discharge current followed the
   known ``similar to-1{''} power dependence (characteristic of films that
   can sustain large electric fields in the range of MV/cm) have different
   optical properties as compared to films for which the discharge current
   is not represented by that empirical function. Etching studies of the
   E-beam deposited Ta2O5 films, combined with reflectance measurements
   after each etch step, resulted in a shift in the reflectance spectrum as
   a function of film thickness. This empirical f versus d dependence
   (where f is the frequency corresponding to the reflectance minimum for
   each film thickness, d) was used to calculate the energies of the 4d
   doublet of Ta+5 in Ta2O5. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society. {[}DOI:

Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Abstract = {{Poor seismic performance of non-code conforming RC buildings, mainly
   designed for gravity loads prior to 1970s, highlights the need for
   reliable vulnerability assessment and retrofitting. The vulnerability is
   compounded since the RC buildings are subject to different
   irregularities such as weak storey, soft storey, plan irregularities,
   and poor construction quality; and interaction of different
   irregularities. Fragility based seismic vulnerability of structures with
   consideration of soft storey (SS) and quality of construction (CQ) is
   demonstrated on three-, five-, and nine-storey RC frames designed prior
   to 1970s. Probabilistic seismic demand model (PSDM) for those gravity
   load designed structures is developed, using the nonlinear finite
   element analysis, considering the interactions between SS and CQ. The
   response surface method is used to develop a predictive equation for
   PSDM parameters as a function of SS and CQ. Result of the analysis shows
   the sensitivity of the model parameter to the interaction of SS and CQ.
   The accuracy of the predictive equations is checked for randomly
   selected SS values and three levels of CQ. Further, the fragility curves
   are developed for the three structures considering SS. CQ and of their
   interactions. Finally, confidence bounds on the fragilities are also
   presented as a measure of their accuracy for risk-informed
   decision-making. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate a simple three-node network consisting of a source, a
   half-duplex decode-and-forward relay with a buffer, and a destination.
   We assume that a direct source-destination link is not available and all
   links undergo fading. We consider the case where the source has no
   channel state information (CSI) and thus is forced to transmit with a
   fixed rate. On the other hand, the relay has full CSI and thus is able
   to adapt its rate to the underlaying channel. We propose a buffer-aided
   relaying protocol which allows the relay to choose its transmission and
   reception time slots adaptively and based on the quality of the
   source-relay and relay-destination links. For this system, we derive the
   maximum achievable throughput and the fraction of throughput lost due to
   outages. Our results reveal that compared to the conventional case when
   the relay always alternates between reception and transmission, a
   throughput gain of up to 100\% is possible.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling and eliminating defects, such as macro-porosity, in die
   casting processes is an on-going challenge for manufacturers. Current
   strategies focus on the execution of a pre-set casting cycle and die
   structure design. To respond to process variability and mitigate its
   negative effects, advanced process control methodologies may be employed
   to dynamically adjust the operational parameters of the process.
   In this work, a finite element heat transfer model has been developed to
   predict the evolution of temperatures and the area of liquid
   encapsulation in a low pressure die casting process. The model was
   validated by comparison to plant trial data. A virtual process has been
   developed based on the model to simulate the continuous operation of the
   real process. A nonlinear state-space model, based on data from the
   virtual process, has been developed to provide a reliable representation
   of this virtual process. The control variables-driven portion exhibits
   linear dynamic behavior with nonlinear static gain, whereas the feed
   forward-driven portion is based on a linear function defined by system
   identification on the virtual process. The resulting MIMO state-space
   model will facilitate the design of a model-based controller for this
   process.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a method for handling persistent visual
   occlusions that disrupt visual tracking for eye-in-hand systems. This
   approach provides an efficient strategy for the robot to ``look
   behind{''} the occlusion while respecting the robot's physical
   constraints. Specifically, we propose a decoupled search strategy
   combining a naive pan tilt search with a sensor placement approach, to
   reduce the strategy's computational cost. We proceed by mapping limited
   environmental data into the robot configuration space and then planning
   within a constrained region. We use a particle filter to continuously
   estimate the target location, while our configuration-based cost
   function plans a goal location for the camera frame, taking into account
   robot singularity, self-collision and joint limit constraints.
   To validate our algorithm, we implemented it on an eye-in-hand robot
   system. Experimental results for various situations support the
   feasibility of our approach for quickly recovering fully occluded moving
   targets. Finally we discuss the implications of this approach to mobile
   robot platforms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the simulation and characterization of a
   microelectromechanical system (MEMS) micromirror fabricated with
   PolyMUMPs. The overall diameter of the hexagonal micrimirror, including
   mirror plate and 3 supporting cantilevers fixed around, is 450um. A 3D
   model is built in finite element method (FEM) with COMSOL. Simulations
   of the elevated height of mirror plate, pull-in voltage and
   eigenfrequency of the rnicromirror are carried out. The static and
   dynamic performances of the fabricated micromirror are characterized by
   Veeco Optical Profiler and Polytek MEMS System Analyzer. The comparison
   between measurement and simulation exhibits good concordance. Surface
   topography measurement shows the elevated height and stress-induced
   concave deformation of mirror plate almost the same scale as
   demonstrated in FEM simulation. The pull-in voltages are measured to be
   around 32V in current-voltage curve which is almost the same as in FEM
   simulation with one electrode biased. The fundamental resonant frequency
   is measured to be 4.3k Hz in torsional motion and 4.9k Hz in piston
   motion.}},

Title = {{Use of Computer Vision to Identify Pedestrians' Nonconforming Behavior
   at Urban Intersections}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2279}},
Pages = {{54-64}},
Abstract = {{The detection and understanding of nonconforming behavior (violations)
   can be useful in forming safety diagnoses and developing safety
   countermeasures. Traffic violations occur when road users, including
   pedestrians, seek increased mobility and disregard traffic laws and
   regulations. Such behavior can cause additional collision risks. This
   paper's objective is to demonstrate the automated identification of
   pedestrian crossing violations with computer vision techniques. Two
   types of violations are considered. The first is spatial violations:
   pedestrians cross an intersection in nondesignated crossing regions. The
   second is temporal violations: pedestrians cross an intersection during
   an improper signal phase. The methodology primarily relies on the
   identification of road users' trajectories and separating pedestrians
   with nonconforming behavior from those with conforming behavior. The
   methodology is demonstrated on two urban intersections, one in downtown
   Vancouver, Canada, the other in Kuwait City, Kuwait. The results show
   satisfactory accuracy in the detection of spatial and temporal
   violations, with an approximately 90\% correct violation detection rate
   having been achieved in both case studies.}},

Title = {{Method for measurement of friction forces on single cells in
   microfluidic devices}},
Journal = {{ANALYTICAL METHODS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{4303-4309}},
Abstract = {{We present a technique for measuring the static and kinetic friction
   forces between single cells and engineered surfaces in microfluidic
   channels. Frictional forces are defined as the sum of the non-specific
   attractive forces between two surfaces in sliding contact. The
   microchannels are fabricated using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and
   modified using polyethylene glycol (PEG). Rectangular microchannels are
   designed to apply a modest compression (10-30\%) to individual cells
   along one axis. Infusing a cell suspension into this channel at a
   precisely controlled flow rate enables the application of piconewtons of
   hydrodynamic drag force to each cell. At certain flow rates, the sample
   cells are separated into a population trapped by friction and a
   population where the hydrodynamic drag force overcomes friction. The
   kinetic friction force is measured as a function of cell compression
   using the velocity difference between free-flowing cells and the fluid.
   The upper bound static friction force is measured as a function of cell
   compression by analyzing the size distributions of trapped and
   free-flowing cells. Specifically, in order to overcome the coupled
   uncertainties associated with the normal force and the coefficient of
   friction, the upper bound static friction is estimated using the
   frictional force overcome by the largest free-flowing cell in the
   sampled population. Finally, the friction-reduction property of
   PEGylated surfaces is evaluated using the ratio of trapped versus
   free-flowing cells. The kinetic friction force between LCC6/Her2 cells
   and PEGylated PDMS was measured to range from 45 to 370 pN for cells
   under compression from 10\% to 30\%. Similarly, the upper bound static
   friction forces were measured to range from 50 to 700 pN for the same
   compression range.}},

Abstract = {{Audience response systems (ARS) are effective tools for improving

   However, if students do not accept ARS and do not find them to be

   perceptions of ARS may help to ensure positive outcomes. The present
   study expands on previous work by simultaneously evaluating several
   student and practice variables that may predict student perceptions of
   ARS. Perceived learning outcomes, engagement, interaction in class,
   enjoyment of ARS, attendance, and preparation for class were examined
   using multivariate regression analysis in two undergraduate samples.
   Student variables, including gender, grade, and year of program
   predicted student perceptions of ARS. Practice variables, including the
   consistency of ARS use, question type, question difficulty, and ease of
   use also predicted student perceptions. The nature and implications of
   these findings are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The dissolution of alloying elements within liquid titanium alloys is of
   utmost importance in ingot production to ensure chemical homogeneity and
   final downstream component performance. A coupled
   thermal-composition-fluid flow model based on a commercial Computational
   Fluid Dynamics package ANSYS-CFX has been developed to describe
   dissolution and homogenization of a solid alloying element introduced
   into the bulk liquid. The transport of heat, mass and momentum via
   diffusion, buoyancy forces, and surface tension forces has been
   incorporated into the computational model together with a Darcy-based
   dampening term applied to the fluid transport within the liquid/solid
   two-phase region. Experimental data from an ethanol-water analogue
   physical model has been used to validate the numerical model, using a
   combination of fluid flow pattern and interface shape, and temperature
   data obtained at discrete locations. The comparison of results between
   the computational model and experiments shows good agreement, providing
   some confidence that the model can be used to investigate the
   dissolution and homogenization processes in the Ti-6Al-4V system.}},

   ongoing toward the development of a thermal-fluid model of the filling

   and tested using water to explore the role of venting on the free
   surface behavior of water and to produce data for validation of the flow
   aspects of the model. Comparison to experimental data confirms the
   model's ability to accurately predict the filling of a planar die and
   that venting significantly influences the free surface behavior. To
   examine conditions more similar to the industrial process the material
   properties of aluminum were used in the model to predict flow in a 36
   degrees section of the production die. Once again venting is found to be
   critical.}},

Title = {{Analyzing Passenger Incidence Behavior in Heterogeneous Transit Services
   Using Smartcard Data and Schedule-Based Assignment}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2274}},
Pages = {{52-60}},
Abstract = {{Passenger incidence (station arrival) behavior has been studied
   primarily to understand how changes to a transit service will affect
   passenger waiting times. The impact of one intervention (e.g.,
   increasing frequency) could be overestimated when compared with another
   (e.g., improving reliability), depending on the assumption of incidence
   behavior. Understanding passenger incidence allows management decisions
   to be based on realistic behavioral assumptions. Earlier studies on
   passenger incidence chose their data samples from stations with a single
   service pattern such that the linking of passengers to services was
   straightforward. This choice of data samples simplifies the analysis but
   heavily limits the stations that can be studied. In any moderately
   complex network, many stations may have more than one service pattern.
   This limitation prevents the method from being systematically applied to
   the whole network and constrains its use in practice. This paper
   considers incidence behavior in stations with heterogeneous services and
   proposes a method for estimating incidence headway and waiting time by
   integrating disaggregate smartcard data with published timetables using
   schedule-based assignment. This method is applied to stations in the
   entire London Overground to demonstrate its practicality; incidence
   behavior varies across the network and across times of day and reflects
   headways and reliability. Incidence is much less timetable-dependent on
   the North London Line than on the other lines because of shorter
   headways and poorer reliability. Where incidence is timetable-dependent,
   passengers reduce their mean scheduled waiting time by more than 3 min
   compared with random incidence.}},

Pages = {{4372-4380}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we describe a microsphere-based check valve integrated
   with a micropump. The check valve uses empty set20 mu m polystyrene
   microspheres to rectify flow in low pressure and low flow rate
   applications (Re < 1). The microspheres form a porous medium in the
   check valve increasing fluidic resistance based on the direction of
   flow. Three check valve designs were fabricated and characterized to
   study the microspheres' effectiveness as resistive elements. A maximum
   diodicity (ratio of flow in the forward and reverse direction) of 18 was
   achieved. The pumping system can deliver a minimum flow volume of 0.25
   mu L and a maximum flow volume of 1.26 mu L under an applied pressure of
   0.2 kPa and 1 kPa, respectively. A proof-of-concept study was conducted
   using a pharmaceutical agent, docetaxel (DTX), as a sample drug showing
   the microsphere check valve's ability to limit diffusion from the
   micropump. The proposed check valve and pumping concept shows strong
   potential for implantable drug delivery applications with low flow rate

Title = {{A Computationally Efficient, Exploratory Approach to Brain Connectivity
   Incorporating False Discovery Rate Control, A Priori Knowledge, and
   Group Inference}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Graphical models appear well suited for inferring brain connectivity
   from fMRI data, as they can distinguish between direct and indirect
   brain connectivity. Nevertheless, biological interpretation requires not
   only that the multivariate time series are adequately modeled, but also
   that there is accurate error-control of the inferred edges. The PCfdr
   algorithm, which was developed by Li and Wang, was to provide a
   computationally efficient means to control the false discovery rate
   (FDR) of computed edges asymptotically. The original PCfdr algorithm was
   unable to accommodate a priori information about connectivity and was
   designed to infer connectivity from a single subject rather than a group
   of subjects. Here we extend the original PCfdr algorithm and propose a
   multisubject, error-rate-controlled brain connectivity modeling approach
   that allows incorporation of prior knowledge of connectivity. In
   simulations, we show that the two proposed extensions can still control
   the FDR around or below a specified threshold. When the proposed
   approach is applied to fMRI data in a Parkinson's disease study, we find
   robust group evidence of the disease-related changes, the compensatory
   changes, and the normalizing effect of L-dopa medication. The proposed
   method provides a robust, accurate, and practical method for the
   assessment of brain connectivity patterns from functional neuroimaging
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Non-isothermal austenite grain growth kinetics has been studied in a
   microalloyed linepipe steel with complex precipitates containing Ti, Nb
   and/or Mo. The goal of these experimental studies is to provide the
   basis for the development of a grain growth model to predict the
   austenite grain size evolution in the weld heat affected zone (HAZ).
   Detailed electron microscopic investigations of the as received steel
   proved the presence of Ti-rich, Nb-rich and Mo-rich precipitates. The
   steel was subjected to austenitizing heat treatments to selected peak
   temperatures of 950, 1150 and 1350 degrees C at heating rates of 10, 100
   and 1000 degrees C/s, respectively. Thermal cycles have been found to
   have a strong effect on the austenite grain size. Austenite grain sizes
   increase with peak temperature and decreasing heating rate. However, the
   increase in heating rate from 100 to 1000 degrees C/s has a negligible
   effect on the austenite grain size. The observed austenite grain growth
   kinetics can be explained taking into account the potential dissolution
   of Nb-rich precipitates.}},

Abstract = {{Austenite grain size is an important microstructure parameter when
   processing steels as it provides the initial condition for the austenite
   decomposition that determines the final microstructure and thus
   properties of the steel. In low-carbon steels it is frequently difficult
   if not impossible to quantify the austenite grain size using
   conventional metallographic techniques. Laser-ultrasonics provides an
   attractive alternative to quantify the grain size in-situ during
   thermomechanical processing of a steel sample. The attenuation of the
   laser generated ultrasound wave is a function of the grain size. The
   present paper gives an overview on the state-of-the-art of this novel
   measurement technique. Using isothermal and non-isothermal grain growth
   tests in low-carbon steels the advantages and limitations of
   laser-ultrasonic measurements will be demonstrated. Further, their
   application for deformed samples will be presented to quantify austenite
   grain sizes during and after recrystallization. The in-situ measurements
   provide significantly new insights into the austenite microstructure
   evolution during thermo-mechanical processing of low-carbon steels. The
   implications on expediting the development of improved process models
   will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Modelling the evolution of structures in polycrystalline materials with
   distributions of fine particles requires integration of multiple length
   scales. Grain boundaries interact with particles on the scale of the
   particle diameters. The particle pinning force controls the kinetics of
   grain growth. Grain diameters can be several orders of magnitude larger
   than particles. In this work, a methodology is proposed to combine two
   sets of phase field models at different length scales. At the smaller
   scale, the effect of particles on movement of a single grain boundary is
   modelled in a small domain with a high grid resolution. The interface
   moves in an array of particles with specified shape and size
   distributions. The average pinning force exerted by the particles, is
   calculated from the interface velocity. Then, an effective driving force
   model is developed to incorporate the obtained pinning force into the
   large scale where grain growth simulations are preformed. In this model,
   the particle pinning force is subtracted from the driving force in the
   phase field formulation. In this effective formulation, particles are
   not resolved in the calculation grid. Therefore, with the larger
   numerical mesh, modelling of larger systems is possible. Kinetics of
   grain growth was studied with 2 dimensional simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Three dimensional (3D) phase field modelling is used to simulate
   austenite grain growth in X80 linepipe steel for thermal paths that are
   typical in the heat affected zone (HAZ). In the HAZ austenite grain
   growth is affected by pinning due to precipitates and their potential
   dissolution. Effective grain boundary mobilities are introduced that are
   consistent with strong pinning at lower temperatures and weak pinning at
   higher temperatures separated by the estimated dissolution temperature
   range of fine NbC precipitates. These mobility relationships are then
   used to describe austenite grain growth in bulk samples subjected to
   rapid heating and cooling conditions to replicate thermal cycles at
   various positions in the HAZ.}},

Abstract = {{The role of autophagy in numerous physiological responses triggered by a
   variety of mechanisms both in states of health and disease has raised
   considerable interest in this cellular process. However, the current
   analytical tools to study autophagy are either invasive or require
   genetic manipulation. Raman microspectroscopy is a potentially
   quantitative analytical method that has been shown to be useful for the
   label-free, non-destructive analysis of living biological cells and
   tissues. We present in this study initial efforts to study autophagy
   using Raman spectroscopy. The response of adherent mouse and human
   cancer cells to starvation conditions (glutamine deprivation and amino
   acid deprivation) was probed by Raman spectroscopy and compared to
   fluorescence microscopy results using autophagy-specific markers. We
   also demonstrate the capability of Raman spectroscopy to monitor the
   recovery dynamics of starved cells and to probe the heterogeneity in the
   response to starvation that can arise in cell populations. Finally, this
   work suggests that the 718 cm(-1) Raman line associated with
   phospholipids may be a useful spectral marker indicative of an
   autophagic response to starvation stimuli. Overall, this study
   establishes the utility of Raman spectroscopy to non-invasively detect
   biologically relevant changes in live cells exposed to conditions known
   to trigger autophagy.}},

Abstract = {{Passive coupling of adjacent structures is known to be an effective
   method to reduce undesirable vibrations and structural pounding effects.
   Past results have shown that reducing the number of dampers can
   considerably decrease the cost of implementation and does not
   significantly decrease the efficiency of the system. The main objective
   of this study was to find the optimal arrangement of a limited number of
   dampers to minimize interstorey drift. Five approaches to solving the
   resulting bi-level optimization problem are introduced and examined
   (exhaustive search, inserting dampers, inserting floors, locations of
   maximum relative velocity and a genetic algorithm) and the numerical
   efficiency of each method is examined. The results reveal that the
   inserting damper method is the most efficient and reliable method,
   particularly for tall structures. It was also found that increasing the
   number of dampers does not necessarily increase the efficiency of the
   system. In fact, increasing the number of dampers can exacerbate the
   dynamic response of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that fiber reinforcement of concrete reduces
   its permeability to water and enhances its service life. In this study,
   this finding was extended to determine if fiber reinforcement can also
   control corrosion of reinforcing steel in traditionally reinforced
   concrete. Two fiber types, cellulose and polypropylene, at 0.1\% and
   0.3\% volume fraction, were examined. Two series of tests were
   performed. In the first series, chloride transport characteristics were
   determined by using the Bulk Diffusion Test, the Silver Nitrate Spray
   Test and the Rapid Chloride Permeability Test. In the second series,
   corrosion activity in reinforcing steel was monitored in loaded RC beams
   with and without fiber reinforcement for a year in a simulated marine
   environment. Results demonstrated that while the presence of fibers
   increased the coefficient of chloride diffusion based on total
   chlorides, there was a decrease in the coefficient related to free
   chlorides. Fibers therefore appear to bind the chlorides and inhibit
   their transport through concrete. Corrosion tests further corroborated
   these findings and indicated that fibers delayed the onset of corrosion
   in RC beams as long as the applied load did not exceed a certain
   threshold value.}},

   the object with a human-like behavior in response to perturbations in
   the height of the other end of the object (e.g., the end supported by
   the human user). We also propose a novel tuning procedure, and find that

Abstract = {{Relaying is a major technique to increase network lifetime in wireless
   sensor networks (WSNs) and body area networks (BANs). The results of
   relaying studies highly depend on power consumption model of relay's
   transmitter and receiver radio, channel and mobility models. In this
   work, we study the effect of relaying with 2.4GHz IEEE802.15.4 modules
   on network lifetime. We analytically derive the energy expenditure of
   relays in which we use the path loss probability distribution function
   (PDF) over links, which is derived from our link characterization using
   micaZ motes, and the existing power consumption models. It turns out
   that in order for relaying to be beneficial to network lifetime and for
   the same transmitter power amplifier efficiency, receive power
   consumption of IEEE802.15.4 widely used RF modules, e. g., micaZ motes
   are required to be decreased. For instance, receive power of 17mW helps
   us achieve 25\% more lifetime with 3-relay scheme than single-hop
   transmission over ankle-waist link during walking, whereas with the
   current receiver, we achieve 12\% less lifetime compared to single-hop
   scenario.}},

Abstract = {{There has been significant research interest over recent years in the
   use of public digital displays and in particular their capability to
   offer both interactivity and personalized content. Although a number of
   interaction technologies have been investigated, a promising approach
   has been the use of the ubiquitous cell phone, which not only offers a
   means to interact with displays but increasingly offers a small but
   high-quality screen to complement the larger public display. However, to
   date there has been little investigation into the impact on users when
   interfaces are distributed across this type of dual screen setup. This
   article reports on a series of experiments carried out to determine if
   there is a significant quantitative or qualitative effect on user
   performance when interaction is split across large public and smaller
   private screens.}},

Abstract = {{The scaling of Silicon devices has exacerbated the unreliability of
   modern computer systems, and power constraints have necessitated the
   involvement of software in hardware error detection. Simultaneously, the
   multi-core revolution has impelled software to become parallel.
   Therefore, there is a compelling need to protect parallel programs from
   hardware errors.
   Parallel programs' tasks have significant similarity in control data due
   to the use of high-level programming models. In this study, we propose
   BLOCKWATCH to leverage the similarity in parallel program's control data
   for detecting hardware errors. BLOCKWATCH statically extracts the
   similarity among different threads of a parallel program and checks the
   similarity at runtime. We evaluate BLOCKWATCH on seven SPLASH-2
   benchmarks to measure its performance overhead and error detection
   coverage. We find that BLOCKWATCH incurs an average overhead of 16\%
   across all programs, and provides an average SDC coverage of 97\% for
   faults in the control data.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel zero voltage switching full-bridge converter with

   presented. The target application for this work is the second stage
   dc-dc converter in a two stage 1.65 kW on-board charger for a plug-in
   hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). For this application the design
   objective is to achieve high efficiency and lower cost in order to
   minimize the charger size, charging time and the amount and cost of
   electricity drawn from the utility. A detailed converter operation
   analysis is presented along with simulation and experimental results. In
   comparison to a benchmark full-bridge with LC output filter, the
   proposed converter reduces the reverse recovery losses in the secondary
   rectifier diodes, therefore enabling a converter switching frequency of
   100 kHz. Experimental results are presented for a prototype unit
   converting 400 V from the input dc link to an output voltage range of
   200 V to 450 V dc at 1650 W. The prototype achieves a peak efficiency of

Abstract = {{Crystalline silica and its presence in dust generated during various
   construction activities may pose a health hazard to construction
   workers. In this article, the occupational exposure to crystalline
   silica and the related long-term health (cancer and non-cancer) risks
   among construction workers from five different trades (activities) were
   evaluated using a probabilistic approach. The predicted 95th percentile
   of the excess lifetime cancer risk and hazard quotients for exposure to
   crystalline silica ranged from 4.5 x 10(-5) to 1.2 x 10(-4), and 15 to
   37, respectively. The efficiency of the state-of-the-art technologies to
   reduce silica inhalation at construction sites are evaluated in the
   context of reduction in long-term health risks to the construction
   workers. The use of engineering controls and personal protective
   equipments to reduce the exposure to crystalline silica reduced the
   hazard quotient and excess lifetime cancer risk approximately by 65\%
   and 78\%, respectively. The sensitivity analyses showed that the
   exposure concentration of crystalline silica was the most significant
   parameter in both cancer and non-cancer risk estimates for the
   construction workers. The breathing rate, the exposure factor, and the
   daily shift hours also significantly contribute to the cancer and

Abstract = {{Control of chemistry and shrinkage void in the final stages of the
   consolidation processes employed to produce Ti alloy ingots is critical
   from the standpoint of productivity as there is a direct correlation to
   the amount of material that must be removed prior to further downstream
   processing. The application of power to the top surface during this
   stage allows the raising of the depth of shrinkage voids; however, it
   can also cause excessive evaporation of volatile elements within the
   alloy. The balancing of these two factors represents a classic
   optimization problem. A mathematical model describing the final stage of
   a commercial consolidation process has been developed to assist in the
   optimization of the process. The model solves the coupled thermal-fluid
   flow problem including solute conservation and evaporation. Experimental
   measurements consisting of the sump depth, pool profile marking, and
   local composition analysis have been used to validate the model
   predictions under various casting conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A new 3D coupled hydro-mechanical granular model that simulates hot
   tearing formation in metallic alloys is presented. The hydro-mechanical
   model consists of four separate 3D modules. (I) The Solidification
   Module (SM) is used for generating the initial solid-liquid geometry.
   Based on a Voronoi tessellation of randomly distributed nucleation
   centers, this module computes solidification within each polyhedron
   using a finite element based solute diffusion calculation for each
   element within the tessellation. (II) The Fluid Flow Module (FFM)
   calculates the solidification shrinkage and deformation-induced pressure
   drop within the intergranular liquid. (III) The Semi-solid Deformation
   Module (SDM) is used to simulate deformation of the granular structure
   via a combined finite element/discrete element method. In this module,
   deformation of the solid grains is modeled using an elasto-viscoplastic
   constitutive law. (IV) The Failure Module (FM) is used to simulate crack
   initiation and propagation with the fracture criterion estimated from
   the overpressure required to overcome the capillary forces at the
   liquid-gas interface. The FFM, SDM, and FM are coupled processes since
   solid deformation, intergranular flow, and crack initiation are deeply
   linked together. The granular model predictions have been validated
   against bulk data measured experimentally and calculated with averaging
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Electroosmotic effect is usually utilized to generate the flow field in
   microfluidic systems. In many of these microdevices, an accurate control
   over the output flow rate of the microfluidic part is necessary for the
   successful operation of the whole system. In this study, a combined
   feedback/feedforward strategy is proposed to control the output flow
   rate in a micro-T-junction. First, finite element model of the
   electroosmotic flow in the T-junction is generated; second, using the
   adaptive neural fuzzy inference system, the finite element model forms a
   basis for generating training data for building an inverse model of the
   flow in the micro-T-junction. This inverse model serves as a controller
   in the feedforward part of the system. Then, in order to make the
   controller robust against disturbances and uncertainties such as
   dimensional tolerances, a Mamdani-type fuzzy logic controller is
   incorporated in the feedback part of the controller. Finally, simulation
   results are presented in order to proof the performance of the designed
   controller.}},

Abstract = {{Raman microspectroscopy is a non-destructive, label-free optical
   technique that offers information-rich molecular analysis of living
   cells. We report here the first Raman spectral study of human induced
   pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), and compare their Raman features to
   those of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and differentiated progeny
   of hESCs. Raman spectra from 687 cm(-1) to 1073 cm(-1) were collected
   from living hiPSCs, hESCs and hESCs non-specifically differentiated for
   20 days. Spectra of hiPSCs and hESCs were found to be highly similar,
   and both were distinguishable from differentiated hESCs in terms of
   relative Raman peak intensities and variances. Principal component
   analysis (PCA) of the spectra demonstrated a clear discrimination
   between hiPSCs and differentiated hESCs. These results suggested that
   reprogramming returned human somatic cells to a state where the overall
   cellular composition was similar to that of human embryonic stem cells.
   Some metabolic differences between the two groups of pluripotent cells
   could be inferred, however it was unclear whether or not these
   differences were related to reprogramming.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY}},

Pages = {{19031-19038}},
Abstract = {{A simple and reproducible sol-gel synthesis strategy was developed to
   fabricate hollow core carbon spheres (HCCSs) with hierarchical
   nanoarchitecture through the hydrolysis, self-assembly and
   co-condensation of bis-{[}3-(triethoxysilyl) propyl] disulfide (TESPDS)
   and octadecyltrimethoxysilane (C18TMS). This synthesis route allows one
   to fabricate thioether-bridged organosilica (TBOS) with tailored
   spherical structure and particle size which can be further converted to
   HCCS upon calcination under N-2 flow. It is assumed that hydrophobic
   octadecyl chains of hydrolyzed C18TMS first form a micelle-like
   self-assembly structure with hydrophilic trihydroxysilyl groups as
   heads, and a reactive core is then expanded by the base-catalyzed
   co-condensation of TESPDS and/or C18TMS over the C18TMS self-assembly
   structure. The organic moieties of TESPDS and C18TMS not only serve as a
   porogen during the formation of TBOS but also as a carbon precursor for
   transformation of TBOS into HCCS during the carbonization. Due to its
   unique hierarchical nanostructure composed of hollow macroporous core
   and meso/microporous shell, which facilitates fast mass transport, along
   with large surface area for electrical charge storage, the HCCS for the
   first time exhibits ultrahigh specific capacitance and energy, good
   cycling performance and rate capability.}},

Abstract = {{The positioning performance of high-speed, high-accuracy light-weight
   motion control systems is usually restricted by the structure
   flexibility and model parameter-varying caused by load mass variation.
   It needs to develop novel motion control algorithm to eliminate the
   residual vibration in the end-effectors, as well as to be robust over
   the load mass variation. This paper addresses the first and crucial step
   of this problem, modeling and identification technique. The linear
   parameter-varying model of the system is constructed and analyzed. The
   parameters and affine function identification method based on nonlinear
   least-squares and principle component analysis technique is proposed.
   The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through a
   lightweight machine experimental setup. It is general enough to be
   applicable to the dynamic behaviors analysis and gain-scheduling robust
   control design for industrial lightweight vibration suppression and
   motion control systems that possess flexible elements and variable
   loads.}},

Title = {{PHASE-SHIFTER-LESS BEAM SCANNING OF A RECEIVE ARRAY USING SPATIAL LO
   DISTRIBUTION}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{A new scheme for phase-shifter-less beam scanning is proposed, which is
   based on spatial distribution of local oscillator (LO) signal among a
   number of heterodyne receivers. Each receiver connected to an element of
   the phased array receives not only the RF signal but also the LO signal.
   The required inter-element phase shift is acquired by different path
   lengths from the antenna radiating the LO signal to the array elements.
   The low-noise amplifier (LNA) following each array element amplifies
   both the RF and LO signals. Since the LO signal is of a relatively
   higher power level, the LNA nonlinearity is employed intentionally to
   mix the RF and LO signals. The generated IF signal at the output
   corresponds to a directive receive pattern at the RF frequency whose
   main lobe can be scanned by varying the position of the LO feed antenna.
   This paper demonstrates the configuration in which the scan range of the
   main lobe can be as wide as 106 degrees while maintaining a constant
   maximum gain with less than 10\% variation. Over this scan range, the
   characteristics of the array receive pattern are not affected for RF
   received power levels exceeding -100 dBm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effect of channel hot carrier stress (CHCS)
   on gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) current in n-type
   metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (n-MOSFETs) with
   HfO2/Ti1-xNx gate stacks. It was found that the behavior of GIDL current
   during CHCS has dependence with the interfacial layer (IL) oxide
   thickness of high-k/metal gate stacks. As IL thickness becomes thinner,
   the GIDL current has a gradual decrease during CHCS, which is contrary
   to the result of thick-oxide IL devices. Based on the variation of GIDL
   current (Delta I-GIDL) in different stress voltage across gate and drain
   terminals, trap-assisted band to band holes injection model was proposed
   to explain the different behavior of GIDL current for different IL
   thickness. Furthermore, we also investigated the impact of different
   Ti1-xNx composition of metal gate electrode on the Delta I-GIDL after
   CHCS, and observed that the magnitude of Delta I-GIDL decreases with the
   increase of nitride ratio. This is due to the fact that nitride atoms
   diffusing from the metal gate fill up oxygen vacancies, and reduce the
   concentration of traps in high-k dielectric. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {{Due to improved kinetics and reduced CO poisoning effects, higher
   temperature alcohol fuel cells have been shown to have higher activity
   and increased performance output when compared to lower temperature
   alcohol fuel cells. In this work, the Direct Alcohol Phosphoric Acid
   Fuel Cell (DAPAFC) with methanol and ethanol as reactant fuels, and Pt
   and PtRu as catalysts is studied. The electrolyte/separator consists of
   Phosphoric Acid in a Silicon Carbide (SiC) matrix and replaces
   conventional polymer electrolyte or PBI membranes. Comprehensive studies
   are conducted to demonstrate the performance effects of the Gas
   Diffusion Layer (GDL), Micro-porous Layer (MPL) and such parameters as
   the stream pressures, higher temperature operation (120-180 degrees C),
   and the thickness of the SiC separator, etc. Results show that at the
   same operating conditions, the cell performance is comparable to that of
   a vapour fed Nafion membrane based fuel cell. Structure improvement of
   the Phosphoric Acid Electrode Assembly (PAEA) and reactant vapor
   composition can significantly improve durability. This type of fuel cell
   demonstrates performance improvement and stability in a higher
   temperature range than is possible with the conventional PEMFC. (C) 2012

   Methods: A brief written survey was administered prior to, and
   approximately 1 h after a 30-min presentation on whiplash injury and
   prevention measures, which was delivered at a regional fleet manager
   meeting held in British Columbia, Canada (n = 27 respondents).
   Results: Respondents had low baseline knowledge levels regarding the
   causes, consequences, and prevention of whiplash. Following the
   presentation, however, respondents improved awareness in all of these
   domains and, most important, reported an increased motivation to
   implement changes based on this newly acquired knowledge.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that improved education practices

   data hiding}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{This article investigates efficient blind watermark decoding approaches
   for hidden messages embedded into host images, within the framework of
   additive spread spectrum (SS) embedding based for data hiding. We study
   SS embedding in both the discrete cosine transform and the discrete
   Fourier transform (DFT) domains. The contributions of this article are
   multiple-fold: first, we show that the conventional SS scheme could not
   be applied directly into the magnitudes of the DFT, and thus we present
   a modified SS scheme and the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) decoder
   based on the Weibull distribution is derived. Secondly, we investigate
   the improved spread spectrum (ISS) embedding, an improved technique of
   the traditional additive SS, and propose the modified ISS scheme for
   information hiding in the magnitudes of the DFT coefficients and the
   optimal ML decoders for ISS embedding are derived. We also provide
   thorough theoretical error probability analysis for the aforementioned
   decoders. Thirdly, sub-optimal decoders, including local optimum decoder
   (LOD), generalized maximum likelihood (GML) decoder, and linear minimum
   mean square error (LMMSE) decoder, are investigated to reduce the
   required prior information at the receiver side, and their theoretical
   decoding performances are derived. Based on decoding performances and
   the required prior information for decoding, we discuss the preferred
   host domain and the preferred decoder for additive SS-based data hiding
   under different situations. Extensive simulations are conducted to
   illustrate the decoding performances of the presented decoders.}},

Title = {{An improved method for the removal of ring artifacts in high resolution
   CT imaging}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{In high resolution computed tomography (CT) using flat panel detectors,
   imperfect or defected detector elements cause stripe artifacts in
   sinogram which results in concentric ring artifacts in the image. Such
   ring artifacts obscure image details in the regions of interest of the
   image. In this article, novel techniques are proposed for the detection,
   classification, and correction of ring artifacts in the sinogram domain.
   The proposed method is suitable for multislice CT with parallel or fan
   beam geometry. It can also be employed for ring artifact removal in 3D
   cone beam volume CT by adopting a sinogram by sinogram processing
   technique. The detection algorithm is based on applying data driven
   thresholds on the mean curve and difference curve of the sinogram. The
   ring artifacts are classified into three types and a separate correction
   algorithm is used for each class. The performance of the proposed
   techniques is evaluated on a number of real micro-CT images.
   Experimental results corroborate that the proposed algorithm can remove
   ring artifacts from micro-CT images more effectively as compared to
   other recently reported techniques in the literature.}},

   single cells}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{2687-2695}},
Abstract = {{We present a microfluidic technique for measuring the deformability of
   single cells using the pressure required to deform such cells through
   micrometre-scale tapered constrictions. Our technique is equivalent to
   whole-cell micropipette aspiration, but involves considerably simpler
   operation, less specialized equipment, and less technical skill. Single
   cells are infused into a microfluidic channel, and then deformed through
   a series of funnel-shaped constrictions. The constriction openings are
   sized to create a temporary seal with each cell as it passes through the
   constriction, replicating the interaction with the orifice of a
   micropipette. Precisely controlled deformation pressures are generated
   using an external source and then attenuated 100 : 1 using an on-chip
   microfluidic circuit. Our apparatus is capable of generating precisely
   controlled pressures as small as 0.3 Pa in a closed microchannel
   network, which is impervious to evaporative losses that normally limit
   the precision of such equipment. Intrinsic cell deformability, expressed
   as cortical tension, is determined from the threshold deformation
   pressure using the liquid-drop model. We measured the deformability of
   several types of nucleated cells and determined the optimal range of
   constriction openings. The cortical tension of passive human neutrophils
   was measured to be 37.0 +/- 4.8 pN mu m(-1), which is consistent with
   previous micropipette aspiration studies. The cortical tensions of human
   lymphocytes, RT4 human bladder cancer cells, and L1210 mouse lymphoma
   cells were measured to be 74.7 +/- 9.8, 185.4 +/- 25.3, and 235.4 +/-
   31.0 pN mu m(-1) respectively. The precision and usability of our
   technique demonstrates its potential as a biomechanical assay for
   wide-spread use in biological and clinical laboratories.}},

Title = {{A Circadian Rhythm in Heart Rate Variability Contributes to the
   Increased Cardiac Sympathovagal Response to Awakening in the Morning}},
Journal = {{CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{757-768}},
Abstract = {{Morning hours are associated with a heightened risk of adverse
   cardiovascular events. Recent evidence suggests that the sleep-wake
   cycle and endogenous circadian system modulate cardiac function in
   humans and may contribute to these epidemiological findings. The aim of
   the present study was to investigate the interaction between circadian
   and sleep-wake-dependent processes on heart rate variability (HRV).
   Fifteen diurnally active healthy young adults underwent a 72-h ultradian
   sleep-wake cycle (USW) procedure (alternating 60-min wake episodes in
   dim light and 60-min nap opportunities in total darkness) in time
   isolation. The present study revealed a significant main effect of
   sleep-wake-dependent and circadian processes on cardiac rhythmicity, as
   well as a significant interaction between these processes. Turning the
   lights off was associated with a rapid increase in mean RR interval and
   cardiac parasympathetic modulation (high-frequency {[}HF] power),
   whereas low-frequency (LF) power and sympathovagal balance (LF:HF ratio)
   were reduced (p <= .001). A significant circadian rhythm in mean RR
   interval and HRV components was observed throughout the wake and nap
   episodes (p <= .001). Sleep-to-wake transitions occurring in the morning
   were associated with maximal shifts towards sympathetic autonomic
   activation as compared to those occurring during the rest of the day.
   Namely, peak LF:HF ratio was observed in the morning, coincidental with
   peak salivary cortisol levels. These results contribute to our
   understanding of the observed increase in cardiovascular vulnerability
   after awakening in the morning. (Author correspondence:

Title = {{Evaluating leakage potential in water distribution systems: a
   fuzzy-based methodology}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{240-252}},
Abstract = {{Loss of water due to leakage is a common phenomenon observed in all
   water distribution systems. However, the water loss can be reduced to an
   acceptable limit by improved understanding of leakage mechanisms and
   pathways, and the influencing factors that lead to leakage. This study
   proposes a methodology to estimate leakage potential (LP) in a water
   distribution system (WDS). The study has identified various factors
   which are directly and/or indirectly associated with LP in a WDS. The
   research has defined a selected set of influencing factors as fuzzy
   variables and has developed a fuzzy rule-based (FRB) model using Mamdani
   inferencing algorithm. The impact of influencing factors varies under
   different operating pressure, therefore a generalized methodology has
   been proposed. The proposed methodology has been implemented for a real
   WDS in Bangkok (Thailand). To evaluate the impacts of uncertainties of
   influencing factors on LP, Monte Carlo simulation-based sensitivity
   analysis has been carried out. It has been concluded that the operating
   system pressure and age of the network are the two most important
   factors that contribute to LP of a WDS. The proposed model will help
   water utility managers to prioritize their network rehabilitation
   strategies and to establishing an efficient active leakage control
   program.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon photonic resonators, implemented using silicon-on-insulator
   substrates, are promising for numerous applications. The most commonly
   studied resonators are ring/racetrack resonators. We have fabricated
   these and other resonators including disk resonators, waveguide-grating
   resonators, ring resonator reflectors, contra-directional
   grating-coupler ring resonators, and racetrack-based
   multiplexer/demultiplexers.
   While numerous resonators have been demonstrated for sensing purposes,
   it remains unclear as to which structures provide the highest
   sensitivity and best limit of detection; for example, disc resonators
   and slot-waveguide-based ring resonators have been conjectured to
   provide an improved limit of detection. Here, we compare various
   resonators in terms of sensor metrics for label-free bio-sensing in a
   micro-fluidic environment. We have integrated resonator arrays with PDMS
   micro-fluidics for real-time detection of biomolecules in experiments
   such as antigen-antibody binding reaction experiments using Human Factor
   IX proteins. Numerous resonators are fabricated on the same wafer and
   experimentally compared. We identify that, while evanescent-field
   sensors all operate on the principle that the analyte's refractive index
   shifts the resonant frequency, there are important differences between
   implementations that lie in the relationship between the optical field
   overlap with the analyte and the relative contributions of the various
   loss mechanisms.
   The chips were fabricated in the context of the CMC-UBC Silicon
   Nanophotonics Fabrication course and workshop. This yearlong,
   design-based, graduate training program is offered to students from
   across Canada and, over the last four years, has attracted participants
   from nearly every Canadian university involved in photonics research.
   The course takes students through a full design cycle of a photonic
   circuit, including theory, modelling, design, and experimentation.}},

Title = {{Deformation and energy of dry snow slabs prior to fracture propagation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{209}},
Pages = {{553-564}},
Abstract = {{Snow slab avalanches primarily release by propagation of shear fractures
   within thin weak layers under thicker slabs. The weak layer is typically
   on the order of 1 mm thick and fails in mode II. In some cases, the weak
   layer is thicker and there may be a need to consider slope-normal
   deformation as part of the energy condition prior to rapid propagation.
   In this paper, field measurements from shear fracture initiation and
   high-speed films are combined to consider the effects of slope-normal
   deformation on bending of the slab prior to propagation and its relation
   to the propagation condition. Slab bending is modelled using two
   limiting cases: (1) a uniformly loaded beam supported by a deforming
   weak layer, analogous to a Winkler foundation, and (2) a uniformly
   loaded unsupported cantilevered beam. The experimental and analytical
   results suggest that slab bending prior to fracture initiation is small
   or negligible. Two previous approaches to modelling slab avalanche
   initiation involving slab bending are discussed. Both models proposed
   strong slab-bending effects prior to initiation, which conflicts with
   our results. Our field observations and modelling both show that strong
   bending is a dynamic effect following slope-parallel weak-layer fracture
   initiation.}},

Title = {{Removal of individual sterols during secondary treatment of pulp mill
   effluents}},
Journal = {{WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{56-65}},
Abstract = {{Analysis of plant sterols in pulp mill effluents is complex and several
   investigations have combined wood extractives with sterols or have
   reported total sterols collectively. The present study exclusively
   focuses on the fate of individual sterols generated in pulp and paper
   manufacturing as they pass through activated sludge biotreatment system.
   Before secondary treatment the pulp mill effluents contained 33\%
   beta-sitosterol, 26\% campesterol, 22\% beta-sitostanol, 17\%
   stigmasterol and 2\% ergosterol (1,000-1,800 mu g/L mean total sterols).
   After treatment, the effluents contained 44\% beta-sitosterol, 22\%
   campesterol, 18\%beta-sitostanol, 14\% stigmasterol and 2\% ergosterol
   (176-428 mu g/L mean total sterols). Each sterol fraction showed
   different removal efficiency. beta-Sitosterol, the major fraction, was
   removed relatively poorly (65\%) while campesterol was removed most
   efficiently (81\%) compared with the removal of other fractions
   (beta-sitostanol 74\% and stigmasterol 64\%). The differential removal
   of sterol fractions altered the sterol profile during different stages
   of the secondary treatment. Owing to its poor removal, beta-sitosterol
   is the most persistent fraction in treated/untreated pulp mill
   effluents. Typically, 21\% of the incoming sterols were contained in
   secondary effluents and 23\% in waste sludge without biodegradation.
   Optimizing the design/operation of treatment systems for removal of
   beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol would improve the performance of
   effluent treatment facilities.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{The separation of biological cells by filtration through microstructured
   constrictions is limited by unpredictable variations of the filter
   hydrodynamic resistance as cells accumulate in the microstructure.
   Applying a reverse flow to unclog the filter will undo the separation
   and reduce filter selectivity because of the reversibility of
   low-Reynolds number flow. We introduce a microfluidic structural ratchet
   mechanism to separate cells using oscillatory flow. Using model cells
   and microparticles, we confirmed the ability of this mechanism to sort
   and separate cells and particles based on size and deformability. We
   further demonstrate that the spatial distribution of cells after sorting
   is repeatable and that the separation process is irreversible. This
   mechanism can be applied generally to separate cells that differ based
   on size and deformability.}},

Abstract = {{In freehand 3D ultrasound, images are acquired while the position of the
   transducer is recorded with a tracking device. Calibration is essential
   in this technique to find the transformation from the image coordinates
   to the reference coordinate system. The single wall technique is a
   common calibration method because a simple plane phantom is used.
   Despite its advantages, such as ease of phantom construction and image
   analysis, this method requires large number of images to converge to the
   solution. One reason is a lack of a closed-form solution. Also, the
   technique uses slightly ill-conditioned sets of equations with a high
   condition number due to limited range of scanning motions that produce
   clear images of the plane. Here, a novel closed-form formulation has
   been proposed for the single wall calibration technique. Also,
   differential measurements of the plane image are used instead of
   absolute plane detection to improve accuracy. The closed-form solution
   leads to more accurate and robust results while providing an insight

Abstract = {{The placement of an epidural needle is among the most difficult regional
   anesthetic techniques. Ultrasound has been proposed to improve success
   of placement. However, it has not become the standard-of-care because of
   limitations in the depictions and interpretation of the key anatomical
   features. We propose to augment the ultrasound images with a registered
   statistical shape model of the spine to aid interpretation. The model is
   created with a novel deformable group-wise registration method which
   utilizes a probabilistic approach to register groups of point sets. The
   method is compared to a volume-based model building technique and it
   demonstrates better generalization and compactness. We instantiate and
   register the shape model to a spine surface probability map extracted
   from the ultrasound images. Validation is performed on human subjects.
   The achieved registration accuracy (2-4 mm) is sufficient to guide the
   choice of puncture site and trajectory of an epidural needle.}},

Abstract = {{Fully developed speckle has been used previously to estimate the
   out-of-plane motion of ultrasound images. However, in real tissue the
   rarity of such patterns and the presence of coherency diminish both the
   precision and the accuracy of the out-of-plane motion estimation. In
   this paper, for the first time, we propose a simple mathematical
   derivation for out-of-plane motion estimation in which the coherent and
   non-coherent parts of the RF echo signal are separated. This method is
   based on the Rician-Inverse Gaussian stochastic model of the speckle
   formation process, which can be considered as a generalized form of the
   K-distribution with richer parameterization. The flexibility of the
   proposed method allows considering any patch of the RF echo signal for
   the purpose of displacement estimation. The experimental results on real
   tissue demonstrate the potential of the proposed method for accurate
   out-of-plane estimation. The underestimation of motion in ex vivo bovine
   tissue at 1 mm displacement is reduced to 15.5\% compared to 37\% for a
   base-line method.}},

Abstract = {{The ultrasound radio-frequency (RF) time series method has been shown to
   be an effective approach for accurate tissue classification and cancer
   detection. Previous studies of the RF time series method were based on a
   serial MATLAB implementation of feature calculation that involved long
   running times. Clinical applications of the RF time series method
   require a fast and efficient implementation that enables realistic
   imaging studies within a short time frame. In this paper, a parallel
   implementation of the RF time series method is developed to support
   clinical ultrasound imaging studies. The parallel implementation uses a
   Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to compute the tissue classification
   features of the RF time series method. Moreover, efficient graphical
   representations of the RF times series features are obtained using the
   Qt framework. Tread computing is used to concurrently compute and
   visualize the RF time series features. The parallel implementation of
   the RF time series is evaluated for various configurations of number of
   frames and number of scan lines per frame acquired in an imaging study.
   Results demonstrate that the parallel implementation enables imaging of
   tissue classification at interactive time. A typical RF time series of
   128 frames and 128 scan lines per frame, the parallel implementation be
   processed in 0.8128 +/- 0.0420 sec.}},

Abstract = {{Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors exploit optical coupling to
   surface plasmons, light waves bound to a metal surface. In the most
   common configuration, a SPR sensor is used with an external light
   source, optical components to polarize incident light and guide light to
   and from a metal surface, a coupling device to convert free-space light
   into surface plasmons and back into free-space light, and a light
   detector. The light source, the optical components, and the light
   detector are external to the SPR device, and the coupling structure is
   often integrated directly with the surface-plasmon-sustaining metal
   surface. The requirement of several external components restricts the
   miniaturization of SPR devices and prohibits low-cost implementation. To
   address these limitations, we design, fabricate, and test a new SPR
   device chip that is fibre-addressable, does not require a discrete
   coupling structure, and integrates light delivery, light polarization
   control, surface plasmon coupling onto a thin, flexible substrate. Our
   SPR chip is constructed from a thin gold layer deposited on top of a
   clear plastic sheet, which is then optically connected from the bottom
   surface onto a plastic linear polarizer sheet. Two cleaved fibres, one
   to input light and the other to collect reflected light, are then
   optically attached to SPR device. We experimentally characterize the SPR
   device and find good agreement between our measurements and a
   theoretical model based on transfer matrix formalism.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated photoconductive (PC) element is introduced as a new
   optoelectronic device in free-space optical (FSO) wireless applications.
   The device is a fundamental extension of the standard PC switch, as it
   has the capabilities for both local optoelectronic signal reception and
   active directional angle of arrival (AOA) sensing. This second
   capability is brought about through the use of a three-phase
   differential technique through three triangular PC switches arranged in
   a corner-cube architecture. Each PC switch is comprised of 50/150 nm
   Cr/Au electrodes, patterned on either side of a 200-micron GaAs PC gap,
   and is biased with the superposition of common DC and AC three-phase
   (120 degrees phase-shifted) bias voltages. The DC bias forms a summed
   signal photocurrent on the central vertex output electrode and
   facilitates data reception; the AC three-phase bias facilitates link
   reliability for diversity reception in optical wireless communication
   systems. Complete theoretical and experimental angular characteristics
   of this device are presented in this work.}},

Abstract = {{Passive dampers can be used to connect two adjacent structures in order

   experimental studies have confirmed efficiency and applicability of
   various connecting devices, such as viscous damper, MR damper, etc.
   However, few papers employed optimization methods to find the optimal
   mechanical properties of the dampers, and in most papers, dampers are
   assumed to be uniform. In this study, we optimized the optimal damping
   coefficients of viscous dampers considering a general case of
   non-uniform damping coefficients. Since the derivatives of objective
   function to damping coefficients are not known, to optimize damping
   coefficients, a heuristic search method, i.e. the genetic algorithm, is
   employed. Each structure is modeled as a multi degree of freedom dynamic
   system consisting of lumped-masses, linear springs and dampers. In order
   to examine dynamic behavior of the structures, simulations in frequency
   domain are carried out. A pseudo-excitation based on Kanai-Tajimi
   spectrum is used as ground acceleration. The optimization results show
   that relaxing the uniform dampers coefficient assumption generates
   significant improvement in coupling effectiveness. To investigate
   efficiency of genetic algorithm, solution quality and solution time of
   genetic algorithm are compared with those of Nelder-Mead algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Post-earthquake rapid recovery of bridge is one of the prime objectives
   for performance based design. Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) has the unique
   ability to undergo large deformation, but can regain its undeformed
   shape through stress removal (i.e. superelasticity), which brings about
   an added advantage in seismic regions. In an attempt to reduce permanent
   damage of concrete bridges, a hybrid RC bridge pier configuration is
   presented here. In the proposed configurations of bridge piers, the
   plastic hinge region is reinforced with SMA and the remaining portion
   with regular steel. Residual displacement is a critical parameter for
   performance based earthquake engineering as it dictates the
   functionality of a member after an earthquake. This paper evaluates
   fragility-based seismic vulnerability of SMA reinforced concrete bridge
   pier considering residual displacement. Fragility curves have also been
   used to assess the relative performance of SMA with conventional steel
   RC bridge pier. Probabilistic Seismic Demand Model (PSDM) has been used
   in generating the fragility functions. The development of these
   fragility curves for bridge piers aid in expressing the potential impact
   of SMA on the bridge pier vulnerability.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the temperature dependency of the physical properties such
   as surface emissivity, which controls the radiative problem, is
   fundamental for determining the thermal balance of many scientific and
   industrial processes. The surface emissivity generally depends on
   surface temperature, wavelength, surface material geometry (curvature,
   roughness), and direction of observation, and often changes with
   oxidation, melting, coating, and even surface pollution. Current work
   studies the influences of temperature dependency of surface emissivity
   on heat transfer in a lumped system. The problem was investigated for
   both one-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) systems. For 1-D
   equations, two recent analytical methods called the homotopy
   perturbation method (HPM) and parameterized perturbation method (PPM)
   are presented. Unlike classic perturbation methods, these techniques do
   not need small parameters for nonlinear heat transfer equations. Thus,
   we can apply them for large values of surface emissivity. For the 2-D
   domain, a finite-element code is used to obtain the unsteady
   distribution of temperature. Three different functions were chosen to
   describe the thermal behavior of surface emissivity. The solutions of
   1-D nonlinear equations are compared with the accurate numerical
   fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, and excellent agreement (maximum error
   of 0.0021\%) was observed. The capabilities of employed analytical
   methods are discussed and it is shown that HPM needs fewer series terms
   in comparison with PPM. For both 1-D and 2-D equations, it is
   illustrated that the temperature gradient increased by adding to the
   order of emissivity variation versus temperature.}},

Title = {{M-Ary RFID Tags Splitting With Small Idle Slots}},

Abstract = {{In radio frequency identifications (RFIDs), an idle slot can be
   interrupted by the reader and takes less time than the other slots. In
   this case, the widely used binary splitting (BS) protocol is not
   optimal. M-ary splitting (M > 2) with a carefully selected M outperforms
   BS, because it can take into account smaller duration of the idle slots.
   In this paper, we provide optimal value of M(M-opt) for varying slot
   sizes that yields minimum identification time. The proposed scheme is
   called optimal splitting (OS). We also revise OS to deal with mobile
   tags and propose the optimal splitting with arrival tags blocking
   (OS-ATB) protocol. Extensive simulations show that OS and OS-ATB
   consistently yield better performance than the other splitting and
   tree-based schemes.
   Note to Practitioners-An RFID reader can interrupt the slot in which no
   tags reply for a predefined time interval, resulting in an short idle
   slot. In this case, binary splitting is not the best choice but simple
   increase of the splitting level can yield much better performance. Since
   the slot sizes are usually fixed for a given system, the optimum value
   can be calculated offline without introducing extra computation
   complexity during the real-time identification.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{371-380}},
Abstract = {{Occupational whole-body vibration is often studied as a risk factor for
   conditions that may arise soon after exposure, but only rarely have
   studies examined associations with conditions arising long after
   occupational exposure has ceased. We aimed to develop a method of
   constructing previous occupational whole-body vibration exposure metrics
   from self-reported data collected for a case-control study of
   Parkinson's disease. A detailed job history and exposure interview was
   administered to 808 residents of British Columbia, Canada (403 people
   with Parkinson's disease and 405 healthy controls). Participants were
   prompted to report exposure to whole-body vibrating equipment. We
   limited the data to exposure reports deemed to be above background
   exposures and used the whole-body vibration literature (typically
   reporting on seated vector sum measurements) to assign intensity
   (acceleration) values to each type of equipment reported. We created
   four metrics of exposure (duration of exposure, most intense equipment
   exposure, and two dose metrics combining duration and intensity) and
   examined their distributions and correlations. We tested the role of age
   and gender in predicting whole-body vibration exposure. Thirty-six
   percent of participants had at least one previous occupational exposure
   to whole-body vibrating equipment. Because less than half of
   participants reported exposure, all continuous metrics exhibited
   positively skewed distributions, although the distribution of most
   intense equipment exposure was more symmetrically distributed among the
   exposed. The arithmetic mean of duration of exposure among those exposed
   was 14.0 (standard deviation, SD: 14.2) work years, while the geometric
   mean was 6.8 (geometric SD, GSD: 4.5). The intensity of the most intense
   equipment exposure (among the exposed) had an arithmetic mean of 0.9
   (SD: 0.3) m.s(-2) and a geometric mean of 0.8 (GSD: 1.4). Male gender
   and older age were both associated with exposure, although the effect of
   age was attenuated after adjustment for gender. The methods developed
   allowed us to create continuous metrics of whole-body vibration
   retrospectively, displaying useful variance for epidemiologic studies.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) with economic objective
   attracts growing interest. In our previous work {[}1], nominal stability
   of economically oriented NMPC for cyclic processes was proved by
   introducing a transformed system, and an infinite horizon NMPC
   formulation with discount factors was proposed. Moreover, the nominal
   stability property for economically oriented NMPC was analyzed in {[}2]
   for a class of systems satisfying strong duality. In this study, we
   extend the previous stability analysis in {[}1] to a general infinite
   horizon NMPC formulation with economic objectives. Instead of the strong
   duality assumption, we require the stage cost to be strongly convex,
   which is easier to check for a general nonlinear system. In addition,
   robust stability of this NMPC controller is also analyzed based on the
   Input-to-State Stability (ISS) framework. A simulated nonlinear double
   tank system subject to periodic change in electricity price is presented
   to illustrate the stability property. Finally, an industrial size air
   separation unit case study with periodic electricity cost is presented.

Abstract = {{This article deals with a numerical study of entropy analysis in mixed
   convection MHD flow of nanofluid over a non-linear stretching sheet
   taking into account the effects of viscous dissipation and variable
   magnetic field. The nanofluid is made of such nano particles as SiO2
   with pure water as a base fluid. To analyze the problem, at first the
   boundary layer equations are transformed into non-linear ordinary
   equations using a similarity transformation. The resultant equations are
   then solved numerically using the Keller-Box scheme based on the
   implicit finite-difference method. The effects of different
   non-dimensional governing parameters such as magnetic parameter,
   nanoparticles volume fraction, Nusselt, Richardson, Eckert, Hartman,
   Brinkman, Reynolds and entropy generation numbers are investigated in
   details. The results indicate that increasing the nano particles to the
   base fluids causes the reduction in shear forces and a decrease in
   stretching sheet heat transfer coefficient. Also, decreasing the
   magnetic parameter and increasing the Eckert number result in improves
   heat transfer rate. Furthermore, the surface acts as a strong source of
   irreversibility due to the higher entropy generation number near the

Abstract = {{Three commercial starches were evaluated in conjunction iwth colloidal

   of the starch was added after the flocculant but before the silica. The
   pulp used was peroxide bleached thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP). A
   statistical design methodology was employed and empirical process models
   were constructed based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) results. The
   models were then employed to predict the retention and drainage. It was
   found that the high-charged cationic starch gave the highest retention
   and best drainage performance. The high-charged cationic starch S880
   also resulted in stronger paper, probably because of the larger and
   stronger flocs produced and its higher affinity with the fiber and
   fines. Finally, pre-flocculation was found to provide stronger paper

Abstract = {{Digital microfluidic (DMF) devices manipulate minuscule droplets through
   basic fluidic operations including droplet transport, mixing and
   splitting commonly known as the building blocks for complete laboratory
   analyses on a single device. A DMF device can house various chemical
   species and confine chemical reactions within the volume of a droplet
   much like a micro-reactor. The automation of fluidic protocols requires
   a feedback controller whose sensor is capable of locating droplets
   independent of liquid composition (or previous knowledge of liquid
   composition). In this research, we present an estimator that tracks the
   continuous displacement of a droplet between electrodes of a DMF device.
   The estimator uses a dimensionless ratio of two electrode capacitances
   to approximate the position of a droplet, even, in the domain between
   two adjacent electrodes. This droplet position estimator significantly
   enhances the control precision of liquid handling in DMF devices
   compared to that of the techniques reported in the literature. It
   captures the continuous displacement of a droplet; valuable information
   for a feedback controller to execute intricate fluidic protocols
   including droplet positioning between electrodes, droplet velocity and
   acceleration control. We propose a state estimator for tracking the
   continuous droplet displacement between two adjacent electrodes. The
   dimensionless nature of this estimator means that any droplet
   composition can be sensed. Thus, no calibration for each chemical
   species within a single DMF device is required. We present theoretical
   and experimental results that demonstrate the efficacy of the position
   estimator in approximating the position of the droplet in the interval
   between two electrodes.}},

   the absence of online travel time data from neighbour links, historical
   records only have to be relied upon. However, where the two types of
   data are available, a data fusion scheme can be applied to make use of
   the two clues. The proposed framework is validated using real-life data
   from the City of Vancouver, British Columbia. The estimation accuracy is
   found to be comparable to the existing literature. Overall, the results

Abstract = {{A dynamically-controlled power-gated (DCPG) FPGA architecture has
   recently been proposed to reduce static energy dissipation during idle
   periods. During a power mode transition from an off state to on state,
   the wakeup current drawn from power supplies causes a voltage droop on
   the power distribution network of a device. If not handled
   appropriately, this current and the associated voltage droop could cause
   malfunction of the design and/or the device. In DCPG FPGAs, the amount
   of wakeup current is not known beforehand as the structures of
   power-gated modules are application dependent; thus, a configurable
   solution is required to handle wakeup current. In this paper we propose
   a programmable wakeup architecture for DCPG FPGAs. The proposed solution
   has two levels: a fixed intra-region level and a configurable
   inter-region level. The architecture ensures that a power-gated module
   can be turned on such that the wakeup current constraints are not
   violated. We study the area and power overheads of the proposed
   solution. Our results show that the area overhead of the proposed inrush
   current limiting architecture is less than 2\% for a power gating region
   of size 3x3 or 4x4 tiles, and the leakage power saved is more than 85\%
   in a region of size 4x4 tiles.}},

Abstract = {{We present a connection between the viability kernel and maximal
   reachable sets. Current numerical schemes that compute the viability
   kernel suffer from a complexity that is exponential in the dimension of
   the state space. In contrast, extremely efficient and scalable
   techniques are available that compute maximal reachable sets. We show
   that under certain conditions these techniques can be used to
   conservatively approximate the viability kernel for possibly
   high-dimensional systems. We demonstrate the results on two practical
   examples, one of which is a seven-dimensional problem of safety in
   anesthesia.}},

Title = {{Development of Torrefaction Kinetics for British Columbia Softwoods}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL REACTOR ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{10}},
Abstract = {{Torrefaction is a thermal treatment without air or oxygen in the
   temperature range of 473-573 K. The pyrolysis kinetics of three chemical
   components (cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin) and wood at low
   temperatures of relevance to torrefaction conditions have been reviewed.
   A series of thermogravimetric (TG) experiments have been carried out to
   study the intrinsic torrefaction kinetics of major chemical components
   and British Columbia (BC) softwoods. The weight loss during BC softwood
   torrefaction was found to be mainly associated with the decomposition of
   hemicelluloses, although there was also certain degree of decomposition
   of cellulose and lignin. The weight loss of the BC softwoods during
   torrefaction could be approximately estimated from the chemical
   composition of wood species and the weight loss data for torrefaction of
   pure cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, respectively. Based on the
   fitting of the TG curves of BC softwoods and three chemical components,
   two different torrefaciton models were proposed. The simple one-step
   (single-stage) kinetic model with the first order reaction can predict
   the reaction data reasonably well over the long residence time, with the
   final sample weight being strongly related to the torrefaction
   temperature. A two-component and one-step first order reaction kinetic
   model, on the other hand, gave improved agreement with data over short
   residence time, and can be used to guide the design and optimization of
   torrefaction reactors over the weight loss range of 0 to 40\% at the
   temperature range of 533-573 K, which covers the typical range of
   industrially relevant operations.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the treatment of dairy manure using the
   microwave enhanced advanced oxidation process (MW-AOP) at pH 2. An
   experimental design was developed based on a statistical program using
   response surface methodology to explore the effects of temperature,
   hydrogen peroxide dosage and heating time on sugar production, nutrient
   release and solids destruction. Temperature, hydrogen peroxide dosage
   and acid concentration were key factors affecting reducing sugar
   production. The highest reducing sugar yield of 7.4\% was obtained at
   160 degrees C, 0 mL, 15 min heating time, and no H2O2 addition.
   Temperature was a dominant factor for an increase of soluble chemical
   oxygen demand (SCOD) in the treated dairy manure. The important factors
   for volatile fatty acids (VFA) production were microwave temperature and
   hydrogen peroxide dosage. Temperature was the most important parameter,
   and heating time, to a lesser extent affecting orthophosphate release.
   Heating time, hydrogen peroxide dosage and temperature were significant
   factors for ammonia release. There was a maximum of 96\% and 196\%
   increase in orthophosphate and ammonia concentration, respectively at
   160 degrees C, 0.5 mL H2O2 and 15 min heating time. The MW-AOP is an
   effective method in dairy manure treatment for sugar production,
   nutrient solubilisation, and solids disintegration.}},

Abstract = {{Arrays of two-degree of freedom analog micromirrors are designed for use
   within an high-contrast projector and fabricated using a multi-user MEMS
   fabrication process. We demonstrate a novel way of optimizing the
   tradeoffs between tilt angle and mirror size by subdividing the mirrors
   into smaller functional subsections that move synchronously. The mirror
   design employs multiple mirrors within a gimbal frame. The frame rotates
   around one axis, and each mirror within the frame rotates around a
   perpendicular axis, resulting in two-degree of freedom rotation. The
   design employs specific electrode shapes to allow one-layer connections.
   Using these fabricated mirrors, simultaneous actuation of mirrors within
   a composite structure is achieved. A prototype array of fabricated
   mirrors is described, with 6 x 5 mirrors each of 160 mu m x 160 mu m
   forming one composite mirror of an array, giving total active area of
   960 mu m x 800 mu m. The mirrors can achieve a maximum tilt angle of
   2.25 degrees. The fill factor of this design is 68\%. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper reports a ferrofluid control method that enables both
   attraction and repelling of ferrofluid on micropatterned planar coils
   coupled with permanent magnets. A combinational use of a controlled
   magnetic field and a bias field is shown to provide lateral forces that
   attract/repel the ferrolluid to/from the coil depending on the direction
   of the current passed through the coil. Active mirror devices whose
   mirrors are switched by ferrofluids are developed as a proof-of-concept
   of the actuation method toward the application to imaging devices and
   optical switches. The planar devices lithographically fabricated to have
   arrays of mirror-coil cells are used to demonstrate
   activation/deactivation of individual cells enabled by the bidirectional
   radial motion of the ferrofluid layer with similar to 100 mu m
   thickness. The static and dynamic behaviors of the ferrofluid in the
   devices are characterized through an image processing approach. Multiple
   mirror cells are selectively and simultaneously operated to show
   enhanced ferrofluid control uniquely available with the two modes of the
   actuation as well as to demonstrate pattern generation with the arrays.

Abstract = {{In Cognitive Radio (CR) systems, the fluctuating nature of the available
   frequency resource due to Primary Users (PUS) activity necessitates the
   introduction of admission and eviction measures at the CR system if a
   guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) is required by Real Time (RT)
   Secondary Users (SUs). This problem has been recently addressed in the
   literature with simplified assumptions that might become unrealistic in
   practical system setups. In this paper, we tackle the problem of
   admission and eviction control of RT SUs in multiple-user Orthogonal
   Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) CR systems and propose new
   solutions that are practical and efficient at the same time. In
   particular, we propose three different ways to install a Resource Buffer
   Zone (RBZ) at the time of admission to limit future call drops resulting
   from fluctuating PU activity. We also study the effect of PU activity on
   the feasibility of the resource allocation problem and propose three
   different methods to resolve system outages once they occur. Numerical
   results obtained through Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the
   efficacy of the proposed techniques. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {{A unified model is proposed for the austenite-to-ferrite transformation
   kinetics in binary Fe-Mn alloys that accounts for solute drag of Mn. To
   aid the model development, continuous cooling transformation (CCT) tests
   were conducted for an interstitial-free steel that can be considered as
   Fe-0.1\%Mn alloy. The experimental transformation data are supplemented
   with literature data for Fe-1\%Mn and Fe-2\%Mn alloys to establish a CCT
   database for Fe Mn alloys. The austenite-to-ferrite transformation
   kinetics is described from a fundamental perspective by assuming an
   interface-controlled reaction and including solute drag of Mn. Using the
   solute drag model of Fazeli and Militzer, intrinsic interface mobility,
   trans-interface diffusivity of Mn and its binding energy have been
   determined from the CCT data. The interfacial parameters are critically
   analyzed and compared with independent measurements of diffusion and
   grain boundary segregation.}},

Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{650-658}},
Abstract = {{The addition of 1.5-2 wt\% Si is a commonly used alloying approach for
   TRIP steels. Si delays cementite precipitation during bainite
   transformation thereby enabling that an adequate amount of austenite can
   be retained at room temperature due to sufficient carbon enrichment.
   However, the degree of cementite prevention and thus the fraction of
   retained austenite depend on the employed processing parameters and
   steel chemistry. The present work proposes a modelling framework to
   quantify the delayed carbide precipitation during bainite formation. A
   nucleation-growth based model describes the simultaneous formation of
   bainitic ferrite and cementite precipitation for various continuous
   cooling scenarios. The retarding effect of Si on cementite precipitation
   is explicitly accounted for. The fraction of bainite and the carbon
   content of the remaining austenite, which determines the M-s temperature
   of remaining austenite, can be tracked along non-isothermal processing
   paths. The proposed model is evaluated using continuous cooling
   transformation data for a 0.19C-1.5Mn-1.6Si-0.2Mo (wt\%) steel.}},

Abstract = {{The establishment, spread, and impact of the invasive bivalve Corbicula
   fluminea (C. fluminea), in Lake Tahoe threatens native species
   distribution in the lake and, potentially, has long-term implications
   for water clarity. In 2009, UBC-Gavia, an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle
   (AUV), was used as a platform to collect georeferenced imagery of the
   benthic regions of Lake Tahoe to determine the lake-wide distribution of
   C. fluminea. Images were collected in water depths less than 10 m at an
   approximately constant height above the bottom of 2 m. Images were
   processed using a semi-automated procedure to determine the ratio of the
   lakebed covered by exposed C. fluminea shells. A visual review was
   conducted on a subset of the images to determine presence of filamentous
   algae that has been observed in association with C. fluminea. Nearly 100
   km of shoreline was covered over a 7-d period, and C. fluminea presence
   was reconfirmed in 4 regions and additional 10 regions identified. In
   regions where the presence of C. fluminea was confirmed, C. fluminea
   depth distribution was validated by comparing image detection counts and
   results from a benthic sediment grab sample survey. Three regions around
   the lake were identified to have filamentous green algae or charophyte
   species. It was impossible to identify species of the known filamentous
   algal taxa (Cladophora glomerata, Spirogyra spp., and Zygnema spp.). The
   collected imagery provides a synoptic view on species distribution
   within the lake that can be used for efficient monitoring of invasive
   species in freshwater and saltwater bodies.}},

Abstract = {{Water droplets are an attractive medium to realize visible-frequency
   optical elements. The smoothness of a droplet surface mitigates losses
   due to light scattering, the shape of a water droplet is reconfigurable
   by either applying pressure or a potential, water is nearly transparent
   over the visible frequency range, and water is highly abundant. Here, we
   explore a simple methodology to dispense and shape water droplets for
   application as the magnifying element in a microscope using either
   reflection-mode or transmission-mode illumination. A water droplet is
   created at the end of a syringe and then coated with a thin layer of
   silicone oil to mitigate evaporation. By applying mechanical pressure to
   the water droplet using a metal tip, the shape of the droplet is tuned
   to yield focusing properties amenable for microscopy. Images captured
   using the microscope demonstrate micron-scale resolution, variable
   magnification, and imaging quality comparable to that obtained by a
   conventional, laboratory-grade microscope.}},

   will investigate this problem in detail through experiments. Through
   examining different biology tissues, it is found that SHG intensity
   drops down from shorter to longer wavelength from 375 nm to 460 nm. By
   comparing these curves with 1/lambda(n) dependence, the n is found to
   vary from 4.5 to 8.5. These patterns can not be fully explained by
   scattering properties of collagen. Other factors such as direct
   generation of SHG may have contribution to these wavelength dependence
   patterns, which needs further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The contents of lead, cadmium, zinc, copper, iron, manganese, nitrites,
   and nitrates were determined in six species of cabbage of the
   cruciferous family obtained from different areas of Poland. The results
   were analyzed and compared in termis of the effect of local industrial
   (southern Poland, Katowice) or agricultural (southeastern Poland,
   Lublin) activities on the amounts of heavy metals in the tested
   vegetables. While the levels of cadmium, lead, and manganese correlated
   well with the different industrial levels of the locations, the
   concentrations of copper, iron, and zinc in the vegetables were not very
   different between the two cities. All the vegetables could generally be
   characterized by low levels of cadmium and lead (less than 0.1
   mg.kg(-1)), and relatively high levels of zinc, iron, and manganese
   (3-10 mg.kg(-1)) regardless of location. Among the tested vegetables,
   Chinese cabbage (Brassica pekinensis Rupr) from Katowice consistently
   gave higher levels of all the analyzed elements (except zinc) than the
   same vegetable from Lublin, while the other specimens produced variable
   data. Red cabbage turned out to contain the highest levels of all
   contaminants compared to other vegetable species. Nitrate levels in all
   the Lublin samples were approximately equal, suggesting that: the
   extensive fertilization in the Lublin area produces a uniform background
   level of these anions. On the other hand, the Katowice samples exhibited
   quite variable and extreme levels of nitrates and nitrites.}},

Abstract = {{Cell-based testing is a key step in drug screening for cancer
   treatments. A microfluidic platform can permit more precise control of
   the cell culture microenvironment, such as gradients in soluble factors.
   These small-scale devices also permit tracking of low cell numbers. As a
   new screening paradigm, a microscale system for integrated cell culture
   and drug screening promises to provide a simple, scalable tool to apply
   standardized protocols used in cellular response assays. With the
   ability to dynamically control the microenvironment, we can create
   temporally varying drug profiles to mimic physiologically measured
   profiles. In addition, low levels of oxygen in cancerous tumors have
   been linked with drug resistance and decreased likelihood of successful
   treatment and patient survival. Our work also integrates a thin-film
   oxygen sensor with a microfluidic oxygen gradient generator which will
   in future allow us to create spatial oxygen gradients and study effects
   of hypoxia on cell response to drug treatment. In future, this
   technology promises to improve cell-based validation in the drug
   discovery process, decreasing the cost and increasing the speed in
   screening large numbers of compounds.}},

   positive phase velocity and another sustaining a negative-index mode
   with a negative phase velocity. The former has a wavelength that
   decreases as a function of frequency, while the latter has a wavelength
   that increases as a function of frequency. Because frequency-dependent
   wavelength increases in one waveguide component of the resonator are
   compensated by wavelength decreases in the other component, the
   resonator can potentially support a continuum of standing wave patterns
   that all satisfy the same resonance condition, effectively widening the
   frequency range over which resonance is achievable. We have tailored the
   geometry of the resonator so that the net phase accrued within the
   resonator is nearly constant over a large portion of the visible
   frequency range, and, as shown through FDTD simulations and analytical
   calculations, a broadband optical resonance is achieved.}},

Abstract = {{The solubility parameter (delta) plays a unique role in the development
   of stable pharmaceutical formulations for assessing phase segregation
   during product synthesis. Understanding this parameter helps to
   determine how a drug substance will behave when processed or when dosed
   in vivo. The aim of this work was to develop a novel comprehensive yet
   rapid and accurate Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR)
   method based on the rank-based ant system feature selection. The method
   was coupled with the multiple linear regression and support vector
   regression and applied to the assessment of solubility parameters for a
   diverse dataset of 1804 chemical compounds. The models were validated by
   solubility prediction of 360 test set compounds which were not used in
   building models. The developed models have high prediction power
   characterized by r(2) values 0.75 and 0.82, and RMSE values 1.96 and
   1.65 (J/(cm(3)))(0.5) for the external test set. Various validation
   techniques and comparison results with the novel optimized support
   vector regression indicate that the developed models can be used to
   determine the solubility parameters for a diverse set of chemicals with
   an acceptable accuracy. The developed models can be beneficial for
   designing new chemical materials with desired solubility parameter
   values.}},

Abstract = {{Performance-based earthquake engineering aims to describe the seismic
   performance of structures using metrics that are of immediate use to
   both engineers and stakeholders. A rigorous yet practical implementation
   of performance-based earthquake engineering methodology is presented.
   The methodology consistently accounts for the uncertainties in the
   hazards exposed by the structure, structural response and structural
   damage to quantify the performance of the entire system. A prototype
   office building designed according to the National Building Code of
   Canada was used to compare the seismic performance of three
   pre-qualified steel seismic force resisting systems. Both the material
   use and expected repair cost at different levels earthquake shaking
   intensities are presented in this paper. The outlined example
   demonstrates a clear and transparent procedure to compare the
   performance of different seismic force resisting systems and allows
   stakeholders to make an informed risk-based decision to select the best
   structural system.}},

Title = {{Mapping Spaces of Environmental Dispute: GIS, Mining, and Surveillance
   in the Amazon}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{320-349}},
Abstract = {{Recent scholarship has urged increased attention to how advances in
   geographical information systems (GIS) technology can more equitably
   help to bridge gaps between the theory and practice of environmental
   protection and dispute resolution. This study brings new evidence to
   burgeoning debates in the Amazon, examining how a United Nations (UN)
   development initiative developed mapping systems in a shifting political
   climate for environmental governance while conducting campaigns with
   peasant miners to address environmental management. Amendments made in
   2002 to the Brazilian Forest Code established natural preserves
   according to the geographic features of watersheds. The laws deter
   commercial land use on preserves, imposing strict penalties where
   artisanal mining is widely prevalent as a livelihood. The UN program
   utilized GIS and Shuttle Radar imagery to map the contested areas
   according to legal definitions and engaged stakeholders to discuss
   political implications. In 2006, new reforms made such mapping tools
   even more controversial-and urgent-with amendments that created
   opportunities for bringing ``informal{''} mining into the legal sphere,
   theoretically allowing ``spaces of exception{''} where mining can be
   legitimated. Our multimethod study underscores the need for appreciating
   diverse understandings of ecologically sensitive zones and empowering
   rural communities to take ownership over geospatial technologies in
   addressing environmental challenges. Although maps produced using the
   proposed methods could be useful, dominant advocacies that champion GIS
   as an enforcement tool often undermine local trust, inflame tensions,
   and render alternative ``grassrootsGIS{''} strategies impracticable. We
   examine the contexts, powers, limitations, and risks of the UN's
   technical intervention, exploring how competing views of environmental
   controversy lead to divergent perspectives on the politics of GIS
   ``knowledge translation{''} and mapping itself.}},
