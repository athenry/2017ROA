Abstract = {{We report on a miniature fiber-optic multiphoton microscopy (MPM) system
   based on a frequency-doubled femtosecond Er-doped fiber laser. The
   femtosecond pulses from the laser source are delivered to the miniature
   fiber-optic probe at 1.58 mu m wavelength, where a standard single mode
   fiber is used for delivery without the need of free-space dispersion
   compensation components. The beam is frequency-doubled inside the probe
   by a periodically poled MgO: LiNbO3 crystal. Frequency-doubled pulses at
   786 nm with a maximum power of 80 mW and a pulsewidth of 150 fs are
   obtained and applied to excite intrinsic signals from tissues. A MEMS
   scanner, a miniature objective, and a multimode collection fiber are
   further used to make the probe compact. The miniature fiber-optic MPM
   system is highly portable and robust. Ex vivo multiphoton imaging of
   mammalian skins demonstrates the capability of the system in imaging
   biological tissues. The results show that the miniature fiber-optic MPM
   system using frequency-doubled femtosecond fiber laser can potentially
   bring the MPM imaging for clinical applications. (C) 2016 Optical

Abstract = {{The biochemical and physical characteristics of composting processes
   have been historically modeled from an analytic point of view. Recently,
   stochastic approaches pushed forward the short-term forecast for the
   observed behaviour, but no model deals well with long-term predictions,
   especially when dealing with industrial data. We present a new approach,
   based on Markov processes, that shows good accuracy when predicting the
   long-term evolution of composting processes on an industrial scale. The
   proposed model deals with incomplete industrial data even for unevenly
   spaced observations, learns from past observations improving accuracy as
   data grows, and shows excellent predictive capabilities for time spans
   larger than 200 days and for heterogeneous large scale compost windrows.
   With our model, predictions can be obtained in real-time using
   Monte-Carlo runs. The model may be extremely convenient for industrial
   environments where large amounts of incomplete available data make it
   very difficult to use other prediction approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Vibration serviceability of timber floors is becoming increasingly
   relevant due to their increased long-span applications in pure timber
   and hybrid structures. As a serviceability limit state, the check of
   acceptable floor vibrations is part of some current timber design
   standards. However, a universal agreement on acceptance levels and
   design procedures has not been achieved. This paper gives an overview of
   traditional and recent design approaches for floor vibrations, with
   those approaches intended to allow engineers to implement design
   strategies that produce floors that perform acceptably under service
   conditions. The subsequent discussion does not catalogue all relevant
   technical literature, information in design manuals and aids, nor list
   all relevant design code rules related to vibration serviceability of
   timber floors. Instead what is written is intended to convey and
   critique the state of background knowledge, design recommendation and
   code rules using illustrative examples from the literature. The
   objective is to contribute to resolution of debate about control of
   floor response characteristics by engineering design methods.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The performance and efficiency of any structure depend on the
   connections that join their components; as such they constitute the most
   critical component. This is also true for timber structures, where
   joining of components is mostly achieved by means of mechanical
   interlocking, metal fasteners, adhesively bonding, or less common, a
   hybrid solution between two or more of these means. This paper gives an
   overview of hybrid jointing approaches: glued-in rods and plates, and a
   novel grouting technology with concrete-type adhesives, and hybrid
   carpentry type joints. The review of glued-in rods and plates
   illustrates that high stiffness and high ductility can be achieved using
   a combination of steel and adhesive. The grouted joints were
   investigated experimentally and numerically and the good agreement
   between them validated the design process and allows dimensioning. The
   carpentry type joints were combined with self-tapping screws, an
   adhesive layer between joist and beam, and a combination of both: the
   results demonstrated that all three types of creating a hybrid joint
   increased the joint stiffness. All these examples of best practise
   timber engineering show the potential that connections can be more
   efficient by improving established solutions through hybridization.}},

Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{The control of boost-derived converters presents a special challenge due
   to its non-minimum phase behavior, forcing a slow transient response
   when traditional linear techniques are employed. In order to improve the
   dynamic behavior, more complex controllers have been proposed (e.g.,
   adaptive, nonlinear, boundary, etc.), but the improvements introduced by
   each one of them cannot be objectively assessed in the absence of a
   theoretical performance limit standard reference. This work introduces a
   benchmarking tool based on the evaluation of the converters' performance
   under start-up, load current, and input voltage step-up/step-down
   transients. Six performance indices are defined using the theoretical
   performance limits as reference. In this way, the converters' dynamic
   performance can be quantitatively assessed in six different aspects,
   enabling a thorough benchmarking procedure. The ideal parameters are
   found by exploring the performance limits of boost converters, providing
   valuable insight into the behavior of the topology. These reference
   parameters are found in a normalized domain and characterized by
   closed-form expressions, providing simple, intuitive, and general
   results valid for any combination of LC parameters and voltage levels.
   The characterization of the dynamic performance limits is validated by
   experimental results. The proposed benchmarking procedure is illustrated
   by evaluating the dynamic performance of two different dc-dc boost
   converters.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel segmentation approach based on deep 3D convolutional
   encoder networks with shortcut connections and apply it to the
   segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in magnetic resonance
   images. Our model is a neural network that consists of two
   interconnected pathways, a convolutional pathway, which learns
   increasingly more abstract and higher-level image features, and a
   deconvolutional pathway, which predicts the final segmentation at the
   voxel level. The joint training of the feature extraction and prediction
   pathways allows for the automatic learning of features at different
   scales that are optimized for accuracy for any given combination of
   image types and segmentation task. In addition, shortcut connections
   between the two pathways allow high- and low-level features to be
   integrated, which enables the segmentation of lesions across a wide
   range of sizes. We have evaluated our method on two publicly available
   data sets (MICCAI 2008 and ISBI 2015 challenges) with the results
   showing that our method performs comparably to the top-ranked
   state-of-the-art methods, even when only relatively small data sets are
   available for training. In addition, we have compared our method with
   five freely available and widely used MS lesion segmentation methods
   (EMS, LST-LPA, LST-LGA, Lesion-TOADS, and SLS) on a large data set from
   an MS clinical trial. The results show that our method consistently
   outperforms these other methods across a wide range of lesion sizes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
   regression approach to address the two major limitations of existing
   intensity-based 2-D/3-D registration technology: 1) slow computation and
   2) small capture range. Different from optimization-based methods, which
   iteratively optimize the transformation parameters over a scalar-valued
   metric function representing the quality of the registration, the
   proposed method exploits the information embedded in the appearances of
   the digitally reconstructed radiograph and X-ray images, and employs CNN
   regressors to directly estimate the transformation parameters. An
   automatic feature extraction step is introduced to calculate 3-D
   pose-indexed features that are sensitive to the variables to be
   regressed while robust to other factors. The CNN regressors are then
   trained for local zones and applied in a hierarchical manner to break
   down the complex regression task into multiple simpler sub-tasks that
   can be learned separately. Weight sharing is furthermore employed in the
   CNN regression model to reduce the memory footprint. The proposed
   approach has been quantitatively evaluated on 3 potential clinical
   applications, demonstrating its significant advantage in providing
   highly accurate real-time 2-D/3-D registration with a significantly
   enlarged capture range when compared to intensity-based methods.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-Raman spectroscopy was employed to study the near-surface stress
   distributions and origins in Si around through silicon vias (TSVs) at
   both room temperature and elevated temperatures for Cu-filled and carbon
   nanotube (CNT)-filled TSV samples. From observations, we proved that the
   stresses near TSVs are mainly from two sources: (1) pre-existing stress
   before via filling, and (2) coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE)
   mismatch-induced stress. CTE-mismatch-induced stress is shown to
   dominate the compressive regime of the near-surface stress distribution
   around the two types of Cu-filled TSV structures in this work and in
   previous work, while pre-existing stress dominates the full range of the
   stress distribution in the CNT-filled TSV structures studied. These
   results show the importance of the pre-existing stress and support the
   use of a liner technology with lower stress introduction such as
   deposited oxide instead of thermal oxide. It is specifically important
   for CNT-filled TSVs, where the pre-existing stress is much larger than
   the CTE-mismatch-induced stress as observed in this work.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, we aim to jointly separate the underdetermined mixtures
   of latent sources from two datasets, where the number of sources exceeds
   the number of observations in each dataset. Currently available blind
   source separation (BSS) methods, including joint blind source separation
   (JBSS) and underdetermined blind source separation (UBSS), cannot
   address this underdetermined problem effectively. We exploit the
   second-order statistics of observations and introduce a novel BSS
   method, termed as underdetermined joint blind source separation (UJBSS).
   Considering the dependence information between two datasets, the problem
   of jointly estimating the mixing matrices is tackled via canonical
   polyadic (CP) decomposition of a specialized tensor in which a set of
   spatial covariance matrices are stacked. Furthermore, the estimated
   mixing matrices are used to recover the sources from each dataset
   separately. Numerical results demonstrate the competitive performance of
   the proposed method when compared to a commonly used JBSS method,
   multiset canonical correlation analysis (MCCA), and the single-set UBSS
   method, UBSS with free active sources (UBSS-FAS).}},

Abstract = {{The use of distributed generators (DGs) has increased in the past decade
   and projections indicate that penetration will further increase. In this
   scenario, with the improvements in power-electronics-based converters,
   the DG units have the potential to effectively resolve voltage/current
   control issues in low-voltage distribution systems. In this paper, a new
   probabilistic index is defined to measure the controllability of
   voltages and currents in the buses and lines of distribution systems.
   Using this index greatly facilitates the analysis and measurement of
   voltage/current controllability levels of distribution systems.
   Different types of DGs are allocated in the system to optimize the
   voltage/current controllability by using the defined index. The results
   are compared with those obtained through the conventional approach of DG
   allocation, which is based on the minimization of energy losses. A new
   combined index is defined to include both V-I controllability and energy
   losses. Several sensitivity studies are then performed to show the
   effect of the penetration level of different types of DGs on the
   proposed indices.}},

Abstract = {{In a residential area where many households have installed rooftop
   photovoltaic (PV) units, there is a reverse power flow from the
   households to the substation when the power generation from PV units is
   larger than the aggregate load of the households. This reverse power
   flow causes the voltage rise problem. In this paper, we study the use of
   demand side management to mitigate the voltage rise problem. We propose
   an autonomous energy consumption scheduling algorithm, which schedules
   the operation of deferrable loads to jointly shave the peak load and
   reduce the reverse power flow. The proposed algorithm shifts the
   operation of deferrable loads from peak consumption hours to hours with
   high-power generation from the PV units. We use stochastic programming
   to formulate an energy consumption scheduling problem, which takes into
   account the uncertainty related to the amount of power generation from
   PV units. The formulated cost function comprises a monetary cost for
   energy consumption, the revenue from energy export, and an external cost
   for the voltage rise. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm
   can mitigate the voltage rise problem in areas with high penetration of
   PV units and reduce the peak-to-average ratio of the aggregate load.}},

Title = {{Nonlinear rheology and pressure wave propagation in a thixotropic
   elasto-viscoplastic fluids, in the context of flow restart}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{231}},
Pages = {{11-25}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A new continuous nonlinear rheological model is established to quantify,
   correlate, and predict the thixotropic viscoelastic and visco-plastic
   properties of waxy crude oil gels. A complete rheological description of
   the gel is afforded by quantification of the maximum stress point (so
   called static yield stress) in conjunction with viscosity of the
   pristine gel and final slurry. Extraneous parameters are derived from
   the maximum stress condition. In order to develop an understanding of
   flow restart processes within gelled pipelines, direct numerical
   simulation of pressure propagation in weakly compressible thixotropic
   elasto-viscoplastic gel (Oldroyd-B fluid model) is performed using the
   rheological correlations. Deficiencies associated with conventional
   Bingham yield stress and conventional shear thinning methodologies are
   concomitantly revealed by the present elasto-viscoplastic model.
   Depending on parametric values, pressure may propagate and flow may
   commence for pipeline lengths larger than the critical length, L-c =
   Delta pR/2 tau(y), (where Lc is the flow restart length for a yielding
   gel without microstructure breakage, Delta p is the applied pressure, R
   is the pipe radius, and tau(y) is the yield stress). Prior to attaining
   the critical length, the nature of the pressure wave is shown to be
   either inertial or viscous, depending on the initial gel viscosity. Upon
   approaching the critical length, the nature of the pressure wave is
   governed by gel degradation, except at extreme compressibility values.
   At high compressibility, the nature of the pressure wave is controlled
   by gel degradation, even prior to reaching L-c, facilitating flow
   commencement in long pipes via a sequential breakage process. At very
   low compressibility, the pressure wave propagates until the force
   exerted by the fluid on the wall evenly balances the applied pressure.
   Hence, the pressure wave may propagate beyond the critical length but
   sustained flow does not commence. At intermediate compressibility
   values, if propagation of pressure to the critical length causes mean
   near-wall gel deformation on a similar magnitude as the static yield
   strain value (gamma = chi(Theta)Delta p(2)/2 tau(y) vs, where ye is the
   isothermal compressibility) then the pressure wave does not propagate
   substantially beyond L-c and flow does not restart in the pipeline. For
   intermediate compressibility when gamma > >gamma(s), then flow restarts
   via the high compressibility mechanism (e.g. low gel strength cases) and
   when gamma < <gamma(s) then the pressure wave propagates without flow
   restart (e.g. high gel strength cases), similar to the low
   compressibility regime. For validation of numerical results, a case with
   only a viscous term is compared with literature results. Furthermore,
   large scale flow loop experiments were performed to measure pressure
   propagation. Experimental results are consistent with the mechanism of
   pressure propagation and flow restart determined numerically. (C) 2016

   Metallic Pipes: Bayesian Belief Network Model}},

Abstract = {{Water mains are the essential component of a water supply system (WSS)
   buried underground, and they account for 80\% of total system
   expenditures. Deterioration of this asset, as a result of an aggressive
   soil environment, is inevitable over a pipe's service life. Although an
   increasing number of studies have estimated the remaining service life
   (RSL) of metallic pipes, most of them either are data intensive or
   consider limited soil and pipe parameters. In this paper, a Bayesian
   belief network (BBN) model is proposed to handle the problem of varying
   data availability and the dependency between parameters. First the
   proposed approach uses a combination of empirical data, experimental
   data, expert opinion, and a mathematical model to predict soil
   corrosivity and pit depth. Then a simple programming logic is used to
   predict RSL. Finally, the performance of the model is evaluated using a
   BBN sensitivity analysis. Monte Carlo simulations (MCSs) are performed
   using randomly generated input from measured statistical parameters
   (i.e., mean and standard deviation) to indicate the effect of input
   parameters on metallic pipe RSL and safety index (SI). (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel framework for parcellation of a brain
   region into functional subROls (Sub-Region-of-Interest) based on their
   connectivity patterns with other brain regions. By utilising previously
   established neuroanatomy information, the proposed method aims at
   finding spatially continuous, functionally consistent subROls in a given
   brain region. The proposed framework relies on (1) a sparse
   spatially-regularized fused lasso regression model for encouraging
   spatially and functionally adjacent voxels to share similar regression
   coefficients; (2) an iterative merging and adaptive parameter tuning
   process; (3) a Graph-Cut optimization algorithm for assigning overlapped
   voxels into separate subROls. Our simulation results demonstrate that
   the proposed method could reliably yield spatially continuous and
   functionally consistent subROls. We applied the method to resting-state
   fMRI data obtained from normal subjects and explored connectivity to the
   putamen. Two distinct functional subROls could be parcellated out in the
   putamen region in all subjects. This approach provides a way to extract
   functional subROls that can then be investigated for alterations in
   connectivity in diseases of the basal ganglia, for example in
   Parkinson's disease. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ultraviolet (UV) disinfection is an effective technology for the
   inactivation of pathogens in water and is of growing interest for
   industrial application. A new UV source ultraviolet light-emitting diode
   (UV-LED) has emerged in the past decade with a number of advantages
   compared to traditional UV mercury lamps. This promising alternative
   raises great interest in the research on application of UV-LEDs for
   water treatment. Studies on UV-LED water disinfection have increased
   during the past few years. This article presents a comprehensive review
   of recent studies on UV-LEDs with various wavelengths for the
   inactivation of different microorganisms. Many inconsistent and
   incomparable data were found from published studies, which underscores
   the importance of establishing a standard protocol for studying UV-LED
   inactivation of microorganisms. Different UV sensitivities to UV-LEDs
   and traditional UV lamps were observed in the literature for some
   microorganisms, which requires further investigation for a better
   understanding of microorganism response to UV-LEDs. The unique aspects
   of UV-LEDs improve inactivation effectiveness by applying LED special
   features, such as multiple wavelengths and pulsed illumination; however,
   more studies are needed to investigate the influencing factors and
   mechanisms. The special features of UV-LEDs offer the flexibility of
   novel reactor designs for a broad application of UV LED reactors. (C)

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Relay communications have attracted increasing research attentions as a
   cost-effective technique to improve spatial diversity, service coverage,
   and energy efficiency in wireless networks. However, existing relay
   schemes (e.g., amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward (DF) schemes)
   still face several major challenges, particularly the accumulation of
   multipath channels effect in AF and long processing latency in DF. To
   address these issues, we propose a novel equalize-and-forward (EF) relay
   scheme to enhance the retransmission reliability while maintaining low
   processing delay at the relay node. In particular, the proposed EF relay
   estimates and equalizes the channel between source and relay to
   eliminate the channel accumulation effect without signal regeneration.
   To further reduce the relay processing time, the channel estimation and
   equalization in the proposed EF design are performed in parallel. The
   proposed equalization is realized by presetting the equalizer
   coefficients with the current channel response that is predicted in
   parallel using multiple past channel responses. Numerical results show
   that the proposed EF relay scheme can achieve comparable symbol error
   rate performance as the DF relay with much less relay latency. In
   addition, the EF relay exhibits low outage probability at the same data
   rate as compared with traditional amplify-and-forward and DF schemes.

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Most large-eddy simulation studies related to wind energy have been
   carried out either by using a fixed pressure gradient to ensure that
   mean wind direction is perpendicular to the wind turbine rotor disk or
   by forcing the flow with a geostrophic wind and timely readjusting the
   turbines' orientation. This has not allowed for the study of wind farm
   characteristics with a time-varying wind vector. In this paper, a new
   time-adaptive wind turbine model for the large-eddy simulation framework
   is introduced. The new algorithm enables the wind turbines to
   dynamically realign with the incoming wind vector and self-adjust the
   yaw orientation with the incoming wind vector similar to real wind
   turbines. The performance of the new model is tested first with a
   neutrally stratified atmospheric flow forced with a time-varying
   geostrophic wind vector. A posteriori, the new model is used to further
   explore the interaction between a synthetic time-changing thermal
   atmospheric boundary layer and an embedded wind farm. Results show that
   there is significant potential power to be harvested during the unstable
   time periods at the cost of designing wind turbines capable of adapting
   to the enhanced variance of these periods. Stable periods provide less
   power but are more constant over time with an enhanced lateral shear
   induced by an increased change in wind direction with height. Copyright

Pages = {{45-53}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The recovery of manganese metal from manganese carbonate precipitate by
   leaching-purification-electrowinning was studied. The manganese
   carbonate precipitate from Baja Mining Corp.'s El Boleo project was
   readily leached into acidic ammonium sulfate solution. The manganese
   extraction reached 99.7\%. The manganese leachate was purified using
   ammonium sulfide to remove harmful impurities (Ni, Co, Cd, Cu and etc.).
   Manganese electrowinning was conducted in a diaphragm cell designed to
   eliminate edge effects and improve manganese deposition. The addition of
   polyacrylamide polymer had a significant leveling effect on manganese
   electrodeposition. However it increased the deposit internal stress and
   even resulted in cracking of manganese deposits at a high dosage. With
   increasing polyacrylamide polymer concentration, current density, and
   pH, the manganese current efficiency first increased, reached a maximum
   value and finally decreased. The manganese current efficiency decreased
   with increasing deposition time as the deposit became rougher and the
   real current density deviated from its ideal value. A reasonable
   catholyte circulation rate is important to maintain the optimum
   manganese electrodeposition. The presence of chloride in solution has a
   little effect on manganese deposition in its concentration range from 0
   to 2 g/L The diaphragm selection as an important part of the cell design
   was analyzed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the unified modeling of mechanics and dynamics of
   metal cutting operations such as turning, boring, drilling and milling.
   The distribution of chip thickness along the cutting edges of tools are
   evaluated using the generalized geometric and kinematic model of the
   operations {[}1]. The effect of relative vibrations between the cutting
   edge and workpiece segments are considered. The force contributed by
   each oblique cutting edge segment is evaluated from shear stress, shear
   angle and friction coefficient defined in orthogonal cutting data base.
   The tool cutting loads are evaluated by summing the differential cutting
   forces along all engaged cutting edges using the generalized geometric
   transformations presented in {[}1]. The chatter stability is solved in
   modal coordinate system, and the forced vibration marks left on the
   finish surface are predicted in discrete time domain. The process
   damping, multiple regenerative phase delays which depend on the tool
   geometry and operations are considered. The application of the proposed
   unified mechanics and dynamics model is demonstrated experimentally in
   drilling, milling with indexable cutters and various end mills, and in
   opening large holes with multifunctional drilling/boring heads. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper presents a generalized geometric model of cutting tools for
   the purpose of predicting the mechanics and dynamics of machining
   operations. The model starts by defining the tangent and rake face
   vectors at discrete elements along the cutting edge. The discrete
   cutting edge elements are assembled mathematically to form either an
   insert or solid cutting edge, which are further transformed to design
   turning, boring, drilling, milling and other tools by considering the
   geometry and kinematics of cutting operations. Homogeneous
   transformation matrices are used to successively locate and orient the
   cutting edge within the insert, tool and process coordinate frames.
   Industry-standard tool-in-use planes are used to obtain the effective
   geometry for all cutting operations. In total 15 geometric parameters
   are used for identifying the geometry of an arbitrary tool. Radial and
   axial runouts are considered in the model. Generalized model is
   demonstrated by modelling the geometry of sample drills, indexable and
   serrated milling tools. The generalized model allows unified prediction
   of machining operations with one mathematical model which covers all
   operations and tool geometries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Nacre, a natural armor, exhibits prominent penetration resistance

   mechanisms and damage-tolerance design strategies may provide
   significant inspiration for the pursuit of high-performance artificial
   armors. In this work, relationships between the structure and mechanical
   performance of nacre were investigated. The results show that other than
   their brick-and-mortar structure, individual nacre tablets significantly
   contribute to the damage localization of nacre. Affected by
   intracrystalline organics, the tablets exhibit a unique fracture
   behavior. The synergistic action of the nanoscale deformation mechanisms
   increases the energy dissipation efficiency of the tablets and
   contributes to the preservation of the structural and functional
   integrity of the shell. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the
   migration of curved and planar boundaries. The reduced mobilities of
   capillarity driven U-shaped half-loop twin boundaries in b.c.c iron (Fe)
   were computed between 800 and 1200 K. To rationalize these results,
   simulations were also performed for planar twin boundaries of different
   inclination to determine their absolute mobilities and grain boundary
   energies. The variation of these properties with inclination was
   integrated into a continuum model which was found to produce the
   steady-state shapes of curved boundaries consistent with those from
   simulations. A further extension of the continuum model enabled
   estimations of the reduced mobility that were in good agreement with
   simulation results. It was also identified that atomistic events
   governing the migration of curved and planar boundaries shared a number
   of similarities. Overall, the analyses of the shapes, mobilities and
   atomic-scale migration mechanisms of curved and planar boundaries
   presented here provide a correlation between the migration of these
   types of twin boundaries. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the size effect on the flexural performance of
   ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC), numbers of UHPC beams with three
   different sizes, including two with smooth steel fibers with aspect
   ratios of 65 and 100 and one with twisted steel fibers with an aspect
   ratio of 100, were fabricated and tested. The beams made of UHPC matrix
   without fiber were also considered for evaluating the effect of fibers
   on the size effect. In addition, image analyses at crack surfaces were
   performed to investigate the size effect on the fiber distribution
   characteristics and their implication on the size dependent flexural
   performance. Test results indicated that the flexural performance of
   UHPC noticeably decreased with an increase in the specimen size, caused
   by a decrease in the number of fibers and poor fiber orientation. The
   use of longer steel fibers with a higher aspect ratio was effective in
   reducing the sensitivity to the size effect of UHPC beams compared with
   shorter steel fibers. Finally, by applying similar fiber distribution
   characteristics for all test specimens of different sizes, an
   insignificant size effect on the flexural strength was obtained for UHPC
   with 2\% by volume of steel fibers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The challenge of penetrating obstacles along with impact from weak
   multipath effects makes 60GHz signal very difficult to be transmitted in
   non-line of sight (NLOS) channel. So 60GHz system is vulnerable to
   obstructions and thus likely results in link interruption. While the
   application of cooperative technology to solve link blockage problem in
   60GHz system should consider the characteristic of directional
   transmission for 60GHz signal. Therefore in this paper a system is
   proposed to solve the link blockage problem in 60GHz NLOS communication
   environment based on the concept of cooperation and also the beamforming
   technology, which is the basis of directional transmission for 60GHz
   communication system. The process of anti-blockage solution with
   cooperative communication is presented in detail, and the fast switching
   and recovery schemes are well designed. The theoretical values of symbol
   error rate (SER) using decode and forward (DF) cooperation and amplify
   and forward (AF) cooperation are presented respectively when the common
   channel interference exists. Simulation results demonstrate that the
   performance based on DF cooperation is better than the performance based
   on AF cooperation when directional transmission is used.}},

Abstract = {{As part of tissue elasticity imaging or elastography, an inverse problem
   needs to be solved to find the elasticity distribution from the measured
   displacements. The finite element method (FEM) is a common method for
   solving the inverse problem in dynamic elastography. This problem has
   been solved with both direct and iterative FEM schemes. Each of these
   methods has its own advantages and disadvantages which are examined in
   this paper. Choosing the data resolution and the excitation frequency
   are critical for achieving the best estimation of the tissue elasticity
   in FEM methods. In this paper we investigate the performance of both
   direct and iterative FEMs for different ranges of excitation frequency.
   A new form of iterative method is suggested here which requires a lower
   mesh density compared to the original form. Also two forms of the direct
   method are compared in this paper: one using the exact fit for
   derivatives calculation and the other using the least squares fit. We
   also perform a study on the spatial resolution of these methods using
   simulations. The comparison is also validated using a phantom
   experiment. The results suggest that the direct method with least
   squares fit is more robust to noise compared to other methods but has
   slightly lower resolution results. For example, for the homogenous
   region with 20 dB noise added to the data, the RMS error for the direct
   method with least squares fit is approximately half of the iterative
   method. It was observed that the ratio of voxel size to the wavelength
   should be within a specific range for the results to be reliable. For
   example for the direct method with least squares fit, for the case of 20
   dB noise level, this ratio should be between 0.1 to 0.2. On balance,
   considering the much higher computational cost of the iterative method,
   the dependency of the iterative method on the initial guess, and the
   greater robustness of the direct method to noise, we suggest using the
   direct method with least squares fit for linear elasticity cases.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional gas-solid flow in a dual-column slot-rectangular
   spouted bed (DSRSB) with a suspended partition was studied
   experimentally and numerically. Predictions from the coupled
   computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM) were
   compared with experimental measurements based on pressure transducers
   and an optical fibre probe. The suspended partition position had little
   effect on particle velocity and voidage under stable spouting
   conditions. The predicted total pressure drops were in reasonable
   agreement with experimental values. For steady spouting, particle
   velocity and bed voidage were strongly influenced by static bed height.
   Solids exchange between the two chambers was modelled. The solids
   exchange rate decreased slightly with time as predicted by the DEM
   model. Raising the suspended partition facilitated solids exchange
   between the chambers. Measured profiles of pressure, voidage and
   particle velocity were in good agreement with simulation predictions,
   demonstrating the capability of the numerical model for predicting such
   flows. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) offer tremendous potential for the
   detection and characterization of cancer. A key challenge for their
   isolation and subsequent analysis is the extreme rarity of these cells
   in circulation. Here, a novel label-free method is described to enrich
   viable CTCs directly from whole blood based on their distinct
   deformability relative to hematological cells. This mechanism leverages
   the deformation of single cells through tapered micrometer scale
   constrictions using oscillatory flow in order to generate a ratcheting
   effect that produces distinct flow paths for CTCs, leukocytes, and
   erythrocytes. A label-free separation of circulating tumor cells from
   whole blood is demonstrated, where target cells can be separated from
   background cells based on deformability despite their nearly identical
   size. In doping experiments, this microfluidic device is able to capture
   >90\% of cancer cells from unprocessed whole blood to achieve 10(4)-fold
   enrichment of target cells relative to leukocytes. In patients with
   metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, where CTCs are not
   significantly larger than leukocytes, CTCs can be captured based on
   deformability at 25x greater yield than with the conventional CellSearch
   system. Finally, the CTCs separated using this approach are collected in
   suspension and are available for downstream molecular characterization.}},

Abstract = {{Since the publication of the 2nd edition of White and Panjabi's
   textbook, Clinical Biomechanics of the Spine in 1990, there has been
   considerable research on the biomechanics of the spine. The focus of
   this manuscript will be to review what we have learned in regards to the
   fundamentals of spine biomechanics. Topics addressed include the whole
   spine, the functional spinal unit, and the individual components of the
   spine (e.g. vertebra, intervertebral disc, spinal ligaments). In these
   broad categories, our understanding in 1990 is reviewed and the
   important knowledge or understanding gained through the subsequent 25
   years of research is highlighted. Areas where our knowledge is lacking
   helps to identify promising topics for future research. In this
   manuscript, as in the White and Panjabi textbook, the emphasis is on
   experimental research using human material, either in vivo or in vitro.
   The insights gained from mathematical models and animal experimentation
   are included where other data are not available. This review is intended
   to celebrate the substantial gains that have been made in the field over
   these past 25 years and also to identify future research directions. (C)

Abstract = {{Disinfection with chlorine is a common practice to ensure secured
   drinking water, but results in potentially harmful disinfection
   by-products (DBPs), when excess chlorination is done. The US
   Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) has established Stage 1 and
   Stage 2 disinfection by-product Rules (DBP rules) to control DBP
   exposure. A modified version of the Canadian Council of Ministries of
   the Environment water quality index (CCME WQI) is used to assess water
   quality. CCME WQI is a globally accepted index to assess water quality,
   but is too generic to be used for DBP rules. The study developed a
   scheme to make the index suitable for DBP rules. A scoring method based
   on an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is applied to assign weights
   based on DBP rules. A previously modified CCME WQI (Islam et al., 2014)
   is adapted along with the weights to perform the assessment at the
   distribution network (DN). A case study was performed on 7 sampling
   stations in a Quebec City DN. The spatial water quality variations are
   presented using kriging - a geostatistical method, which identifies the
   regions with relatively poor water quality and highlights the potential
   locations for re-chlorination points. The proposed assessment
   formulation is flexible to handle situations with limited data, which
   makes it especially suited to smaller municipalities.}},

Abstract = {{With advances in sensor and actuator design, intelligent computing
   techniques and personal care robotics, today's robots hold promise as
   fully interactive, therapeutic human companions. To achieve this
   ambitious goal, key interaction components must be identified and then
   systematically designed and evaluated. Based on successes of
   human-animal therapy, we propose affective touch as one such component.
   Delivering this adjunct in a controllable robot form allows us to
   examine its efficacy for therapeutic applications such as anxiety
   management. With an approach grounded in social cognitive theories for
   human-animal relations, we deployed a social robot, the Haptic Creature,
   in an interaction designed to be calming: participants held the robot on
   their laps and stroked it as it was breathing. As a result, their heart
   and respiration rates significantly decreased relative to stroking a
   non-breathing robot. They also reported themselves as calmer and
   happier.}},

Abstract = {{Nanomaterials such as nanowires, carbon nanotubes, and nanoparticles
   have already led to breakthroughs in the field of biological and medical
   sensors. The quantum size effects of the nanomaterials and their
   similarity in size to natural and synthetic nanomaterials are
   anticipated to improve sensor sensitivity dramatically. Nanowires are
   considered as key nanomaterials because of their electrical
   controllability for accurate measurement, and chemical-friendly surface
   for various sensing applications. This review covers the working
   principles and fabrication of silicon nanowire sensors. Furthermore, we
   review their applications for the detection of viruses, biomarkers, and
   DNA, as well as for drug discovery. Advances in the performance and
   functionality of nanowire sensors are also surveyed to highlight recent
   progress in this area. These advances include the improvements in
   reusability, sensitivity in high ionic strength solvent, long-term
   stability, and self-powering. Overall, with the advantages of

   Moreover, the time gap had a higher impact on the probability of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objective. The brain characteristics of different people are not the
   same. Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) should thus be customized for
   each individual person. In motor-imagery based synchronous BCIs, a
   number of parameters (referred to as hyper-parameters) including the EEG
   frequency bands, the channels and the time intervals from which the
   features are extracted should be predetermined based on each subject's
   brain characteristics. Approach. To determine the hyperparameter values,
   previous work has relied on manual or semi-automatic methods that are
   not applicable to high-dimensional search spaces. In this paper, we
   propose a fully automatic, scalable and computationally inexpensive
   algorithm that uses Bayesian optimization to tune these
   hyper-parameters. We then build different classifiers trained on the
   sets of hyper-parameter values proposed by the Bayesian optimization. A
   final classifier aggregates the results of the different classifiers.
   Main Results. We have applied our method to 21 subjects from three BCI
   competition datasets. We have conducted rigorous statistical tests, and
   have shown the positive impact of hyper-parameter optimization in
   improving the accuracy of BCIs. Furthermore, We have compared our
   results to those reported in the literature. Significance. Unlike the
   best reported results in the literature, which are based on more
   sophisticated feature extraction and classification methods, and rely on
   prestudies to determine the hyper-parameter values, our method has the
   advantage of being fully automated, uses less sophisticated feature
   extraction and classification methods, and yields similar or superior
   results compared to the best performing designs in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Stereoscopic video technologies have been introduced to the consumer
   market in the past few years. A key factor in designing a 3D system is
   to understand how different visual cues and distortions affect the
   perceptual quality of stereoscopic video. The ultimate way to assess 3D
   video quality is through subjective tests. However, subjective
   evaluation is time consuming, expensive, and in some cases not possible.
   The other solution is developing objective quality metrics, which
   attempt to model the Human Visual System (HVS) in order to assess
   perceptual quality. Although several 2D quality metrics have been
   proposed for still images and videos, in the case of 3D efforts are only
   at the initial stages. In this paper, we propose a new full-reference
   quality metric for 3D content. Our method mimics HVS by fusing
   information of both the left and right views to construct the cyclopean
   view, as well as taking to account the sensitivity of HVS to contrast
   and the disparity of the views. In addition, a temporal pooling strategy
   is utilized to address the effect of temporal variations of the quality
   in the video. Performance evaluations showed that our 3D quality metric
   quantifies quality degradation caused by several representative types of
   distortions very accurately, with Pearson correlation coefficient of
   90.8 \%, a competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art 3D
   quality metrics.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this study, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) analysis was used
   to measure and analyze the adsorption of off-gases and oxygen by wood
   pellets during storage. Such information on how these gases interact
   with the material helps in the understanding of the purging/stripping
   behavior of off-gases to develop effective ventilation strategies for
   wood pellets. Steam-exploded pellets showed the lowest carbon dioxide
   (CO2) uptake compared to the regular and torrefied pellets. The high CO2
   adsorption capacity of the torrefied pellets could be attributed to
   their porous structure and therefore greater available surface area.
   Quantifying the uptake of carbon monoxide by pellets was challenging due
   to chemical adsorption, which formed a strong bond between the material
   and carbon monoxide. The estimated energy of desorption for CO (97.8
   kJ/mol) was very high relative to that for CO2 (7.24 kJ/mol),
   demonstrating the mechanism of chemical adsorption and physical
   adsorption for CO and CO2, respectively. As for oxygen, the strong bonds

   be well approximated by a two-layer fluid with a diffuse interface. The
   growth and damping rates of sub-harmonic interfacial waves generated by
   a surface wave through a three-wave resonant interaction are measured in
   the laboratory. These measurements are compared with theoretical
   predictions. A diffuse interface reduces the damping rate and increases
   the growth rate. The predicted growth rate provides excellent comparison
   with the laboratory measurements. The inclusion of the effects of a
   diffuse interface significantly improve the comparison.}},

Abstract = {{The Minamata Convention is an agreement signed by 128 countries in 2013
   to reduce the global trade and production of mercury. However, only 20
   countries have ratified the agreement, excluding Canada. Up until now,
   Environment Canada has only proposed regulations to prohibit the import
   and manufacture of all mercury-containing products unless these products
   are specifically excluded or exempted from the regulations. In
   comparison, the United States ratified the Convention in November, 2013,
   which completely stopped its mercury exports. In 2011, almost 100\% of
   all mercury imported into Canada came from the US, whereas in 2014,
   nearly 100\% was from Malaysia. In 2011, 118 tonnes or 95\% of total
   mercury exports from Canada was shipped to Cuba, while in 2014 it had
   increased to 175 tonnes or 98\% of the total. This situation raises
   certain questions: What does Cuba need metallic mercury for, when they
   do not have any artisanal gold mines? Are they re-exporting to other
   Latin American countries that do have artisanal gold mines? Why is
   Canada possibly operating as a middleman to export mercury, when it has
   already outlined the commitment to stop mercury trading? This issue
   should be part of the agenda of the new Liberal government in Ottawa, as
   the current situation clearly shows the need to swiftly ratify the
   Minamata Convention and begin implementing its recommendations, before
   evidence of mercury trading becomes an international embarrassment for
   Canada. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Compute-and-forward (C\&F) is a promising new approach to interference
   management, enjoying several advantages over other information-theoretic
   schemes. C\&F usually requires channel state information (CSI) at the
   receivers so that an ``optimal{''} scaling factor can be computed for
   the purposes of decoding. In this paper, a blind C\&F scheme-i.e., one
   not requiring CSI-is developed. Rather than attempting to compute the
   optimal scaling factor, this new scheme seeks one or more ``good{''}
   scalars, i.e., scalars that allow correct decoding despite possibly
   being suboptimal. The region of all such good scalars is characterized.
   To find a good scalar, a computationally efficient scheme is proposed
   which involves error-detection, a hierarchically organized list, as well
   as a use of the smoothing lemma from lattice theory. Simulation results
   show that our blind C\&F scheme achieves-for a class of nested lattice
   codes-the same throughput as its CSI-enabled counterpart at the expense
   of, approximately, a two-fold increase in computational complexity in
   the high-throughput region. Moreover, our blind C\&F scheme can be
   applied to multisource multirelay networks with a good
   performance/complexity tradeoff.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the resource-allocation problem for energy
   efficiency (EE)-spectral efficiency (SE) tradeoff. Unlike traditional
   research that uses the EE as an objective function and imposes
   constraints either on the SE or on the achievable rate, we propound a
   multiobjective optimization approach that can flexibly switch between
   the EE and SE functions or change the priority level of each function
   using a tradeoff parameter. Our dynamic approach is more tractable than
   the conventional approaches and more convenient to realistic
   communication applications and scenarios. We prove that the
   multiobjective optimization of the EE and SE is equivalent to a simple
   problem that maximizes the achievable rate/SE and minimizes the total
   power consumption. Then, we apply the generalized framework of the
   resource allocation for the EE-SE tradeoff to optimally allocate the
   subcarriers' power for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)
   with imperfect channel estimation. Finally, we use numerical results to
   discuss the choice of the tradeoff parameter and study the effect of the
   estimation error, transmission power budget, and channel-to-noise ratio
   on the multiobjective optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless personal area networks (WPANs) based on the IEEE 802.15.4
   standard have been increasingly applied in vehicular and
   transportation-related applications. The 6LoWPAN protocol is used in
   delivering Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) packets over WPANs using
   the mesh-under routing (MUR) or route-over routing (ROR) mechanisms.
   When delivering an IPv6 packet over a multihop route consisting of
   unreliable links in a WPAN, the probability that the packet is
   successfully delivered at the destination, i.e., the packet delivery
   ratio (PDR), via MUR or ROR can be very small. This paper proposes the
   Reliable IPv6 Packet Delivery Scheme (RIPDS), which overcomes the
   aforementioned problem and considerably improves the PDR. RIPDS achieves
   a high PDR by use of network coding to encode the fragments of an IPv6
   packet into multiple encoded packets, such that, regardless of the loss
   of some encoded packets, the original fragments and the original IPv6
   packet can be still recovered by the node that receives some other
   encoded packets. The PDR and end-to-end packet latency under RIPDS, MUR,
   the controlled MUR (CtrMUR), and ROR are derived. Simulation results
   show that the proposed RIPDS outperforms the existing routing schemes
   such as ROR, MUR, and the CtrMUR, both in PDR and packet latency.}},

Abstract = {{Resource allocation is an important factor in providing different
   varieties of services in next-generation broadband wireless systems. In
   this paper, we consider dynamic routing and subchannel allocation for
   providing quality of service (QoS) in the downlink of orthogonal
   frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) networks enhanced with
   buffering relays. Specifically, we consider satisfying the QoS
   requirements of both delay-sensitive users with the goal of meeting
   packet deadline constraints and delay-tolerant users who need guarantees
   on their average throughputs. We provide a framework for ``time-domain
   scheduling{''} and ``frequency-domain resource allocation,{''} and based
   on this, we propose novel channel-, queue-, and delay-aware policies for
   formulating and solving the joint routing and resource allocation
   problem. In particular, these policies take different approaches to
   decide on the set of users considered in the utility function, the delay
   budget division between the base station and relays, the routing path of
   delay-sensitive users' packets, and the computation of minimum rate
   requirements for serving their queues. We present an iterative algorithm
   to solve the resulting problems. Numerical results show significant
   improvements in throughput and delay performance of the proposed
   resource allocation mechanisms compared with existing algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study an uplink network configuration in a two-tier
   macro-femto heterogeneous system with hybrid access control. We consider
   a system where one macro base station (MBS) and a cluster of adjacent
   femto base stations (FBSs) together serve a number of mobile users. In
   this system, base stations and users make decisions in various network
   configuration processes with different optimization objectives. Such
   decision-making processesz are usually correlated, and an efficient
   mechanism is needed to coordinate the decision makers. In this paper, we
   propose a five-stage network configuration mechanism where access
   control, resource allocation, and power management are sequentially
   performed at the base stations and users, respectively. We show that
   this mechanism provides incentive for the FBSs to operate at the hybrid
   access mode. We model the configuration mechanism as a multistage
   decision-making process and formulate a multilevel optimization problem.
   We analyze the problem in a bottom-up manner and propose efficient
   algorithms to solve the optimization problem in each level sequentially.
   Simulation results show that the proposed network configuration
   mechanism achieves a higher system utility than configuration mechanisms
   with topology-based hybrid access or closed access.}},

Abstract = {{Several methods have been proposed for evaluating a person's insulin
   sensitivity from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the
   euglycemic insulin clamp technique. However, none are easy or
   inexpensive to implement since the plasma insulin concentration, a key
   variable for assessing the insulin sensitivity index (ISI), is required
   to be clinically measured at specific times. Therefore, the purpose of
   this study is to develop a new ISI that can be easily and accurately
   obtained by patients themselves without costly, time-consuming, and
   inconvenient testing methods. This study proposes a simple
   self-administered testing method, simulated on a computerized model of
   type II diabetic patients, for estimating the ISI. The test involves a
   75-g glucose ingestion and two injections of 10 mU/kg insulin. Blood
   glucose is measured 1 and 2 h later. The test was evaluated by using a
   previously developed diabetic-patient dynamic model. Fifteen sets of
   OGTT data from diabetic patients published in the literature were used
   for the model development. A simulation of the proposed
   self-administered test indicates that the proposed ISI correlates well
   with the ISI called M-value obtained from the gold standard but
   elaborate euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (r = 0.927, p = 0.0045). The
   proposed ISI is considered to be easy to perform, time-saving,
   inexpensive, and accurate enough for clinical assessments.}},

Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Successful long-term bioremediation of mining -influenced water using
   complex organic matter and naturally-occurring microorganisms in
   sub-surface flow constructed wetlands requires a balance between easily
   and more slowly degrading material. This can be achieved by combining
   different types of organic materials. To provide guidance on what
   mixture combinations to use, information is needed on how the ratio of
   labile to recalcitrant components affects the degradation rate and the
   types of microbial populations supported. To investigate this, different
   ratios of wood and hay were used in up -flow column bioreactors treating
   selenium-and sulphate-containing synthetic mine -influenced water. The
   degradation rates of crude fibre components appeared to be similar
   regardless of the relative amounts of wood and hay. However, the nature
   of the degradation products might have differed in that those produced
   in the hay-rich bioreactors were more biodegradable and supported high
   sulphate-reduction rates. Microorganisms in the sulphate-reducing and
   cellulose-degrading inocula persisted in the bioreactors indicating that
   bio-augmentation was effective. There was a shift in microbial community
   composition over time suggesting that different microbial groups were
   involved in decomposition of more recalcitrant material. When dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) was over-supplied, the relative abundance of
   sulphate-reducers was low even through high sulphate-reduction rates
   were achieved. As DOC diminished, sulphate-reducers become more
   prevalent and their relative abundance correlated with sulphate
   concentrations rather than sulphate -reduction rate.}},

Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{This study reveals a novel method to tailor the micro- and meso-porous
   structures of activated biochar by exploiting the interaction between
   pre-carbonization drying conditions and carbonization temperature in KOH
   activation. Biochar samples were mixed with concentrated KOH and then
   dried under air or nitrogen for various periods of time (0-280 h)
   followed by carbonization at 475, 675 or 875 degrees C. It is confirmed
   that by manipulating drying conditions and carbonization temperatures,
   the KOH activated biochar can have a predominantly microporous,
   mesoporous or a combined (micro/meso) porous structure. The surface
   area, micropore and mesopore volumes tailored between: 488-2670 m(2)
   g(-1), 0.04 -0.72 cm(3) g(-1), and 0.05-1.70 cm(3) g(-1), respectively.
   The mechanism of porosity development was investigated by FTIR analysis
   suggesting conversion of KOH to K2CO3 due to different drying conditions
   as a major role in tailoring the structure. The application of activated
   biochar with tailored porosity was investigated for Electric Double
   Layer adsorption of NaCl/NaOH to be employed in water treatment
   (capacitive deionization) or energy storage (supercapacitor) processes.
   The majorly microporous activated biochar (N-2-dried activated at 675
   degrees C) showed promising capacitances between 220 and 245 F g(-1).
   Addition of mesoporous structure resulted in capacitances between 182
   and 240 F g(-1) with significantly reduced electrode resistance and
   improved capacitive behavior as evidenced by Impedance Spectroscopy and
   Galvanostatic Charge/Discharge tests. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Wireless energy harvesting is regarded as a promising energy supply
   alternative for energy-constrained wireless networks. In this paper, a
   new wireless energy harvesting protocol is proposed for an underlay
   cognitive relay network with multiple primary user (PU) transceivers. In
   this protocol, the secondary nodes can harvest energy from the primary
   network (PN) while sharing the licensed spectrum of the PN. In order to
   assess the impact of different system parameters on the proposed
   network, we first derive an exact expression for the outage probability
   for the secondary network (SN) subject to three important power
   constraints: 1) the maximum transmit power at the secondary source (SS)
   and at the secondary relay (SR); 2) the peak interference power
   permitted at each PU receiver; and 3) the interference power from each
   PU transmitter to the SR and to the secondary destination (SD). To
   obtain practical design insights into the impact of different parameters
   on successful data transmission of the SN, we derive throughput
   expressions for both the delay-sensitive and the delay-tolerant
   transmission modes. We also derive asymptotic closed-form expressions
   for the outage probability and the delay-sensitive throughput and an
   asymptotic analytical expression for the delay-tolerant throughput as
   the number of PU transceivers goes to infinity. The results show that
   the outage probability improves when PU transmitters are located near SS
   and sufficiently far from SR and SD. Our results also show that when the
   number of PU transmitters is large, the detrimental effect of
   interference from PU transmitters outweighs the benefits of energy
   harvested from the PU transmitters.}},

Abstract = {{A multiple center milestone study of clinical vertebra segmentation is
   presented in this paper. Vertebra segmentation is a fundamental step for
   spinal image analysis and intervention. The first half of the study was
   conducted in the spine segmentation challenge in 2014 International
   Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention
   (MICCAI) Workshop on Computational Spine Imaging (CSI 2014). The
   objective was to evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art
   vertebra segmentation algorithms on computed tomography (CT) scans using
   ten training and five testing dataset, all healthy cases; the second
   half of the study was conducted after the challenge, where additional 5
   abnormal cases are used for testing to evaluate the performance under
   abnormal cases. Dice coefficients and absolute surface distances were
   used as evaluation metrics. Segmentation of each vertebra as a single
   geometric unit, as well as separate segmentation of vertebra
   substructures, was evaluated. Five teams participated in the comparative
   study. The top performers in the study achieved Dice coefficient of 0.93
   in the upper thoracic, 0.95 in the lower thoracic and 0.96 in the lumbar
   spine for healthy cases, and 0.88 in the upper thoracic, 0.89 in the
   lower thoracic and 0.92 in the lumbar spine for osteoporotic and
   fractured cases. The strengths and weaknesses of each method as well as
   future suggestion for improvement are discussed. This is the first
   multi-center comparative study for vertebra segmentation methods, which
   will provide an up-to-date performance milestone for the fast growing
   spinal image analysis and intervention. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This article describes a novel approach for the binary classification of
   two-wheeler road users in a dense mixed traffic intersection. The
   classification is a supervised procedure to differentiate between
   motorized and non-motorized (human-powered) bikes. Road users were first
   detected and tracked using object recognition methods. Classification
   features were then selected from the collected trajectories. The
   features include maximum speed, cadence frequency in addition to
   acceleration-based parameters. Experiments were conducted on a video
   data set from Shanghai, China, where cyclists as well as motorcycles
   tend to share the main road facilities. A sensitivity analysis was
   performed to assess the quality of the selected features in improving
   the accuracy of the classification. A performance analysis demonstrated
   the robustness of the proposed classification method with a correct
   classification rate of up to 93\%. This research contributes to the
   literature of automated data collection and can benefit the applications
   in many transportation-related fields such as shared space facility
   planning, simulation models for two-wheelers, and behavior analysis and
   road safety studies. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Zirconia (ZrO2) ceramics are being considered as a candidate material
   for thermal insulating barriers in pressure tubes used in the
   supercritical water (SCW) nuclear reactors. However, the literature
   suggests that zirconia may undergo a detrimental phase transformation
   which is accelerated in aqueous environments. In this research, 8 mol\%
   Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) ceramics with the addition of 5 and 10
   mol\% Nd2O3 were manufactured via spark plasma sintering (SPS) process
   and subsequently subjected to a SCW environment. The weight losses and
   microstructural evolutions of these materials during SCW exposure were
   studied. The results suggest that doping YSZ with Nd2O3 significantly
   decreased the degradation rate of the YSZ ceramic and improved its
   structural stability. X-ray diffraction studies revealed that after
   degradation testing, the Nd2O3 helped to retain the desirable cubic
   phase of YSZ matrix. In the case of pure YSZ ceramic, a phase change of
   the matrix toward the monoclinic lattice was observed and likely
   contributed to the ceramic's disintegration in SCW environment.}},

Abstract = {{A number of recent studies have identified and begun to quantify
   increased susceptibility of the infrastructure to climate change-induced
   carbonation of reinforced concrete. In this paper, the results of a
   study are presented which uses an updated empirical model to predict the

   thereafter, predict carbonation depths for a number of urban
   environments in the United States. Data from newer climate forecasts
   from the 5th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment report
   are used to generate predictions for carbonation depths in four U.S.
   cities of varying geographic and climatic conditions (Los Angeles,
   Houston, Chicago, New York City). Results confirm that carbonation
   depths will increase in the future because of climate change. The
   magnitude of the increase is dependent on the climate-change scenario
   considered and the geographic location of the city. Whether or not the
   increases will require building code changes to increase concrete cover
   or improve concrete quality will be dependent on actual construction
   practices for the city in question.}},

Abstract = {{A new solid solution system, Pb(Mg(1-x/2)Mn(x/2)W1/2)O-3, is formed by
   replacing Mg2+ with Mn2+ in the Pb(Mg1/2W1/2)O-3 complex perovskite. The

   It is observed that for such a chemical modification, the surface of the
   grain changes significantly. A stepped surface nanostructure appears in
   the Mn-substituted perovskite. Detailed surface morphology of the
   stepped patterns was revealed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), which
   determined that the interlayer step height varies from 2.3 to 8.3 nm.
   Analyse by XRD, SEM, EDX, and AFM suggest that the nature of the stepped

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{It is well understood that the early-age properties of cementitious
   materials influences its long-term performance. Cementitious materials
   experience high moisture loss at early age resulting in volumetric
   shrinkage. When this shrinkage is restrained, tensile stresses develop
   resulting in cracking of the material. This issue is more pronounced at
   early-age when the tensile strength of cementitious materials is not
   fully developed. There are many methods and models available to predict
   the drying shrinkage of concrete. However, the relationship between
   early age uniaxial tensile strength and restrained shrinkage cracking
   characteristics at early age is not well understood. Uniaxial tests were
   conducted on dog-bone specimens made using various fiber types including
   glass, cellulose and three types of synthetic fibers. Tensile
   characteristics including stress versus strain plots for all the
   specimens along with stress at peak, post crack strength at 2 mm
   deflection along with elongation at peak are calculated and presented in
   this paper. Plastic shrinkage cracking results obtained using an
   innovative test developed by the authors were correlated to these
   tensile strength results. Results indicate that post crack residual
   tensile strength at early-age is inversely proportional to the total
   crack area resulting from restrained shrinkage. The effectiveness of
   various fiber types is also discussed in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{A pilot-scale study was performed to evaluate a coagulant dose which had
   been optimized for biopolymer (i.e., foulant) removal on subsequent
   ultrafiltration (UF) fouling, as well as disinfection by-product (DBP)
   precursor removal. Polyaluminum chloride (PACl) dosages were selected
   based on a point of diminishing returns for biopolymer removal (0.5
   mg/L) and directly compared to that applied at full-scale (6 mg/L).
   Membrane fouling (reversible and irreversible) was measured as
   resistance increase over a 48 hour filtration period. DBP formation
   potential (total trihalomethanes (TTHMs), haloacetic acids (HAA(9)) and
   total adsorbable organic halides (AOX)) were measured in both raw and
   treated waters. Results of the study indicate that application of a PACl
   dose optimized for biopolymer reduction (0.5 mg/L) resulted in 65\% less
   irreversible UF fouling when compared to 6 mg/L. The addition of PACl
   prior to the membrane resulted in up to a 14\% reduction in DBP
   precursors relative to the UF membrane alone. A similar level of DBP
   precursor reduction was achieved for both 0.5 and 6 mg/L dosages. The
   results have implications for cost savings, which may be realized due to
   decreased chemical use, as well as increased membrane life associated
   with lower irreversible fouling rates.}},

Abstract = {{The spinal cord undergoes physical deformation during traumatic spinal
   cord injury (TSCI), which results in biological damage. This study
   demonstrates a novel approach, using magnetic resonance imaging and
   image registration techniques, to quantify the three-dimensional
   deformation of the cervical spinal cord in an in vivo rat model.
   Twenty-four male rats were subjected to one of two clinically relevant
   mechanisms of TSCI (i.e. contusion and dislocation) inside of a MR
   scanner using a novel apparatus, enabling imaging of the deformed spinal
   cords. The displacement fields demonstrated qualitative differences
   between injury mechanisms. Three-dimensional Lagrangian strain fields
   were calculated, and the results from the contusion injury mechanism
   were deemed most reliable. Strain field error was assessed using a Monte
   Carlo approach, which showed that simulated normal strain error
   experienced a bias, whereas shear strain error did not. In contusion
   injury, a large region of dorso-ventral compressive strain was observed
   under the impactor which extended into the ventral region of the spinal
   cord. High tensile lateral strains under the impactor and compressive
   lateral strains in the lateral white matter were also observed in
   contusion. The ability to directly observe and quantify in vivo spinal
   cord deformation informs our knowledge of the mechanics of TSCI.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The quest for sustainability in construction material usage has made the
   use of more renewable resources in the construction industry a
   necessity. Plant-based natural fibres are low cost renewable materials
   which can be found in abundant supply in many countries. This paper
   presents a summary of research progress on plant-based natural fibre
   reinforced cement-based composites. Fibre types, fibre characteristics
   and their effects on the properties of cement-based materials are
   reviewed. Factors affecting the fresh and hardened properties of
   cement-based composites reinforced with plant-based natural fibre are
   discussed. Measures to enhance the durability properties of cement-based
   composites containing plant-based natural fibres are appraised.

Abstract = {{The stability of a Cs-promoted Co-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst, prepared by

   cause of catalyst deactivation is shown to be due to carbonaceous
   deposits. The effect of adding H2O (0.047 and 0.094mol/mol (4.7 and 9.4
   mol\%)), NH3 (375-1500x10(-6)mol/mol (375-1500 ppmv)) and H2S (5x10(-6)

   reported. Both the catalyst activity and the alcohol product selectivity
   are reduced in the presence of feed gas impurities, with H2O addition
   significantly increasing selectivity to CO2 and coke deposition. The
   impact of NH3 is reversible, whereas catalyst deactivation is only
   partially reversible in the case of H2O. H2S completely and irreversibly

Abstract = {{Situation awareness (SA) is essential for the safe operation of systems
   involving human-automation interaction. In this paper, using the theory
   of functional observers, we model SA for the user interacting with a
   continuous-time linear time-invariant dynamical system. For systems
   under human control or shared control, we use the proposed model to
   determine the required information to be displayed in the user interface
   for achieving SA. The user interface provides the user with the ability
   to observe the continuous-time outputs of the system, as well as the
   ability to enter continuous-time control inputs. In some systems, due to
   inadequacy of the displayed information, the user may not be able to
   accomplish the desired task. To determine the required information to be
   displayed and the necessary states to be tracked, we propose a model of
   attaining SA for the users by modeling the user as a specific type of
   estimator (i. e., the extended delayed functional observer/predictor).
   We then evaluate what information is needed for such an estimator and
   how the desired functional of the states have to be expanded so that the
   user can precisely reconstruct and accurately predict the desired task.
   As an application example, we investigate the problem of controlling the
   depth of anesthesia during surgery and determine whether there exists a
   feasible combination of the expanded task and the displayed information
   that allows the anesthetist to precisely predict the depth of anesthesia
   of the patient.}},

Abstract = {{The human visual system (HVS) attempts to select salient areas to reduce
   cognitive processing efforts. Computational models of visual attention
   try to predict the most relevant and important areas of videos or images
   viewed by the human eye. Such models, in turn, can be applied to areas
   such as computer graphics, video coding, and quality assessment.
   Although several models have been proposed, only one of them is
   applicable to high dynamic range (HDR) image content, and no work has
   been done for HDR videos. Moreover, the main shortcoming of the existing
   models is that they cannot simulate the characteristics of HVS under the
   wide luminous range found in HDR content. This paper addresses these
   issues by presenting a computational approach to model the bottom-up
   visual saliency for HDR input by combining spatial and temporal visual
   features. An analysis of eye movement data affirms the effectiveness of
   the proposed model. Comparisons employing three well-known quantitative
   metrics show that the proposed model substantially improves predictions
   of visual attention for HDR content.}},

Abstract = {{Ubiquitous and traditional service-provider platforms and frameworks are
   non-flexible and standardized. But ubiquitous environments are dynamic
   and variable. New service-provider platforms should be capable of
   handling such changing conditions. Specifically, a flexible and reliable
   network framework that adapts to various service components is
   necessary. Towards achieving this goal, this paper proposes a
   network-based intelligent humanoid robot (NBIHR) consisting of
   intelligent software components. The framework of an NBIHR requires
   reliable and stable network connection with real-time response between
   software components. In the developed service platform, intelligent
   software components work on the resources that are distributed in the
   network, and the NBIHR uses the results from the resources. In this way,
   the NBIHR is able to provide high-quality and intelligent service to
   users. In this framework, TCP/IP-based interface and middleware CORBA
   (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) are designed to integrate
   software components into an NBIHR system. The performance of the
   developed system is studied to demonstrate its effectiveness.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Segmental unbounded posttensioned concrete bridge piers can resist large
   lateral drifts and eliminate residual deformation during an earthquake.
   The seismic behavior of posttensioned bridge piers depends on several
   factors, including concrete strength, posttensioning (PT) force, aspect
   ratio, and axial-load ratio. This study investigated the effects of
   these factors and their interactions on the seismic behavior of such
   piers, which are not adequately addressed in the existing literature.
   Here, finite-element models of unbounded posttensioned concrete piers
   were generated to perform a parametric study. These models were first
   validated with experimental results and then used to predict the seismic
   behavior of unbounded posttensioned concrete piers. At the initial
   stage, full factorial analysis was performed by considering the
   following three factors: PT level, PT ratio, and concrete strength. The
   results indicate that none of them in combination resulted negatively on
   pier yielding capacity and postelastic stiffness, as long as the
   axial-load ratio was within 20\%. After this preliminary study, a more
   comprehensive fractional factorial study, including seven factors, was
   performed. In the fractional factorial analysis, each of the factors was
   considered at two levels. The piers were analyzed under reverse cyclic
   loading. Based on the lateral load-displacement responses of the piers,
   regression analysis was performed to propose equations for calculating
   global yielding and stiffness of piers.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-adjustable articulators have often been used to simulate occlusal
   dynamics, but advances in intra-oral scanning and computer software now
   enable dynamics to be modelled mathematically. Computer simulation of
   occlusal dynamics requires accurate virtual casts, records to register
   them and methods to handle mesh collisions during movement. Here,
   physical casts in a semi-adjustable articulator were scanned with a
   conventional clinical intra-oral scanner. A coordinate measuring machine
   was used to index their positions in intercuspation, protrusion, right
   and left laterotrusion, and to model features of the articulator.
   Penetrations between the indexed meshes were identified and resolved
   using restitution forces, and the final registrations were verified by
   distance measurements between dental landmarks at multiple sites. These
   sites were confirmed as closely approximating via measure-ments made
   from homologous transilluminated vinylpolysiloxane interocclusal
   impressions in the mounted casts. Movements between the indexed
   positions were simulated with two models in a custom biomechanical
   software platform. In model DENTAL, 6 degree-of-freedom movements were
   made to minimise deviation from a straight line path and also shaped by
   dynamic mesh collisions detected and resolved mathematically. In model
   ARTIC, the paths were further constrained by surfaces matching the
   control settings of the articulator. Despite these differences, the
   lower mid-incisor point paths were very similar in both models. The
   study suggests that mathematical simulation utilising interocclusal
   bite' registrations can closely replicate the primary movements of casts
   mounted in a semi-adjustable articulator. Additional indexing positions
   and appropriate software could, in some situations, replace the need for
   mechanical semi-adjustable articulation and/or its virtual
   representation.}},

Title = {{Ductility Estimation for a Novel Timber-Steel Hybrid System}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In current force-based seismic design procedures, structures are allowed
   to behave inelastically during significant seismic events. For this
   reason, the applied design base shear of a structure is calculated by
   reducing the elastic strength demand by a ductility factor that
   represents the ability of a structure or structural system to deform
   inelastically beyond yielding. Whereas North American building codes
   provide ductility factors for traditional structural systems, including
   timber-based or steel-based systems, there are currently no design
   provisions available for novel hybrid structural systems. Thus research
   is required to define the force reduction factors, and specifically the
   ductility factor, Rd, to safely and efficiently design novel systems
   within the existing seismic design provisions. One such novel system is
   the so-called finding the forest through the trees (FFTT), proposed in
   2012, where mass-timber panels act as shear walls and are connected to
   each other and to perimeter frames through steel beams. The research
   reported in this paper presents nonlinear dynamic analyses to evaluate
   the suitability of Rd factors ranging from 1.5-6.0 to design Option 1 of
   the FFTT system, which is proposed for buildings up to 12 stories tall.
   Potential Rd factors are evaluated by limiting interstory drift as the
   main performance criterion in nonlinear time history analyses to an
   acceptable limit of 2.5\% drift with 90\% probability of nonexceedance.
   Based on the analyses presented in this paper, a ductility factor of 5.0
   is suggested for the considered layout of the novel timber-steel hybrid
   FFTT system. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The wavelet transform possesses multi-resolution property and high
   localization performance; hence, it can be optimized for speech
   recognition. In our previous work, we show that redundant wavelet filter
   bank parameters work better in speech recognition task, because they are
   much less shift sensitive than those of critically sampled discrete
   wavelet transform (DWT). In this paper, three types of wavelet
   representations are introduced, including features based on dual-tree
   complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT), perceptual dual-tree complex wavelet
   transform, and four-channel double-density discrete wavelet transform
   (FCDDDWT). Then, appropriate filter values for DT-CWT and FCDDDWT are
   proposed. The performances of the proposed wavelet representations are
   compared in a phoneme recognition task using special form of the
   time-delay neural networks. Performance evaluations confirm that
   dual-tree complex wavelet filter banks outperform conventional DWT in
   speech recognition systems. The proposed perceptual dual-tree complex
   wavelet filter bank results in up to approximately 9.82 \% recognition
   rate increase, compared to the critically sampled two-channel wavelet
   filter bank.}},

Title = {{An Ethnographic Observational Study to Evaluate and Optimize the Use of
   Respiratory Acoustic Monitoring in Children Receiving Postoperative
   Opioid Infusions}},
Journal = {{ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{122}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:
   Respiratory depression in children receiving postoperative opioid
   infusions is a significant risk because of the interindividual
   variability in analgesic requirement. Detection of respiratory
   depression (or apnea) in these children may be improved with the
   introduction of automated acoustic respiratory rate (RR) monitoring.
   However, early detection of adverse events must be balanced with the
   risk of alarm fatigue. Our objective was to evaluate the use of acoustic
   RR monitoring in children receiving opioid infusions on a postsurgical
   ward and identify the causes of false alarm and optimal alarm
   thresholds.
   METHODS:
   A video ethnographic study was performed using an observational, mixed
   methods approach. After surgery, an acoustic RR sensor was placed on the
   participant's neck and attached to a Rad87 monitor. The monitor was
   networked with paging for alarms. Vital signs data and paging
   notification logs were obtained from the central monitoring system.
   Webcam videos of the participant, infusion pump, and Rad87 monitor were
   recorded, stored on a secure server, and subsequently analyzed by 2
   research nurses to identify the cause of the alarm, response, and
   effectiveness. Alarms occurring within a 90-second window were grouped
   into a single-alarm response opportunity.
   RESULTS:
   Data from 49 patients (30 females) with median age 14 (range, 4.4-18.8)
   years were analyzed. The 896 bedside vital sign threshold alarms
   resulted in 160 alarm response opportunities (44 low RR, 74 high RR, and
   42 low Spo(2)). In 141 periods (88\% of total), for which video was
   available, 65\% of alarms were deemed effective (followed by an
   alarm-related action within 10 minutes). Nurses were the sole responders
   in 55\% of effective alarms and the patient or parent in 20\%. Episodes
   of desaturation (Spo(2) < 90\%) were observed in 9 patients: At the time
   of the Spo(2) paging trigger, the RR was > 10 bpm in 6 of 9 patients.
   Based on all RR samples observed, the default alarm thresholds, to serve
   as a starting point for each patient, would be a low RR of 6 (> 10 years
   of age) and 10 (4-9 years of age).
   CONCLUSIONS:
   In this study, the use of RR monitoring did not improve the detection of
   respiratory depression. An RR threshold, which would have been
   predictive of desaturations, would have resulted in an unacceptably high
   false alarm rate. Future research using a combination of variables
   (e.g., Spo(2) and RR), or the measurement of tidal volumes, may be
   needed to improve patient safety in the postoperative ward.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a model that addresses sentence embedding, a hot
   topic in current natural language processing research, using recurrent
   neural networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. The
   proposed LSTM-RNN model sequentially takes each word in a sentence,
   extracts its information, and embeds it into a semantic vector. Due to
   its ability to capture long term memory, the LSTM-RNN accumulates
   increasingly richer information as it goes through the sentence, and
   when it reaches the last word, the hidden layer of the network provides
   a semantic representation of the whole sentence. In this paper, the
   LSTM-RNN is trained in a weakly supervised manner on user click-through
   data logged by a commercial web search engine. Visualization and
   analysis are performed to understand how the embedding process works.
   The model is found to automatically attenuate the unimportant words and
   detect the salient keywords in the sentence. Furthermore, these detected
   keywords are found to automatically activate different cells of the
   LSTM-RNN, where words belonging to a similar topic activate the same
   cell. As a semantic representation of the sentence, the embedding vector
   can be used in many different applications. These automatic keyword
   detection and topic allocation abilities enabled by the LSTM-RNN allow
   the network to perform document retrieval, a difficult language
   processing task, where the similarity between the query and documents
   can be measured by the distance between their corresponding sentence
   embedding vectors computed by the LSTM-RNN. On a web search task, the
   LSTM-RNN embedding is shown to significantly outperform several existing
   state of the art methods. We emphasize that the proposed model generates
   sentence embedding vectors that are specially useful for web document
   retrieval tasks. A comparison with a well known general sentence
   embedding method, the Paragraph Vector, is performed. The results show
   that the proposed method in this paper significantly outperforms
   Paragraph Vector method for web document retrieval task.}},

Abstract = {{A recently introduced structure for the capacitive micromachined
   ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) has focused on the applications of the
   asymmetric mode of vibration and has shown promising results in
   construction of super-resolution ultrasound images. This paper presents
   the first implementation and experimental results of a transceiver
   circuit to interface such CMUT structures. The multiple input/multiple
   output receiver in this work supports both fundamental and asymmetric
   modes of operation and includes transimpedance amplifiers and low-power
   variable-gain stages. These circuit blocks are designed considering the
   trade-offs between gain, input impedance, noise, linearity and power
   consumption. The high-voltage transmitter can generate pulse voltages up
   to 60 V while occupying a considerably small area. The overall circuit
   is designed and laid out in a 0.35 mu m CMOS process and a four-channel
   transceiver occupies 0.86 x 0.38 mm(2). The prototype chip is
   characterized in both electrical and mechanical domains. Measurement
   results show that each receiver channel has a nominal gain of 110 dB
   Omega with a 3 dB bandwidth of 9 MHz while consuming 1.02 mW from a 3.3
   V supply. The receiver is also highly linear, with 1 dB compression
   point of minimum 1.05 V which is considerably higher than the previously
   reported designs. The transmitter consumes 98.1 mW from a 30 V supply
   while generating 1.38 MHz, 30 V pulses. The CMOS-CMUT system is tested
   in the transmit mode and shows full functionality in air medium.}},

Abstract = {{Cutter-workpiece engagement (CWE) is the instantaneous contact geometry
   between the cutter and the in-process workpiece during machining. It
   plays an important role in machining process simulation and directly
   affects the calculation of the predicted cutting forces and torques. The
   difficulty and challenge of CWE determination come from the complexity
   due to the changing geometry of in-process workpiece and the curved tool
   path of cutter movement, especially for multi-axis milling. This paper
   presents a new method to determine the CWE for general milling
   processes. To fulfill the requirement of generality, which means for any
   cutter type, any in-process workpiece shape, and any tool path even with
   self-intersections, all the associated geometries are to be modeled as
   triangle meshes. The involved triangle-to-triangle intersection
   calculations are carried out by an effective method in order to realize
   the multiple subtraction Boolean operations between the tool and the
   workpiece mesh models and to determine the CWE. The presented method has
   been validated by a series of case studies of increasing machining
   complexity to demonstrate its applicability to general milling
   processes. (C) 2015 Society of CAD/CAM Engineers. Production and hosting

Title = {{Effect of activated biochar porous structure on the capacitive

Abstract = {{Activated biochar (i.e., a by-product of biomass pyrolysis) is developed
   as a renewable, low-cost, and promising carbon-based electrode for
   capacitive deionization (CDI) of NaCl and ZnCl2 solutions. High surface
   area biochar samples (i.e., between 971 and 1675 m(2) g(-1)) are
   prepared with three types of tailored porous structure: (a)
   predominately microporous (87\% of total pore volume), (b) mesoporous
   (72\% of total pore volume), and (c) a combination of both structures.
   The effect of the different porous structures, including also the
   sub-nanometer pore size ranges, on the electrosorption of Na+ and Zn2+
   is studied by electrochemical techniques (i.e., cyclic voltammetry,
   galvanostatic charge/discharge, and batch-mode electrosorption)
   complemented by surface structural and compositional analysis. For NaCl
   removal, all samples showed promising capacity (i.e., up to 5.39 mg NaCl
   g(-1)) and durability through four consecutive adsorption/regeneration
   cycles. In case of ZnCl2 on the other hand, the microporous sample
   experienced considerable drop in removal capacity (>75\% drop) from
   cycle nr. 1 to 4. Interestingly, the sample with mostly mesoporous
   structure showed the highest removal capacity and durability for Zn2+
   removal. These results emphasize the importance of tailoring the porous
   structure of the biochar electrode material as a function of the
   specific size of adsorbate ions to improve the CDI performance. (C) 2015

Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{291}},
Pages = {{408-413}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the potential of mine waste as a mineral sorbent
   for CO2 capture and sequestration during gas solid phase. The
   experiments tested the isotherm of pure CO2 adsorption with partial
   pressure from 10(-5) to 1 bar at ambient temperature. Chemical and
   mechanical activations were used as pre-treatment methods to enhance CO2
   adsorption capacity. The CO2 adsorption capacity of mineral sorbents was
   determined and compared among various materials. The mechanisms of CO2
   adsorption on mineral sorbents also analyzed through studying the
   isotherm. Results indicate that CO2 adsorption capacity is enhanced with
   an increase in surface area, micropore volume, and weight ratio for Mg
   to Si, and with a decrease in forsterite crystal structure disorder.
   Both activation methods reduced the CO2 adsorption capacity per surface
   area by reducing the weight ratio of Mg to Si in chemical activation,
   and disordering forsterite crystal structure in mechanical activation.
   With the increase of serpentine content in mineral sorbents, the CO2
   adsorption mechanism changed from physisorption to chemisorptions.
   Mechanical activation on mine waste activated the serpentine content and
   promoted CO2 chemisorption. At present, 480 s of mechanical activation
   on mine waste material in an IsaMill has 17.83 m(2)/g of specific
   surface area, 6.96 x 10(-3) cm(3)/g of micropore, and 5.84 x 10(13)
   m/m(3) of dislocation density on forsterite, yielding 2.73 mg CO2 per g
   samples. Mechanically-activated mine waste is suitable for industrial
   application for integrated CO2 capture and sequestration. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) systems have been proposed for efficient usage of
   spare spectrum licensed to primary systems. This leads to the issue of
   providing as much spectrum to CR users as possible while not degrading
   the quality of service (QoS) of primary users of the spectrum. This
   paper proposes a novel cooperation scheme between primary and CR users
   to guarantee QoS of primary users up to the cell edge while making the
   licensed spectrum available for opportunistic access by the CR users. We
   suggest that the primary users at the cell edge, who have poor QoS,
   should allow secondary users to access their spectrum, while at the same
   time, the secondary users would help to enhance the primary users QoS
   using superposition coding on the primary users transmissions. Thus the
   proposed method can provide a so called ``win-win strategy{''} by
   benefiting both primary and CR users. The proposed cooperative access
   scheme in cognitive radios solves efficiently the sum-rate maximization
   problem on cognitive Gaussian Multiple Access Channels (GMACs) for power
   allocation of primary systems that cooperates with CR systems in a
   distributed fashion. We solved the problem using iterative Jacobian
   method in a distributed manner. A totally asynchronous distributed power
   allocation for sum-rate maximization on cognitive GMACs is suggested.
   Numerical results show that the QoS of primary users at the cell edge is
   improved by the proposed cooperative access scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings are often contaminated with muscle
   artifacts. Muscular activities strongly obscure EEG signals and
   complicate subsequent EEG-based data analysis. Conventional methods for
   removing muscle artifact from EEG are usually based on blind source
   separation techniques and involve jointly analyzing multichannel EEG
   recordings. Instead of using the multichannel approaches, this paper
   proposes to explore single-channel techniques for muscle artifact
   removal from multichannel EEG. It may seem paradoxical that we denoise
   each channel individually while ignoring interchannel relationships. We
   conduct a performance comparison study, through numerical simulations
   and applications to real EEG recordings contaminated with muscle
   artifacts. The results demonstrate the advantage of single-channel
   techniques over multichannel ones, especially for low signal-to-noise
   ratios. This paper may change the traditional understanding of denoising
   the EEG signals.}},

Abstract = {{The branched TiO2 nanotubes (BTNTs) were synthesized by a combined
   method of electrospinning, hydrothermal treatment, calcination, and
   ultrasonic treatment. Various morphologies of BTNTs were obtained by
   adjusting the hydrothermal temperature or time, and this yielded a
   morphologically controllable BTNTs geometry. The CNTs incorporated TiO2
   nanorods (CTNRs) were fabricated via a combined method. The novel
   bilayer photoanodic film made of the CTNRs as an underlayer and the
   BTNTs as a light-scattering overlayer was fabricated for flexible
   dye-sensitized solar cells (FDSSCs). With addition of the BTNTs, the
   conversion efficiency of FDSSCs was greatly enhanced due to the improved
   light-scattering, the increased dye loading, and the more effective
   electron collection. The highest conversion efficiency of 4.18\% was
   achieved with the 150 degrees C hydrothermal treatment for 30 min, which
   is nearly twice that of the FDSSCs using single-layer CTNRs film. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{22-32}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Properties of colloidal and aerosol agglomerates depend on their
   morphology. Accurate estimation of the mobility-equivalent diameter d(m)
   in different flow regimes is essential in many industrial processes and
   measurements. Previous work on the hydrodynamic properties of clusters
   focussed on agglomerates composed of monodisperse primary particles.
   However aggregates formed in real processes, e.g. soot particles, are
   usually formed from polydisperse monomers. Using numerically-generated
   agglomerates it is shown here that the radius of gyration, surface area,
   and mass of the agglomerates increase with primary particle
   polydispersity (given constant geometric mean primary particle size
   d(pg)). Here, d(m) is taken as the projected area-equivalent diameter
   for the free molecular regime; Stokesian Dynamics is used to compute
   d(m) in the continuum flow regime. For fixed number of primaries and
   d(pg), d(m) increases with polydispersity in both free molecular and
   continuum regimes ( > 20\% for large particles at high polydispersity).
   Considering an aerosol population with polydisperse primary particles,
   this increase is found to depend on whether the variations in primary
   particle size occur within aggregates or between aggregates; this can be
   important in the interpretation of measurements. Finally, mobility
   diameters are correlated with total number, median diameter and its
   geometric standard deviation of the primary particles. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   that combines discrete modified CSO and tabu search is proposed. Results
   show that the proposed improvements help in enhancing the performance of
   the original algorithm. As a test case, the NP-hard problem of buffer
   minimization in CMOL (CMOS+nanowire+MOLecules) circuits is addressed.
   The performance of the proposed implementation of CSO algorithm is
   compared with other heuristics.}},

Abstract = {{Fouling and cleaning of membranes are well understood, but long-term
   changes (ageing) are not as established. A large body of literature has
   emerged on membrane ageing in the past 15 years. An array of changes in
   physical and chemical characteristics, as well as in membrane
   performance, has been attributed to ageing. The present review and
   analysis of published literature emphasize that research into membrane
   ageing is complex; it can only be comprehensively addressed by
   considering performance factors, chemical/physical membrane
   characteristics, and analytical methods in parallel, as well as the
   links between these. Of the performance factors, membrane resistance and
   breach frequency are widely discussed, but there is still debate over
   the membrane characteristics that cause them to change. Changing
   membrane fouling rate has been attributed to fewer causes, whereas
   membrane cleaning rate has not been linked to membrane characteristics.
   Chemical and physical changes in PVDF membranes can be understood using
   classic analytical techniques as well as methods that mimic membrane
   operation. Several research avenues emerged from the literature review.
   These include heightened attention to foulant effects, identifying the
   cause of changes to cleaning rate, and considering all performance
   factors simultaneously in economic assessment of membrane ageing. (C)

Abstract = {{As one of the two-dimensional (2-D) transition metal dichalcogenides,
   atomically thin molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has attracted significant
   attention and research interests for micro and nanoelectronic
   applications. Significant efforts have been made to develop different
   approaches in order to obtain atomic layer MoS2, such as exfoliation,
   chemical synthesis, and physical or chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
   processes. In this paper, we report a hydrogen-free and promoter-free
   CVD growth to synthesize large-area MoS2 atomic layers. A variety of
   techniques including optical microscopy (OM), atomic force microscopy
   (AFM), photoluminescence (PL) mapping, Raman and x-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), high resolution electron microscopy (HREM) and
   scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) were applied to
   characterize the film quality, uniformity and layer numbers. High
   quality centimeter-sized MoS2 atomic layers were demonstrated, which
   form a foundation to develop wafer-sized material platform for device
   fabrication and production. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Rinne test: does the tuning fork position affect the sound amplitude at
   the ear?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD \& NECK SURGERY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{45}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Guidelines and text-book descriptions of the Rinne test
   advise orienting the tuning fork tines in parallel with the longitudinal
   axis of the external auditory canal (EAC), presumably to maximise the
   amplitude of the air conducted sound signal at the ear. Whether the
   orientation of the tuning fork tines affects the amplitude of the sound
   signal at the ear in clinical practice has not been previously reported.
   The present study had two goals: determine if (1) there is clinician
   variability in tuning fork placement when presenting the air-conduction
   stimulus during the Rinne test; (2) the orientation of the tuning fork
   tines, parallel versus perpendicular to the EAC, affects the sound
   amplitude at the ear.
   Methods: To assess the variability in performing the Rinne test, the
   Canadian Society of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery members were
   surveyed. The amplitudes of the sound delivered to the tympanic membrane
   with the activated tuning fork tines held in parallel, and perpendicular
   to, the longitudinal axis of the EAC were measured using a Knowles
   Electronics Mannequin for Acoustic Research (KEMAR) with the microphone
   of a sound level meter inserted in the pinna insert.
   Results: 47.4 and 44.8 \% of 116 survey responders reported placing the
   fork parallel and perpendicular to the EAC respectively. The sound
   intensity (sound-pressure level) recorded at the tympanic membrane with
   the 512 Hz tuning fork tines in parallel with as opposed to
   perpendicular to the EAC was louder by 2.5 dB (95 \% CI: 1.35, 3.65 dB;
   p < 0.0001) for the fundamental frequency (512 Hz), and by 4.94 dB (95
   \% CI: 3.10, 6.78 dB; p < 0.0001) and 3.70 dB (95 \% CI: 1.62, 5.78 dB;
   p = .001) for the two harmonic (non-fundamental) frequencies (1 and 3.15
   kHz), respectively. The 256 Hz tuning fork in parallel with the EAC as
   opposed to perpendicular to was louder by 0.83 dB (95 \% CI: -0.26, 1.93
   dB; p = 0.14) for the fundamental frequency (256 Hz), and by 4.28 dB (95
   \% CI: 2.65, 5.90 dB; p < 0.001) and 1.93 dB (95 \% CI: 0.26, 3.61 dB; p
   = .02) for the two harmonic frequencies (500 and 4 kHz) respectively.
   Conclusions: Clinicians vary in their orientation of the tuning fork
   tines in relation to the EAC when performing the Rinne test. Placement
   of the tuning fork tines in parallel as opposed to perpendicular to the
   EAC results in a higher sound amplitude at the level of the tympanic
   membrane.}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Removal kinetics of four standard organic matter isolates under the
   application of strongly basic ion exchange resins (IEX) in suspended
   mode was studied under commercial application conditions. Suwannee River
   natural organic matter (SRNOM), SR fulvic acid (SRFA), and Pony Lake
   fulvic acid (PLFA) were greatly removed (>90\%) and highly preferred by
   IEX resins (alpha > 5, over Cl-, and HCO3-) while SR humic acid (SRHA)
   was the least preferred organic structure among the four isolates
   studied (alpha approximate to 1). Moreover, the efficacy of removal for
   fulvic acids (i.e., SRFA, PLFA) was consistent over consecutive reuse of
   IEX resins (i.e., loading cycles) whereas it decreased for SRNOM and
   SRHA over the course of operation. The stoichiometric correlation
   between the chloride released from the resins as a result of organic
   molecules uptake indicated that ion exchange was the dominant mechanism.
   Results obtained indicated that molecular weight and charge density of
   isolates played a major role in the performance of ion exchange process
   for organic matter removal. Furthermore, various empirical and physical
   models were evaluated using the experimental data and pore diffusion was
   found to be the rate-liming step during the uptake of organic matters;
   hence, it was used as the appropriate model to predict the kinetics of
   removal. Consequently, free liquid diffusivities and effective pore
   diffusion coefficients of organic molecules were estimated and findings
   were in agreement with the literature data that were obtained from
   spectrophotometric methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes the flexural behavior of ultra-high-performance
   fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) beams reinforced with glass
   fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) rebars and hybrid reinforcements (steel
   + GFRP rebars). Three GFRP bar-reinforced beams and four hybrid
   reinforced beams with different reinforcement ratios were fabricated and
   tested. Owing to the strain-hardening characteristics of UHPFRC, all
   test beams exhibited very stiff load-deflection behavior after the
   formation of cracks and satisfied the service crack width criteria of
   CAN/CSA S806. In addition, deformability factors higher than the lower
   limit of CAN/CSA-S6 were obtained for all test beams. The increase in
   the reinforcement ratio of GFRP rebars resulted in the improvement of
   their flexural performances, including post-cracking stiffness, load
   carrying capacity, and ductility (or deformability). The use of hybrid
   reinforcements by replacing a part of a GFRP rebar with a steel rebar
   contributed to a higher post-cracking stiffness before steel yielding,
   but led to lower deformability. Based on a sectional analysis, both
   AFGC/SETRA and JSCE recommendations were appropriate for predicting the
   moment-curvature response of UHPFRC beams with GFRP rebars and hybrid
   reinforcements: the average ratios of the maximum moments obtained from
   experiments and numerical analyses were found to be 1.12 and 0.94,
   respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{536-545}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{The deformation of the fusion weld mushy zone, as a critical factor in
   solidification cracking, has been simulated by combining a 3D
   multi-scalemodel of solidification and microstructure with a deformation
   model that includes the effects of solidification shrinkage,
   thermo-mechanical forces and restraining forces. This new model is then
   used to investigate the role of welding parameters on the deformation
   rate of micro liquid channels during Gas Tungsten Arc welding of AA6061.
   It is shown that the internal normal deformation rate due to
   solidification shrinkage and also the external normal deformation rate
   caused by external forces are both highest for the micro liquid channels
   at the center of the mushy zone where solidification cracks usually
   occur. Furthermore, the model shows that welding travel speed and
   welding current strongly influence the deformation rate of the weld
   mushy zone and consequently the solidification cracking susceptibility
   of the weld. The model can be also used to link micro-scale phenomena
   with the macro-scale characteristics of solidification cracking during
   welding. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{46}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{To date, no specific framework has been developed to guide composite
   structure designers to select the optimum fiber types and fabric weave
   patterns for a given application. This article aims to, first,
   investigate the effect of weighting methods in multiple criteria
   decision making (MCDM) and then arrive at a systematic framework for
   optimum weave pattern selection in fiber reinforced polymer (FRP)
   composites. Namely, via measured data from an industrial case study, the
   TOPSIS MCDM technique has been applied to choose the best candidate
   among different polypropylene/glass laminates. As an input to TOPSIS,
   different types of subjective and objective weighting methods were
   initially compared to assess the role of relative importance values
   (weights) of design criteria. These included the Entropy method, the
   modified digital logic (MDL) method, and the criteria importance through
   inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC) method. Next, two new subjective
   weighting methods, named `Numeric Logic (NL)' and `Adjustable Mean Bars
   (AMB)' methods, were introduced to give more practical and effective
   means to the decision makers during the weighting of criteria. In
   particular, compared to the MDL, the NL method increased the accuracy of
   assigned weights for an expert DM. On the other hand, the AMB provided a
   more interactive, visual approach through MCDM weighting process for
   less experienced DMs. Finally, a generalized combinative weighting
   framework is presented to show how different types of weightings may be
   combined to find more reliable rankings of alternatives. The combinative
   weighting could specifically accommodate different scenarios where a
   group of designers are involved and have different levels of experience,
   while given a large number of alternatives/criteria in highly nonlinear
   applications such as impact design of composite materials. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A slab-like pore model consisting of a thin water slab that is confined
   by a metal wall on one side and a dense ionomer skin layer on the other
   side was simulated with classical molecular dynamics. The model mimics
   thin-film structures of Pt/support (referred to as the metal), water
   layer, and ionomer phase encountered in cathode catalyst layers of
   polymer electrolyte fuel cells. The equilibrium proton density near the
   metal surface is the key variable required to predict the ORR activity
   and the Pt dissolution rate under fuel cell operating conditions. Here,
   we explored the equilibrium proton density distribution in the confined
   water layer as a function of oxide coverage at the metal surface, excess
   surface charge density, water layer thickness, and ionomer film
   structure. The effect of ionomer hydrophobicity on the water dynamics in
   the nanopore was also investigated. The electric dipole field created by
   the oxide layer on the Pt surface interacts strongly with protons, and
   concentrates protons at the metal surface. A direct relation was found
   between the surface proton concentration and the oxide layer dipole
   moment. Performing simulations with different ionomer structures and
   pore widths clarified the sensitivity of the proton density distribution
   to properties that are specific for the structure and distribution of
   the ionomer phase in catalyst layers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Microorganisms develop coordinated beating patterns on surfaces lined
   with cilia known as metachronal waves. For a chain of cilia attached to
   a flat ciliate, it has been shown that hydrodynamic interactions alone
   can lead the system to synchronize. However, several microorganisms
   possess a curve-shaped ciliate body and so to understand the effect of
   this geometry on the formation of metachronal waves, we evaluate the
   hydrodynamic interactions of cilia near a large spherical body. Using a
   minimal model, we show that for a chain of cilia around the sphere, the
   natural periodicity in the geometry leads the system to synchronize. We
   also report an emergent wavelike behavior when an asymmetry is
   introduced to the system.}},

Abstract = {{Visualization and analysis of the rodent spinal cord subject to
   experimental spinal cord injury (SCI) has almost completely been limited
   to naked-eye observations, and a single measure of gross spinal cord
   motion due to injury. This study introduces a novel method which
   utilizes MRI to quantify the deformation of the rodent spinal cord due
   to imposed, clinically-relevant injuries - specifically, cervical
   contusion and dislocation mechanisms. The image registration methods
   were developed using the Advanced Normalization Tools package, which
   incorporate rigid, affine and deformable registration steps. The
   proposed method is validated against a fiducial-based, gold-standard'
   measure of spinal cord tissue motion. The validation analysis yielded
   accuracy (and precision) values of 62m (49m), 73m (79m) and 112m (110m),
   for the medio-lateral, dorso-ventral and cranio-caudal directions,
   respectively. The internal morphological change of the spinal cord has
   never before been quantified, experimentally. This study demonstrates
   the capability of this method and its potential for future application
   to in vivo rodent models of SCI.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{148}},
Pages = {{48-58}},
Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{Molybdenite (MoS2) is a naturally hydrophobic mineral with anisotropic
   surface properties. Its floatability is influenced by a number of
   factors such as, particle size and shape, face/edge ratio, degree of
   crystallization, face heterogeneity, pH, etc. Molybdenite is floated by
   using oily collectors, and its recovery is strongly affected by slime
   coating phenomena. A number of hydrolyzable cations, such as Ca2+ and
   mg(2+), depress molybdenite in alkaline solutions. Depression of
   molybdenite in seawater and saline waters is mainly induced by the
   precipitation of colloidal magnesium hydroxide when pH is raised to
   depress pyrite. Other metal cations present in recycled process water
   can also reduce the flotation recovery of molybdenite (e.g., Al3+, Fe2+,
   Cu2+ ions). The native floatability of molybdenite is highly depressed
   by natural polymers (starch, dextrin, guar gum, humic acids, etc.) and
   synthetic polymers (e.g., flocculants of the polyacrylamide type). The
   advances in understanding the surface chemistry of these systems are
   reviewed and discussed in this paper. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Leach residues, produced during pilot and demonstration scale medium
   temperature (150 degrees C) hydrometallurgical processing of sulfide
   ores contain amorphous/poorly crystalline and metastable nano-scale iron
   oxides/oxyhydroxide phases. These phases control the properties of the
   residue and contain a relatively high loading of the valuable (Cu, Ni)
   metals. Residue samples from CESL and Vale pilot and demonstration plant
   medium temperature processes were characterized using different
   techniques. Poor agreement between total iron analysis by inductively
   coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and quantitative X-ray powder
   diffraction QXRPD indicated the presence of amorphous/poorly crystalline
   iron oxide phases. QXRPD coupled with sequential extraction was used for
   quantification of the amorphous iron phases. Amorphous iron
   oxides/oxyhydroxides were found to be a major source of copper and
   nickel losses to the residue. The distribution of copper and nickel into
   the amorphous and crystalline iron oxide phases was determined by a
   two-stage sequential extraction process. Association of copper and
   nickel to the amorphous phases was found to be approximately 2-4 times
   higher than with the crystalline iron oxide phases. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{It is common knowledge that surfactants lower the surface tension of
   water. The typical textbook explanation of this phenomenon is that the
   force of attraction between surfactant and water molecules is less than
   that between two water molecules; hence the surface contraction force
   decreases in the presence of surfactants; however, this common
   description, based on the strength of intermolecular interactions, is
   overly simplified because it ignores an important thermodynamic
   function: the surface entropy of water. Here we report separate
   measurements of water's surface enthalpy and surface entropy in the
   presence of nonionic, zwitterionic, anionic, and cationic surfactants.
   While all of these surfactants decreased the surface enthalpy of water
   by 50-70\%, the surface entropy of water could drop to near-zero or even
   negative values for ionic surfactants. Studies of this zero-entropy
   state of water surface using phase-sensitive sum-frequency generation
   (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
   suggested that the zero-entropy state of the water surface was
   associated with surfactant-induced ordering of water molecules and
   enhanced hydrogen bond formation at the water surface. Both effects
   reduce water molecules' degrees of freedom for motion and thus lower the
   surface entropy of water. The ability of a surfactant to decrease the
   surface entropy of water is in the order ionic > zwitterionic >
   nonionic. For all surfactant head groups surface entropy plays a
   critical role in determining the surface tension of water. The
   description of water's surface tension is not complete without
   considering its surface entropy.}},

   ventilation are capable of providing 11.4 m(3) of air/min in average.
   Usually 100 to 120 miners per shift are working in the mining fronts and
   this air quantity is not adequate to provide enough fresh air and
   comfort to workers and to dilute contaminants to a safe concentration.
   Interviews with managers of 50 mining fronts revealed that dry drilling
   is used by 92\% and only 10\% of miners wear masks. The study highlights
   the need of forced fans, dust control strategies, use of dust mask, pre
   and post medical checks, gas monitoring, training and abiding to safe
   mining practices as the measures to improve health and safety of the
   miners at the area. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work amorphous FeC films were deposited on thin sheets of
   interstitial free steel using physical vapor deposition. Annealing
   treatments were then carried out to diffuse C from the coating into the
   substrate at temperatures lower than those traditionally used in
   carburizing treatments. The yield stress was shown to significantly
   increase with annealing temperature from similar to 120 MPa at 25
   degrees C up to a maximum of 300 MPa at 630 degrees C without any
   significant loss of ductility. At 710 degrees C, a decrease in yield
   strength was related to the coarsening of carbides inside the IF steel
   (confirmed by atom probe tomography), and the associated reduction in
   the matrix solid solution carbon concentration (confirmed by
   thermoelectric power measurements). The through-thickness carbon
   diffusion profile was predicted using Fick's law and validated by Knoop
   hardness measurements. Yield strength predictions were accurate if the
   crystallization of the FeC film was taken into account as it controls
   the amount of carbon available to be diffused in the interstitial free
   steel substrate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of fluid chemistry on the microstructure of light backfill: An
   X-ray CT investigation}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{202}},
Pages = {{153-162}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{Bentonite-sand mixtures are widely accepted as the candidate sealing
   materials of radioactive waste repository due to their high swelling
   capacity and low hydraulic conductivity. These properties of the
   material depend largely on its microstructure, particularly, the pore
   space geometry. The aim of this investigation is to explore the effect
   of the pore fluid (NaCl and CaCl2) on the microstructure, pore geometry
   and hydraulic conductivity of a barrier material. Representative samples
   of light backfill (LBF) prepared with a 50-50 bentonite-sand mixture at
   a compacted dry density of 1.24 Mg/m(3) were used. As a first attempt,
   X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) was used to study the LBF under the
   distilled water (DW) and two other pore fluid conditions. In order to
   acquire a good quality image with high resolution, X-ray source,
   detector, and a small LBF specimen (5.5 mm in diameter) were placed
   close together and scanned with Xradia Micro XCT-400. The voxel of the
   scanned images were (1.15 x 1.15 x 1.15) mu m(3), indicating that the
   particles with a diameter greater than 2 mu m could be easily observed.
   The porosity value estimated at the end of the consolidation test showed
   significantly higher values compared to the X-ray CT analysis. The
   interconnected pore components and absolute permeability of distilled
   water or salt solution saturated LBF samples were analyzed using Avizo
   software. This analysis showed that the volume of interconnected pore
   increased due to the presence of salt solutions and resulted higher
   hydraulic conductivity. The salt solution increased porosity, pore size,
   volume of interconnected pore and hydraulic conductivity of the LBF. (c)

Title = {{A comparison between Offset Herringbone and El Teniente underground cave
   mining extraction layouts using a discrete event simulation technique}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINING RECLAMATION AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{Several underground cave mining operations have realised benefits in
   development rates when an extraction level layout is designed according
   to the El Teniente style. Geotechnical benefits may accrue in adopting
   the advance undercut technique in which extraction drift development
   lags the undercut development directly above. However, few technical
   studies are available in the literature that directly compare the Offset
   Herringbone and El Teniente styles when the decision criteria focus is
   on development rate impacts. This paper reports on research into
   discrete event simulation (DES) modelling that emulates stochastically
   the process of building the interdependent lateral infrastructure levels
   within the footprint of an existing cave mining method that uses the
   advance undercut technique. Such DES models can capture design
   considerations: firstly in the early stages of development, in which a
   limited number of headings are available; and secondly in the full
   stages of development where the maximum number of headings are governed
   by the width of the ore body. DES modelling is discussed in this paper
   in a case study situation, where results indicated that an additional
   3\% of drawpoint drivage required in an El Teniente layout could
   increase development rates by an average of 9\%.}},

Title = {{Detection of Homophilic Communities and Coordination of Interacting
   Meta-Agents: A Game-Theoretic Viewpoint}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL AND INFORMATION PROCESSING OVER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies two important signal processing aspects of homophilic
   behavior namely, detection of homophilic communities and the distributed
   coordination of meta-agents, which interact with the detected homophilic
   communities. First, the theory of revealed preferences from
   microeconomics is used to construct a nonparametric decision test for
   homophilic behavior using only the time series of external influences
   and associated agents' responses. These tests rely on rationalizing the
   dataset of agents' actions as the play from the Nash equilibrium of a
   concave potential game. A stochastic gradient algorithm is given to
   optimize the external influence signal in real time to minimize the
   Type-II error probabilities of the detection test subject to specified
   Type-I error probability. Using the decision test, methods are provided
   to detect for homophilic communities. Subsequently, a nonparametric
   algorithm is presented that uses the constructed potential function for
   the potential game to predict the preferences of the detected homophilic
   communities. Second, we present a non-cooperative game model for
   interaction of meta-agents that interact with the communities and
   propose an algorithm that prescribes meta-agents how to take actions
   based on the preference of the communities and past interaction
   information with other meta-agents. The proposed algorithm has two
   timescales: the slow timescale is the nonparametric preference learning
   presented in the first part, and the fast timescale is a regret-matching
   stochastic approximation algorithm. It is shown that, if all meta-agents
   follow the proposed algorithm, their collective behavior is attracted to
   the correlated equilibria set of the game. This means that meta-agents
   can co-ordinate their strategies in a distributed fashion as if there
   exists a centralized coordinating device that they all trust to follow.
   We provide a real-world example using the energy market, and a numerical
   example to detect malicious agents in an online social network.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, molecular community analysis and analytical measurements
   were combined to assess and compare the identity, functionality,
   structure, and temporal changes of membrane and conventional enhanced
   biological phosphorous removal systems (which ran stable over 300 days)

   was added to the system with the goal to enhance phosphate removal. Both
   systems behaved similarly with respect to phosphate and nitrogen removal
   efficiency and had similar community evenness, but they differed in
   community composition. A principle component analysis indicated that,
   the community of the membrane system changed permanently whereas the
   conventional system returned to approximately its initial composition.
   The relative intensity of DGGE bands were transformed in a numerical
   matrix and based on this matrix a model was constructed, which predicted
   some bands as foam forming bands, which were identified as foam-forming

Abstract = {{The failure of many drug trials testing newer therapeutics for brain
   disease has spawned investigation of novel treatments. Here we briefly
   review recent non-invasive transcranial electrical stimulation (tES)
   studies that suggest modulation of brain activity can be done safely and
   effectively, even when subjects do not feel the stimulation. In contrast
   to Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), an accepted surgical therapy for
   diseases such as Parkinson's, tES is completely noninvasive. Moreover,
   tES studies have demonstrated changes in motor performance, working
   memory, decision making, and somatosensory function. Galvanic Vestibular
   Stimulation (GVS) is also a form of electrical stimulation, but
   selectively activates vestibular afferents. Given the widespread
   cortical regions influenced by vestibular input, GVS can also have a
   myriad of effects, including partial amelioration of hemi-neglect, a
   known complication of right hemispheric stroke. In the future, it may be
   possible to judicially select pulsatile stimuli so that tES and/or GVS
   are tailored to the subject, or even the particular state of the
   individual, which may result in a quantum leap in efficacy of this
   exciting new technology.}},

Title = {{Molecular Dissection of Xyloglucan Recognition in a Prominent Human Gut
   Symbiont}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Polysaccharide utilization loci (PUL) within the genomes of resident
   human gut Bacteroidetes are central to the metabolism of the otherwise
   indigestible complex carbohydrates known as ``dietary fiber.{''}
   However, functional characterization of PUL lags significantly behind
   sequencing efforts, which limits physiological understanding of the
   human-bacterial symbiosis. In particular, the molecular basis of complex
   polysaccharide recognition, an essential prerequisite to hydrolysis by
   cell surface glycosidases and subsequent metabolism, is generally poorly
   understood. Here, we present the biochemical, structural, and reverse
   genetic characterization of two unique cell surface glycan-binding
   proteins (SGBPs) encoded by a xyloglucan utilization locus (XyGUL) from
   Bacteroides ovatus, which are integral to growth on this key dietary
   vegetable polysaccharide. Biochemical analysis reveals that these outer
   membrane-anchored proteins are in fact exquisitely specific for the
   highly branched xyloglucan (XyG) polysaccharide. The crystal structure
   of SGBP-A, a SusD homolog, with a bound XyG tetradecasaccharide reveals
   an extended carbohydrate-binding platform that primarily relies on
   recognition of the beta-glucan backbone. The unique, tetra-modular
   structure of SGBP-B is comprised of tandem Ig-like folds, with XyG
   binding mediated at the distal C-terminal domain. Despite displaying
   similar affinities for XyG, reverse-genetic analysis reveals that SGBP-B
   is only required for the efficient capture of smaller oligosaccharides,
   whereas the presence of SGBP-A is more critical than its
   carbohydrate-binding ability for growth on XyG. Together, these data
   demonstrate that SGBP-A and SGBP-B play complementary, specialized roles
   in carbohydrate capture by B. ovatus and elaborate a model of how
   vegetable xyloglucans are accessed by the Bacteroidetes.
   IMPORTANCE The Bacteroidetes are dominant bacteria in the human gut that
   are responsible for the digestion of the complex polysaccharides that
   constitute ``dietary fiber.{''} Although this symbiotic relationship has
   been appreciated for decades, little is currently known about how
   Bacteroidetes seek out and bind plant cell wall polysaccharides as a
   necessary first step in their metabolism. Here, we provide the first
   biochemical, crystallographic, and genetic insight into how two surface
   glycan-binding proteins from the complex Bacteroides ovatus xyloglucan
   utilization locus (XyGUL) enable recognition and uptake of this
   ubiquitous vegetable polysaccharide. Our combined analysis illuminates
   new fundamental aspects of complex polysaccharide recognition, cleavage,
   and import at the Bacteroidetes cell surface that may facilitate the
   development of prebiotics to target this phylum of gut bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{The production of crude oil from the Canadian oil sands has generated
   tailings ponds that contain oil sands process-affected water and oil
   sands fluid fine tailings (FFT). One remediation strategy is to backfill
   a mined out pit with FFT and cap this with a mix of oil sands
   process-affected water and fresh water to form a lake, called an end pit
   lake. Here we discuss various mechanisms governing the vertical mixing
   of suspended solids in an end pit lake. Depending on the depth of the
   water cap, wind waves can cause mixing between the water cap and the
   FFT. Other potential mixing mechanisms include: convection due to
   salt-water exclusion during ice formation, penetrative convection due to
   surface cooling, gas emission from the FFT, and internal wave activity.
   Data collected at Syncrude Canada Limited's Base Mine Lake in 2013 and
   2014 are used to demonstrate the effects of some of these processes.}},

Abstract = {{Water utilities often rely on water main failure prediction models for
   developing preventive or proactive repair and replacement action
   programs. Due to inherent uncertainties in modeling, it is challenging
   to understand the water main failure processes and to predict the
   failure effectively. In this study, Bayesian model averaging (BMA)
   method is presented to identify the influential covariates and to
   predict the failure rates of water mains considering model
   uncertainties. To accredit the proposed model, it is implemented to
   predict the failure of pipes of the water distribution network of the
   City of Kelowna, BC and Greater Vernon Water, BC, Canada. Results
   indicate that the proposed BMA approach captures the effect of the
   potential explanatory variables more effectively through the posterior
   probabilities in contrast to that of the p-value given by the classical
   regression analysis. Moreover, BMA approach performs better compared to
   classical regression analysis when limited pipe failure data are

Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{107-113}},

Abstract = {{Do bicyclist preferences for low-traffic facilities lead to route
   choices that minimize air pollution inhalation doses? For both
   preferences and doses a routing trade-off can exist between exposure to
   motor vehicle traffic and trip duration. We use past studies of bicycle
   route preferences and pollution exposure levels to estimate
   exposure/distance trade-offs among roadway facility types.
   Exposure/distance trade-offs for preferences and doses are found to be
   similar when comparing off-street paths, bike boulevards, and
   low-to-moderate traffic streets with or without bike lanes; when
   choosing a route among these facilities we expect bicyclists to
   approximately minimize inhalation doses. Compared to dose-minimizing
   behavior, bicyclists tend to use high-traffic streets too often if there
   is a bike lane and not enough if there is not. The recommendation for
   practice is to provide low-traffic routes wherever possible in bicycle
   networks, not to limit bicycle facilities on high-traffic streets.
   Networks with extensive low-traffic bicycle facilities are robust to
   misalignments between preferences and doses because they reduce both the
   likelihood and severity of excess (non-minimum) doses. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The increased use of forest and wood residues for the production of
   bioenergy, biofuels, and other bioproducts is essential to enhance the
   economic performance of forest products industries and reduce
   environmental impacts. Bi-objective optimization models have been
   developed recently to support the optimum design of either bioenergy or
   biofuels supply chains considering economic as well as environmental
   impacts. In an integrated bioenergy and biofuels supply chain where
   biofuel producers are also users of the generated energy, the energy
   flows among co-located supply chain entities affect the environmental
   and economic objective functions and consequently the optimal design of
   the supply chain, therefore, the energy flows have to be considered in
   the optimization model. This type of bi-objective problem has not been
   modeled in previous studies. In this paper, a bi-objective biorefinery
   supply chain optimization model for the production of bioenergy and
   biofuels using forest and wood residues is developed. The model
   considers energy flows among co-located technologies and is formulated
   as a multi-period mixed integer program (MIP) that calculates the net
   present value (NPV) and the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission
   savings associated with the biorefinery supply chain. The applicability
   of the proposed model is illustrated through a case study in British
   Columbia, Canada. (C) 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Title = {{Reducing streak artifacts in computed tomography via sparse
   representation in coupled dictionaries}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Reducing the number of acquired projections is a simple and
   efficient way to reduce the radiation dose in computed tomography (CT).
   Unfortunately, this results in streak artifacts in the reconstructed
   images that can significantly reduce their diagnostic value. This paper
   presents a novel algorithm for suppressing these artifacts in 3D CT.
   Methods: The proposed algorithm is based on the sparse representation of
   small blocks of 3D CT images in learned overcomplete dictionaries. It
   learns two dictionaries, the first dictionary (D-a) is for artifact-full
   images that have been reconstructed from a small number (approximately
   100) of projections. The other dictionary (D-c) is for clean
   artifact-free images. The core idea behind the proposed algorithm is to
   relate the representation coefficients of an artifact-full block in Da
   to the representation coefficients of the corresponding artifact-free
   block in Dc. The relation between these coefficients is modeled with a
   linear mapping. The two dictionaries and the linear relation between the
   coefficients are learned simultaneously from the training data. To
   remove the artifacts from a test image, small blocks are extracted from
   this image and their sparse representation is computed in Da. The linear
   map is then used to compute the corresponding coefficients in Dc, which
   are then used to produce the artifact-suppressed blocks.
   Results: The authors apply the proposed algorithm on real cone-beam CT
   images. Their results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively
   suppress the artifacts and substantially improve the quality of the
   reconstructed images. The images produced by the proposed algorithm have
   a higher quality than the images reconstructed by the FDK algorithm from
   twice as many projections.
   Conclusions: The proposed sparsity-based algorithm can be a valuable
   tool for postprocessing of CT images reconstructed from a small number
   of projections. Therefore, it has the potential to be an effective tool
   for low-dose CT. (C) 2016 American Association of Physicists in

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Undulatory locomotion is ubiquitous in nature and observed in different
   media, from the swimming of flagellated microorganisms in biological
   fluids, to the slithering of snakes on land, or the locomotion of
   sandfish lizards in sand. Despite the similarity in the undulating
   pattern, the swimming characteristics depend on the rheological
   properties of different media. Analysis of locomotion in granular
   materials is relatively less developed compared with fluids partially
   due to a lack of validated force models but recently a resistive force
   theory in granular media has been proposed and shown useful in studying
   the locomotion of a sand-swimming lizard. Here we employ the proposed
   model to investigate the swimming characteristics of a slender filament,
   of both finite and infinite length, undulating in a granular medium and
   compare the results with swimming in viscous fluids. In particular, we
   characterize the effects of drifting and pitching in terms of propulsion
   speed and efficiency for a finite sinusoidal swimmer. We also find that,
   similar to Lighthill's results using resistive force theory in viscous
   fluids, the sawtooth swimmer is the optimal waveform for propulsion
   speed at a given power consumption in granular media. The results
   complement our understanding of undulatory locomotion and provide
   insights into the effective design of locomotive systems in granular
   media. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Fiber-reinforced elastomeric isolators (FREIs) are a new type of
   elastomeric base isolation systems. Producing FREIs in the form of long
   laminated pads and cutting them to the required size significantly
   reduces the time and cost of the manufacturing process. Due to the lack
   of adequate information on the performance of FREIs in bonded
   applications, the goal of this study is to assess the performance
   sensitivity of 1/4-scale carbon-FREIs based on the experimental tests.
   The scaled carbon-FREIs are manufactured using a fast cold-vulcanization
   process. The effect of several factors including the vertical pressure,
   the lateral cyclic rate, the number of rubber layers, and the thickness
   of carbon fiber-reinforced layers are explored on the cyclic behavior of
   rubber bearings. Results show that the effect of vertical pressure on
   the lateral response of base isolators is negligible. However,
   decreasing the cyclic loading rate increases the lateral flexibility and
   the damping capacity. Additionally, carbon fiber-reinforced layers can
   be considered as a minor source of energy dissipation.}},

Title = {{Internal corrosion hazard assessment of oil \& gas pipelines using

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{479-495}},

Abstract = {{A substantial amount of oil \& gas products are transported and
   distributed via pipelines, which can stretch for thousands of
   kilometers. In British Columbia (BC), Canada, alone there are over
   40,000 km of pipelines currently being operated. Because of the adverse
   environmental impact, public outrage and significant financial losses,
   the integrity of the pipelines is essential. More than 37 pipe failures
   per year occur in BC causing liquid spills and gas releases, damaging
   both property and environment. BC oil \& gas commission (BCOGS) has
   indicated metal loss due to internal corrosion as one of the primary
   causes of these failures. Therefore, it is of a paramount importance to
   timely identify pipelines subjected to severe internal corrosion in
   order to improve corrosion mitigation and pipeline maintenance
   strategies, thus minimizing the likelihood of failure. To accomplish
   this task, this paper presents a Bayesian belief network (BBN)-based
   probabilistic internal corrosion hazard assessment approach for oil \&
   gas pipelines. A cause-effect BBN model has been developed by
   considering various information, such as analytical corrosion models,
   expert knowledge and published literature. Multiple corrosion models and
   failure pressure models have been incorporated into a single flexible
   network to estimate corrosion defects and associated probability of
   failure (PoF). This paper also explores the influence of fluid
   composition and operating conditions on the corrosion rate and PoF. To
   demonstrate the application of the BBN model, a case study of the
   Northeastern BC oil \& gas pipeline infrastructure is presented. Based
   on the pipeline's mechanical characteristics and operating conditions,
   spatial and probabilistic distributions of corrosion defect and PoF have
   been obtained and visualized with the aid of the Geographic Information
   System (GIS). The developed BBN model can identify vulnerable pipeline
   sections and rank them accordingly to enhance the informed
   decision-making process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of technologies such as combine heat and power systems
   has accelerated the integration of energy resources in energy hubs.
   Besides, the advances in smart grid technologies motivate the
   electricity utility companies toward developing demand response (DR)
   programs to influence the electricity usage behavior of the customers.
   In this paper, we modify the conventional DR programs in smart grid to
   develop an integrated DR (IDR) program for multiple energy carriers fed
   into an energy hub in smart grid, namely a smart energy (S. E.) hub. In
   our model, the IDR program is formulated for the electricity and natural
   gas networks. The interaction among the S. E. hubs is modeled as an
   ordinal potential game with unique Nash equilibrium. Besides, a
   distributed algorithm is developed to determine the equilibrium.
   Simulation results show that in addition to load shifting, the customers
   in the S. E. hubs can participate in the IDR program by switching the
   energy resources (e.g., from the electricity to the natural gas) during
   the peak hours. Moreover, the IDR program can increase the S. E. hubs'
   daily payoff and the utility companies' daily profit.}},

Abstract = {{The use of cognitive-radio(CR)-enabled femtocell is regarded as a
   promising technique in wireless communications, and many studies have
   been reported on its resource allocation and interference management.
   However, fairness and spectrum sensing errors were ignored in most of
   the existing studies. In this paper, we propose a resource allocation
   scheme for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based
   cognitive femtocells. The target is to maximize the total capacity of
   all femtocell users (FUs) under given quality-of-service (QoS) and
   cotier/cross-tier interference constraints with imperfect channel
   sensing. To achieve the fairness among FUs, the minimum and maximum
   numbers of subchannels occupied by each user are considered. First, the
   subchannel and power allocation problem is modeled as a mixed-integer
   programming problem, and then, it is transformed into a convex
   optimization problem by relaxing subchannel sharing and applying cotier
   interference constraints, which is finally solved using a dual
   decomposition method. Based on the obtained solution, an iterative
   subchannel and power allocation algorithm is proposed. The effectiveness
   of the proposed algorithm in terms of capacity and fairness compared
   with the existing schemes is verified by simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Future backscatter RFID systems are required to be more reliable and
   data intensive for emerging fields such as Internet of Things (IoT).
   Motivated by this, orthogonal space-time block code (OSTBC), which is
   very successful in mobile communications for its low complexity and high
   performance, has already been investigated for MIMO backscatter RFID.
   Also a recently proposed scheme called unitary query was shown to be
   able to considerably improve the reliability of MIMO backscatter RFID by
   exploiting query diversity. Therefore, incorporating the classical OSTBC
   (at the tag end) with the unitary query (at the query end) seems
   promising. However, in this paper, we first show that simple direct
   employment of OSTBC together with unitary query incurs a linear decoding
   problem and eventually leads to severe performance degradation. As a
   redesign of the unitary query idea and the classical OSTBC specifically
   for MIMO backscatter RFID, we present a BUTQ-mOSTBC design pair idea by
   proposing the block-level unitary query (BUTQ) at the query end and the
   corresponding modified OSTBC (mOSTBC) at the tag end. The proposed
   BUTQ-mOSTBC can resolve the linear decoding problem, keep the simplicity
   and high performance properties of the classical OSTBC, and achieve the
   query diversity for the MIMO backscatter RFID.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider secure downlink transmission in a multicell
   massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system where the numbers
   of base station (BS) antennas, mobile terminals, and eavesdropper
   antennas are asymptotically large. The channel state information of the
   eavesdropper is assumed to be unavailable at the BS and hence, linear
   precoding of data and artificial noise (AN) are employed for secrecy
   enhancement. Four different data precoders (i.e., selfish zero-forcing
   (ZF)/regularized channel inversion (RCI) and collaborative ZF/RCI
   precoders) and three different AN precoders (i.e., random,
   selfish/collaborative null-space-based precoders) are investigated and
   the corresponding achievable ergodic secrecy rates are analyzed. Our
   analysis includes the effects of uplink channel estimation, pilot
   contamination, multicell interference, and path-loss. Furthermore, to
   strike a balance between complexity and performance, linear precoders
   that are based on matrix polynomials are proposed for both data and AN
   precoding. The polynomial coefficients of the data and AN precoders are
   optimized, respectively, for minimization of the sum-mean-squared-error
   of and the AN leakage to the mobile terminals in the cell of interest
   using tools from free probability and random matrix theory. Our
   analytical and simulation results provide interesting insights for the
   design of secure multicell massive MIMO systems and reveal that the
   proposed polynomial data and AN precoders closely approach the
   performance of selfish RCI data and null-space-based AN precoders,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Physical inactivity is increasing among children globally and has been
   directly linked to the growing problems of overweight and obesity. We
   aim to assess the impact of a new mobile exergame, MobileKids Monster
   Manor (MKMM), in a school-based setting. MKMM, developed with input from
   youth to enhance physical activity, is wirelessly connected to an
   accelerometer-based activity monitor. Forty-two healthy students (11.3
   +/- 1.2 years old and 0.28 +/- 1.29 body-mass index {[}BMI] z-score)
   participated in a randomized 4-week crossover study to evaluate the game
   intervention. The two study arms consisted of week-long baseline, game
   intervention/control, washout, and control/game intervention phases. All
   participants were required to wear an activity monitor at all times to
   record steps and active minutes for the study duration. MKMM was used
   during each arm's respective intervention week, during which children
   were asked to play the game at their convenience. When children were
   exposed to the game, an increase compared with the control phase of
   2,934 steps per day (p = 0.0004, 95\% CI 1,434-4,434) and 46 active
   minutes per day (p = 0.001, 95\% CI 20-72) from baseline (12,299
   steps/day and 190 active minutes/day) was observed. A linear regression
   model showed that MKMM yielded a greater increase in steps and active
   minutes per day among children with a higher BMI z-score, showing 10
   percent more steps per day and 14 percent more active minutes per day
   relative to baseline, per unit increase in BMI z-score. In conclusion,
   MKMM increased steps and active minutes in a school-based environment.
   This suggests that mobile exergames could be useful tools for schools to
   promote physical activity and combat obesity in adolescents.}},

Abstract = {{Low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy treatment takes place by
   implantation of small radioactive seeds in and sometimes adjacent to the
   prostate gland. A patient specific target anatomy for seed placement is
   usually determined by contouring a set of collected transrectal
   ultrasound images prior to implantation. Standard-of-care in prostate
   brachytherapy is to delineate the clinical target anatomy, which closely
   follows the real prostate boundary. Subsequently, the boundary is
   dilated with respect to the clinical guidelines to determine a planning
   target volume. Manual contouring of these two anatomical targets is a
   tedious task with relatively high observer variability. In this work, we
   aim to reduce the segmentation variability and planning time by
   proposing an efficient learning-based multi-label segmentation
   algorithm. We incorporate a sparse representation approach in our
   methodology to learn a dictionary of sparse joint elements consisting of
   images, and clinical and planning target volume segmentation. The
   generated dictionary inherently captures the relationships among
   elements, which also incorporates the institutional clinical guidelines.
   The proposed multi-label segmentation method is evaluated on a dataset
   of 590 brachytherapy treatment records by 5-fold cross validation. We
   show clinically acceptable instantaneous segmentation results for both
   target volumes.}},

Title = {{Dynamics of the removal of viscoplastic fluids from inclined pipes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{229}},
Pages = {{43-58}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The dynamics of the removal of a viscoplastic fluid by a Newtonian fluid
   is investigated experimentally and theoretically in an inclined pipe
   based on our previous studies on near-horizontal and highly inclined
   configurations. The fluids are miscible. The displacing Newtonian fluid
   is heavier than the displaced viscoplastic one i.e. the configuration is
   density-unstable. In our earlier work it was found that two major flow
   regimes, namely center-type and slump-type, might occur depending on the
   density difference. These flows are explored in great details through
   measurements of the displacement speeds and hydraulic Reynolds numbers.
   The residual viscoplastic layer unevenness is characterized revealing
   that the flows are in the range of large roughness regimes. Through an
   integrated experimental-theoretical approach, estimates of the
   interfacial and wall shear stresses are given which is of great
   importance in designing the displacement and cleaning processes
   involving fluids with yield stress. Accompanied by Ultrasonic Doppler
   Velocimetry (UDV) data, the dynamics of the removal of the viscoplastic
   fluid from a pipe is elucidated suggesting three distinct phases in the
   displacement process namely a plug flow, inertial multi-dimensional flow
   at the displacing front and steady multi-layer developed flow. Finally,
   the viscoplastic displacement flow results are compared against the
   predictions of the closure model, previously proved successful for
   Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids displacement in pipe. It is found
   that in the case of viscoplastic fluids the closure model always over
   predicts the displacing front velocity due to the inertial stresses
   present at the front not captured in the model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Mine reclamation succeeds when healthy, self-sustaining ecosystems
   develop on previously mined lands. Regulations require reclamation of
   ecosystem services; however, there are few specified targets, and those
   that are presented are vague. Sequencing genomic DNA and transcribed RNA
   from environmental samples may provide critical supportive information
   for attempts to recreate ecosystem functions from the ground up on
   disturbed lands. In this review, we highlight the use of genomics to
   meet mine closure goals, to enhance ecosystem development, and to
   optimize ecosystem services inherent in self-sustaining reclaimed
   ecosystems. We address the development of environmental
   genomicssequencing and analysis of environmentally derived DNAto
   characterize microbial communities on mine sites. We then provide four
   areas where genomics has proven instrumental for informing management
   and assisting in reclamation of mine sites in the form of bioreactors,
   passive treatment systems, novel gene discovery, and DNA barcoding.
   Finally, we describe how recently developed techniques have transferable
   value to mine reclamation and provide evidence for future applications
   of genomics and the necessary steps to integrate these data into
   comprehensive management of mined sites.}},

Abstract = {{Although effects of biochemical modulation of stem cells have been
   widely investigated, only recent advances have been made in the
   identification of mechanical conditioning on cell signaling pathways.
   Experimental investigations quantifying the micromechanical environment
   of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are challenging while computational
   approaches can predict their behavior due to in vitro stimulations. This
   study introduces a 3D cell-specific finite element model simulating
   large deformations of MSCs. Here emphasizing cell mechanical modulation
   which represents the most challenging multiphysics phenomena in
   sub-cellular level, we focused on an approach attempting to elicit
   unique responses of a cell under fluid flow. Fluorescent staining of
   MSCs was performed in order to visualize the MSC morphology and develop
   a geometrically accurate model of it based on a confocal 3D image. We
   developed a 3D model of a cell fixed in a microchannel under fluid flow
   and then solved the numerical model by fluid-structure interactions
   method. By imposing flow characteristics representative of vigorous in
   vitro conditions, the model predicts that the employed external flow
   induces significant localized effective stress in the nucleo-cytoplasmic
   interface and average cell deformation of about 40\%. Moreover, it can
   be concluded that a lower strain level is made in the cell by the
   oscillatory flow as compared with steady flow, while same ranges of
   effective stress are recorded inside the cell in both conditions. The
   deeper understanding provided by this study is beneficial for better
   design of single cell in vitro studies.}},

Abstract = {{The state-of-the-art magnetically linear voltage-behind-reactance (VBR)
   and phase-domain induction machine models for nodal-analysis-based
   electromagnetic transients programs (EMTP-type) offer an excellent
   combination of numerical stability, accuracy, and efficiency. However,
   incorporation of magnetic saturation in these models renders their
   interfacing circuits dependent on the operating segment of the
   piecewise-linear saturation characteristics. Consequently,
   refactorization of the network's conductance matrix is required during
   simulations, which reduces the numerical efficiency of the overall
   solution and limits the models' range of application. This paper
   presents a new VBR squirrel-cage induction machine model that includes
   main flux saturation and possesses a saturation-independent
   constant-parameter interfacing circuit. Case studies in PSCAD/EMTDC
   demonstrate that the proposed model offers similar numerical stability
   and accuracy to the state-of-the-art models, while considerably
   increasing simulation speed for practical multimachine systems.}},

Abstract = {{Brushless permanent magnet (BLPM) motor drives based on Hall sensors
   have received extensive attention in the literature and are widely used
   in many applications. However, most of the available and published
   controllers assume that the Hall signals are always available, which is
   not true if any of the sensors are faulted. In this paper, several
   fault-tolerant control schemes for BLPM motor drives are proposed. The
   methodology is based on fault diagnosis and its classification, and
   subsequent signal reconstruction. Simulation and experimental results
   demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed
   fault-tolerant schemes in restoring the motor operation when failures
   occur in up to two Hall sensors. The proposed fault-tolerant schemes can
   be easily and flexibly realized for conventional drive systems, either
   by adding the code in the existing driver or by adding a simple
   auxiliary circuit between the Hall sensors and the driver.}},

Abstract = {{High-pulse-count rectifier systems (with more than six pulses) are often
   used in high-power applications. Dynamic average value modeling (AVM)
   has proven to be indispensable for simulation and analysis of such power
   electronic systems. However, developing accurate AVMs for such
   line-commutated converters is challenging due to the presence of
   complicated switching patterns (operating modes), configuration of
   multi-phase transformers and/or rotating machines, inter-phase
   transformers, filters, etc. This paper presents a generalized
   methodology for full-order dynamic average modeling of high-pulse-count
   line-commutated rectifiers, which is based on the recently proposed
   parametric AVM approach. Extensive simulation studies are carried out
   considering the 18-pulse rectifier example system. The accuracy and
   numerical advantages of the developed generalized AVM is verified
   against the detailed switching model, and a previously established
   average model in time and frequency domains.}},

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{Although historically, antibiotic resistance has occurred naturally in
   environmental bacteria, many questions remain regarding the specifics of
   how humans and animals contribute to the development and spread of
   antibiotic resistance in agroecosystems. Additional research is
   necessary to completely understand the potential risks to human, animal,
   and ecological health in systems altered by
   antibiotic-resistance-related contamination. At present, analyzing and
   interpreting the effects of human and animal inputs on antibiotic
   resistance in agroecosystems is difficult, since standard research
   terminology and protocols do not exist for studying background and
   baseline levels of resistance in the environment. To improve the state
   of science in antibiotic-resistance-related research in agroecosystems,
   researchers are encouraged to incorporate baseline data within the study
   system and background data from outside the study system to normalize
   the study data and determine the potential impact of
   antibiotic-resistance-related determinants on a specific agroecosystem.
   Therefore, the aims of this review were to (i) present standard
   definitions for commonly used terms in environmental antibiotic
   resistance research and (ii) illustrate the need for research standards
   (normalization) within and between studies of antibiotic resistance in
   agroecosystems. To foster synergy among antibiotic resistance
   researchers, a new surveillance and decision-making tool is proposed to
   assist researchers in determining the most relevant and important
   antibiotic-resistance-related targets to focus on in their given
   agroecosystems. Incorporation of these components within
   antibiotic-resistance-related studies should allow for a more
   comprehensive and accurate picture of the current and future states of
   antibiotic resistance in the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Growth of the unconventional gas industry is predicted to continue to be
   an important component of the global energy landscape. The rapid
   expansion of shale and tight gas development has raised many
   environmental and human health concerns, particularly in regards to
   ground and surface water contamination. The unconventional gas industry
   has begun to transition toward the use of hydraulic fracturing chemicals
   that pose minimal environmental and human health hazards in order to
   mitigate the risks associated with possible chemical containment
   failure. Integrated chemical hazard evaluation has been facilitated by
   an adapted index-based approach to combine noncommensurate
   multiparameter chemical hazard data into a single score value.
   Comparative analysis of existing chemical hazard index scoring systems
   as well as the formulation of a novel hydraulic fracturing fluid
   greenness assessment system revealed several important considerations
   for index development and application. Index scores calculated using the
   investigated index systems highlighted the need for informed, optimized
   hazard class selection as input for score determination, the maintenance
   of hazard category intensity during parameter transformation, as well as
   representative hazard class and chemical component mathematical
   weightings, and robust aggregation techniques for final score
   calculation. Continued research should work to model the combined hazard
   posed by individual chemicals while considering the effect of dilution
   as well as incorporate additional index metrics beyond hazard intensity.
   Fully disclosed index systems, applied with complete knowledge of their
   strengths and weaknesses, provide useful monitoring and communication
   tools to promote environmental-best practices in the unconventional gas

Abstract = {{We present a direct comparison between the predicted and measured
   probability density functions (PDF) of the reaction progress variable
   and conditioned values of the scalar dissipation rates (SDR) in premixed
   turbulent flames. The predictions are based on simulations of premixed
   flames using the linear-eddy model (LEM), parameterised by a wide range
   of integral length scales and turbulent Reynolds numbers. The
   experimental results are highly spatially resolved temperature and
   species data from the Cambridge Sandia swirl burner. The LEM simulations
   display remarkable accuracy in capturing the features observed
   experimentally. Further, the results reveal that the LEM calculated PDF
   and SDR for premixed flames remain relatively steady under a variety of

Abstract = {{A one-step method is introduced for synthesizing rutile TiO2 nanorods
   (TNRs) directly from Ti metal. TNRs are generated by hydrothermally
   processing a Ti metal disc in H2SO4/CuSO4 solutions at 150 degrees C. In
   a 112-day long experiment, different ledgewise growth mechanisms are
   observed in the early (7-day) and the late (112-day) stages of TNR
   formation. A unique phenomenon is observed in that the length of the
   TNRs is a function of processing time and the H2SO4/CuSO4 concentration,
   whereas the diameter of the TNRs is almost unaffected. It is found that
   the diameter of these nanorods can only be affected by variation of
   temperature. A mechanism involving the critical dimension of the (101)
   growth front is proposed in this paper. In addition, methyl orange
   degradation efficiency of 90\% was achieved when the fabricated TNRs
   were used as immobilized photocatalysts.}},

Abstract = {{A range of ultrasonication (US) and microwave irradiation (MW) sludge
   pretreatments were compared to determine the extent of cellular
   destruction in micro-organisms within secondary sludge and how this
   cellular destruction translated to anaerobic digestion (AD). Cellular
   lysis/inactivation was measured using two microbial viability assays,
   (1) Syto 16A (R) Green and SytoxA (R) Orange counter-assay to discern
   the integrity of cellular membranes and (2) a fluorescein diacetate
   assay to understand relative enzymatic activity. A range of MW
   intensities (2.17-6.48 kJ/g total solids or TS, coinciding temperatures
   of 60-160 A degrees C) were selected for comparison via viability
   assays; a range of corresponding US intensities (2.37-27.71 kJ/g TS,
   coinciding sonication times of 10-60 min at different amplitudes) were
   also compared to this MW range. The MW pretreatment of thickened waste
   activated sludge (tWAS) caused fourfold to fivefold greater cell death
   than non-pretreated and US-pretreated tWAS. The greatest microbial
   destruction occurred at MW intensities greater than 2.62 kJ/g TS of
   sludge, after which increased energy input via MW did not appear to
   cause greater microbial death. In addition, the optimal MW pretreatment
   (80 A degrees C, 2.62 kJ/g TS) and corresponding US pretreatment (10
   min, 60 \% amplitude, 2.37 kJ/g TS) were administered to the tWAS of a
   mixed sludge and fed to anaerobic digesters over sludge retention times
   (SRTs) of 20, 14, and 7 days to compare effects of feed pretreatment on
   AD efficiency. The digester utilizing MW-pretreated tWAS (80 A degrees
   C, 2.62 kJ/g TS) had the greatest fecal coliform removal (73.4 and 69.8
   \% reduction, respectively), greatest solids removal (44.2 \% TS
   reduction), and highest overall methane production (248.2 L CH4/kg
   volatile solids) at 14- and 7-day SRTs. However, despite the fourfold to
   fivefold increases in cell death upon pretreatment, improvements from
   the digester fed MW-pretreated sludge were marginal (i.e., increases in
   efficiency of less than 3-10 \%) and likely due to a smaller proportion
   of cells (10-20 \%) in the polymeric network and mixed sludge fed to
   digesters.}},

Number = {{5-8}},
Pages = {{1013-1023}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an improved methodology for evaluating the position
   and orientation errors of airfoil sections of a manufactured aero-engine
   blade. The existing method estimates these errors by finding rigid-body
   transformations with translational and rotational parameters altogether
   to best match the inspection data points onto the design airfoil
   profiles. Such transformations lead to unreliable evaluation results due
   to combining the position and orientation errors with each other. This
   paper proposes to decouple the position and orientation errors in their
   evaluation in order to avoid the combining effect. To isolate the
   position error from the orientation error, an important location
   tolerance evaluation feature, the centroid of a manufactured airfoil
   section, must be correctly identified from the sectional inspection data
   points. Identifying the centroid location directly from discrete data
   points is subject to an error caused by biased area calculations on the
   pressure and suction sides of an airfoil. This work proposes to
   reconstruct a valid airfoil profile from the inspection data points for
   each airfoil section to overcome the area bias problem and to maintain
   consistency in identifying the centroid. With the centroid of each
   inspected airfoil section identified, the position error and the
   orientation error can then be evaluated in sequence. A series of case
   studies has been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed methodology and how it is able to prevent wrongful
   rejection/acceptance of geometrically acceptable/unacceptable blades as
   well as incorrect modification of the related manufacturing processes.}},

   widely-used porosity-based thermal conductivity models}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{307}},

Abstract = {{Porosity and pore size data have long been used for reconstructing (two
   directional) fibrous materials. The present study is aimed to explain
   the overlooked fact that pore size parameter, bundling several other
   geometric parameters together, cannot be directly used for the
   reconstruction and geometrical modeling of gas diffusion layers (GDLs)
   of fuel cells. Instead, it has to be converted to fiber spacing, for
   which purpose it is a useful parameter. A technical approach is
   presented on how to reach fiber spacing from pore size (diameter) data.
   The reason why GDLs with the same porosity, fiber diameter and angle,
   but with unequal fiber spacing, may have different properties is also
   explained by providing physical evidence.
   The present study clearly demonstrates that the traditional notion that
   fibrous materials with lower porosity have higher thermal conductivity
   does not necessary hold. In addition, it is shown that GDLs with the
   same porosity and the same pore size may have different fiber spacing
   and thus, distinct properties. It is found that the thermal conductivity
   models based solely upon porosity can be off by several hundred percent
   and must be either discarded or used over the narrow range of conditions
   under which they have been formulated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Large water-quality databases are valuable for predicting mine drainage

   water-quality data collected from 1971 to 1994 from many locations at a
   copper-molybdenum-gold-silver-rhenium mine site, we compared three
   imputation methods to estimate missing water-quality data: iterative
   robust model-based imputation (IRMI), multiple imputations of incomplete
   multivariate data (AMELIA), and sequential imputation for missing values
   (IMPSEQ). These methods were evaluated based on mean absolute error,
   relative absolute error, and percent bias techniques. The results showed
   that IMPSEQ and IRMI are suitable to impute missing values in
   water-quality databases at mine sites, whereas AMELIA is not.}},

Abstract = {{To date, to the best of the authors' knowledge, in almost all of the
   studies performed around the hemodynamics of bileaflet mechanical heart
   valves, a heart rate of 70-72beats/min has been considered. In fact, the
   heart rate of similar to 72beats/min does not represent the entire
   normal physiological conditions under which the aortic or prosthetic
   valves function. The heart rates of 120 or 50beats/min may lead to
   hemodynamic complications, such as plaque formation and/or
   thromboembolism in patients. In this study, the hemodynamic performance
   of the bileaflet mechanical heart valves in a wide range of normal and
   physiological heart rates, that is, 60-150beats/min, was studied in the
   opening phase. The model considered in this study was a St. Jude Medical
   bileaflet mechanical heart valve with the inner diameter of 27mm in the
   aortic position. The hemodynamics of the native valve and the St. Jude
   Medical valve were studied in a variety of heart rates in the opening
   phase and the results were carefully compared. The results indicate that
   peak values of the velocity profile downstream of the valve increase as
   heart rate increases, as well as the location of the maximum velocity
   changes with heart rate in the St. Jude Medical valve model. Also, the
   maximum values of shear stress and wall shear stresses downstream of the
   valve are proportional to heart rate in both models. Interestingly, the
   maximum shear stress and wall shear stress values in both models are in
   the same range when heart rate is <90beats/min; however, these values
   significantly increase in the St. Jude Medical valve model when heart
   rate is >90beats/min (up to similar to 40\% growth compared to that of
   the native valve). The findings of this study may be of importance in
   the hemodynamic performance of bileaflet mechanical heart valves. They
   may also play an important role in design improvement of conventional
   prosthetic heart valves and the design of the next generation of
   prosthetic valves, such as percutaneous valves.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the performance of the scaled largest eigenvalue
   (SLE) detector used for the detection of stationary time-series. We
   focus on a single-antenna setup and a blind detection scenario (neither
   the signal covariance, nor the noise variance are known). The SLE
   detector has received much attention in the context of cognitive radios
   (CR) due to its simplicity, good performance and robustness to noise
   level uncertainties. Specifically, our goal is to analyze the detector
   based on the statistic, where represent the ordered eigenvalues of the
   sample covariance matrix. We derive a large-sample-size closed-form
   approximation for the test statistic which allows us to derive its
   statistical distribution and set up the detector to achieve the required
   probability of false-alarm and probability of detection. We also study
   the robustness of the detector in the presence of noise uncertainty and
   impulsive- noise and investigate the benefits of the spatial sign filter
   for such scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Void characterization and porosity measurements of uncured and partially
   cured carbon/epoxy prepregs are challenging due to the soft nature of
   the matrix. If samples need to be cut from a larger laminate, the act of
   cutting and polishing can alter the void morphology. This paper presents
   a method to prepare samples for optical microscopy by infiltrating the
   pore space in the soft prepreg with a room-temperature curing
   low-viscosity resin to support the structure during cutting and
   polishing in preparation for optical microscopy. The methodology is
   validated by comparison with results obtained from porosity measurements
   using the ASTM D2734 standard density method. The paper also explores
   the use of thickness measurements to determine porosity. It is shown
   that thickness measurements can be used to estimate porosity for the
   no-bleed out-of-autoclave prepreg system used in the present study but
   that the accuracy is lower than using microscopy or density methods.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},

Volume = {{791}},
Pages = {{358-383}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the entrainment of liquid films on a partially wetting
   plate vertically withdrawn from a reservoir of viscous liquid using a
   combination of diffuse-interface numerical simulation and lubrication
   analysis. So far available theoretical investigations were commonly
   conducted by focusing on separate parameter regions, and a complete
   description of the flow regimes with increasing plate speed is still
   missing. By solving the full Stokes equations, we present a complete
   scenario of film transition in the presence of moving contact line. With
   increasing plate speed, we identify numerically four successive flow
   regimes in terms of the interfacial morphologies: (1) a stationary
   meniscus, (2) a speed-independent thick film connected to the liquid
   bath through a stationary dimple, (3) coexistence of a thick film and
   the classical Landau-Levich-Derjaguin (LLD) film connected by a
   propagating capillary shock and (4) a film with a monotonically varying
   thickness. The characteristics of the film profiles in different regions
   of the interfaces are analysed with lubrication theory as applicable,
   and satisfactory agreements with the numerical results are obtained. In
   particular, we confirm that the onset of film deposition occurs at a
   vanishing apparent contact angle, consistent with the predictions of
   lubrication theory. Numerical results suggest that the critical
   capillary number for the onset of film deposition is smaller than that
   for the onset of LLD film despite the fact that it is higher than the
   experimentally observed one, showing that the thick film can be realized
   in the two-dimensional model. We also demonstrated that the LLD film is
   triggered by the bifurcation of the stationary dimple, which is found to
   admit multiple branches of stable and unstable solutions.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical model for low-consistency repulping linking pulp material
   properties, consistency, temperature, and rotor and vat geometry is
   provided, which allows for accurate prediction of the time and energy
   required for repulping in both a 0.25 m(3) laboratory-scale repulper and
   a 15 m(3) industrial-scale repulper. The model assumes that all
   deflaking work is done by the repulper rotor in the rotor-swept volume
   by turbulence generated by the rotor and that no deflaking occurs in the
   rest of the vat. Rotor shaft power is split linearly between the breakup
   of waste paper and dissipation by turbulence. Comparing the model
   predictions and experimental data for different pulp types, vat fill
   levels, and pulp suspension consistencies yields a correlation of
   R-2=0.99 between all experimental results and the model predictions
   given the condition of fully turbulent (Reynolds-independent) repulper
   rotor operation. The efficiency of the laboratory repulper is reduced
   from that predicted by the model for very low vat fill levels. This is
   due to a loss of effectiveness of the baffles at these low levels as
   indicated by solid body motion of the suspension and reduced rotor power
   number. This indicates that thorough mixing is a requirement to maximize
   repulping efficiency. Repulping time and energy savings can be
   accomplished by increasing the suspension consistency and the
   rotor-swept volume/vat volume ratio by either increasing rotor size or
   reducing vat volume, all while ensuring complete mixing and circulation
   in the vat.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{128-141}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on constitutive and numerical modeling of strain-rate
   dependency in natural clays while also accounting for anisotropy and
   destructuration. For this purpose the SANICLAY model that accounts for
   the fabric anisotropy with the additional destructuration feature that
   accounts for sensitivity of natural clays, is considered as the
   reference model. An associated flow rule is adopted for simplicity. The
   model formulation is refined to also account for the important feature
   of strain-rate dependency using the Perzyna's overstress theory. The
   model is then implicitly integrated in finite element program PLAXIS.
   Performance of the developed and implemented model is explored by
   comparing the simulation results of several element tests and a boundary
   value problem to the available experimental data. The element tests
   include the constant strain-rate under one-dimensional and triaxial
   conditions on different clays. The boundary value problem includes a
   test embankment, namely embankment D constructed at Saint Alban, Quebec.
   For comparison, the test embankment is also analyzed using the Modified
   Cam-Clay (MCC) model, the SANICLAY model, and the viscoplastic model but
   without destructuration. Results demonstrate the success of the
   developed and implemented viscoplastic SANICLAY in reproducing the
   strain-rate dependent behavior of natural soft soils. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The use of vegetable oils can offer important environmental advantages
   with respect to biodegradability and renewability, along with good
   performance in a range of different applications. Unlike petroleum-based
   lubricants, which have been studied and developed over a century,

   work, the rheological properties of industrial canola-oil-based
   bio-lubricants were investigated using a rotary rheometer. The
   bio-hydraulic oil exhibited constant viscosity at both moderate and high
   shear rates, as well as shear thinning at low shear rates and
   temperatures less than 30?. Frequency sweep tests revealed significant
   viscoelasticity in the bio-hydraulic oil, which developed over time.
   Time dependence and structure recovery effects were also investigated.
   These experiments reveal some characteristic liquid crystal

   Walking speed and gait variability are shown to be affected by the

   Experiments are performed on a video data set from Surrey, British

   using computer vision. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess
   the quality of the selected features in improving the accuracy of the
   classification. Classification results show that the proposed approach
   is promising with around 80\% correct detection rate. This research can

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADHESION AND ADHESIVES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{33-40}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Glued-in rods are an increasingly used technical solution for numerous
   structural applications in timber engineering, and demonstrate the
   potential of adhesively bonded connections. During the insertion process
   the adhesive fills a very narrow gap over significant anchorage contact
   area, raising concerns that manufacturing defects may impact the
   structural performance of the bonded joint, namely the possible lack of
   adhesion resulting from inadequate preparation of the joint on site.
   Previous studies on the effect of bonding defects on the capacity of
   bonded joints identified a nuanced relationship that depends on the
   ductility of the adhesive.
   This paper presents experimental evidence that sheds light on the
   relationship between defects and capacity of glued timber joints. Joints
   composed of softwood glulam members and mild steel glued-in threaded
   rods were manufactured with two types of defects likely to be
   encountered on-site: i) rods placed at an angle inside drill hole
   instead of aligned with the joint axis, and ii) rod placed against the
   side of the drill hole instead of fully centered. To establish
   performance benchmarks a first phase studied the influence of the
   anchorage length and the rod diameter using three different adhesives.
   The effect of these defects on joint capacity was investigated with
   three different adhesives in combination with three different rod
   anchorage lengths. The investigations demonstrated that joints with
   sufficient rod anchorage (herein 10 times the rod diameter) do not
   exhibit a statistically significant loss of capacity, if compared to
   defect free joints. These results can contribute towards better
   understanding of the influence that the studied parameters have on the
   performance on timber joints with glued-in rods, as well as to translate
   this information to promote the development of further applications. (C)

Abstract = {{A theoretical study is presented of the flow of viscoplastic fluid
   through a Hele-Shaw cell that contains various kinds of obstructions.
   Circular and elliptical blockages of the cell are considered together
   with stepwise contractions or expansions in slot width, all within the
   simplifying approximation of a narrow gap. Specific attention is paid to
   the flow patterns that develop around the obstacles, particularly any
   stagnant plugged regions, and the asymptotic limits of relatively small
   or large yield stress. Periodic arrays of circular contractions or
   expansions are studied to explore the interference between obstructions.
   Finally, viscoplastic flow through a cell with randomly roughened walls
   is examined, and it is shown that constructive interference of local
   contractions and expansions leads to a pronounced chatmelization of the
   flow. An optimization algorithm based on minimization of the pressure
   drop is derived to construct the path of the channels in the limit of
   relatively large yield stress or, equivalently, relatively slow flow.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous online monitoring of rotating machines is necessary to assess
   real-time health conditions so as to enable early detection of operation
   problems and thus reduce the possibility of downtime. Rolling element
   bearings are crucial parts of many machines and there has been an
   increasing demand to find effective and reliable health monitoring
   technique and advanced signal processing to detect and diagnose the size
   and location of incipient defects. Condition monitoring of rolling
   element bearings, comprises four main stages which are, statistical
   analysis, fault diagnostics, defect size calculation, and prognostics.
   In this paper the effect of defect size, operating speed, and loading
   conditions on statistical parameters of acoustic emission (AE) signals,
   using design of experiment method (DOE), have been investigated to
   select the most sensitive parameters for diagnosing incipient faults and
   defect growth on rolling element bearings. A modified and effective
   signal processing algorithm is designed to diagnose localized defects on
   rolling element bearings components under different operating speeds,
   loadings, and defect sizes. The algorithm is based on optimizing the
   ratio of Kurtosis and Shannon entropy to obtain the optimal band pass
   filter utilizing wavelet packet transform (WPT) and envelope detection.
   Results show the superiority of the developed algorithm and its
   effectiveness in extracting bearing characteristic frequencies from the
   raw acoustic emission signals masked by background noise under different
   operating conditions. To experimentally measure the defect size on
   rolling element bearings using acoustic emission technique, the proposed
   method along with spectrum of squared Hilbert transform are performed
   under different rotating speeds, loading conditions, and defect sizes to
   measure the time difference between the double AE impulses. Measurement
   results show the power of the proposed method for experimentally
   measuring size of different fault shapes using acoustic emission
   signals. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A multi-criteria decision support model for evaluating the performance
   of partnerships}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{373-384}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Partnership is one of the strategies that could help companies increase
   their competiveness in a global market. Previous studies reported that a
   high percentage of partnerships fail to achieve their drivers of
   entering into partnership. The lack of a comprehensive partnership
   evaluation has been identified as one of the main reasons for
   partnership failure. In this paper, a multi-criteria decision support
   model is developed to evaluate the performance of an ongoing partnership
   in different periods based on the measures associated with the drivers
   for entering into the partnership. Interpretive Structural Modeling
   (ISM), Analytical Network Process (ANP) and Fuzzy Logic (FL) are used in
   order to address the interdependency, the importance of, and the
   uncertainty in performance measures, respectively. The outputs of the
   model are the importance of each performance measure and a single number
   for the overall partnership performance in each period, named as
   Partnership Performance Index (PPI) here. PPI is different from either
   mere financial or operational performance measures. PPI is a
   multi-dimensional measure which includes multiple performance measures
   associated with the partnership drivers and accounts for their
   importance and interdependencies. The model is applied to a partnership
   between a logging company and a sawmill in British Columbia, Canada. PPI
   is used to evaluate this partnership in three different periods. PPI
   values are compared to conventional measures for partnership evaluation
   and the managers confirmed that PPI values better represent the
   performance of their partnership. The sensitivity of the PPIs is
   investigated based on the changes in the importance as well as the value
   of the measures. The rankings from the model are compared to the ones
   estimated by the managers, and the results showed that the rankings are
   compatible. This model contributes to the literature by developing an
   index for partnership performance which captures partnership drivers and
   performance measures as well as their importance and interdependencies.

Abstract = {{Dual active bridge converters enable bidirectional power flow in buck
   and boost operating modes. This paper presents an advanced switching
   sequence and burst-mode strategy to balance conduction, switching, and
   magnetic losses under light, medium, and heavy loading conditions,
   leading to improved operating efficiency. The implementation of the
   switching sequence employs the natural state-plane trajectories of the
   converter and contributes to higher efficiency and the ability to
   perform burst mode. The proposed switching sequences improve the overall
   efficiency of the converter by enabling soft switching and adjusting the
   frequency to match the minimum RMS transformer current in the full
   operating range. Furthermore, it incorporates a fully controlled
   burst-mode switching sequence for light loading conditions to further
   extend the efficiency gains. As a result, maximum efficiency is obtained
   by taking advantage of all the possible switching structures of the
   converter. The analysis provides insight into the natural trajectories
   of the converter, which produce soft-switching transitions and enable
   the converter structures to achieve the target operating point directly.
   Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the
   benefits of the switching sequence and illustrate the burst-mode
   operation.}},

   electrostatics can cause bubble elongation in gas-fluidized beds.
   However, there was a lack of experimental evidence to test the numerical

   beds with two levels of charging. The results indicate that single
   bubbles are smaller and more elongated in a bed with higher charge
   density. Instability of bubble roofs for particles of high electrostatic
   charge density was also observed.
   The experimental results are in agreement with the previous simulation
   results, with uniform particle charge density in the lower part of the
   bed and differences in the upper part. New simulations allowing for
   spatial variation of charge density show that bubble shape and stability
   are functions of the particle charge density distribution. Differences
   between simulation and experimental results are likely due to
   non-uniform distribution of charge on particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional (2D) lattice gas automata model was developed to
   describe the behavior of flow and heat transfer around a heated
   stationary circular cylinder. To validate the feasibility of this model,
   heat transfer of a heated stationary circular cylinder, which is
   concentrically placed in a square enclosure, was simulated and compared
   with analytical results. Further investigations on flow and heat
   transfer past a heated stationary cylinder in a channel at Reynolds
   number of 100-200 were then carried out. The flow and heat
   characteristics were presented by streamlines and thermal nephograms.
   The dependences of drag coefficient and Nusselt number on the Reynolds
   number were further studied and compared to literature data. Simulation
   results of the heat transfer in the enclosure agree with the solution of
   the diffusive heat transfer equation. For the investigated Reynolds
   number range, time averaged drag coefficient decreases as Reynolds
   number increases, while Nusselt number increases with increasing
   Reynolds number. Reasonable agreements with previous investigations were
   achieved, demonstrating that the presented model provides an alternate
   method to simulate flow and heat transfer problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The influence of tar-containing synthesis gas (syngas) from a 2 MW
   biomass gasification plant on dense Pd and Pd-Ru composite membranes was
   investigated. A slip stream from the product gas was subjected to tar
   capture, removal and syngas scrubbing before entering a custom-made
   membrane test unit The concentration of hydrogen sulfide between the
   syngas scrubbing and membrane test unit was below the detection limit
   Tar sampling analysis showed a total tar concentration of 240 mg/m(3),
   with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons contributing more than half. The
   experimental test showed that there was appreciable influence of
   tar-free syngas on the permeabilities of both the Pd and Pd-Ru
   membranes. Inhibition of syngas containing 120 or 240 mg/m3 tar on the
   membranes resulted in a rapid decline in permeation flux. SEM and EDX
   analysis showed that surface organics blocked hydrogen adsorption and
   mass transfer in the membranes. FTIR spectra revealed that aromatic
   compounds such as naphthalene were most abundant in the surface
   contamination. Oxidation by air at high temperature partially restored
   the membrane permeability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Novel magnetically separable BiOBr/CoFe2O4 microspheres assembled from
   nanoparticles were successfully fabricated by a facile solvothermal
   method at 160 degrees C for 12 h. Then, BiOBr/CoFe2O4 microspheres were
   characterized via XRD, TEM, SEM, EDS and VSM. Congo red (CR) was
   selected as a pollutant model to evaluate the photocatalytic activities
   of BiOBr/CoFe2O4 microspheres. The value of coercivity (232 Oe) and the
   saturation magnetization (33.79 emu g(-1)) were obtained, which
   indicated that BiOBr/CoFe2O4 microspheres can be separated and recovered
   easily from the treated solution. What is more, by calculation, the
   initial rate constants of BiOBr/CoFe2O4 microspheres is about 1.45 times
   higher than that of the pure BiOBr, which resulted from superior
   adsorption and transfer performance to organic contaminants in aqueous
   systems. Four consecutive regeneration cycles demonstrated that the
   BiOBr/CoFe2O4 microspheres had high photostability under simulated solar
   light irradiation. According to the radical trapping experiments, the
   h(+) radicals and O-2(center dot-) radicals were the two main active
   species that drive the photocolorization of CR pollutant by
   BiOBr/CoFe2O4 microspheres under simulated solar light irradiation. This
   work suggests that the BiOBr/CoFe2O4 microspheres may be a promising
   photocatalyst for photodegrading organic pollutants and environmental
   remediation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: To investigate the physical properties and the hydration
   behaviour of the fast-setting bioceramic iRoot FS Fast Set Root Repair
   Material (iRoot FS) and three other endodontic cements.
   Methods: iRoot FS, Endosequence Root Repair Material Putty (ERRM Putty),
   gray and white mineral trioxide aggregate (G-MTA \& W-MTA), and
   intermediate restorative material (IRM) were evaluated. The setting time
   was measured using ANSI/ADA standards. Microhardness was evaluated using
   the Vickers indentation test. Compressive strength and porosity were
   investigated at 7 and 28 days. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
   was employed for the hydration test.
   Results: iRoot FS had the shortest setting time of the four bioceramic
   cements (p <.001). The microhardness values of iRoot FS, ERRM Putty and
   MTA increased at different rates over the 28 days period. At day one,
   ERRM Putty had the lowest microhardness of the bioceramic cements (p
   <.001), but reached the same level as MTA at 4, 7 and 28 days. The
   microhardness of iRoot FS was lower than that of W-MTA at 7 and 28 days
   (p <.05). The porosity of the materials did not change after 7 days (p
   <.05). The compressive strength values at 28 days were significantly
   greater for all bioceramic groups compared to those at 7 days (p <.01).
   ERRM Putty had the highest compressive strength and the lowest porosity
   of the evaluated bioceramic cements (p <.05), followed by iRoot FS,
   W-MTA, and G-MTA, respectively. DSC showed that iRoot FS hydrated
   fastest, inducing an intense exothermic reaction. The ERRM Putty did not
   demonstrate a clear exothermic peak during the isothermal calorimetry
   test.
   Conclusions: iRoot FS had a faster setting time and hydrating process
   than the other bioceramic cements tested. The mechanical properties of
   iRoot FS, G-MTA and W-MTA were relatively similar.}},

Abstract = {{Vertebral compression fractures can be successfully restored by
   injectable bone cements. Here the as-yet unexplored in vitro
   cytotoxicity, in vivo biodegradation, and osteoconductivity of a new
   calcium phosphate silicate cements (CPSC) are studied, where monocalcium
   phosphate (MCP; 5, 10, and 15 wt\%) is added to calcium silicate cement
   (CSC). Setting rate and compressive strength of CPSC decrease with the
   addition of MCP. The crystallinity, microstructure, and porosity of
   hardened CPSC are evaluated by X-ray diffractometer, Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy, and microcomputed tomography (CT). It is found
   that MCP reacts with calcium hydroxide, one of CSC hydration products,
   to precipitate apatite. While the reaction accelerates the hydration of
   CSC, the formation of calcium silicate hydrate gel is disturbed and
   highly porous microstructures form, resulting in weaker compressive
   strength. In vitro studies demonstrate that CPSC is noncytotoxic to
   osteoblast cells and promotes their proliferation. In the rabbit tibia
   implantation model, clinical X-ray and CT scans demonstrate that CPSC
   biodegrades slower and osseointegrates better than clinically used
   calcium phosphate cement (CPC). Histological studies demonstrate that
   CPSC is osteoconductive and induces higher bone formation than CPC, a
   finding that might warrant future clinical studies.}},

   response}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{A number of thin silicon films are deposited on crystalline silicon,
   native oxidized crystalline silicon, and optical quality fused quartz
   substrates through the use of ultra-high-vacuum evaporation at growth
   temperatures ranging from 98 to 572 degrees C. An analysis of their
   grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and Raman spectra indicates that a
   phase transition, from amorphous-to-crystalline, occurs as the growth
   temperature is increased. Through a peak decomposition process, applied
   to the Raman spectroscopy results, the crystalline volume fractions
   associated with these samples are plotted as a function of the growth
   temperature for the different substrates considered. It is noted that
   the samples grown on the crystalline silicon substrates have the lowest
   crystallanity onset temperature, whereas those grown on the optical
   quality fused quartz substrates have the highest crystallanity onset
   temperature; the samples grown on the native oxidized crystalline
   silicon substrates have a crystallanity onset temperature between these
   two limits. These resultant dependencies on the growth temperature
   provide a quantitative means of characterizing the
   amorphous-to-crystalline phase transition within these thin silicon
   films. It is noted that the thin silicon film grown on an optical
   quality fused quartz substrate at 572 degrees C, possessing an 83\%
   crystalline volume fraction, exhibits an optical absorption spectrum
   which is quite distinct from that associated with the other thin silicon
   films. We suggest that this is due to the onset of sufficient long-range
   order in the film for wave-vector conservation to apply, at least
   partially. Finally, we use a semi-classical optical absorption analysis
   to study how this phase transition, from amorphous-to-crystalline,
   impacts the spectral dependence of the optical absorption coefficient.

Abstract = {{Integrated sensing and biosensing microfluidic systems often require
   sealing between polysiloxane, glass, and gold interfaces, while
   maintaining functional support on the gold surface within the cell
   chamber (e.g., biomolecular interaction analysis). A carboxylated
   trimethoxysilane (TMS-EDTA) coating has been shown to facilitate the
   bonding of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to gold and glass slides. In this
   work, the adsorption of TMS-EDTA onto Au is characterized in order to
   enable its rational use in hybrid glass/gold substrates. Surface plasmon
   resonance results suggest that carboxylates are available for
   streptavidin immobilization. Atomic force microscopy studies indicate
   that a uniform surface coverage with monolayer thickness is formed.
   Infrared spectroscopy studies confirm that the carboxyl groups are
   present. Moreover, there is little evidence of siloxane cross-linking.
   Electrochemical differential capacitance measurements reveal that the
   potential-dependent free energies of adsorption are similar to-20 to -30
   kJ/mol (for potentials between -0.5 and 0.2 V) in the complex
   electrolyte solution used. Furthermore, at highly negative potentials
   (similar to-1.1 V), TMS-EDTA desorbs from the Au surface. The
   fundamental knowledge obtained about TMS-EDTA adsorption on Au can be
   applied to construct robust PDMS-based systems with hybrid glass/gold
   substrates.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic behavior of the anodic peak for amorphous nickel
   oxy/hydroxide (a-NiOx) films in basic media was investigated.
   Chronocoulometry of films with known nickel concentrations reveals that
   a total of four electrons per nickel site comprise the signature anodic
   peak at 1.32 V during the first oxidative scan, and two electrons are
   passed through the associated cathodic peak on the reverse scan. The
   anodic and cathodic signals each contain two electrons on the successive
   scans. Catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was detected within the
   anodic peak, which is at a lower potential than is widely assumed. In
   order to rationalize these experimental results, we propose that the
   four-electron oxidation event is the conversion of the film from
   nickel(II) hydroxide ({[}Ni-II-OH](-)) to a higher valent nickel
   peroxide species (e.g., Ni-IV-OO or Ni-III-OO.). The subsequent
   reduction of the nickel peroxide species is confined by a chemical step
   resulting in the accumulation of {[}Ni-II-OOH](-), which is then
   oxidized by two electrons to form Ni-IV-OO during the subsequent
   oxidative scan on the time scale of a cyclic voltammetric experiment.
   Our proposed mechanism and the experimental determination that each
   nickel site is oxidized by four electrons helps link the myriad of
   seemingly disparate literature data related to OER catalysis by nickel
   electrodes. The faster catalysis that occurs at higher oxidative
   potentials is derived from a minority species and is not elaborated
   here.}},

Title = {{Boosting the Transparency of Thin Layers by Coatings of Opposing
   Susceptibility: How Metals Help See Through Dielectrics}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{We propose a hypothesis that a very thin layer can be made more
   transparent by adding a thin coating with susceptibility of opposing
   sign. Two experimental tests backed by a theoretical model support this
   hypothesis. First, we show that the visible and near-infrared
   transmission through a semi-transparent silver film can be enhanced by
   up to similar to 70\% and spectrally tailored depending on the type and
   thickness of the dielectric coating. Material types explored as
   dielectric coating layers include conventional metal oxides (titanium
   dioxide) and lesser-explored elemental semiconductors (undoped silicon,
   p-type silicon, and germanium). Second, and more surprisingly, we show
   that coating a 50-nm-thick silicon nitride membrane with a 10-nm-thick
   silver layer can modestly enhance the transmission by up to 6 +/- 1\% in
   the blue part of the spectrum. Transmission enhancements are observed
   for three silver-coated membranes in different configurations. Thinner
   silver coatings are theoretically capable of enhancement factors greater
   than 10\%, but implementation is restricted by challenges in making
   smooth and continuous silver films below 10 nm in thickness. This study
   is important because it is the first demonstration of reciprocity with
   respect to the transmission enhancements achieved by combining thin
   metallic and dielectric layers.}},

Abstract = {{A novel nanowire-structured polypyrrole-cobalt composite, PPy-CTAB-Co,
   is successfully synthesized with a surfactant of cetyltrimethylammounium
   bromide (CTAB). As an electro-catalyst towards oxygen reduction reaction
   (ORR) in alkaline media, this PPy-CTAB-Co demonstrates a superior ORR
   performance when compared to that of granular PPy-Co catalyst and also a
   much better durability than the commercial 20 wt\% Pt/C catalyst.
   Physiochemical characterization indicates that the enhanced ORR
   performance of the nanowire PPy-CTAB-Co can be attributed to the high
   quantity of Co-pyridinic-N groups as ORR active sites and its large
   specific surface area which allows to expose more active sites for
   facilitating oxygen reduction reaction. It is expected this PPy-CTAB-Co
   would be a good candidate for alkaline fuel cell cathode catalyst.}},

Abstract = {{A series of poly(lactide) (PLA) samples, exhibiting various levels of
   syndiotactic enrichment, were formed via the ring-opening polymerization
   of meso-lactide using two families of dinuclear indium catalysts:
   (RR/RR)- {[} (NNO)InCl](2)(mu-Cl)(mu-OEt) (1) and
   (RR/RR)-{[}(ONNO)In(mu-OEt)](2) (2). Isotactic and heterotactic PLAs
   were also synthesized using known methodologies, and the thermal and
   rheological behaviors of these PLAs with different microstructures were
   compared. Solution theological studies showed that the values of
   intrinsic viscosities and hydrodynamic radii as functions of molecular
   weight (M-w) were highest for iso-PLAs, followed by hetero and then
   syndio-PLAs. The viscosities of the heterotactically enriched PLAs were
   in agreement with literature values reported for atactic PLAs. The
   molecular weight between entanglements (M-e) was greatest for the
   syndiotactically enriched PLAs, giving rise to the lowest zero-shear
   viscosity. hi addition, hetero- and isotactically enriched PLA had
   higher flow activation energies (E-a,E-flow) than syndiotactic variants,
   implying the inclusion of transient aggregate regions within these
   polymers due to enhanced L- and D-interactions. Although hardening was
   observed for all types of PLAs, it was more dominant for isotactic PLAs
   due to stronger L- and D-interactions possibly leading to a, small
   degree of stereocomplex microcrystallites.}},

Abstract = {{The drying of sessile nanofluid droplets on a surface can form various
   patterns and plays important role in micro and nano-manufacture
   technologies. In this paper, the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) approach
   based on the 2D Ising model is developed to simulate the drying process
   of a nanofluid droplet in a circular domain. In contrast to assuming a
   constant chemical potential in previous models, a chemical potential
   function dependent on time and the radius of the droplet is proposed.
   This model is used to investigate the formation of branched nanoparticle
   aggregates resulting from the drying of a nanofluid droplet. The
   predicted patterns from the drying droplet show a good agreement with
   the experiments. The distribution of particles and the shrinking of the
   contact line during the drying process, as well as the effects of the
   initial boundary chemical potential and the decrease rate of the
   chemical potential on the drying process have been investigated. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper employs a logistic regression technique to develop
   multivariate damage models. The models are intended for performance
   assessments that require the probability that structural components are
   in one of several damage states. As such, the developments represent an
   extension of the univariate fragility functions that are omnipresent in
   contemporary performance-based earthquake engineering. The multivariate
   logistic regression models that are put forward here eliminate several
   of the limitations of univariate fragility functions. Furthermore, the
   new models are readily substituted for existing fragility functions
   without any modifications to the existing performance-based analysis
   methodologies. To demonstrate the proposed modeling approach, a large
   number of tests of reinforced concrete shear walls are employed to
   develop multivariate damage models. It is observed that the drift ratio
   and aspect ratio of concrete shear walls are among the parameters that
   are most influential on the damage probabilities.}},

Title = {{Heat Transfer Impact of Synthetic Jets for Air-Cooled Array of Fins}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Free convection air cooling from a vertically placed heat sink is
   enhanced by upward concurrent pulsated air flow generated by mesoscale
   synthetic jets. The cooling enhancement is experimentally studied. An
   enhancement factor is introduced and defined as the ratio of convection
   heat transfer coefficients for jet-on (enhanced convection) to jet-off
   (natural convection) cooling conditions. To obtain the two coefficients,
   heat transfer by radiation is excluded. A high-resolution infrared (IR)
   camera is used to capture detailed local temperature distribution on the
   heat sink surface under both cooling conditions. Analysis is carried out
   to obtain local convection heat transfer coefficients based on measured
   local surface temperatures. The enhancement of convectional cooling by
   synthetic jets can be then quantified both locally and globally for the
   entire heat sink. Two categories of thermal tests are conducted. First,
   tests are conducted with a single jet to investigate the effects of jet
   placement and orifice size on cooling enhancement, while multiple jets
   are tested to understand how cooling performance changes with the number
   of jets. It is found that the cooling enhancement is considerably
   sensitive to jet placement. Jet flow directly blowing on fins provides
   more significant enhancement than blowing through the channel between
   fins. When using one jet, the enhancement ranges from 1.6 to 1.9 times.
   When multiple jets are used, the heat transfer enhancement increases
   from 3.3 times for using three jets to 4.8 times for using five jets.
   However, for practical thermal designs, increasing the number of jets
   increases the power consumption. Hence, a new parameter, ``jet impact
   factor (JIF),{''} is defined to quantify the enhancement contribution
   per jet. JIF is found to change with the number of jets. For example,
   the four-jet configuration shows higher JIF due to higher contribution
   per jet than both three-jet and five-jet configurations.}},

Abstract = {{The distinct superelastic properties and flag shape hysteresis of shape
   memory alloys (SMAs) make them an ideal candidate for the design and
   development of various structural components in civil infrastructure.
   Due to the fact that SMA reinforcement has significantly different
   properties than conventional steel, structures reinforced with SMA will
   behave differently. The design equations used for steel reinforced
   concrete structures are not applicable while using SMA as reinforcement
   in concrete. This study investigated the bond behavior of SMA rebars
   (with and without sand coating) in concrete using 56 pushout specimens.
   The test results are explored to evaluate the influence of concrete
   strength, bar diameter, embedment length, and surface condition. Surface
   modification using sand coating notably improved the bond strength of
   SMA rebar. Finally, empirical equation based on statistical analyses is
   presented to predict the maximum average bond strength. The proposed
   equation reasonably calculates the average bond strength of SMA
   reinforcing bars in concrete. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 The Institution

Abstract = {{Terminating an RF rectifier with an optimum load resistance is important
   to maximize the efficiency of converting RF power to dc power. The
   optimum load resistance can also vary significantly as a function of RF
   input power. Therefore, an adjustable load circuit that tracks changes
   in RF power is required to maximize efficiency. As a way of implementing
   an adjustable load circuit that can provide a regulated output voltage
   to power a host system, a two-stage power-conversion circuit is
   proposed. The first stage is a dc-to-dc discontinuous mode converter
   that is controlled by an input loop to regulate the load impedance
   presented to the RF rectifier. The analysis, design, and experimental
   results of the first stage adjustable load circuit with a tracking loop
   are described. The load is connected to a 985-MHz 10-W GaN Class-F RF
   rectifier and results with the load circuit are compared to the optimum

   programming}},
Journal = {{MECHATRONICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{71-83}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a scheme of evolutionary design optimization, which
   integrates modeling with bond graphs and optimization using genetic
   programming for multi-domain engineering systems, particularly
   mechatronic systems. The performance of the developed system is studied
   using both experimentation and simulation. During the evolutionary
   optimization, in addition to the desired response error, system
   complexity is also taken into account. For the experimental study, the
   method is implemented in an industrial fish processing machine at the
   Industrial Automation Laboratory of the University of British Columbia,
   and the obtained results for suggested design modifications are studied
   and tested. The drawbacks of the fitness calculation methodologies that
   are presented in literature are identified and improved fitness
   functions are developed for evolutionary design in the present work.
   While previous work has investigated the integration of bond graphs and
   genetic programming for designing an engineering system, the present
   work specifically addresses the application of the developed method for
   the design improvement of an industrial machine. The proposed method is
   applicable particularly to existing engineering systems, first because
   the initial model can be tested by comparing its simulated results with
   the corresponding results from the actual physical system, and second
   because the design improvements as suggested by the evolutionary design
   framework, which is developed in the present work, may be implemented
   and tested against the behavior of the corresponding model. (C) 2015

   two-finger underactuated hand}},
Journal = {{MECHATRONICS}},

Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{93-107}},

Abstract = {{Underactuated hands are able to achieve shape adaptation to conformally
   grasp a wide variety of objects, while keeping low undesirable hand
   attributes such as weight, size, complexity and cost. The available
   analytical and simulation studies of planar underactuated hands normally
   assume quasi-static conditions and a fixed object. In the present paper,
   a new quasi-dynamic analysis of the grasping process in the horizontal
   plane by a planar, two-finger, four-joint underactuated hand is
   presented. The study considers object movement during the grasping
   process, and also contact friction with a surface that supports the
   object. An extensive and versatile simulation program, based on the
   analysis, is developed to investigate the effects of various parameters
   of hand and object on the grasping process. A prototype hand has been
   developed and the simulation results are validated experimentally. An
   extensive and detailed study and optimization exercise is carried out
   using the developed simulation tool. Specifically, the study concerns a
   manipulative grasping process that moves the object to the hand
   centerline during the process. Important new findings on the influence
   of link dimensions, link angular speeds, friction with the supporting
   surface, object mass and object size on the grasping performance of the
   hand in this scenario are presented. The results are used to establish
   new design guidelines for the hand. In particular, the results indicate
   that in the case where there is limited information on the size and
   precise initial location of the object to be grasped, the optimal hand
   design would involve inner to outer phalange size ratios of
   approximately 3:1, and inner phalange joints that are very close to each
   other. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The cutting tool geometry is known to be an influential factor on damage
   induced during drilling of composite materials. Conversely, the geometry
   of the tool is affected under multiple drilling cycles due to highly

   quality of drilled woven carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP)
   laminates, given different tool wear conditions. Namely, a full
   factorial design of experiments has been conducted to quantify the
   significance of each process parameter (cutting velocity, feed rate and
   tool point angle), as well as their interactions, on the generation of
   entry-and exist-delaminations as well as the thrust force for different
   tool types. Finally, using a response surface methodology, a
   multi-objective optimization strategy has been presented to select
   optimum ranges of design parameters that can minimize the aforementioned
   output variables collectively. Such knowledge may be useful to explore
   further improvements toward defect-free drilling of woven CFRP

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Passive air-breathing microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a promising
   technology for energy recovery from wastewater and their performance is
   highly dependent on characteristics of the separator that isolates the
   anaerobic anode from the air-breathing cathode. The goal of the present
   work is to systematically study the separator characteristics and its
   effect on the performance of passive air-breathing flat-plate MFCs
   (FPMFCs). This was performed through characterization of structure,
   properties, and performance correlations of eight separators in Part 1
   of this work. Eight commercial separators were characterized, in
   non-inoculated and inoculated setups, and were examined in passive
   air-breathing FPMFCs with different electrode spacing. The results
   showed a decrease in the peak power density as the oxygen and ethanol
   mass transfer coefficients in the separators increased, due to the
   increase of mixed potentials especially at smaller electrode spacing.
   Increasing the electrode spacing was therefore desirable for the
   application of diaphragms. The highest peak power density was measured
   using Nafion((R))117 with minimal electrode spacing, whereas using
   Nafion((R))117 or Celgard((R)) with larger electrode spacing resulted in
   similar peak powers. Part 2 of this work focuses on numerical modelling
   of the FPMFCs based on mixed potential theory, implementing the
   experimental data from Part 1.}},

Abstract = {{The separator plays a key role on the performance of passive
   air-breathing flat-plate MFCs (FPMFC) as it isolates the anaerobic anode
   from the air-breathing cathode. The goal of the present work was to
   study the separator characteristics and its effect on the performance of
   passive air-breathing FPMFCs. This was performed partially through
   characterization of structure, properties, and performance correlations
   of eight separators presented in Part 1. Current work (Part 2) presents
   a numerical model developed based on the mixed potential theory to
   investigate the sensitivity of the electrode potentials and the power
   output to the separator characteristics. According to this numerical
   model, the decreased peak power results from an increase in the mass
   transfer coefficients of oxygen and ethanol, but mainly increasing mixed
   potentials at the anode by oxygen crossover. The model also indicates
   that the peak power is affected by the proton transport number of the
   separator, which affects the cathode pH. Anode pH, on the other hand,
   remains constant due to application of phosphate buffer solution as the
   electrolyte. Also according to this model, the peak power is not
   sensitive to the resistivity of the separator because of the
   overshadowing effect of the oxygen crossover.}},

Abstract = {{Electromechanical valve actuation (EVA) is an emerging technology that
   aims to optimize valve trains, allowing for significant improvements to
   engine performance, efficiency, and emissions. Recently, a simulation
   study introduced a novel cogging-torque-assisted motor-driven (CTAMD)
   valve actuation system. The actuator design emphasized a large output
   cogging torque that removed the need for conventional valve springs. The
   cogging torque developed by this actuator allows for highly efficient
   energy recovery that is superior to comparable systems that make use of
   mechanical springs. This paper experimentally validates the simulation
   study with a prototype actuator constructed using the specifications
   suggested in the previous simulation. The characterization procedure of
   the prototype is discussed and close agreement is found between the
   simulated and experimental motor parameters. Furthermore, this paper
   details a control system that minimizes Ohmic loss while providing fast
   transition times and low seating velocities. Finally, experimental
   results are displayed and compared to the simulated results as well as
   other EVA systems to validate the conjectured speed and efficiency of
   the CTAMD system.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In vivo endoscopic Raman spectroscopy of human tissue using a fiber
   optic probe has been previously demonstrated. However, there remain
   several technical challenges, such as a robust control over the laser
   radiation dose and measurement repeatability during endoscopy. A
   decrease in the signal to noise was also observed due to aging of Raman
   probe after repeated cycles of harsh reprocessing procedures. To address
   these issues, we designed and tested a disposable, biocompatible, and
   sterile sheath for use with a fiber optic endoscopic Raman probe. The
   sheath effectively controls contamination of Raman probes between
   procedures, greatly reduces turnaround time, and slows down the aging of
   the Raman probes. A small optical window fitted at the sheath cap
   maintained the measurement distance between Raman probe end and tissue
   surface. To ensure that the sheath caused a minimal amount of
   fluorescence and Raman interference, the optical properties of materials
   for the sheath, optical window, and bonding agent were studied. The
   easy-to-use sheath can be manufactured at a moderate cost. The sheath
   strictly enforced a maximum permissible exposure standard of the tissue
   by the laser and reduced the spectral variability by 1.5 to 8.5 times
   within the spectral measurement range. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{Accurate measurement of the moisture content of paper is essential in
   papermaking and is also important in some paper-based microfluidic
   devices. Traditional measurement techniques provide very limited
   spatiotemporal resolution and working range. This article presents a
   novel method for moisture content measurement whose operating principle
   is the strong correlation between the optical transparency of paper and
   its moisture content. Spectrographic and microscopic measurement
   techniques were employed to characterize the relation of moisture
   content and relative transparency of four types of paper: hardwood
   chemi-thermomechanical pulp paper, Northern bleached softwood kraft
   paper, unbleached softwood kraft paper, and General Electric (R) Whatman
   (TM) grade 1 chromatography paper. It was found that for all paper
   types, the paper transparency increased monotonically with the moisture
   content (as the ratio of the mass-of-water to the mass-of-dry-paper
   increased from 0\% to 120\%). This significant increase in relative
   transparency occurred due to the refractive index matching role of water
   in wet paper. It is further shown that mechanical loading of the paper
   has little impact on the relative transparency, for loadings that would
   be typical on a paper machine. The results of two transient water
   absorption experiments are presented that show the utility and accuracy
   of the technique. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Latency removal in the mechanical pulping process occurs in a continuous

   order to optimize the latency removal process and reduce the energy
   consumption in the operation, a kinetic study was carried out. In the
   study, the phenomenon of latency and knowledge related to latency
   removal were critically reviewed and discussed. Latency removal was
   characterized by the change of Canadian Standard Freeness (or freeness),
   and its dependences on treatment conditions, i.e., disintegration
   temperature, power input, pulp consistency and time, were determined.
   Kinetic models of latency removal for secondary refiner thermomechanical
   (TMP) and bleached chemithermomechanical (BCTMP) pulps have been
   developed, which were based on the rate of latency elimination
   characterized by the decrease of freeness.}},

Title = {{A denoising algorithm for projection measurements in cone-beam computed
   tomography}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{71-82}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The ability to reduce the radiation dose in computed tomography (CT) is
   limited by the excessive quantum noise present in the projection
   measurements. Sinogram denoising is, therefore, an essential step
   towards reconstructing high-quality images, especially in low-dose CT.
   Effective denoising requires accurate modeling of the photon statistics
   and of the prior knowledge about the characteristics of the projection
   measurements. This paper proposes an algorithm for denoising low-dose
   sinograms in cone beam CT. The proposed algorithm is based on minimizing
   a cost function that includes a measurement consistency term and two
   regularizations in terms of the gradient and the Hessian of the
   sinogram. This choice of the regularization is motivated by the nature
   of CT projections. We use a split Bregman algorithm to minimize the
   proposed cost function. We apply the algorithm on simulated and real
   cone-beam projections and compare the results with another algorithm
   based on bilateral filtering. Our experiments with simulated and real
   data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Denoising
   of the projections with the proposed algorithm leads to a significant
   reduction of the noise in the reconstructed images without oversmoothing
   the edges or introducing artifacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Processes for potassium extraction from abundant K-feldspar have
   recently attracted interest to ensure potash self-sufficiency for
   developing countries. Concurrently, distiller waste and soda residue
   formed in the ammonia-soda process (Solvay method) have resulted in
   serious pollution. A method of potassium extraction from K-feldspar with
   distiller waste and soda residue as additives is proposed. The effects
   of roasting temperature, particle size of K-feldspar and the amount of
   additive on potassium extraction for the K-feldspar-CaCl2-CaCO3 system
   were studied. The reaction kinetics of the system with mass ratios of
   K-feldspar (106-160 mu m) : CaCl2 : CaCO3 = 1 : 2 : 2 at 750-850 degrees
   C were modeled by the diffusion-based Ginstling-Brounshtein equation.
   The apparent activation energy was approximately 111 kJ.mol(-1). On the
   basis of the XRD and SEM-EDS analysis, two different reaction mechanisms
   were proposed below and above the melting point of CaCl2 (772 degrees
   C). A pilot test was carried out at a roasting temperature of 850
   degrees C and the recovery of potassium was approximately 82\%. The
   encouraging results obtained in the laboratory were replicated at the

Abstract = {{Quality of experience (QoE) and power consumption are two important
   considerations of OFDMA multicell networks. In this letter, we propose a
   fair QoE-based radio resource allocation (FQRA) for OFDMA multicell
   networks. Different from the previous work, the multiuser QoE per power
   consumption is introduced as the performance metric. A novel utility
   function, which can characterize the fairness of users' QoE and power
   consumption jointly, is proposed. Then a multiuser FQRA problem is
   formulated. Due to the nonconvex form of optimization, a two-step
   solution is devised in which the subchannel allocation and power
   allocation are performed iteratively. Simulation results show that our
   method can significantly improve the QoE per power consumption of cells
   and outperform the state-of-art schemes.}},

Abstract = {{In-vehicle communications are emerging to play an important role in the
   continued development of reliable and efficient X-by-Wire applications
   in new vehicles. Since vehicle devices, sensors, and the electronic
   control unit (ECU) are already connected to power wires, the advancement
   of power line communications (PLCs) can provide a very low cost and
   virtually free platform for in-vehicle communications. In this paper, we
   propose a medium access control (MAC) protocol for vehicular PLC
   systems, where multiple nodes are competing for transmission over the
   direct current (dc) power line. The proposed protocol uses a combination
   of time and frequency multiplexing and consists of two key features: 1)
   a distributed channel selection policy to arbitrate packet transmission
   across different channels and provide robustness against interference
   and noise and 2) a distributed collision resolution algorithm to allow
   efficient nodes completion over selected channels. Specifically, the
   collision resolution algorithm is optimized with respect to the channel
   policy such that the success probability of transmission in each channel
   is maximized. Numerical results are also supplemented to validate the
   performance of the proposed protocol and provide useful guidelines for
   developing a robust contention-based MAC protocol for vehicular PLC
   systems.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the robust transceiver design for a multi-hop
   full-duplex decode-and-forward (DF) relay system employing
   single-carrier transmission with frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE).
   We take into account the effect of imperfect channel state information
   (CSI) where the CSI errors are modeled as Gaussian random variables with
   known statistics. The design of the precoding at the transmitter and the
   equalization at the receiver is formulated as an optimization problem
   with the objective to minimize two relevant performance metrics, namely,
   the sum mean-square error (MSE) and the maximum MSE across the different
   hops, subject to separate transmit power constraints for the nodes. We
   show that the equalization filters can be optimized individually at the
   receiving nodes and take the form of robust Wiener filters. However, due
   to the loopback/backward interference, the transmit signals in the
   different hops are coupled and the transmit precoding problem leads to a
   nonconvex power allocation problem in the frequency domain. To find the
   optimal power allocation, we first employ a sequential geometric
   programming (sGP) approach, which uses the condensation technique to
   transform the objective function into a posynomial and then solves a
   sequence of standard GP problems. The sGP approach requires global
   channel knowledge at a central node and the involved subproblems admit
   only numerical solutions. To gain further insight into the structure of
   the problem, we also consider an alternating optimization (AO) approach
   for power allocation where convex programming problems and difference of
   convex programming problems are solved in an alternating manner. The
   resulting AO algorithm admits closed-form solutions in each iteration
   step and requires less signaling overhead compared to the centralized
   sGP scheme. Numerical results for the MSEs and achievable rates of the
   proposed robust schemes are provided, showing that the proposed sGP and
   AO algorithms yield significant performance gains compared to
   conventional half-duplex relay systems and nonrobust full-duplex
   designs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate a multiuser MIMO downlink with imperfect
   channel state information (CSI) from the physical-layer security
   provision. In a classical transmitter (Alice)-legitimate receiver
   (Bob)-eavesdropper (Eve) model using artificial noise to disturb Eve's
   reception, we consider a general scenario where all nodes are equipped
   with multiple antennas, and Bob's CSI is acquired by pilot-assisted
   channel estimation. For designing the secure transmit beamforming, we
   utilize random matrix quantization (RMQ) to quantize Bob's channel
   estimate, and then Bob feeds it back to Alice. Due to the effects of
   imperfect CSI at Alice, the secrecy performance is upper bounded in the
   high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions. In order to avoid the
   interference-limited phenomenon, we present a scaled strategy for the
   secrecy system utilizing derived upper bound on the secrecy rate loss.
   Moreover, it is shown that our derived results can be easily extended to
   a special case where both legitimate and eavesdropping receivers equip a
   single antenna each, where random vector quantization (RVQ) is utilized
   instead. By employing our proposed feedback strategy, the secrecy rate
   increases with transmit power, and the certain secrecy requirement can
   be guaranteed.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient waste treatment strategy should be cost-effective and,
   minimize potential impacts on various stakeholders and the environment.
   This study proposes a decision framework that can model the
   stakeholder's conflicting priorities over the sustainability criteria,
   when selecting a municipal solid waste treatment option. The proposed
   framework compares life cycle sustainability impacts of selected options
   and develops a weighing scheme for combining impacts based on
   stakeholders' preferences. It then uses game theory to help the
   stakeholders fairly share the costs and benefits, and guides the
   stakeholders to reach an agreement on a mutually sustainable and
   pragmatic solution. In this study, the application of the framework to
   select a waste-to-energy technology for Vancouver, Canada is
   demonstrated. The case study discusses the prospect of producing
   refuse-derived fuel by cement industry and the municipality. Results
   show that the cement industry and the municipality may mutually benefit
   from the refuse derived fuel, if the industry pays a tipping fee of
   \$0.077-0.96 per kg waste to access the required amount of solid waste
   from the municipality. The outcome of the framework can help in the
   approval and application of an overall sustainable option by both
   stakeholders and in making the negotiation more efficient and timely.

Abstract = {{Open MRI in functional positions has potential to directly and
   non-invasively assess cam femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). Our
   objective was to investigate whether open MRI can depict intrusion of
   the cam deformity into the intra-articular joint space, and whether
   intrusion is associated with elevated acetabular contact force. Cadaver
   hips (9 cam; 3 controls) were positioned in an anterior impingement
   posture and imaged using open MRI with multi-planar reformatting. The
   -angle (describing clearance between the femoral neck and acetabulum)
   was measured around the entire circumference of the femoral neck. We
   defined a binary MRI cam-intrusion sign (positive if <0 degrees). We
   then instrumented each hip with a piezoresistive sensor and conducted
   six repeated positioning trials, measuring acetabular contact force (F).
   We defined a binary contact-force sign (positive if F>20N). Cam hips
   were more likely than controls to have both a positive MRI cam-intrusion
   sign (p=0.0182, Fisher's exact test) and positive contact-force sign
   (p=0.0083), which represents direct experimental evidence for cam
   intrusion. There was also a relationship between the MRI cam-intrusion
   sign and contact-force sign (p=0.033), representing a link between
   imaging and mechanics. Our findings indicate that open MRI has
   significant potential for in vivo investigation of the cam FAI
   mechanism. (c) 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley

Abstract = {{Recently, distributed order systems as a generalized concept of
   fractional order have been a major focus in science and engineering
   areas, and have rapidly extended application across a wide range of
   disciplines. However, only a few numerical methods are available for
   analyzing the distributed order systems. This paper proposes a novel
   numerical scheme to analyze the behavior of single input single output
   linear systems in the time domain with a single distributed order
   differentiator/integrator by using operational matrix technique. The
   proposed method reduces different analysis problems to a system of
   algebraic equations by using block pulse functions, which makes it easy
   to handle an arbitrary input. Numerical examples were used to illustrate
   the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed method. The
   proposed method was found to be an efficient tool for analyzing linear
   distributed order systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Substantial amount of glass wastes are being generated all around the
   world. In most cases, they end up in the landfill without considering
   recycling option. Since it is an inert material, they occupy the
   landfill space for considerable amount of time unless there is a
   potential for recycling. Such glass wastes in the crushed form have a
   good potential in the infrastructure industry. In this research we
   investigate the possibility of utilizing recycled glass powder (RGP) in
   along with supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), such as fly ash
   (FA) and silica fume (SF) as partial replacements of cement. The
   physical and mechanical properties of fresh and hardened cement mortar
   with such combinations are investigated. In order to improve the
   physical and mechanical properties of hardened mortar, styrene butadiene
   rubber (SBR) was also added in the mortar mix. The result shows that the
   addition of fine RGP, FA and SF significantly improved the bond between
   the SBR and cement matrix which leads to an increase in the compressive
   and flexural strengths. Moreover, the addition of RGP, SF and FA
   considerably reduced the alkali silica reaction (ASR) expansions,
   percentage of water absorption, and the rate of water absorption than
   those of the control mix. This study shows that the RGP can be
   successfully utilized as an effective mineral admixture in cement mortar
   with 25\% optimal replacement of cement. Crown Copyright (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this paper, the design of a low-power low-noise readout circuit for
   cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe or CZT) detectors is presented. Such
   sensors are used in a variety of applications, including medical
   imaging, security, and astrophysics. The readout circuit includes a
   charge-sensitive amplifier (CSA), a reset network to accommodate the
   leakage current of the detector, and a first-order pulse shaper with a
   pole-zero cancellation circuit. The CSA has two gain settings for 0-5-
   and 5-45-fC injected charge, and the pulse shaper is designed to provide
   four different shaping times. The discharge time constant of the CSA can
   also be adjusted to accommodate various event rates. Furthermore, a
   comprehensive noise analysis of the readout system is presented. To
   facilitate the noise analysis, the equivalent noise charge (ENC)
   equations are derived analytically. The optimization of the noise
   performance of the front-end circuit is also discussed. The
   application-specific integrated circuit is fabricated in a 0.13-mu m
   CMOS process. For a detector capacitance of 250 fF, the measured ENC
   varies from 66 to 101 (e) over bar -rms depending on the peaking time.
   The measured power consumption of the readout circuit is just under 1 mW
   from a 1.2 V supply.}},

Abstract = {{Goal: We present a novel ``pick-up{''} ultrasound transducer for
   intraabdominal robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. Such a
   ``pick-up{''} ultrasound transducer is inserted through an abdominal
   incision at the beginning of the procedure and remains in the abdominal
   cavity throughout, eliminating the need for a dedicated port or a
   patient bedside surgical assistant. The transducer has a handle that can
   be grasped in a repeatable manner using a da Vinci Prograsp tool,
   allowing the transducer to be accurately manipulated by the surgeon
   using the da Vinci Robot. This is one way to enable 3-D tracking of the
   transducer, and, thus, mapping of the vasculature. The 3-D vascular
   images can be used to register preoperative CT to intraoperative camera
   images. Methods: To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we use
   an ultrasound vessel phantom to register a CT surface model to extracted
   ultrasound vessel models. The 3-D vascular phantom images are generated
   by segmenting B-mode images and tracking the pick-up ultrasound
   transducer with the da Vinci kinematics, internal electromagnetic
   sensor, or visible fiducials suitable for camera tracking. Results:
   Reconstruction results using da Vinci kinematics for tracking give a
   target registration error of 5.4 +/- 1.7 mm.}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes a method to measure, model and compensate both
   geometrically dependent and independent volumetric errors of five-axis,

   all 5 axes are represented by error motion twists. The component errors
   of translational drives have been measured with a laser interferometer,
   and the errors of two rotary drives have been identified with ballbar
   measurements. The complete volumetric error model of a five-axis machine
   has been modeled in the machine's coordinate system and proven
   experimentally. The volumetric errors are mapped to the part coordinates
   along the tool path, and compensated using the kinematic model of the
   machine. The compensation strategy has been demonstrated on a five-axis
   machine tool controlled by an industrial CNC with a limited freedom, as
   well as by a Virtual CNC which allows the incorporation of compensating
   all 41 errors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence
   and mode of WaveOne (Dentsply Tulsa Dental Specialties, Tulsa, OK)
   instrument defects after single use at different endodontic clinics.
   Methods: A total of 438 WaveOne instruments were collected after
   clinical use from the 4 specialist clinics over a 12 month period and
   from 1 graduate program over a 20-month period. The incidence and type
   of instrument defects were analyzed. The lateral surfaces of part of the
   defective instruments and fracture surfaces of fractured files were
   examined using scanning electron microscopy. Unused and clinically used
   files were examined by a nanoindentation test. Results: Of the 438
   WaveOne instruments collected, 42 (9.6\%) had defects: 40 (9.1\%) were
   distorted and 2 (0.5\%) files had fractured, 1 Small and 1 Primary file.
   Clear differences in the frequency of defects were found among the 3
   file sizes; the occurrence of distortion and fracture were highest with
   the Small file (21.2\% and 0.7\%, respectively) followed by the Primary
   file (4.4\% and 0.4\%, respectively) (P < .05). No defects were detected
   on the Large file. The cause of the 2 fractures was shear stress.
   Instruments from various clinics showed no significantly different
   occurrence of instrument deformation. Unwinding occurred at 1.2-3.1 mm
   from the tip. No significant difference in nanohardness was detected
   among unused and used instruments. Conclusions: The risk of used
   fracture is very low when files are singly used by endodontists and
   residents. Unwinding of the files occurred most frequently in the Small
   file. The frequency of defects of WaveOne instruments were not
   influenced by the operator.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with sleep disordered breathing (SDB) can experience changes
   in automatic cardiac regulation as a result of frequent sleep
   fragmentation and disturbance in normal respiration and oxygenation that
   accompany most apnea/hypopnea events. In adults, these changes are
   reflected in enhanced sympathetic and reduced parasympathetic activity.
   In this study, we examined the autonomic cardiac regulation in children
   with and without SDB, through spectral and detrended fluctuation
   analysis (DFA) of pulse rate variability (PRV). PRV was measured from
   pulse-to-pulse intervals (PPIs) of the photoplethysmogram (PPG) recorded
   from 160 children using the Phone Oximeter (TM) in the standard setting
   of overnight polysomnography. Spectral analysis of PRV showed the
   cardiac parasympathetic index (high frequency, HF) was lower (p < 0.01)
   and cardiac sympathetic indices (low frequency, LF and LF/HF ratio) were
   higher (p < 0.01) during apnea/hypopnea events for more than 95\% of
   children with SDB. DFA showed the short- and long-range fluctuations of
   heart rate were more strongly correlated in children with SDB compared
   to children without SDB. These findings confirm that the analysis of the
   PPG recorded using the Phone Oximeter (TM) could be the basis for a new
   screening tool for assessing PRV in non-clinical environment.}},

Abstract = {{The reuse of air added for gas sparging to airlift return activated
   sludge (RAS) in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) was investigated. Numerical
   modeling suggests that the RAS conveyance requirements in an MBR could
   be met for systems with a treatment capacity of 3.810(6)Ld(-1), and
   potentially for larger MBRs, depending on the system design (i.e.,
   U-shaped rather than linear systems). Pilot scale validation confirmed
   that airlift could be used to meet the RAS conveyance requirements.
   Optimal conditions were obtained for pilot scale systems with square air
   collectors, intermediate/large air collector angles, greater depth of
   submergence and individual tubing to redirect the airlifted flow.
   Implementation of airlift RAS conveyance in small to intermediate size
   MBRs can results in a reduction of approximately 20\% in operating
   costs.}},

Abstract = {{A recently developed novel nanofiber-based strain sensor is introduced
   as a potential alternative to the conventional measurement tools for
   heart beat rate monitoring. Since the measured signals in real life are
   often contaminated by certain artifacts, in this paper, to overcome
   limitations of currently available empirical mode decomposing (EMD) and
   blind source separation-based methods and recover the buried heart beat
   signal accurately, we propose a novel blind source separation framework
   by combining noise-assisted multivariate EMD (NAMEMD) and multiset
   canonical correlation analysis (MCCA). The proposed method takes
   advantage of the multivariate data-adaptive nature of the NAMEMD and
   MCCA, which contributes to accurate extraction of the desired signal.
   The absolute correlation coefficients (ACCs) between the extracted
   signal and the original source signal are adopted to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed method in the simulation study. The average
   of the ACC yielded by the proposed method is 0.902, which is
   significantly higher than that by the state-of-the-art approaches. We
   also examine the proposed method on the nanosensor data collected when
   the subject performs 11 tasks. It is shown that the proposed method can
   achieve better performance, especially for preserving the shape of the
   heart beat signal.}},

Abstract = {{The properties and impacts of aggregated aerosol particles (i.e., soot,
   metal oxide fumes) depend on their morphology, as characterized by
   fractal dimension, prefactor, and primary particle diameter. The
   morphology may be measured directly by time-consuming ex situ microscopy
   or rapid but indirect in situ methods. Previously, it was found that
   particle mass and mobility measurements could be used for the estimation
   of the primary particle diameter of zirconia aggregates, using plausible
   assumptions related to the fractal structure (specifically, prefactor
   k(a) and exponent D-alpha). Since the formation and growth of zirconia
   aggregates are different from carbon soot, here we compare primary
   particle diameters measured directly from transmission electron
   microscopy analysis of soot particles with the diameters estimated from
   mass-mobility measurements. Performing extensive measurements on soot
   emissions from two reciprocating engines over a range of operating
   conditions, we found that there are no universal values of k(a) and
   D-alpha that can be used for all conditions. However, new optimized
   values of k(a) and D-alpha are estimated here for soot particles. The
   variation of the primary particle diameter with particle size is also
   taken into consideration and is shown to be essential to obtain
   physically realistic results. Using optimized values of k(a) and
   D-alpha, the average primary particle sizing error is reduced for all
   soot types. This suggests that with some calibration, in situ sizing of
   the primary particle diameter, using mass and mobility measurements, can
   provide useful accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Formed from a reciprocal translocation t(9:22)(q34;q11) of genetic
   material between the long arms of human chromosomes 9 and 22, the
   constitutively active breakpoint cluster region (BCR) Abelson 1 (ABL)
   tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL is known to be causative of chronic myelogenous
   leukemia (CML). In 98 \% of CML patients harboring the t(9:22)(q34;q11)
   translocation, known as the Philadelphia chromosome, the chimeric
   BCR-ABL oncogene is created through cleavage of the BCR gene within its
   major breakpoint region (M-BCR) and breakage of the ABL gene within a
   100-kbp region downstream of exon 2a. Clinical detection of the fused
   BCR-ABL oncogene currently relies on direct visualization by
   fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), a relatively tedious assay
   that typically offers a detection limit of ca. 2 \%. Here, we describe a
   novel assay that uses droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) technology to reliably
   measure M-BCR status and the presence of BCR-ABL. When applied to
   cell-line models of CML, the assay accurately quantifies BCR-ABL
   frequency to a detection limit of 0.25 \%. It therefore offers improved
   specificity relative to FISH, and may allow identification of variant
   translocation patterns, including derivative chromosome 9 deletions.}},

Abstract = {{The scalable extension of HEVC (known as SHVC), the recent scalable
   video coding standard, results in an improved compression performance at
   the cost of significant increase in computational coding complexity. One
   of the main factors that contribute to the SHVC encoder complexity is
   choosing the best partitioning structure for the coding tree units
   (CTUs). Our study focuses on developing a scheme for predicting the CTU
   structure in the quality and spatial scalable extension of HEVC. The
   proposed scheme uses the CTU partitioning structure of the already
   encoded CTUs in the enhancement layers (ELs) and base layer (BL) to
   predict the coding unit sizes of the to-be-encoded CTUs in the EL.
   Performance evaluations confirm that our proposed complexity reduction
   scheme significantly reduces the execution time of the SHVC encoder,
   while maintaining the overall quality of the coded streams.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an enhanced mathematical model for transient
   thermal analysis in machining processes. The proposed mathematical model
   is able to simulate transient tool, workpiece, and chip temperature
   fields as a function of time for interrupted processes with time varying
   chip loads such as milling and continuous machining processes such as
   turning and drilling. A finite difference technique with implicit time
   discretization is used for the solution of partial differential
   equations to simulate the temperature fields on the tool, workpiece, and
   chip. The model validations are performed with the experimental
   temperature measurement data available in the literature for the
   interrupted turning of Ti6Al6V-2Sn, Al2024, gray cast iron and for the
   milling of Ti6Al4V. The simulation results and experimental measurements
   agree well. With the newly introduced modeling approach, it is
   demonstrated that time-dependent dynamic variations of the temperature
   fields are predicted with maximum 12\% difference in the validated cases
   by the proposed transient thermal model.}},

Abstract = {{Despite successful implantation of St. Jude Medical bileaflet mechanical
   heart valves, red blood cell lysis and thrombogenic complications
   associated with these types of valves are yet to be addressed. In our
   previous study, we proposed an elliptic housing where 10\% ovality was
   applied to the housing of St. Jude Medical valves. Our preliminary
   results suggested that the overall hemodynamic performance of St. Jude
   Medical valves improved in both the closing and opening phases. In this
   study, we evaluated the hemodynamics around the leaflets in the opening
   phase using a more sophisticated computational platform, computational
   fluid dynamics. Results suggested both lower shear stress and wall shear
   stress values and an overall improved hemodynamic performance in the
   proposed design. This improvement is characterized by lower values of
   shear stress and wall shear stress in the regions downstream of the
   leaflets, lower pressure drop across the valve and smaller recirculation
   zones in the sinuses areas. The proposed design may open a new chapter
   in the concept of design and hemodynamic improvement of the next
   generation of mechanical heart valves.}},

Abstract = {{The formation potential of carbonaceous and nitrogenous disinfection
   by-products (C-DBPs, N-DBPs) after ion exchange treatment (IEX) of three
   different water types in multiple consecutive loading cycles was
   investigated. Liquid chromatography with organic carbon detector
   (LC-OCD) was employed to gauge the impact of LEX on different natural
   organic matter (NOM) fractions and data obtained were used to correlate
   these changes to DBPs Formation Potential (FP) under chlorination. Humic
   (-like) substances fractions of NOM were mainly targeted by ion exchange
   resins (40-67\% removal), whereas hydrophilic, non-ionic fractions such
   as neutrals and building blocks were poorly removed during the treatment
   (12-33\% removal). Application of ion exchange resins removed 13-20\% of
   total carbonaceous DBPs FP and 3-50\% of total nitrogenous DBPs FP.
   Effect of the inorganic nitrogen (i.e., Nitrate) presence on N-DBPs FP
   was insignificant while the presence of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON)
   was found to be a key parameter affecting the formation of N-DBPs. DON
   especially the portion affiliated with humic substances fraction, was
   reduced effectively (similar to 77\%) as a result of IEX treatment. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach in multidisciplinary design of
   mechatronic systems, using an inductive genetic programming (IGP) along
   with a bond graph modeling tool (BG). The proposed design algorithm
   dynamically explores the space of finding optimal design solutions
   through utilizing two navigated steps for simultaneous optimization of
   both topology and parameters. In the first step, an IGP tool is applied
   on the bond graph embryo model of the system for topology synthesis. In
   the second step, an optimization tool that incorporates an artificial
   immune system (AIS) is implemented for optimization of the parameter
   values. A supervisory loop statistically analyzes the efficiency of the
   different mechatronic elements in improving the system's performance. By
   acquiring knowledge and learning from prior trials, the evolution
   parameters are automatically and dynamically adjusted, with the aim to
   achieve more efficient evolution progress. The developed method is
   practically compared with an available bond graph-genetic programming
   (BGGP) method via designing an aerospace engine mount system. Results
   show that more navigated and accurate design results are acquired from
   the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Axial flows over cylinders are frequently encountered in practice, e.g.

   closed-form relationships are developed for heat transfer coefficients

   cylinders from one row to another while assuming the same temperature
   for all the cylinders in each row. The model could well capture several
   sets of numerical data, which can be regarded as excellent in light of
   the simplicity and comprehensiveness of the model. The compact and
   accurate formulae developed in this work can be readily employed, and
   also implemented into any software or tools, for the estimation of Nu in

Pages = {{24-33}},

Abstract = {{During mechanical activation, disorder in the crystal structure of
   olivine has been recognized as one of the most important factors for
   enhancing the reaction rate of downstream carbonation processes. This
   paper investigates the detailed microstructure of olivine after
   mechanical activation in a SPEX 8000 mill using the X-ray diffraction
   technique. In order to successfully extract information from the
   microstructure using X-ray diffraction patterns, various models were
   applied and compared, including the Scherrer method, Williamson-Hall
   method, Multiple Whole Profile fitting method, and Rietveld method.
   Results show that with 120 min of milling, the media particle size
   initially decreased dramatically, and then increased slightly, the BET
   surface area and amorphization degree increased, the lattice was
   initially compressed and then expended, the crystallite sizes decreased,
   and strains increased. The strain value for 120-min
   mechanically-activated olivine, calculated by the Scherrer method,
   Williamson-Hall method, Rietveld method, and MWP method, was 2.15 x
   10(-3), 1.64 x 10(-3), 0.73 x 10(-3), and 0.28 x 10(-3), respectively.
   The Rietveld method was found to be the most accurate method and
   therefore most suitable method for characterizing the microstructure of
   olivine and mine waste materials containing olivine. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A key feature of the smart grid is the introduction of two-way data
   communications into the power grid. This brings many security
   challenges, because of the large-scale, difficult-to-secure environment,
   complexity of smart grid systems, and resource limitations of the smart
   grid deployments. In this paper, we focus on security and privacy
   concerns in the context of the smart grid. Existing security mechanisms
   developed for traditional information technology systems can be used as
   a basis for designing security measures for the smart grid. However, new
   methods that meet the special requirements and characteristics of the
   smart grid are also required. In spite of the obstacles against
   developing detailed security solutions for the future smart grid, such
   as uncertainty of the architecture and lack of practical experiences
   with security attacks, some research has been performed in this area
   over the last few years. We survey the existing literature on different

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in algorithms for computed tomography (CT)
   reconstruction from a small number of projection measurements. In this
   paper, we propose an algorithm that is based on variance-reduced
   stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Variance-reduced SGD methods are a
   new class of stochastic optimization algorithms that have proved highly
   successful in solving large-scale optimization problems. These
   algorithms store a copy of the full gradient direction or stochastic
   gradient directions and use them in building update directions. We
   propose an algorithm for CT image reconstruction that starts off with
   variance-reduced SGD updates and gradually increases the batch size. As
   the algorithm approaches the solution and the batch size grows, the
   algorithm turns into a limited-memory quasi-Newton algorithm to exploit
   the curvature information in the vicinity of the solution. We apply the
   proposed algorithm on simulated and real cone-beam CT projections and
   compare it with several other algorithms. Our results show that the
   proposed algorithm is very fast and is able to reconstruct very
   high-quality images in a small number of iterations.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the thermal nitridation effects on phosphorus (P)
   diffusion in strained Si1-x Ge (x) and strained Si1-x Ge (x) :C (y) with
   up to 18 \% germanium and 0.09 \% carbon. P diffusivities under thermal
   nitridation (vacancy injection) and effective inert condition were
   compared. The results show that thermal nitridation can retard P
   diffusion in SiGe, but the effectiveness of this retardation method
   decreases with the increasing Ge and C content. When 0.06 and 0.09 \%
   carbon are present in Si0.82Ge0.18, thermal nitridation slightly
   increases P diffusivity compared to the inert condition. The Ge
   dependence can be explained by the increasing contribution from the
   vacancy-assisted mechanism for P diffusion in strained SiGe with the
   increasing Ge content. In terms of interstitial undersaturation ratio in
   Si0.82Ge0.18, thermal nitridation can further decrease by 31-53 \% on

Title = {{Influence of Changing Casing Groove Parameters on the Performance of
   Centrifugal Compressors Near Stall Condition}},

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The casing treatment is an effective method for increasing the stall
   margin of compressors and enhancing the flow distribution at the blades
   tip. The present numerical study focuses on making an optimization of
   the casing groove parameters which can enhance the centrifugal
   compressor performance during stall. The casing grooves parameters
   considered are the groove cross section aspect ratio (the groove height
   to width ratio), groove location, and the number of grooves. Five groove
   aspect ratios were considered ranging from 0.2 to 1.8. Three groove
   locations were studied: at full blades leading edge, at splitter blades
   leading edge, and after the splitter blades leading edge by a distance
   equals to the distance between the first and second groove locations.
   Comparisons were made among different cases with number of grooves
   starting from one up to seven grooves located at the most effective
   locations and have the optimum cross section dimensions as deduced from
   the results of the groove aspect ratio and groove location optimization.
   Results showed that by using groove aspect ratio less than one, the
   reinjected groove flow is relatively weak but when the aspect ratio is
   equal to one, there is enough space inside the groove for the flow to
   circulate and generate the reinjected groove flow with higher
   velocities. When the groove aspect ratio was increased to be more than
   one, the reinjected flow velocity was increased slightly and its
   effective area was increased in the circumferential direction. Results
   also indicated that the best location for the groove is at the full
   blades leading edge because the stall area can be minimized and
   controlled in a better way comparing with the other groove locations.
   Results showed that by increasing the number of grooves, the surge
   margin (SM) increases and the isentropic efficiency decreases, but the
   stall area at the shroud surface decreases in size and its location is
   shifted toward the blades trailing edge.}},

Abstract = {{Solid additives were used as a microwave absorber to improve the low
   microwave absorption rate of switchgrass going through pyrolysis, and as
   a catalyst to improve the bio-oil and biochar characteristics. The
   synergistic effects were manifested in the presence of a mixture of

   resulting in increased microwave absorption rate, and improved bio-oil
   and biochar quality. The sample of microwave heating switchgrass with 10
   wt.\% K3PO4 + 10 wt.\% bentonite reached 400 degrees C after 2.8 min,
   compared with 28.8 min through conventional heating, producing biochar
   with increase in BET surface area from 0.33 m(2)/g to 76.3 m(2)/g
   compared with conventional heating. Furthermore, water content of the
   bio-oil reduced from 22.7 to 15.0 wt.\% compared with biomass mixed with
   20 wt.\% SiC, a chemically-inert microwave absorbing material used to
   increase microwave heating. Introducing catalysts showed a great

Journal = {{OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{143-153}},

Abstract = {{Multi-component measurements in shearography and other applications of
   Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) are typically achieved
   using multiple optical configurations that are activated sequentially to
   measure each desired quantity separately. A novel optical setup is
   introduced here where orthogonal shearography measurements are
   simultaneously made using a single color-camera imaging multiple
   monochromatic light sources of different wavelengths. The Red-Green-Blue
   (RGB) sensors of a conventional Bayer type camera are read separately,
   thereby providing three independent color signals and independent ESPI
   phase maps. Orthogonal axis shearography is achieved using a modified
   shearography interferometer where a dichroic filter is added to provide
   a second wavelength-dependent measurement. The availability of the two
   surface slopes gives the opportunity for the data to be summed
   numerically to give the surface displacement shape. This application is
   of significant practical interest because the surface displacement
   measurement can be made under field conditions by taking advantage of
   the well-known optical stability of shearography measurements. The two
   simultaneously measured surface slopes also offer the possibility to
   mathematically compensate for non-uniformity and non-orthogonality in
   the image shear caused by mirror non-flatness and/or mirror
   misalignments. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{499}},

Abstract = {{Gas transport in the diffusion barrier and porous substrate layers is
   modeled in order to evaluate its impacts on the performance of
   palladium-based composite membranes for H-2 separation. A
   pseudo-2-dimensional model is created for a cylindrical membrane module
   with counter-current flow. It is hypothesized that displacement of
   proton transport paths may occur in the bulk metal membrane due to a
   non-permeable solid phase in direct contact with it. A flux-weighted
   effective membrane thickness is proposed to account for this effect,
   which has not been considered in previous literature. Both the dusty gas
   model (DGM) and binary fraction model (BFM) are used to simulate gas
   transport in the porous media. Predictions show that under certain
   circumstances, a well-designed diffusion barrier may cause a slight
   increase in H2 flux, contrary to common belief. Two mechanisms are
   identified which enhance membrane performance by sweeping the permeate
   side. Though gases with small Schmidt number were found to be more
   likely to penetrate through the membrane substrate and build significant
   concentration at the membrane-substrate interface, the choice of sweep
   gas may depend on other practical considerations, especially gas
   separation downstream. Combinations of porosity and pore size are
   recommended for the membrane substrate and diffusion barrier based on
   modeling results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to recover and fully charge batteries in electric vehicles,
   smart battery chargers should not only work under different loading
   conditions and output voltage regulations (close to zero to 1.5 times
   the nominal output voltage), but also provide a ripple-free charging
   current for battery packs and a noise-free environment for the battery
   management system (BMS). In this paper, an advanced LLC design procedure
   is investigated to provide advantageous extreme regulation and eliminate
   detrimental burst mode operation. A modified, special LLC tank driven by
   both variable frequency and phase shift proves to be a successful
   solution to achieve all the regulation requirements for battery charging
   (from recovery, bulk, equalization, to finish). The proposed solution
   can eliminate the negative impact of burst mode noises on the BMS,
   provide a ripple-free charging current for batteries in different states
   of charge, reduce the switching frequency variation, and facilitate the
   EMI filter and magnetic components designs procedure. In order to fully
   consider the characteristics of the full bridge LLC resonant converter,
   especially the output voltage regulation range and soft transitions of
   the MOSFETs in the fixed frequency phase shift mode, a new set of
   analytical equations is obtained for the LLC resonant converter with
   consideration of separated primary and secondary leakage inductances of
   the high frequency transformer. Based on the proposed strategy and
   analytical equations, multivariate statistical design methodology is
   employed to design and optimize a 120 VDC, 3-kW battery charger. The
   experimental results exhibit the excellent performance of the resulting
   converter, which has a peak efficiency of 96.5\% with extreme regulation
   capability.}},

Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Research in thermionics has been reinvigorated recently by the advent of
   nanotechnology and nanomaterials. Thermionic energy convertors are
   commonly modelled using the Poisson-Vlasov system of equations under
   various limitations and approximations. With the ever-growing demands of
   emergent thermionic devices, more comprehensive approaches are needed in
   order to be able to treat a broader range of device configurations and
   operational parameters. Here, we propose a self-consistent approach
   that, by iterating between the Poisson and Vlasov equations, does not
   rely on the existence of an analytical solution to the latter.
   Specifically, we present a particle-tracing implementation of this
   method for solving the system numerically in an efficient manner. In the
   case where an analytical solution does exist, we present an asymptotic
   expansion of the ill-behaving functions that arise; this approach
   improves the effectiveness of the method in the deep space-charge mode.
   We also demonstrate the applicability of this approach in the presence
   of back-emission. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{144}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Bromine forms a tetragonal clathrate hydrate structure (TS-I) very
   rarely observed in clathrate hydrates of other guest substances. The
   detailed structure, energetics, and dynamics of Br-2 and Cl-2 in TS-I
   and cubic structure I (CS-I) clathrate hydrates are studied in this work
   using molecular dynamics and quantum chemical calculations. X-ray
   diffraction studies show that the halogen-water-oxygen distances in the
   cages of these structures are shorter than the sum of the van der Waals
   radii of halogen and oxygen atoms. This suggests that the stabilizing
   effects of halogen bonding or other non-covalent interactions (NCIs) may
   contribute to the formation of the unique tetragonal bromine hydrate
   structure. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of Br-2 and Cl-2
   clathrate hydrates using our previously developed five-site charge
   models for the dihalogen molecules {[}Dureckova et al. Can. J. Chem. 93,
   864 (2015)] which reproduce the computed electrostatic potentials of the
   dihalogens and account for the electropositive sigma-hole of the halogen
   bond donor (the dihalogen). Analysis of the radial distribution
   functions, enthalpies of encapsulation, velocity and orientation
   autocorrelation functions, and polar angle distributions are carried out
   for Br-2 and Cl-2 guests in various cages to contrast the properties of
   these guests in the TS-I and CS-I phases. Quantum chemical partial
   geometry optimizations of Br-2 and Cl-2 guests in the hydrate cages
   using the M06-2X functional give short halogen-water distances
   compatible with values observed in X-ray diffraction experiments. NCI
   plots of guest-cage structures are generated to qualitatively show the
   relative strength of the non-bonding interactions between dihalogens and
   water molecules. The differences between behaviors of Br-2 and Cl-2
   guests in the hydrate cages may explain why bromine forms the unique
   TS-I phase. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Regeneration of a perchlorate-exhausted highly selective ion exchange
   resin: Kinetics study of adsorption and desorption processes}},

Abstract = {{Perchlorate is a stable and soluble ion that can last for decades in the
   environment and can cause a number of environmental and health issues.
   Perchlorate is commonly removed using highly-selective ion exchange
   resins that are replaced after exhaustion and incinerated or disposed in
   a landfill since there is no viable regeneration method. The major
   limitations in regeneration of single use resins is achieving complete
   desorption of perchlorate. The sustainability of treatment processes for
   perchlorate contaminated water can be achieved by regenerating the
   exhausted resin. As the first step of resin bioregeneration study,
   research on the adsorption and desorption kinetics of the perchlorate
   ion from a strong base anion exchange resin was conducted. Different
   chemical reaction and diffusion models were analyzed using experimental
   data. Both adsorption and desorption experimental data were best
   described by the Pseudo-second order model with adsorption rate
   constants of 2 x 10(-3) +/- 0.001 (g/mg/min) and desorption rate
   constants of 5 x 10(-2) +/- 0.01 (g/mg/min). These results suggest that
   the rate limiting stage for adsorption and desorption of perchlorate ion
   into the resin can be chemisorption. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Impacts of a Rapidly Declining Mountain Snowpack on Streamflow Timing in
   Canada's Fraser River Basin}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{With its headwaters in the water towers of the western Cordillera of
   North America, the Fraser River is one of the continent's mightiest
   rivers by annual flows, supplies vital freshwater resources to populous
   downstream locations, and sustains the world's largest stocks of sockeye
   salmon along with four other salmon species. Here we show the Variable
   Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model's ability to reproduce accurately
   observed trends in daily streamflow for the Fraser River's main stem and
   six of its major tributaries over 1949-2006 when air temperatures rose
   by 1.4 degrees C while annual precipitation amounts remained stable.
   Rapidly declining mountain snowpacks and earlier melt onsets result in a
   10-day advance of the Fraser River's spring freshet with subsequent
   reductions in summer flows when up-river salmon migrations occur.
   Identification of the sub-basins driving the Fraser River's most
   significant changes provides a measure of seasonal predictability of
   future floods or droughts in a changing climate.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure of BiVO4 photoanodes to ultraviolet (UV) radiation for extended
   time periods (e.g., 20 h) produces a morphological change and
   concomitant improvement in photo-electrocatalytic (PEC) efficiency for
   driving water splitting directly by sunlight. The similar to 230 mV
   cathodic shift in onset potential and doubling of the photocurrent at
   1.23 V vs. RHE after UV curing are comparable to the effects engendered
   by the presence of a secondary catalyst layer. PEC measurements and
   absorption spectra indicate that the cathodic shift after UV curing
   corresponds to a suppression of charge recombination and a greater
   photovoltage generation caused by the shift of the flat-band potential,
   and not an improvement in electrocatalytic activity or light absorption.
   Spectroscopic surface analysis suggests that surface defect sites, which
   are eliminated by UV curing, for the differences in observed charge
   recombination.}},

Title = {{Scaling approach toward nano electro-discharge machining: Nanoscale
   patterning of carbon nanotube forests}},
Journal = {{MICROELECTRONIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{64-70}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{Micro-electro-discharge machining (mu EDM) is a versatile technique for
   micromachining of electrically conductive materials with resolutions
   limited within the micrometer scale. This paper reports an approach to
   pushing the resolution limit of mu EDM down to the nanometer scale. EDM
   with different electrode tip sizes is performed on carbon nanotube
   forests and the results reveal a favorable scaling effect of the tip
   size on the working voltage required for the breakdown of the dielectric
   between the electrode and workpiece, suggesting that downsizing of the
   electrode tip assists in the reduction of the discharge pulse energy.
   Based on this finding, controlled patterning of grating-like structures
   with similar to 200 nm height is demonstrated on carbon nanotube forests
   with an estimated pulse energy of 1 nJ, achieved using a tungsten
   electrode with a tip radius of 3 mu m. Theoretical analysis of this
   process setting shows a close match with the experimental results,
   further supporting the scaling effect. These results suggest the
   feasibility of the approach toward ``nano-EDM{''} for an extensive range
   of potential applications in micro/nanodevice and nanotechnology areas.

Abstract = {{Copper mining and processing activities at an abandoned mine in the
   Lefke-Xeros area of Cyprus have created a huge environmental
   contamination problem in the locality. As an alternative mitigation and
   management measure, we reported in previous studies that these tailings
   could be used as a concrete making material. In this paper, results of
   an experimental investigation of the reinforcement corrosion performance
   and cost efficiency of 0.57 and 0.50 w/b ratio concrete containing
   copper tailings either as a cement replacement or an additive material
   are presented. The time to initiation of corrosion and half-cell
   potential (HCP) of reinforcements were measured. Actual corrosion status
   of extracted reinforcement bars was also verified by visual inspection.
   Results showed that while early corrosion initiation occurred in some
   samples containing tailings as a cement replacement material, delayed
   corrosion initiation was observed in all samples containing copper
   tailings as an additive. Although HCP values became slightly more
   electronegative as tailings content of samples increased, no substantial
   reinforcement corrosion was observed. Based on corrosion performance and
   cost efficiency analyses, utilization of 5\% pre-wetted tailings either
   as a cement replacement or an additive material is the best tailings
   reuse approach. Increased tourism-related businesses associated with
   reduced pollution of the Lefke-Xeros coastal area would have a positive
   impact on the socioeconomic status of the community. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{A hybrid multi-stage stochastic programming-robust optimization model
   for maximizing the supply chain of a forest-based biomass power plant

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},

Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{Electricity generated from forest-based biomass is an attractive source
   of renewable energy. However, the cost of generating heat and/or
   electricity from it is relatively high due to the low energy density of
   wood, high moisture content and variations in its quality and
   availability. Models have been developed to optimize the supply chain
   and reduce the cost per kilowatt hour generated. This paper focuses on
   incorporating uncertainty in the supply chain of such a model. The model
   considers the tactical supply chain planning of a power plant over a
   one-year time horizon with monthly time steps. Uncertain parameters
   which impact the net profit of the power plant include `biomass
   quality,' namely moisture content and higher heating value, and `monthly
   available biomass' from different suppliers. Robust optimization is used
   to model uncertainty in the quality of biomass. Then a hybrid,
   multi-stage, `stochastic programming-robust optimization' model is
   presented in order to simultaneously include uncertainty in biomass
   quality and biomass availability. It is demonstrated that the hybrid
   model takes advantage of both modelling approaches to balance the profit
   estimates and the tractability to various circumstances. The model
   provides solution considering all instances of the uncertain parameters
   within the defined sets and scenario tree. The results revealed a major
   trade-off between profit and range of biomass quality. Profit decreased
   by up to 23\% when there was +/- 13\% variation in moisture content and
   +/- 5\% change in higher heating value. The model achieved a biomass
   purchase cost that was lower than the current commercial costs at the
   power plant. Implementing the model could prevent production curtailment
   and undesirable fluctuation in storage levels which occurred in the past
   due to variations in biomass availability and quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Concussion is a serious health concern. Concussion in athletes is of
   particular interest with respect to the relationship of concussion
   exposure to risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a
   neurodegenerative condition associated with altered cognitive and
   psychiatric functions and profound tauopathy. However, much remains to
   be learned about factors other than cumulative exposure that could
   influence concussion pathogenesis. Approximately 20\% of CTE cases
   report a history of substance use including androgenic-anabolic steroids
   (AAS). How acute, chronic, or historical AAS use may affect the
   vulnerability of the brain to concussion is unknown. We therefore tested
   whether antecedent AAS exposure in young, male C57BI/6 mice affects
   acute behavioral and neuropathological responses to mild traumatic brain
   injury (TBI) induced with the CHIMERA (Closed Head Impact Model of
   Engineered Rotational Acceleration) platform. Male C57Bl/6 mice received
   either vehicle or a cocktail of three AAS (testosterone, nandrolone and
   17 alpha-methyltestosterone) from 8-16 weeks of age. At the end of the
   7th week of treatment, mice underwent two closed-head TBI or sham
   procedures spaced 24 h apart using CHIMERA. Post-repetitive TBI (rTBI)
   behavior was assessed for 7 d followed by tissue collection. AAS
   treatment induced the expected physiological changes including increased
   body weight, testicular atrophy, aggression and downregulation of brain
   5-HT1B receptor expression. rTBI induced behavioral deficits, widespread
   axonal injury and white matter microgliosis. While AAS treatment did not
   worsen post-rTBI behavioral changes, AAS-treated mice exhibited
   significantly exacerbated axonal injury and microgliosis, indicating
   that AAS exposure can alter neuronal and innate immune responses to
   concussive TBI.}},

Abstract = {{An interval type-2 fuzzy fractional programming (IT2FFP) method is
   developed for planning the renewable energy in electric power system for
   supporting sustainable development under uncertainty. IT2FFP can tackle
   output/input ratio problems where complex uncertainties are expressed as
   type-2 fuzzy intervals (T2FI) with uncertain membership functions. The
   IT2FFP method is then applied to planning Beijing electric power system,
   where issues of renewable energy utilization, electricity supply
   security, and pollutant/greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation are
   incorporated within the modeling formulation. The obtained results
   suggest that the coal-fired power would continue to decrease and the
   share of renewable energy in gross electricity supply would maintain an
   increasing trend. Results also reveal that imported electricity plays a
   significant role in the city's energy supply. A number of decision
   alternatives are also analyzed based on the interval solutions as well
   as the projected applicable conditions, which represent multiple options
   with sustainable and economic considerations. The optimal alternative
   that can give rise to the desirable sustainable option under the
   maximization of the share of renewable power generation has been
   suggested. The findings can help decision makers identify desired
   alternatives for managing such a mixed energy system in association with
   sustainable development. Compared with the conventional optimization
   methods that optimize single criterion, it is proved that IT2FFP is
   advantageous in balancing conflicting objectives and reflecting
   complicated relationships among multiple system factors as well as in
   tackling various subjective judgments of decision makers with different
   interests and preferences. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Subsequently, the surface is characterized with Scanning Electron
   Microscope and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy. The data shows that
   the corrosion effect of organic matter depends on its composition and
   concentration. Citric acid is the most corrosive organic. Humic acid and

Abstract = {{Acid rock drainage (ARD) is a major environmental problem that poses
   significant environmental risks during and after mining activities. A
   new methodology for environmental risk assessment based on probability

   estimating risk of heavy metals posed to selected endpoints
   probabilistically, while propagating data and parameter uncertainties
   throughout the risk assessment steps. The methodology is demonstrated at
   a minesite located in British Columbia, Canada. The result of the
   methodology for the case study minesite shows the fate-and-transport of
   heavy metals is well simulated in the mine environment. In addition, the
   results of risk characterization for the case study show that there is
   risk due to transport of heavy metals into the environment. (C) 2015

Title = {{Optimized shear design equation for slender concrete beams reinforced

   analysis}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{151-165}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{A lack of confidence in the shear design of concrete beams reinforced
   with Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) bars may lead to excessive
   reinforcement and thus increase the overall cost of construction. In
   order to improve the accuracy of the current guidelines, two databases
   of slender (shear span to depth ratio >2.5) FRP reinforced concrete (RC)
   beams were developed from literature. The first set of data contains
   slender beams of 116 tests with only FRP rebar as longitudinal
   reinforcements whereas the second set contains 46 test beams reinforced
   with FRP as both longitudinal reinforcements and stirrups. The second
   database was used to evaluate the confinement effect of FRP rebar as
   stirrups. Thereafter a Genetic Algorithm was implemented to optimize the
   shear equations proposed in FRP design guidelines of ACI 440.1R-06, CSA
   S806-02, CSA S6-09, and Reineck's tooth model. The optimized shear
   equations showed less scatter than the original equations as they could
   achieve an average V-test/V-caic close to 1.0 with a significant
   improvement in coefficient of variation (Coy) with the validation
   database compared to the original equations. It was observed that the
   concrete shear equation prediction could be improved if the concrete
   strength could be taken to a power value less than what is currently
   recommended in the guidelines. In the case of transverse shear
   equations, the inclusion of concrete strength improved the results of
   the optimized equations. The optimized shear equations were further
   calibrated by performing reliability analysis in order to use them for
   design purposes. The resistance factors for the shear design equations
   were calculated at a target reliability index, beta(r) of 3.5 in order
   to achieve an acceptable level of structural safety. Crown Copyright (C)

Title = {{A reliability assessment of constrained spherical deconvolution-based

   chronic stroke}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{257}},
Pages = {{109-120}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is
   commonly used to assess white matter properties after stroke. Novel work
   is utilizing constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) to estimate
   complex intra-voxel fiber architecture unaccounted for with tensor-based
   fiber tractography. However, the reliability of CSD-based tractography
   has not been established in people with chronic stroke.
   New method: Establishing the reliability of CSD-based DW-MRI in chronic
   stroke. High-resolution DW-MRI was performed in ten adults with chronic
   stroke during two separate sessions. Deterministic region of
   interest-based fiber tractography using CSD was performed by two raters.
   Mean fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC),
   tract number, and tract volume were extracted from reconstructed fiber
   pathways in the corticospinal tract (CST) and superior longitudinal
   fasciculus (SLF). Callosal fiber pathways connecting the primary motor
   cortices were also evaluated. Inter-rater and test-retest reliability
   were determined by intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs).
   Results: ICCs revealed excellent reliability for FA and ADC in
   ipsilesional (0.86-1.00; p < 0.05) and contralesional hemispheres
   (0.94-1.00; p < 0.0001), for CST and SLF fibers; and excellent
   reliability for all metrics in callosal fibers (0.85-1.00; p < 0.05).
   ICC ranged from poor to excellent for tract number and tract volume in
   ipsilesional (-0.11 to 0.92; p <= 0.57) and contralesional hemispheres
   (-0.27 to 0.93; p <= 0.64), for CST and SLF fibers.
   Comparison with existing method: Like other select DW-MRI approaches,
   CSD-based tractography is a reliable approach to evaluate FA and ADC in
   major white matter pathways, in chronic stroke.
   Conclusion: Future work should address the reproducibility and utility
   of CSD-based metrics of tract number and tract volume. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{With an increasing emphasis on network security, much more attentions
   have been attracted to the vulnerability of complex networks. In this
   paper, the fractal dimension, which can reflect space-filling capacity
   of networks, is redefined as the origin moment of the edge betweenness
   to obtain a more reasonable evaluation of vulnerability. The proposed
   model combining multiple evaluation indexes not only overcomes the
   shortage of average edge betweenness's failing to evaluate vulnerability
   of some special networks, but also characterizes the topological
   structure and highlights the space-filling capacity of networks. The
   applications to six US airline networks illustrate the practicality and
   effectiveness of our proposed method, and the comparisons with three
   other commonly used methods further validate the superiority of our
   proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the numerous use of the constant phase element (CPE) in the
   modeling of the impedance characteristics of the electrochemical
   systems, the physical reasoning of this non-intuitive element is not
   clear. In this paper, the CPE impedance is analytically calculated using
   the anomalous diffusion theory. The fractional calculus and the
   anomalous diffusion are first reviewed. It is shown that the chance
   inequality in the random walk in a porous media can result in an
   anomalous diffusion. Then, the Boltzmann distribution of the particles
   used in the Gouy-Chapman theory of the double layer is modified to
   determine the double layer capacitance. Finally, the impedance of the
   double layer is calculated which is equivalent to the CPE impedance
   reported in literature. It is shown that this novel theory covers the
   interpretations previously presented for the CPE and its relation to the
   fractal dimension and the pore size distribution of the porous media.

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 4}},
Abstract = {{In this work, a magnetohydrodynamic method is proposed for the actuation
   of droplets in small-scale planar fluidic systems, providing an
   alternative to commonly used methods such as
   electrowetting-on-dielectric. Elementary droplet-based operations,
   including transport, merging, and mixing, are demonstrated. The forces
   acting on millimetric droplets are carefully investigated, with a
   primary focus on the magnetic actuation force and on the unbalanced
   capillary forces that arise due to hysteresis. A super-hydrophobic
   channel is 3D printed to guide the droplets, with thin wires installed
   as contact electrodes and permanent magnets providing a static magnetic
   field. It is shown that droplet motion is enhanced by increasing the
   droplet size and minimizing the electrode contact surface. The effects
   of channel geometry on threshold voltage and minimum moveable droplet
   volume are characterized. Finally, the presence of electrolysis is
   investigated and mitigating strategies are discussed. (C) 2016 AIP

Abstract = {{Sustaining high data rates over an indoor broadband power line
   communication (PLC) link is a challenging task due to the significant
   attenuation of high frequency signals transmitted over power cables.
   Repeaters are often used to alleviate the problem of signal attenuation,
   however, this comes at a loss of multiplexing gain. On the other hand,
   modern relaying concepts, as used in wireless systems, are not as
   effective in PLC setups due to the absence of diversity improvement. In
   this study, the authors address this issue and propose a new approach to
   improve the multiplexing gain of relay-aided PLC systems. The authors
   consider a multi-user indoor PLC scenario where all users want to share
   their data. For this setup, the authors then advocate the application of
   amplify-and-forward (AF) multi-way relaying (MWR). Considering the
   practical constraints of an indoor PLC system, the authors study the
   achievable data rates of AF MWR, and compare them to those achievable
   with direct (non-cooperative) transmission and conventional relaying
   schemes. The simulations demonstrate that depending on the network
   topology, MWR can result in significant performance improvement. The
   authors further discuss how their rate analysis can be exploited to
   decrease the energy consumption in the system.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to achieve aerobic granulation utilizing
   fermented municipal wastewater under low pH, and alkalinity conditions.
   Stable granulation was achieved after a 166-day start-up period. Due to
   low influent strength, supplemental carbon addition, in the form of
   sucrose, was added to the feed storage tank on the 82nd day of start-up
   to facilitate granulation. This increased the system's organic loading
   rate from 1.43 +/- 0.14 to 2.53 +/- 0.18kgCOD/m(3)/d, and reduced the
   influent pH due to fermentation of the added sucrose. Although
   granulation was successful, the nutrient removal was limited. Removal
   rates at an influent pH of 6.23 +/- 0.06 were 54.4\%+/- 8.3\% for
   phosphorus, 21.9\%+/- 4.1\% for ammonium, and 84.0\%+/- 3.0\% for total
   chemical oxygen demand (COD). During the second phase of
   experimentation, increased amounts of sucrose were added to the feed,
   which resulted in increased volatile fatty acid concentrations and pH
   reduction to 5.62 +/- 0.12 due to fermentation. Under further reduced pH
   conditions, phosphorus, ammonium, and total COD removal were found to be
   58.9\%+/- 4.7\%, 37.9\%+/- 4.7\%, and 87.1\%+/- 0.9\%, respectively.
   Settling volume indexes, SVI10 and SVI30, were found to be 148.8 +/-
   28.9 mL/g, for the influent pH of 6.23 +/- 0.06, and 157.5 +/- 40.6mL/g,
   for the influent pH of 5.62 +/- 0.12. This high SVI is indicative of the
   formation of lower-density granules in comparison to high-ash-content
   granules. The absence of denitrification-induced chemical phosphorus
   precipitation within the granule was likely a contributing factor to the
   low granule density observed in the system.}},

Abstract = {{Developments in micro- and nanofluidic technologies have led to new
   kinds of cell culture and screening systems that are collectively termed
   organ-ona- chip systems. Organ-on-a-chip systems are in vitro
   microfabricated devices that mimic dynamic interactions of in vivo
   microenvironments. In addition to existing two-dimensional and
   three-dimensional cell tissues, organ-on-a-chip systems can mimic the
   biomechanical and biochemical microenvironment of in vivo tissues as
   well as the interaction effect of the microenvironment on cell and
   tissue functions. Due to these features, organ-on-a-chip systems have
   become excellent platforms for drug screening and delivery test and
   tissue engineering. In this review, specific examples of various types
   of organ-on-a-chip devices and their applications in tissue engineering
   and drug delivery test are discussed. The ready feasibility and
   performance of current state-of-the-art organ-on-a-chip systems,
   including lungon- a-chip, heart-on-a-chip, liver-on-a-chip,
   vessel-on-a-chip, and tumor-on-a-chip are also covered in this chapter.
   The limitations of conventional systems, basic fabrication process of
   organ-on-a-chip devices, and future prospective of organon- a-chip are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The coal mining industry has struggled recently with numerous operations
   being closed due to poor market conditions and profitability. In spite
   of these low prices however the industry is seeing longwall projects

   This paper examines longwall coal projects and what makes them
   successful. The topic of safety is a primary focus, with coal mining
   disasters highlighted and operational challenges addressed. It includes
   summary root-cause analyses that may serve as a risk register to
   highlight significant issues and challenges facing the industry.

   generally requires knowledge of how each affects base-pairing properties

   scanning calorimetry and UV spectroscopy may be used to quantify the
   melting thermodynamics of short dsDNA containing chemically modified
   nucleosides in one or both strands. Insights are provided into why and
   how the presence of highly stable base pairs containing modified
   nucleosides can alter the nature of calorimetry or melting spectroscopy
   data, and how each experiment must therefore be conducted to ensure
   high-quality melting thermodynamics data are obtained. Strengths and
   weaknesses of the two methods when applied to chemically modified

   26 dB for the transverse electric mode at 1550 nm. The 10\%-90\%
   response time of the switch is 1.28 ms, including a 780 mu s rise time

Title = {{Interfacial dynamics in complex fluids}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Complex fluids are characterized by microstructures whose configuration
   can be driven out of equilibrium by macroscopic flow, and consequently
   contribute an additional stress that modifies the flow in return. When
   immiscible complex fluids coexist in a flow system, the fluid-fluid
   interface introduces an additional length scale into the fluid dynamics,
   typically intermediate between the microstructures of the bulk fluids
   and the macroscopic flow. Thus, multicomponent complex fluids often
   exhibit intriguing features in the interfacial flow, and offer an
   opportunity to study hydrodynamic coupling across length scales. In this
   review, we illustrate the novel interfacial dynamics in complex fluids
   using three examples that involve three types of complex fluids: polymer
   solutions, liquid crystals and ferrofluids. The focus will be on the
   dynamics of drops, which coalesce, break up, and self-assemble into
   regular patterns in these examples. In each case, we present
   experimental observations of novel interfacial phenomena. Then we
   explore the underlying fluid-dynamic mechanisms using theoretical models
   and numerical simulations. Comparing the experimental and computational
   results, we highlight the roles of the interface in relating complex
   rheology on the molecular scale to hydrodynamics on the macroscopic
   scale. Finally we point out outstanding questions and suggest future
   investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud radio access network (Cloud-RAN) has great potentials to improve
   energy efficiency and increase capacity of wireless networks. In this
   paper, we study the green communication for Cloud-RANs. Instead of only
   focusing on the transmit power consumption, we minimize the network
   power consumption which includes not only transmit power consumption but
   also circuit power consumption. In addition, we take into account the
   scenario that some mobile users can not be served. A joint multiuser
   admission control and downlink beamforming scheme is proposed for
   Cloud-RANs to minimize the network power consumption. We first formulate
   the problem as a two-stage problem, and then adopt semidefinite
   relaxation (SDR) to transform it as a Mixed-Integer Semidefinite Program
   (MI-SDP) which is a convex programming when the integer variables are
   fixed. By using the continuous relaxation, a heuristic algorithm with
   low complexity is proposed to derive the suboptimal solution. The
   simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our
   proposed algorithm compared with the existing work.}},

Abstract = {{Human sleep cyclically alternates between wakefulness and different
   sleep stages. There are various physiological changes that occur during
   wakefulness and sleep transitions. In particular, fluctuations occur in
   cardiorespiratory activity, mainly determined by the autonomic nervous
   system. The purpose of this study was to implement a multivariate
   logistic regression model to classify 30-second epochs of an overnight
   sleep dataset into awake and sleep states using the features extracted
   from the photoplethysmogram (PPG). The extracted features provided
   information about heart rate variability, respiratory activity, vascular
   tone and body movement.
   Overnight PPG signals were collected using a smartphone-based pulse
   oximeter, simultaneously with standard polysomnography from 160 children
   at the British Columbia Children's hospital. The sleep technician scored
   all wake/ sleep epochs throughout the PSG study. We divided the dataset
   into training data, used to develop the model using LASSO, and test
   data, used to validate the model.
   The developed model was assessed epoch-by-epoch for each subject
   individually, and for the complete test dataset. The performance of the
   model on the full test dataset showed a median accuracy of 77\%,
   sensitivity of 80\%, and specificity of 70\%. Thus, providing a detailed
   epoch-byepoch analysis with at-home pulse oximetry alone is feasible
   with accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values above 70\%. However,
   the performance of the model might decrease when analyzing subjects with
   a high number epochs of wakefulness.}},

   Network for solving this problem. We observe that (1) compare with
   ``single-frame{''} activity recognition, data sequence based

   sequence information with a simple ``mete layer{''} network model yields
   a better performance than memory based deep learning approaches.}},

Abstract = {{With the prevalence of social networks, social recommendation is rapidly
   gaining popularity. Currently, social information has mainly been
   utilized for enhancing rating prediction accuracy, which may not be
   enough to satisfy user needs. Items with high prediction accuracy tend
   to be the ones that users are familiar with and may not interest them to
   explore. In this paper, we take a psychologically inspired view to
   recommend items that will interest users based on the theory of social
   curiosity and study its impact on important dimensions of recommender
   systems. We propose a social curiosity inspired recommendation model
   which combines both user preferences and user curiosity. The proposed
   recommendation model is evaluated using large-scale real world datasets
   and the experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of social
   curiosity significantly improves recommendation precision, coverage and

Abstract = {{Current latency monitoring approaches for Software Defined Network often
   use the control plane as the infrastructure to inject time-stamp data
   packets as probe packets to measure the network latency at a particular
   time, but suffer from three major issues when the network latency needs
   to be continuously monitored: 1) the increased control plane's overhead,
   2) the feasibility of using data packets as probe packets, and 3) the
   increasing measurement error using OpenFlow messages to measure the time
   from the controller to a switch as the network scale grows. To overcome
   these issues, this paper proposes link latency monitoring using
   time-stamped Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) packets, aided by a
   linear calibration function to reduce errors of measuring
   switch-controller delays. Time stamping LLDP packets, which are used to
   discover the global network topology in SDNs, does not add extra
   workload to the control plane and the results always reach the
   controller thus while avoiding measurement failures that might occur in
   existing approaches. Our linear calibration function can reduce the
   measurement error to less than 5\% of the link latency measured by ping
   in a network with up to 30 switches and the link latency not less than
   1ms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates a new approach for the use of multiple strain
   sensors on a wearable flexible finger band to measure the posture and
   movement of a human finger accurately. The system is further developed
   to repeat the human finger motion on a robotic finger. Here, we used
   adaptive network-based fuzzy interface system (ANFIS) to relate the
   strain sensor readings to human finger posture and motion. The input and
   output measurements used to train ANFIS are obtained from the strain
   sensors of the wearable platform and a 3 degree of freedom (DOF)
   exoskeleton testbed, respectively. The ANFIS model is then used to
   predict human finger posture and motion directly from the strain sensors
   installed on the finger band. We made additional experiments and
   generated testing data using the exoskeleton testbed to verify the ANFIS
   model. Finally, we demonstrate that the robotic finger closely follows
   the human finger motion by reading the wearable finger band output and
   calculating the posture and motion parameters in real time.}},

Abstract = {{A switching nonlinear control system consisting of multiple Lyapunov
   functions and an adaptive mechanism is considered for small quadrotors.
   A typical quadrotor has only four actuators and six degrees of freedom
   (DOF) which makes it an under-actuated system. Underactuation adds
   constraints to the control input and complicates designing the control
   system. In addition, quadrotor control systems suffer from the presence
   of parameter uncertainty. In this work, the quadrotor's parameters are
   considered to be unknown but bounded. The proposed control algorithm
   combines a switching technique with an adaptation mechanism to overcome
   the difficulties associated with underactuation and uncertainty.
   Specifically, the switching controller is designed based on multiple
   Lyapunov functions to deal with the underactuation problem; and the
   adaptive mechanism is used to overcome the parametric uncertainties. The
   stability of the combined controller is proven within the region of
   interest, and simulation with real UAV model parameters was used to show
   that the proposed controller allows the system to follow a designed path
   closely.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a joint control method for the user association and
   almost blank sub-frame (ABSF) based interference coordination (IC)
   technique in heterogeneous cellular networks is proposed. The
   optimization objective is simultaneously improving system throughput and
   guaranteeing proportionally fairness. Usually, user and base station
   (UE-BS) association is performed before ABSF rate determination, which
   is suboptimal with respect to UE-BS association. We formulate the joint
   optimization of UE-BS association and ABSF rate as a combinatorial
   optimization problem. To deal with it, we proposed an iterative method
   to discover the ABSF rate, the optimal association and the optimal
   resource blocks(RBs) allocation that can maximum long-term average
   throughput. Besides, as we cannot know the interference before
   user-association and resource allocation, we proposed a graph-based BS
   clustering method to estimate the interference before user-association
   and resource allocation. Simulation results show the efficiency of our
   proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Energy consumption in wireless communication systems is exponentially
   increasing due to growing wireless traffic. Combating adverse effects of
   excessive energy consumption calls for energy-aware system design,
   leading to a new research paradigm, green communications. To achieve
   energy awareness in a full-duplex (FD) bi-directional multiple antenna
   system, in this paper, we study a Quality-of-Service (QoS) problem,
   where the total transmit power is minimized subject to minimum rate
   constraints at each node, and propose two algorithms. We first apply a
   penalty-based method in order to obtain an efficient optimization
   strategy. Afterwards, in the second algorithm, we generalize the
   well-known relationship between Weighted-Sum-Rate (WSR) and Weighted
   Minimum-Mean-Squared-Error (WMMSE) problems, originally used to solve
   the sum-rate maximization problem, to tackle the sum-power minimization

Abstract = {{We consider a single cell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system,
   where a base-station (BS) operating in full-duplex (FD) mode serves
   multiple uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) mobile users operating in
   half-duplex (HD) mode, simultaneously. The self-interference at the BS,
   and co-channel interference (CCI) from UL users to DL users are both
   taken into account. We consider the transmit and receive filter design
   for sum-rate maximization subject to a sum-power constraint at the BS
   and individual power constraints at each UL user of the system under the
   limited dynamic range considerations at the transmitters and receivers.
   By reformulating this non-convex problem as an equivalent component-wise
   convex optimization problem with the addition of two auxiliary
   variables, we propose a low complexity algorithm which converges to a

Abstract = {{High-Level Synthesis (HLS) has emerged as a leading technology to reduce
   the design time and complexity that is associated with reconfigurable
   systems. In order to maintain the productivity promised by HLS, it is
   important that the designer can debug the system in the context of the
   high-level code. Currently, software simulations offer a quick and
   familiar method to target logic and syntax bugs, while software/hardware
   co-simulations are useful for synthesis verification. However, to
   analyze the behaviour of the circuit as it is running, the user is
   forced to understand waveforms from the synthesized design.
   In this paper, we describe a methodology using source-level
   instrumentation for C-based HLS tools, to create memories and related
   circuitry to gather trace data that provides visibility into the
   operation of the circuit. This trace is then matched with a database
   that maps each memory entry to the high-level variables that have
   meaning to the designer during debug. Compared to previous source-level
   instrumentation approaches, we include the trace buffer and associated
   circuitry as part of the instrumentation, leading to additional
   optimization opportunities. We introduce a low overhead optimization
   technique, named Array Duplicate Minimization (ADM), to improve trace
   memory efficiency.
   Results are shown to demonstrate the feasibility of the instrumentation
   technique with these new components, resulting in reasonable impact on
   circuit size and speed. ADM improves overall debug observability by
   removing up to 31.7\% of data duplication created between the trace
   memory and the circuit's memory structures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns on inefficiency or even failure in secret key
   generation caused by the imperfect channel state information. We propose
   a secret key generation scheme based on wavelet analysis. Firstly, the
   channel estimates are pre-processed by wavelet analysis to improve the
   correlation. Secondly, to ensure the randomness of the secret keys, an
   adaptive equal probability quantization approach is proposed to quantize
   the estimates. Then, the quantized preliminary keys are reconciled and
   their privacy is amplified to obtain a final secure key. Furthermore, we
   validate the feasibility of the proposed scheme in real environments.
   Simulation and testing results all show that the proposed scheme
   achieves remarkable improvement in terms of bit mismatch rate and key
   generation rate compared with existing schemes. Besides, for the
   randomness, the generated keys pass the National Institute of Standards

Abstract = {{As we are approaching the exascale era in super-computing, designing a
   balanced computer system with powerful computing ability and low energy
   consumption becomes increasingly important. GPU is a widely used
   accelerator in most recently applied supercomputers. It adopts massive
   multithreads to hide long latency and has high energy efficiency.
   In contrast to its strong computing power, GPUs have few on-chip
   resources with several MB of fast on-chip memory storage per SM
   (Streaming Multiprocessors). GPU caches exhibit poor efficiency due to
   the mismatch of the throughput-oriented execution model and its cache
   hierarchy design. Since the severe deficiency in on-chip memory, the
   benefit of high computing capacity of GPUs is pulled down by the poor
   cache performance dramatically, which limits system performance and
   energy-efficiency. In this paper, we put forward a locality protected
   scheme to make full use of the data locality based on the fixed
   capacity. We present a Locality Protected method based on instruction PC
   (LPP) to promote GPU performance. Firstly, we use a PC-based collector
   to collect the reuse information of each cache line. After getting the
   dynamic reuse information of the cache line, we take an intelligent
   cache allocation unit (ICAU) which coordinates the reuse information
   with LRU (Least Recently Used) replacement policy to find out the cache
   line with the least locality for eviction. The results show that LPP
   provides an up to 17.8\% speedup and an average of 5.5\% improvement
   over the baseline method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the joint user association (UA) and user
   scheduling (US) for load balancing in a wireless downlink heterogeneous
   network by formulating a network-wide utility maximization problem. In
   order to efficiently solve the problem, we first approximate the
   original non-convex throughput function to a concave function, and
   demonstrate that the gap for such approximation approaches zero when the
   number of users is sufficiently large. Then, a distributed algorithm is
   further proposed to obtain the UA and US solutions by exploiting the
   convex optimization technique known as alternating direction method of
   multipliers. A remarkable feature of the proposed algorithm is that
   apart from load balancing, multiuser diversity is exploited in the
   association time to further improve system performance. The simulation
   results show the superior performance of the proposed algorithm and
   underscore the significant benefits of jointly exploiting multiuser
   diversity and load balancing.}},

Abstract = {{In order to improve the delay quality-of-service aware throughput
   performance of the optical wireless communications, a joint power
   allocation and relay selection scheme is proposed for a relay assisted
   multichannel coherent optical wireless communication system. The
   proposed joint power allocation and relay selection scheme provides the
   delay aware quality-of-service guarantee by maximizing the end-to-end
   effective capacity under the average transmit power constraints at both
   source as well as relay nodes. The joint power allocation and relay
   selection problem is formulated as a non-convex and combinatorial
   optimization problem, and the solution of this optimization problem is
   obtained using a time-sharing relaxation technique. Subsequently, a fast
   convergent algorithm is proposed for the joint power allocation and
   relay selection by considering the delay aware quality-of-service
   requirements of the services transmitted over the optical wireless
   communication channels. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed
   joint power allocation and relay selection scheme provides the strict
   statistical delay aware quality-of- service with an improved throughput

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a new scheme called Mutual Preamble
   Detection (MPD) to reduce the collision recovery time in broadband power
   line communication (BB-PLC) networks. Although latest BB-PLC products
   deliver a physical layer data rate of over 1000 Mbps, this is not
   efficiently translated into the medium access control (MAC) layer
   throughput due to several factors, including the long time intervals
   taken to recover from collisions. To address this, we use in-band full
   duplex operation to enable network nodes to transmit and simultaneously
   detect preambles, making them aware of a potential frame collision. With
   the detection of such a potential collision, we compel the network nodes
   to refrain from frame transmission in order to avoid the lengthy
   collision recovery time. The near-zero values of detection error and
   false alarm probabilities ensure the feasibility of our scheme in
   typical in-home BB-PLC networks. We present OMNeT++ simulation results

   using our proposed MPD scheme, over a traditional BB-PLC protocol.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous cloud small cell network (HCSNet) with energy harvesting
   is a promising technique in the next generation mobile communications.
   However, the cross-tier and co-tier co-channel interference can be
   severe due to the spectrum sharing in inter-tier and intra-tier of
   HCSNet. This paper investigates the problem of power allocation and
   subchannel assignment with the consideration of cross-tier/co-tier
   interference mitigation, energy harvesting and incomplete channel state
   information. The power allocation problem in HCSNet is modeled as a
   non-cooperative game by introducing a time-varying cross-tier/co-tier
   interference pricing with simultaneous wireless information and power
   transfer. Subchannel allocation is modeled as a non-cooperative
   potential game by minimizing the the total interferences experienced by
   users on each subchannel. Iterative scheme of power optimization and
   subchannel allocation is proposed to obtain the Nash equilibrium points.
   Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithms in HCSNet.}},

Abstract = {{.Abstract Planar spiral windings have garnered a significant amount of
   attention recently due to the popularity of slim consumer electronics
   combined with their low-profile, high reproducibility, and simple
   manufacturing. Unfortunately they still suffer from high internal
   capacitance which limits their use at high frequencies. This work
   presents the novel inverse Track-Width-Ratio (TWR) planar structure,
   which greatly reduces the undesired capacitance of multi-layer planar
   spiral windings by changing the turn widths. The amount of overlapping
   copper is ultimately reduced with the proposed technique, especially in
   the areas where the capacitance is the highest, resulting in
   significantly improved performance. Analytical models for the resistance
   of planar spiral windings with inverse TWR employed are presented and
   used as inputs into Finite Element Analysis to predict the capacitive
   behaviour of the structure. These results are compared to experimental
   results obtained from an impedance analyzer and a capacitance reduction
   up to 50\% is exhibited, with a reduction in ac resistance by 20\%.}},

Abstract = {{Resonant power converters have become ubiquitous to efficiently process
   electrical energy, however, their complicated structure challenges
   linear controllers in anticipating their large signal performance. Since
   small-signal modeling techniques do not provide sufficient information
   regarding the large signal behavior of power converters, nonlinear
   geometric controllers can be employed to tackle the poor large signal
   dynamic response. In this paper, a nonlinear controller called the
   average geometric controller is introduced for the LLC converter with
   the ability of providing an extreme start-up dynamic response and
   eliminate overshoot. A novel average large signal model is developed and
   serves as the foundations to develop the average geometric controller
   for LLC converters. The average large signal model significantly
   simplifies the large-signal behavior analysis and results in obtaining
   the average circular trajectories of the LLC converter. In order to
   validate the theoretical analysis, experimental and simulation results
   of a 500W prototype LLC converter employing the average geometric
   controller are presented. The experimental results show a significant
   increase in start-up performance while the overshoot is eliminated.}},

Abstract = {{Planar transformers (PTs) offer advantages over traditional wire-wound
   transformers including low-height, low leakage inductance, excellent
   thermal characteristics, Exceptional reproducibility and manufacturing
   simplicity. Despite these features, PTs have very high parasitic
   capacitance due to the large overlapping area and the small distance
   between consecutive layers. These parasitic capacitances can severely
   affect the performance of power converters and limit the application of
   PTs in high frequencies. In this paper, a new PT with very low parasitic
   capacitance is introduced to mitigate the problems that arise from the
   parasitic capacitances. The superiority of the proposed PT is confirmed
   through finite element analysis (FEA) and the experimental measurements
   and it is shown that the proposed transformer has 21.2 times less intra
   and 16.6 times less inter-winding capacitance than traditional spiral
   PT. This significant capacitance reduction has a tangible effect on the
   performance of power converter and the experimental results of employing
   the proposed transformer in 1.2 kW LLC resonant converter shows
   considerable performance improvement of the converter in terms of common
   mode (CM) noise and light-loading voltage regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Due to high blockage loss of millimeter wave (mm-wave) channel,
   researchers proposed to use multipath components (MPCs) as alternative
   communication links when line of sight (LOS) signal gets blocked.
   However, when both link ends are moving such as in Device-to-Device
   (D2D) scenario, MPC parameters show variation in their characteristics.
   In such scenarios, MPCs need to be persistent with
   transmitter/receiver's movement in order to be used as a communication
   link. The main goal of this paper is to the characterize persistent MPCs
   for the mm-wave propagation channel at 30 GHz frequency in an urban
   environment. To this end, we develop a set of algorithms to resolve
   these MPCs. We investigate how persistent MPCs evolve and change their
   characteristics in both temporal and angular domain with receiver's
   movement. We also analyze the probability of occurrence of persistent
   paths of different lengths and differential change of their azimuth
   angle of arrivals (azimuth-AOAs) throughout the movement. These
   information of persistent paths will help the system developer to design
   blockage effect immune communication links for D2D user.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate for the first time the benefits of
   wireless caching for the physical layer security (PLS) of wireless
   networks. In particular, a caching scheme enabling power-efficient PLS
   is proposed for cellular video streaming with constrained backhaul
   capacity. By sharing video data across a subset of base stations (BSs)
   through both caching and backhaul loading, secure cooperative
   transmission of several BSs is dynamically enabled in accordance with
   the cache status, the channel conditions, and the backhaul capacity.
   Thereby, caching reduces the data sharing overhead over the
   capacity-constrained backhaul links. More importantly, caching
   introduces additional secure degrees of freedom and enables a
   power-efficient design. We investigate the optimal caching and
   transmission policies for minimizing the total transmit power while
   providing quality of service (QoS) and guaranteeing secrecy during video
   delivery. A two-stage non-convex mixed-integer optimization problem is
   formulated, which optimizes the caching policy in an offline video
   caching stage and the cooperative transmission policy in an online video
   delivery stage. As the problem is NP-hard, suboptimal polynomial-time
   algorithms are proposed for low-complexity cache training and delivery
   control, respectively. Sufficient optimality conditions, under which the
   proposed schemes attain global optimal solutions, are also provided.
   Simulation results show that the proposed schemes achieve low secrecy
   outage probability and high power efficiency simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{Passive eavesdropping is a main threat for the security of interference
   alignment (IA) networks. To solve this problem, artificial noise (AN)
   can be utilized in IA networks. In addition, AN can be exploited as an
   energy source through wireless power transfer (WPT). In this paper, we
   propose an ANassisted IA scheme with WPT. In the scheme, AN is
   transmitted by each IA transmitter to disrupt the eavesdroppers, with
   energy harvesting implemented by the power- splitting (PS) method. To
   enhance the capability of anti- eavesdropping and WPT, the total
   transmit power of AN is maximized to disrupt the eavesdropper by jointly
   optimizing the transmit power of legitimate signal and the PS
   coefficients, with both of the required SINR and harvested energy
   constrained. Extensive simulation results are presented to validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}},

   achieve advantageous numerical properties. Constant parameter VBR
   (CPVBR) models has also been presented to avoid having the variable
   inductance matrix that is present in CCPD and VBR models in case of
   salient rotor machines. This paper improves the CPVBR model using the
   auxiliary rotor winding to achieve better accuracy when the machine in
   connected to power electronic converters. The new model is shown to

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the modeling of integrated acdc backup and

   the emergence of microgrids and distributed generations. The
   conventional shifted-frequency analysis (SFA) type dynamic phasors (DPs)
   assume a bandpass spectrum of power system signals, and thus are only
   suitable to model system components wherein the 60Hz fundamental
   frequency is dominant. To account for high-order harmonics of interest
   in ac-dc systems, this paper considers another type of DPs based on the
   generalized averaging method (GAM), and proposes a possible interface
   between the SFA- and GAM-type DP models. Computer studies demonstrate
   that the proposed DP interface allows for accurate simulations of both
   fundamental frequency components and high-order harmonics in integrated
   ac-dc power systems, while providing significant numerical advantages

Abstract = {{A modified Elman neural network (MENN) based neural adaptive inverse
   control scheme is proposed for trajectory tracking of rate-dependent
   hysteresis. To attenuate the influence of the rate-dependent hysteresis,
   a modified inverse backlash operator (MIBO) is developed to act as the
   hidden layer neuron of the MENN to describe the dynamic behavior of the
   inverse rate-dependent hysteresis. The diagonal recurrent weights of
   context layer and the recurrent weights from hidden layer to context
   layer are designed to enhance the dynamic learning capability of the
   MENN. To determine an appropriate structure and the parameters of the
   MENN for adaptive inverse control, a MENN is trained first based on the
   data of inverse rate-dependent hysteresis. In view of the nonsmooth
   characteristics of the MIBOs, a restricted step proximal bundle (RSPB)
   method is employed to search the appropriate subgradients at the
   nonsmooth vertexes of the MIBOs. The relevant Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M)
   algorithm is developed to acquire an appropriate MENN that is used as
   the initial controller to implement adaptive inverse control for rate-
   dependent hysteresis via gradient descent learning algorithm. Numerical

Abstract = {{Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) biomarkers of multiple sclerosis (MS),
   particularly fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) sequences, have
   long been investigated. However, advanced analytical methods, capable of
   fusing results from different MRI modalities, could be more informative
   to have enabled joint biomarkers. Here we estimate disease duration (DD)
   in MS subjects (n=47) based on fusion of information from Myelin Water
   Imaging (MWI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and resting state
   functional MRI (rsfMRI) modalities, by adapting a joint Multimodal
   Statistical Analysis Framework. Using this data driven, multimodal,
   latent variable (LV) approach, common and unique information in each
   dataset was acquired and their relationship with DD is analyzed through
   the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression.
   The common components between the three modalities, but not the unique
   components of each modality, accurately predicted DD. To further
   investigate the regions importance for estimating DD, we separated the
   data into two groups: ``early{''} and ``late{''} DD depending upon their
   relationship to the median duration of illness (120 months). In early
   disease, DTI information in the Right Tapetum and the Fornix jointly
   with MWI information in the Left Superior Cerebellar Penducle, Right
   Cerebral Penducle, and Cingulum were most informative. In contrast,
   rsfMRI demonstrated altered connectivity throughout disease duration.
   Our results demonstrate the power of multimodal imaging markers in MS.}},

Abstract = {{Beckmann distribution is a versatile mathematical model, which can be
   applied in performance analyses of radio frequency communications,
   free-space optical communications and underwater optical communications.
   However, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of Beckmann
   distribution does not have a closed-form expression, which makes it
   challenging to derive closed-form outage probability expression of
   communications over channels involving Beckmann random variables. In
   this paper, we derive closed-form upper and lower CDF bounds of Beckmann
   distribution, and the bounds can be arbitrarily tight by properly
   choosing the parameters of the bounds. Compared to the numerical
   estimation of the double-fold integral expression of the Beckmann CDF,
   using the closed-form bounds to estimate the CDF is not only faster, but
   also has less space complexity. More importantly, the analytical CDF
   bounds explicitly quantify the largest possible discrepancy between the
   approximate CDF and the exact CDF, while the discrepancy of the
   numerical estimation is unknown.}},

Abstract = {{A free-space optical system using subcarrier intensity modulated
   quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) is investigated for Gamma-Gamma
   fading channels with receiver in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) imbalances.
   The I/Q imbalance caused by imperfection of analog components is
   unavoidable using any direct-conversion transceivers. In addition to the
   receiver I/Q imbalances, the performance of a subcarrier QPSK system is
   impaired by the fluctuation of irradiance over the Gamma-Gamma fading
   channels. By taking into consideration of both receiver I/Q imbalances
   and fading, we derive closed-form symbol error rate (SER) and bit-error
   rate (BER) expressions. It is discovered that the value of amplitude
   imbalance is irrelevant to the error rate performance of the QPSK

Abstract = {{In a cloud environment, a scheduler assigns arriving tasks to one of
   many servers, with the goal of minimizing response times. There are two
   conventional approaches to cloud scheduling. The first is called the
   Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) algorithm, which directs an arriving task
   to the least loaded server. Despite its excellent delay performance, JSQ
   is throughput-limited, and thus doesn't scale well with the number of
   servers. The second is called the Power-of-d-choices (Pod) algorithm,
   which selects d servers at random and routes a task to the least loaded
   server of the d servers. Despite its scalability, Pod suffers from long
   tail response times. In this paper, a hybrid scheduling strategy is
   proposed, and it consists of a Pod scheduler and a throughputl-imited
   helper. Hybrid scheduling takes the best of both worlds, enjoying
   scalability and low tail response times. In particular, hybrid
   scheduling has bounded maximum queue size in the large-system regime,
   which is in sharp contrast to the Pod scheduling whose maximum queue
   size is unbounded.}},

Abstract = {{To reduce the transmission power while maintaining quality of service
   requirements of users, more remote radio heads (RRHs) should be active,
   and this in turn increases the circuit power in the distributed antenna
   systems with simultaneous wireless information and power transferring.
   Yet, the above procedures may lead to an unbalanced power consumption
   between transmission and circuit; therefore causes extra burden on the
   operators' power budget. To obtain a balanced transmission power and
   circuit power, this paper studies the system utility minimization
   problem in such a system via joint RRH selection and beamforming. The
   utility is formulated as the weighted sum of transmission power and
   circuit power. Since the formulated problem is NP-hard, a low complexity
   iterative algorithm is developed to achieve a near-optimal solution. The
   complexity of each iteration step is analyzed. Computer simulation
   results show the convergence of the proposed algorithm and the tradeoff
   between the transmission power and the circuit power.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a multi-cell multiple-input multiple-output full-duplex (FD)
   system, where multiple FD capable base stations (BSs) serve multiple
   mobile users operating in FD mode. The self-interference at the BSs and
   users, and co-channel interference (CCI) between all the nodes (BSs and
   users) in the system are both taken into account. We consider the
   transmit and receive filter design for sum-rate maximization problem
   subject to sum-power constraints at the BSs and individual power
   constraints at each user of the system under the limited dynamic range
   considerations at the transmitters and the receivers. By reformulating
   this non-convex problem as an equivalent multi-convex optimization
   problem with the addition of two auxiliary variables, we propose a low
   complexity alternating algorithm that converges to a stationary point.
   Since this sum-rate maximization results in starvation of users in terms
   of resources depending on the power of the self-interference and CCI
   channels, we modify the sum-rate maximization problem by adding target
   data rate constraints on each user, and propose an algorithm based on
   Lagrangian relaxation of the rate constraints.}},

Title = {{Securing Uplink Transmission for Lightweight Single-Antenna UEs in the
   Presence of a Massive MIMO Eavesdropper}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{With the coming of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the fifth generation
   (5G) wireless communication era, more and more lightweight user
   equipments (UEs) appear in our life. The private information they gather
   and transmit on the uplink will likely face security risks, since the
   lightweight UEs are probably with limited number of antennas, e.g., only
   one antenna, limited power and low signal processing and data computing
   capabilities, which may inherently weaken the corresponding secrecy
   performance. As a consequence, traditional cryptographic techniques and
   complex physical layer security techniques with favorable secrecy
   performance may not be suitable for lightweight UEs due to high
   implementation complexity. Moreover, it is highly plausible that the
   unauthorized nodes can utilize much more powerful large antenna array,
   i.e., massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology, to
   intercept the uplink information sent by the lightweight UEs due to the
   maturity of massive MIMO technology by then. Considering the possibility
   of facing massive MIMO eavesdropper, we propose to adopt the uplink
   original symbol phase rotated (UOSPR) scheme to secure the uplink
   transmission for lightweight single-antenna UEs in this paper. By
   employing the UOSPR secure transmission scheme, the lightweight UEs will
   randomly rotate the original information bearing symbols before they are
   transmitted to the BS on the uplink. This can be viewed as a symbol
   encryption process. The BS is then assured to be able to infer the
   accurate phase rotation and recover the original symbols while the
   massive MIMO eavesdropper can learn little useful information about the
   randomly rotated phase. The corresponding secrecy analysis of the UOSPR
   scheme on the uplink transmission is presented in detail. Furthermore,
   we show that the UOSPR scheme is with low complexity from the
   perspective of the lightweight UEs, which potentially makes it a
   candidate uplink secure transmission scheme in IoT and 5G scenarios.
   Simulation results are provided to further corroborate the effectiveness
   of the UOSPR secure transmission scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep apnea, characterized by frequent pauses in breathing during sleep,
   poses a serious threat to the healthy growth and development of
   children. Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard for sleep apnea
   diagnosis, is resource intensive and confined to sleep laboratories,
   thus reducing its accessibility. Pulse oximetry alone, providing blood
   oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and blood volume changes in tissue (PPG), has
   the potential to identify children with sleep apnea. Thus, we aim to
   develop a tool for at-home sleep apnea screening that provides a
   detailed and automated 30 sec epoch-by-epoch sleep apnea analysis. We
   propose to extract features characterizing pulse oximetry (SpO(2) and
   pulse rate variability {[}PRV], a surrogate measure of heart rate
   variability) to create a multivariate logistic regression model that
   identifies epochs containing apnea/hypoapnea events.
   Overnight pulse oximetry was collected using a smartphone-based pulse
   oximeter, simultaneously with standard PSG from 160 children at the
   British Columbia Children's hospital. The sleep technician manually
   scored all apnea/hypoapnea events during the PSG study. Based on these
   scores we labeled each epoch as containing or not containing
   apnea/hypoapnea. We randomly divided the subjects into training data
   (40\%), used to develop the model applying the LASSO method, and testing
   data (60\%), used to validate the model.
   The developed model was assessed epoch-by-epoch for each subject. The
   test dataset had a median area under the receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curve of 81\%; the model provided a median accuracy
   of 74\%, sensitivity of 75\%, and specificity of 73\% when using a risk
   threshold similar to the percentage of apnea/hypopnea epochs. Thus,
   providing a detailed epoch-by-epoch analysis with at-home pulse oximetry
   alone is feasible with accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values
   above 73\%. However, the performance might decrease when analyzing
   subjects with a low number of apnea/hypoapnea events.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach to identify the respiratory phases of
   heart cycles from acceleration signals (i.e., seismocardiogram) recorded
   from the sternum, in back to front direction. The acceleration signals
   were recorded simultaneously with a single lead electrocardiogram (ECG),
   and the respiratory signal (using a chest band strain gauge) from 20
   healthy subjects. Two accelerometer-derived respiration (ADR) signals
   were computed by computing the lower and upper envelope of the
   accelerometer signal. In the proposed methodology, for each subject a
   metric so-called, the piecewise total harmonic distortion (THD) was used
   to identify which one of lower and upper envelopes is the best ADR for
   detecting respiratory phases. The accuracy of piecewise THD in the
   selection of the correct envelope of SCG signal as an estimation of ADR
   is 84.6\%. Consequently, respiratory phases of heart cycles were
   identified using the estimated ADR signals. Results confirm that the
   proposed envelope detection based ADR technique can detect respiratory
   phases of heartbeats with the accuracy of above 75\%. In other words,
   using aforementioned methods, THD thresholding and piecewise THD, the
   capability of ADR signal to detect respiratory phases is increased
   approximately 14\% compared to the lower envelope of the accelerometer
   (ADR(Lower)) and 4\% compared to the upper envelope of accelerometer
   signal (ADR(Upper)).}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are one of the key technologies that
   support the development of digital health care, which has attracted
   increasing attention in recent years. Compared with general Wireless
   Sensor Networks (WSNs), WBANs have more stringent requirements on
   reliability and energy efficiency. Though WBANs are applied within
   limited transmission range, the on-body channel condition can be very
   challenging because of blocking or absorbing of signal. In this paper,
   we are looking into the design of Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols
   and propose an opportunistic scheduling scheme by applying heuristic
   scheduling and dynamic superframe length adjustment to improve the
   system performance. The simulations have been supplemented to show the
   advantages of the proposed solutions in outage rate performance,

Abstract = {{This paper presents the first direct-write microfabrication of thin-film
   thermocouple temperature sensors enabled by controlled manipulation of
   micro glow plasma. The microplasma is generated at the tip of a

   enabling localized sputtering deposition of the alloy on the substrate
   to create sensing junctions via plasma scanning over the substrate.
   Micropatterning of T-type (Constantan-Cu) thermocouples is demonstrated
   by drawing Constantan film directly on Cu-coated substrates using
   cylindrical target electrodes with diameters down to 50 mu m. The
   thermoelectric behaviors of printed structures are measured to prove
   their thermocouple function, with a sensitivity of 39 mu V/degrees C
   that matches well with the typical T-type's coefficient. This
   direct-write scheme is promising for rapid, low-cost printing of micro
   temperature sensors, i.e., thermocouples, thermopiles and resistive
   temperature detectors, potentially on a variety of objects including
   three-dimensional components and flexible substrates.}},

Abstract = {{As societal expectations have changed from narrowly focused
   environmental issues to broader sustainable development concerns, it is
   vital that future engineers graduate with an understanding of how social
   impacts may affect or may be affected by their decisions. Drawing on
   complexity theory and sustainability literature, this paper describes
   how engineering programs can incorporate a course that will enable
   graduating engineers to explore the interdependencies among technical,
   economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainability.
   System's elements and interdependences are identified using modularity,
   a technique that applies deductive and inductive methods. Using the
   example of a sustainable lignin-based product we demonstrate how such
   methods can be demonstrated in class. We then discuss the implications
   for engineering teaching and propose an integrated sustainability
   analysis course that focuses on harnessing social factors within
   sustainability systems, by seeking them out and exploiting
   interdependencies. This will prepare future engineers to work on a more
   realistic scenario, and more broadly explore new ideas and possible
   solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Because sustainability learning is necessarily situated in local culture
   and ``place,{''} engaging key communities-of-interest in planning and
   deployment is foundational to sustainability effort. Recently, the
   University Sustainability Initiative (USI), at the University of British
   Columbia (UBC), employed engagement techniques that reached out across
   the university campus to develop generic descriptions of sustainability
   attributes of graduating students, which propose that UBC students
   within all disciplines strive to develop four attributes in preparation
   for facing today's challenges (i.e., holism, sustainability knowledge,
   awareness \& integration, and acting for positive change) (USI 2015a).
   The USI recognizes, `` that in order to find creative solutions to the
   ecological, economic and social challenges of our time, we must explore,
   advance and apply our understanding of sustainability{''} (USI 2015b).
   This paper reports on a second set of engagement processes focused on
   developing the first stage of Engineering Education for Sustainable
   Development (EESD) degree-level learning outcomes that, in turn, aim to
   guide course redevelopment within the engineering programs. We start by
   presenting examples of sustainability learning opportunities offered in
   undergraduate programs elsewhere in North America. Most of these
   opportunities involve adding several courses to an already course-heavy
   degree. At several schools there is an option to complete a
   ``certificate program{''} encompassing a few extra courses, but these
   certificate programs are not necessarily directed at engineering
   students. We then describe UBC Applied Science Faculty engagement
   activities, aimed at measuring the interest of administrators, faculty
   members, staff, and students regarding incorporating sustainability
   learning opportunities within the common first year curriculum. We next
   relate informal first year student survey responses to the literature
   and we outline recommendations for advancing the development of
   sustainability learning within the first year curriculum.}},

Abstract = {{Complex engineering projects often require interdisciplinary approaches
   and the ability to understand and navigate professional, cultural,

   Piloted in 2011, the Faculty of Applied Science at the University of
   British Columbia offers APSC 461 and 462, Global Engineering Leadership,
   to better prepare graduates for a broader scope of engineering practice.
   The courses emphasize four key themes: leadership, ethical community
   engagement, participatory planning and understanding differences. These
   four themes provide a strong framework for student learning as they are
   intended to problematize the technical mindset of traditional
   engineering practice (e.g., linear and hierarchical thinking; a western,
   scientific worldview). In APSC 461, drawing on a pedagogy of
   Community-based Experiential Learning (CBEL), the four themes are
   explored through a series of talks (guest speakers, instructor),
   student-led discussions and workshops, and collaboration on a community
   project proposed by a local organization. Students further engage in the
   concepts through written reading responses and reflections. The
   preparation provided by the four themes becomes even more important for
   those who continue in the international service learning course module
   of APSC 462. This practicum is hosted by an agro-ecology centre in a
   rural community in Mexico. Anecdotal evidence suggests these themes
   support critical reflection and student preparedness to work with
   community partners. More formalized studies are required to properly
   assess the impact which will, in turn, inform future development of the
   courses.}},

   detection outside clinical settings. The wireless EEG sensor nodes
   consume a considerable amount of battery energy to acquire, encode and
   transmit the data to the server side. In this paper, we introduce
   energy-efficient monitoring systems to increase the sensors' battery
   lifetime. Specifically, we propose a feature extraction method that is
   robust to artifacts and can effectively select the most discriminant
   features relevant to seizures. Second, we show how to use the missing at
   random (MAR) method to reduce the energy required at the sensor node for
   data transmission without compromising the seizure detection accuracy at
   the server side. Finally, we show how the expectation maximization (EM)
   method is used at the server side to accurately substitute the missing
   values. The performance of the proposed scheme is compared to those of
   the state-of-the art methods, and is shown to achieve less power
   consumption without compromising the seizure detection accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The task of classifying EEG signals for self-paced Brain Computer
   Interface (BCI) applications is extremely challenging. This difficulty
   in classification of self-paced data stems from the fact that the system
   has no clue about the start time of a control task and the data contains
   a large number of periods during which the user has no intention to
   control the BCI. Therefore, to improve the performance of the BCI, it is
   imperative to exploit the characteristics of the EEG data as much as
   possible. For motor imagery based self-paced BCIs, during motor imagery
   task the EEG signal of each subject goes through several internal state
   changes. Applying appropriate classifiers that can exploit the temporal
   correlation in EEG data can enhance the performance of the BCI. In this
   paper, we propose an algorithm which is able to capture the temporal
   correlation of the EEG signal. We compare the performance of our
   algorithm that is based on neural network conditional random fields to
   two well-known dynamic classifiers, the Hidden Markov Models and
   Conditional Random Fields and to the static classifier, Support Vector
   Machines. We compare these methods using the data from SM2 dataset, and
   we show that our algorithm yields results that are considerably superior
   to the other approaches in terms of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of
   the BCI system.}},

Abstract = {{Routing congestion is a significant challenge in integrated circuit
   design due to their ever-growing number of metal layers, the expanding
   set of design rules and exponential growth in complexity. This increases
   the need for an accurate congestion estimation methodology - this
   estimation approach must be fast such that it can be used within tight
   loops of other algorithms such as placement. An accurate modeling metric
   is presented in this paper which has the ability to take into account
   local congestion, design blockages, as well as the impact of routing due
   to the application progression. Results show that the congestion map is
   well predicted and matched with that of post-routing. Blockages are
   avoided in a similar way to that of a typical detailed router.}},

Title = {{Geographic Routing in Duty-Cycled Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks
   With Radio Irregularity}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{9043-9052}},
Abstract = {{Industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) are required to provide
   highly reliable and real-time transmission. Moreover, for connected
   K-neighborhood (CKN) sleep scheduling-based duty-cycled IWSNs in which
   the network lifetime of IWSNs can be prolonged, the two-phase geographic
   greedy forwarding (TPGF) geographic routing algorithm has attracted
   attention due to its unique transmission features: multi path, shortest
   path, and hole bypassing. However, the performance of TPGF in CKN-based
   duty-cycled IWSNs with radio irregularity is not well investigated in
   the literature. In this paper, we first evaluate the impact of radio
   irregularity on CKN-based duty-cycled IWSNs. Furthermore, we investigate
   the routing performance of TPGF in CKN-based duty-cycled IWSNs with
   radio irregularity, in terms of the number of explored routing paths as
   well as the lengths of the average and shortest routing paths.
   Particularly, we establish the upper bound on the number of explored
   routing paths. The upper bound is slightly relaxed with radio
   irregularity compared with without radio irregularity; however, it is
   bounded by the number of average 1-hop neighbors in always-on IWSNs.
   With extensive simulations, we observe that the cross-layer optimized
   version of TPGF (i.e., TPFGPlus) finds reliable transmission paths with
   low end-to-end delay, even in CKN-based duty-cycled IWSNs with radio
   irregularity.}},

Abstract = {{Melanoma is a malignant tumor of melanocytes. Melanoma cells have high
   light absorption due to melanin highly contained in melanoma cells. This
   property is employed for the detection of circulating melanoma cell by
   in vivo photoacoustic flow cytometry (PAFC), which is based on
   photoacoustic effect. Compared to in vivo flow cytometry based on
   fluorescence, PAFC can employ high melanin content of melanoma cells as
   endogenous biomarkers to detect circulating melanoma cells in vivo. We
   have developed in vitro experiments to prove the ability of PAFC system
   of detecting photoacoustic signals from melanoma cells. For in vivo
   experiments, we have constructed a model of melanoma tumor bearing mice
   by inoculating highly metastatic murine melanoma cancer cells, B16F10
   with subcutaneous injection. PA signals are detected in the blood
   vessels of mouse ears in vivo. The raw signal detected from target cells
   often contains some noise caused by electronic devices, such as
   background noise and thermal noise. We choose the Wavelet denoising
   method to effectively distinguish the target signal from background
   noise. Processing in time domain and frequency domain would be combined
   to analyze the signal after denoising. This algorithm contains time
   domain filter and frequency transformation. The frequency spectrum image
   of the signal contains distinctive features that can be used to analyze
   the property of target cells or particles. The processing methods have a
   great potential for analyzing signals accurately and rapidly. By
   counting circulating melanoma cells termly, we obtain the number
   variation of circulating melanoma cells as melanoma metastasized. Those
   results show that PAFC is a noninvasive and label-free method to detect
   melanoma metastases in blood or lymph circulation.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has provided
   innovative solutions to reduce traffic accidents caused by fatigue
   driving. When drivers are in bad mood or tired, their vigilance level
   decreases, which may prolong the reaction time to emergency situation
   and lead to serious accidents. With the help of mobile sensing and
   mood-fatigue detection, drivers' moodfatigue status can be detected
   while driving, and then appropriate measures can be taken to eliminate
   the fatigue or negative mood to increase the level of vigilance. This
   paper presents the basic concepts and current solutions of moodfatigue
   detection and some common solutions like mobile sensing and cloud
   computing techniques. After that, we introduce some emerging platforms
   which designed to promote safe driving. Finally, we summarize the major
   challenges in mood-fatigue detection of drivers, and outline the future

Abstract = {{In this paper we present an economic model predictive control (econ MPC)
   strategy for a two-stage (primary and secondary refining) Mechanical
   Pulping (MP) process. The MP process is a complex multi-input
   multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear process with strong interactions among the
   variables. In order to guarantee both stability and convergence of the
   closed-loop nonlinear MP process, two different econ MPC schemes are
   proposed: one with penalty on the increment of the input and one with
   penalty on the offset of the input from its steady-state target. We
   demonstrate that both econ MPC schemes achieve significant amount of
   energy reduction in terms of the specific energy consumed by the process
   while ensuring closed-loop stability and convergence to a nearby
   steady-state. In addition, we show that more energy reduction can be
   achieved by using the econ MPC with penalty on the input increment
   compared with the other scheme. Simulation results also demonstrate the
   potential benefits of using econ MPC over the standard MPC technique.}},

   values. A low-order model representing opioid dose-response relationship
   is derived via system identification and parametric sensitivity
   analysis. Based on the model thus derived, a model reference adaptive
   controller and a composite adaptive controller are designed, whose
   performance is compared with non-adaptive control. In-silico simulation

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of robust alarm design for chemical processes
   represented by stochastic state-space models (SSMs). Alarm design for
   such complex processes faces three important challenges: 1) processes
   exhibit highly non-linear behavior; 2) state variables are not precisely
   known (modeling error) and often unmeasured (hidden); and 3) process
   signals are not necessarily Gaussian, stationary or uncorrelated. We
   propose the design of a delay timer alarm for monitoring unmeasured
   latent variables. The proposed design reduces the false and missed alarm
   rates. To deal with non-stationary process behavior in normal and
   abnormal operations, we propose an average-case delay timer alarm
   design. The efficacy of the proposed robust alarm design is illustrated
   on a non-stationary chemical reactor.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling blood glucose level for patient with type 2 diabetes
   mellitus (T2DM) has been influenced by many variables with significant
   levels of variability, such as insulin sensitivity, carbohydrates
   intake, exercise, and more. These variabilities make controlling blood
   glucose level a complex problem. In patients with advanced T2DM, when
   the body fails to regulate blood glucose level, an external loop
   including an insulin pump and a glucose measurement device can be used
   in maintaining glucose regulation. However, the control of blood glucose
   level may fail even in patient with insulin pump therapy. Therefore,
   building a reliable model-based fault detection system to detect
   failures in controlling blood glucose level dealing with all
   variability, uncertainty, and lack of accuracy is critical. In this
   article, we propose utilizing a validated robust model-based fault
   detection technique based on a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) filtering
   method for detecting faults in the insulin infusion system and detecting

Abstract = {{Employing viability techniques to preserve safety in safety-critical
   control applications has recently attracted much attention. The
   techniques rely on a conservative approximation of the viability kernel
   based on a state-space model of the system. However, in the case where
   the system's model is uncertain the safety concern has yet to be
   addressed in the literature. In this work, we are seeking a single
   control action preserving safety for a set-represented model
   uncertainty. We define the model-invariant viability kernel for a
   multi-model uncertainty description. Based on this kernel, we show that
   under some assumptions, the control action taken based on any model in
   the model set is capable of preserving safety for the entire set. We
   propose a model-invariant safety-preserving control input which is the
   same for all models in the set. We evaluate and discuss the performance
   of the proposed scheme by applying it to the closed-loop control of
   anesthesia in which safety is critical.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease with an early course
   that is characterized by attacks of clinical worsening, separated by
   variable periods of remission. The ability to predict the risk of
   attacks in a given time frame can be used to identify patients who are
   likely to benefit from more proactive treatment. In this paper, we aim
   to determine whether deep learning can extract, from segmented lesion
   masks, latent features that can predict short-term disease activity in
   patients with early MS symptoms more accurately than lesion volume,
   which is a very commonly used MS imaging biomarker. More specifically,
   we use convolutional neural networks to extract latent MS lesion
   patterns that are associated with early disease activity using lesion
   masks computed from baseline MR images. The main challenges are that
   lesion masks are generally sparse and the number of training samples is
   small relative to the dimensionality of the images. To cope with sparse
   voxel data, we propose utilizing the Euclidean distance transform (EDT)
   for increasing information density by populating each voxel with a
   distance value. To reduce the risk of overfitting resulting from high
   image dimensionality, we use a synergistic combination of downsampling,
   unsupervised pretraining, and regularization during training. A detailed
   analysis of the impact of EDT and unsupervised pretraining is presented.
   Using the MRIs from 140 subjects in a 7-fold cross-validation procedure,
   we demonstrate that our prediction model can achieve an accuracy rate of
   72.9\% (SD = 10.3\%) over 2 years using baseline MR images only, which
   is significantly higher than the 65.0\% (SD = 14.6\%) that is attained
   with the traditional MRI biomarker of lesion load.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of kidney volume is essential for clinical diagnoses
   and therapeutic decisions related to renal diseases. Existing kidney
   volume estimation methods rely on an intermediate segmentation step that
   is subject to various limitations. In this work, we propose a
   segmentation-free, supervised learning approach that addresses the
   challenges of accurate kidney volume estimation caused by extensive
   variations in kidney shape, size and orientation across subjects. We
   develop dual regression forests to simultaneously predict the kidney
   area per image slice, and kidney span per image volume. We validate our
   method on a dataset of 45 subjects with a total of 90 kidney samples. We
   obtained a volume estimation accuracy higher than existing
   segmentation-free (by 72 \%) and segmentation-based methods (by 82\%).
   Compared to a single regression model, the dual regression reduced the
   false positive area-estimates and improved volume estimation accuracy by
   41 \%. We also found a mean deviation of under 10\% between our
   estimated kidney volumes and those obtained manually by expert
   radiologists.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional task solution schemes in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are
   mainly not suitable for complicated task processing due to high energy
   consumption and long processing delay. In this paper, we proposed an
   energy efficient Complicated Task Solution scheme for real-time task
   processing based on node Cooperation (CTSC), which consists of two main
   phases: task grouping and task allocation. In the task grouping phase,
   complicated tasks are divided into different groups based on task graph.
   In the task allocation phase, based on node cooperation, different group
   tasks are allocated to different nodes by using bid invitation. Thus,
   multiple tasks can be processed in parallel, which ultimately reduces
   task processing delay and limits communication overheads. Simulation
   results show that CTSC is much more suitable for large scale WSNs. In
   addition, CTSC outperforms related works in terms of shorter response
   time of task processing and less energy consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Thiosulfate extraction of gold has sparked widespread interest in
   recovering gold from carbonaceous and copper-containing gold ores.
   However, thiosulfate ions are known to be dangerous corrosion promoters
   of structural materials. Accordingly, this study aims at characterizing
   the electrochemical corrosion performance of various structural steels
   in calcium thiosulfate and ammonium thiosulfate gold leaching solutions.
   The corrosion behavior was investigated using cyclic potentiodynamic
   polarization, open circuit potential monitoring, and electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy. It was found that the stainless steels, namely
   304L, 316L and duplex 2205, manifested no sign of pitting corrosion in
   the calcium thiosulfate leaching solution. Thiosulfate ions at a high
   concentration of 0.1 M in the calcium thiosulfate leaching solution
   played a protective role against pitting corrosion. In the ammonium
   thiosulfate leaching solution also, findings indicated the absence of
   pitting/localized corrosion for the duplex 2205 stainless steel. The
   thicknesses of the passive films formed on the stainless steels at
   different operating conditions were calculated using a variety of
   proposed electrochemical models and the obtained results were validated
   with ToF-SIMS experimental results. It was determined that the
   recently-developed power-law (P-L) model predicts the film thickness
   more accurately than the other models studied. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{The in-cell electrochemical synthesis of p-anisaldehyde
   (p-methoxybenzaldehyde PMA) was carried out by the redox mediated
   oxidation of p-methyoxytoluene (PMT), using the Ce(IV)/Ce(III) system
   with methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and a laboratory scale single-cell
   parallel plate electrochemical reactor (ECR) coupled to a stirred tank
   thermochemical reactor (TCR). To suppress a rapid rise in the operating
   voltage of the ECR its cathode was modified to a graphite felt covered
   by a micro-porous diaphragm. The performance of a full batch recycle
   process with the modified ECR was explored via factorial experiments at
   a superficial current density of 3150 Am-2 with the variables: acid
   concentration, temperature, phase volume ratio and PMT conversion.
   Contrary to conventional practice, the organic reaction products were
   not removed from the recycling electrolyte. In this case the highest
   yield of PMA was 28\%, the relatively poor performance being attributed
   to the accumulation of reaction products in the electrolyte. Rough
   economic estimates indicate that the cost of the main materials and
   energy for the in-cell method studied here, without optimization, is
   about 3 times that of the corresponding ex-cell process using a purified
   recycling electrolyte. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society. All rights

Abstract = {{The slip behavior of high-density polyethylenes (HDPEs) is studied over
   surfaces of different topology and surface energy. Laser ablation has
   been used to micro/nano-pattern the surface of dies in order to examine
   the effect of surface roughness on slip. In addition, fluoroalkyl
   silane-based coatings on smooth and patterned substrates were used to
   understand the effect of surface energy on slip. Surface roughness and
   surface energy effects were incorporated into the double reptation slip
   model (Ebrahimi et al., J. Rheol., 2015, 59, 885-901) in order to
   predict the slip velocity of studied polymers on different substrates.
   It was found that for dies with rough surfaces, polymer melt penetrates
   into the cavities of the substrate (depending on the depth and the
   distance between the asperities), thus decreasing wall slip. On the
   other hand, silanization of the surface increases the slip velocity of
   polymers in the case of smooth die, although it has a negligible effect
   on rough dies. Interestingly, the slip velocity of the studied polymers
   on various substrates of different degrees of roughness and surface
   energy, were brought into a mastercurve by modifying the double
   reptation slip velocity model.}},

Abstract = {{Computational imaging has recently attracted much attention due to its
   excellent potential in delivering advanced capabilities such as motion
   deblurring and high-speed compressive sensing. However, the development
   of computational cameras has been limited by the lack of a technology
   that can efficiently support temporal encoding. Conventionally, temporal
   encoding is performed by complicated off-chip optics such as split light
   modulators (SLMs). This results in camera systems with large physical
   sizes, performance degradation, and high power consumption. In this
   paper, we propose a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) pixel
   design that performs temporal optical binary encoding for on-chip,
   high-speed computational imaging applications. Compared to conventional
   high-speed imaging techniques, the proposed CMOS computational pixel is
   a promising approach for on-chip temporal encoding, enabling simpler
   camera optics and reduced power consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Its inherent economic and environmental advantages as an internal
   combustion engine fuel make natural gas (NG) an attractive alternative
   to diesel fuel as the primary energy source for some compression
   ignition (CI) engine applications. Diesel pilot-ignition of NG is an
   attractive fueling strategy as it typically requires minimal
   modification of existing CI engines. Furthermore, this strategy makes
   use of the highly developed direct injection (DI) diesel fuel systems
   already employed on modern CI engines for to control dual-fuel (DF)
   combustion. Despite the increasing popularity of the dual-fuel NG engine
   concept, the fundamental understanding of the fuel conversion mechanisms
   and the impact of the fueling parameters is still incomplete. A
   conceptual understanding of the relevant physics is necessary for
   further development of fueling and pilot-ignition strategies to address
   the shortcomings of dual-fuel combustion, such as low-load emissions and
   combustion stability.
   An experimental facility supporting optical diagnostics via a Bowditch
   piston arrangement in a 2-litre, single-cylinder research engine
   (Ricardo Proteus) was used in this study to consider the effect of
   fueling parameters on the fuel conversion process in a dual fuel engine.
   Fueling was achieved with port injected CH4 and diesel direct injection
   using a common rail system. Simultaneous, high-speed natural luminosity
   (NL) and OH{*} chemiluminescence imaging was used to characterize
   dual-fuel combustion and the influence of pilot injection pressure (300
   bar vs. 1300 bar) and relative diesel-Cat ratios (pilot ratio, PR), as
   these have been noted as key operating dual-fuel control metrics.
   The pilot injection pressure was observed to have a significant impact
   on the fuel conversion process. At higher pilot injection pressures, the
   auto-ignition sites were concentrated around the piston bowl periphery
   and the reaction zone propagated towards the center of the bowl. At
   lower pilot injection pressures, ignition initiated in the vicinity of
   the pilot fuel jet structures and resulted in a more heterogeneous fuel
   conversion process with regions of intense natural luminosity,
   attributed to particulate matter. An increase in the pilot ratio (i.e.,
   increased diesel fraction) resulted in a more aggressive combustion
   event, due to a larger fraction of energy released in a premixed
   auto-ignition event. This was coupled with a decrease in the fraction of
   the combustion chamber with significant OH{*} or NL light emission,
   indicating incomplete fuel conversion in these regions. The insight to
   the dual-fuel conversion processes presented in this work will be
   ultimately used to develop dual-fuel injection strategies, as well as
   provide much needed validation data for modeling efforts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the control of an active power filter (APF) based on
   a 3-phase, 3-level neutral point clamped (NPC) converter with selective
   harmonic compensation. To achieve the selective harmonic compensation,
   the APF use several synchronous rotatory frames, which are rotating at
   the angular frequency and sequence of their respective harmonics, to
   detect and control the magnitude and angle of each individual harmonic
   using d and q variables. A three dimensional space vector modulator
   (3D-SVPWM) is used to generate the compensation currents. Due to its
   multilevel topology, the proposed active power filter can be used in
   high voltage power quality applications, such as sub-transmission and
   distribution levels. Simulation results are shown to validate the
   proposed solution and corroborate the proper function of the multilevel

Abstract = {{Current passage in the ESR process is accomplished by at least two
   Faradaic reaction systems, one at the electrode/slag interface and
   another at the slag/ingot interface. The nature of these reactions has
   been investigated and is reported to be a function of the alloy
   composition, current density and slag composition. In this report, data
   generated from both DC and line-frequency AC ESR operations is used to
   relate laboratory investigations on these reactions to results obtained
   in industrial practice. The operating reaction in the line frequency AC
   melting of simple alloy steels is found to be principally the reversible
   anodic oxidation of iron (Fe/Fe2+). In the equivalent DC process there
   is in addition the cathodic deposition of aluminium, resulting in the
   formation of substantial amounts of D-type alumina inclusions in the
   ingot. The Faradaic reactions involve energy exchange which should be
   taken into account in the process energy balance. They also are likely
   to change the interface physical characteristics such as interfacial
   tension. The data is extended to the case of low frequency ESR furnaces
   in which it is found that the extent of the reactions is strongly
   dependent on current density. It is concluded that the presence of
   Faradaic reactions in low frequency furnaces is unlikely to lead to
   quality problems in the alloys and applications for which these
   processes are used. This conclusion appears to be supported by
   industrial practice and leads to a further conclusion that low frequency
   practices in large ESR furnaces could potentially be replaced by simpler
   DC systems.}},

Title = {{DEVELOPMENT OF A SIZE REDUCTION EQUATION FOR WOODY BIOMASS: THE

Journal = {{Transactions of the ASABE}},

Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{Size reduction is an essential but energy-intensive process for
   preparing biomass for conversion processes. Three well-known scaling
   equations (Bond, Kick, and Rittinger) are used to estimate energy input
   for grinding minerals and food particles. Previous studies have shown
   that the Rittinger equation has the best fit to predict energy input for
   grinding cellulosic biomass. In the Rittinger equation, Rittinger's
   constant (k(R)) is independent of the size of ground particles, yet we
   noted large variations in kR among similar particle size ranges. In this
   research, the dependence of k(R) on the physical structure and chemical
   composition of a number of woody materials was explored. Branches from
   two softwood species (Douglas fir and pine) and two hardwood species
   (aspen and poplar) were ground in a laboratory knife mill. The recorded
   data included power input, mass flow rate, and particle size before and
   after grinding. Nine material properties were determined: particle
   density, solid density (pycnometer and x-ray diffraction methods),
   microfibril angle, fiber coarseness, fiber length, and composition
   (lignin and cellulose glucan contents). The correlation matrix among the
   nine properties revealed high degrees of interdependence between
   properties. The k(R) value had the largest positive correlation (+0.60)
   with particle porosity across the species tested. Particle density was
   strongly correlated with lignin content (0.85), microfibril angle
   (0.71), fiber length (0.87), and fiber coarseness (0.78). An empirical
   model relating k(R) to particle density was developed.}},

Abstract = {{Economic affordability is a crucial factor for repairable systems.
   Previous work about economic life prediction of systems mainly concerned
   about cost models, regardless of system structure or components'
   relationship. In this paper, a new economic life prediction method has
   been proposed with combination of a maintenance model and an
   accumulative damage model. The maintenance model is to depict the
   repairable deteriorating components of system. Non-repairable
   components' degradation processes are described by the accumulative
   damage model. Each component failure threshold can be obtained by
   allocating system failure threshold based on the extensive theory. Then,
   the objective of minimizing total cost determines the economic life
   value of system. Finally, a pump example is presented to illustrate the
   procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid composite moulding (LCM) processes are of great interest to the
   advanced composites industry as it provides a means of efficiently
   processing complex parts with a process that can be automated. To design
   an LCM process a number of decisions must be made including constituent
   material selection, injection pressure, processing temperature, tool
   design, and ancillary equipment selection among others. There is
   currently no comprehensive methodology/workflow used to assess and/or
   design these processes. This paper lays out a structured approach for
   designing them.
   This approach combines a number of experimental characterization and
   simulation techniques to estimate the cycle time of an LCM process. The
   workflow begins by characterizing the constituent materials. Experiments
   to determine resin viscosity and cure kinetics, and fiber preform
   permeability are performed. Process simulation is employed to estimate
   the mould fill time as a function of temperature and compared to the
   resin working time vs temperature. The processing temperature and
   infusion time can then be determined. Once the processing temperature is
   identified, thermochemical analysis is performed to determine to the
   overall cycle time. A detailed explanation of this methodology and case
   study are presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate functional correlates of gamma band
   oscillations in low-noise EEG signals acquired in the LSBB shielded
   capsule and compare them to signals acquired in a typical hospital
   environment. Using a research-grade EEG acquisition system, we acquired
   64-channel EEG recordings from three volunteers performing several
   cognitive, sensory, and motor tasks in both LSBB and hospital settings.
   Time-frequency analysis on the signals acquired in both environments
   reveals that the task-induced increase in gamma band (> 30 Hz) energy
   relative to the resting state EEG is more prominent in signals acquired
   at LSBB, suggesting that task-specific changes in EEG are better
   reflected and more readily detected in signals acquired at LSBB. These
   results further demonstrate the potential value of low-noise settings
   such as the LSBB for conducting challenging high-frequency EEG studies.}},

Abstract = {{Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a key technology
   driving the 5G evolution. It relies on the use a large number of
   antennas at the base-station to improve network performance. The
   performance of massive MIMO systems is often limited by imperfect
   channel estimation because of pilot contamination. Recently, several
   channel estimation techniques have been proposed to minimize the
   performance degradation. However, the assessment of these techniques in
   the literature has often been conducted considering standard channel
   models, like the independent Rayleigh fading model and Clarke's
   multi-path model, which do not consider spatial correlation. In this
   work, we investigate different channel models used and proposed for
   massive MIMO transmission and, through numerical studies, highlight
   their effect on the performance of the aforementioned channel estimation
   techniques. Based on this we recommend the use of channel models that
   capture the spatial correlation between antennas and different user
   channels.}},

Abstract = {{The blind rendezvous, which requires neither Common Control Channel
   (CCC) nor the information of the target user's available channels, has
   recently attracted a lot of research interests. As a contribution to
   this research area, in this paper we propose a Sender-Jump Receiver-Wait
   blind rendezvous algorithm, which has fully satisfied the following
   requirements: 1) guaranteeing rendezvous; 2) realizing full rendezvous
   diversity, i.e., any pair of users can rendezvous on all commonly
   available channels; 3) requiring no time-synchronization; 4) supporting
   both symmetric and asymmetric models; 5) supporting multi-user/multi-hop
   scenarios and 6) consuming short Time-to-Rendezvous (TTR). Theoretical
   analysis and computer simulations have validated our algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, computational cameras have demonstrated superior
   performance in a variety of applications. Currently, optical encoding is
   implemented using components that are typically not integrated on the
   image sensor chip. This results in camera systems with large physical
   sizes, performance compromises, and implementation challenges,
   particularly in applications where size and power are constrained. In
   this paper, we propose a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
   pixel structure with bidirectional multi-level spatial coded exposure
   encoding capability for computational imaging. Based on a capacitive
   transimpedance amplifier (CTIA) core, the proposed pixel architecture
   achieves bidirectional multi-level optical encoding, and is compatible
   with monolithic CMOS implementation. Designed and laid out in a standard
   0.13-mu m CMOS process, the pixel occupies an area of 13.8 mu m x 13.8
   mu m with a fill factor of 30\%.}},

Abstract = {{The detection of agents whose responses satisfy equilibrium play is
   useful for predicting the dynamics of information propagation in social
   networks. Using Afriat's theorem of revealed preferences, we construct a
   non-parametric detection test to detect if the responses of a group of
   agents is consistent with play from the Nash equilibrium of a concave
   potential game. For agents that satisfy the detection test, it is useful
   to learn the associated concave potential function of the game. In this
   paper, a non-parametric learning algorithm is provided to estimate the
   concave potential function of agents with necessary and sufficient
   conditions on the response class for the algorithm to be a probably
   approximately correct learning algorithm. In the case of response
   signals measured in noise, a statistical test to detect agents playing a
   concave potential game that has a pre-specified Type-I error probability
   is provided. The detection tests and learning algorithm are applied to
   real-world data sets from the Twitter social network and the Ontario

Title = {{Before-After Safety Evaluation Using Full Bayesian Macroscopic
   Multivariate and Spatial Models}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2601}},
Pages = {{128-137}},
Abstract = {{Many studies have addressed spatial correlation in traffic collision
   modeling. It has been generally concluded that the inclusion of spatial
   correlation improves model goodness of fit and the precision of
   parameter estimates. However, the application in before-after safety
   evaluation has rarely been documented in the traffic safety literature.
   The objectives of the presented study were to (a) apply both the
   univariate and multivariate full Bayesian (FB) spatial models in before-
   after safety evaluation and (b) compare the results with those of
   nonspatial FB models. A reduction of the posted speed limit in urban
   residential neighborhoods in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada was used as a
   case study for the before-after safety evaluation. Yearly collision data
   and other neighborhood characteristics data were collected for a group
   of treated and reference neighborhoods to develop macroscopic models.
   The four models considered in this study were (a) Poisson-lognormal, (b)
   Poisson lognormal with conditional autoregressive (CAR) distribution,
   (c) multivariate Poisson- lognormal, and (d) multivariate Poisson
   lognormal with CAR distribution. The results showed that the
   multivariate Poisson lognormal with CAR distribution model for collision
   severities outperformed the other three models according to the deviance
   information criteria. Parameter estimates showed slight differences
   across the models. However, for the current data set, the results of the
   before-after safety evaluation showed similar findings across the
   models. Estimated collision reductions were 13\%, 24\%, and 12\% for
   total, severe, and property-damage-only collisions, respectively.}},

Pages = {{138-152}},
Abstract = {{This study conducted an automated safety diagnosis fora major signalized
   intersection in the city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The study was
   motivated by concerns raised about the potential safety implications of
   increasing the speed limit across the major road corridor of the
   intersection to 60 km/h from the current posted speed of 50 km/h. The
   diagnosis was performed with video data collected at the intersection
   for two consecutive days. Traffic conflicts at the location were
   identified, analyzed, and categorized according to such criteria as
   severity and road user type. Temporal and spatial violations were
   automatically identified. Automated data collection for traffic counts
   and travel speeds was performed and validated. It was observed that the
   high frequency of conflicts between vehicles and vulnerable road users
   (i.e., pedestrians and cyclists) and the presence of heavy vehicles
   could lead to more severe conflicts and possible collisions if the speed
   limit is raised. According to the outcome of the performed analysis, it
   was recommended that the existing speed limit not be raised, but kept at
   the current level. Several safety countermeasures were suggested to
   improve the safety at the intersection. This study demonstrated the
   practical application of automated traffic conflict analysis technology
   and its ability to help traffic engineers conduct a comprehensive safety
   assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the variance in the numerical precision requirements of
   Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) {[}1], {[}2], Stripes (STR), a hardware
   accelerator is presented whose execution time scales almost
   proportionally with the length of the numerical representation used. STR
   relies on bit-serial compute units and on the parallelism that is
   naturally present within DNNs to improve performance and energy with no
   accuracy loss. In addition, STR provides a new degree of adaptivity
   enabling on-the-fly trade-offs among accuracy, performance, and energy.
   Experimental measurements over a set of DNNs for image classification
   show that STR improves performance over a state-of- the-art accelerator
   {[}3] from 1.30x to 4.51x and by 1.92x on average with no accuracy loss.
   STR is 57\% more energy efficient than the baseline at a cost of 32\%
   additional area. Additionally, by enabling configurable, per-layer and
   per-bit precision control, STR allows the user to trade accuracy for
   further speedup and energy efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{In many graph applications, the structure of the graph changes
   dynamically over time and may require real time analysis. However,
   constructing a large graph is expensive, and most studies for large
   graphs have not focused on a dynamic graph data structure, but rather a
   static one. To address this issue, we propose DegAwareRHH, a high
   performance dynamic graph data store designed for scaling out to store
   large, scale-free graphs by leveraging compact hash tables with high
   data locality. We extend DegAwareRHH for multiple processes and
   distributed memory, and perform dynamic graph construction on large
   scale-free graphs using emerging `Big Data HPC' systems such as the
   Catalyst cluster at LLNL. We demonstrate that DegAwareRHH processes a
   request stream 206.5x faster than a state-of-the-art shared-memory
   dynamic graph processing framework, when both implementations use 24
   threads/processes to construct a graph with 1 billion edge insertion
   requests and 54 million edge deletion requests. DegAwareRHH also
   achieves a processing rate of over 2 billion edge insertion requests per
   second using 128 compute nodes to construct a large-scale web graph,
   containing 128 billion edges, the largest open-source real graph dataset
   to our knowledge.}},

Title = {{Channel Selection Policy in Multi-SU and Multi-PU Cognitive Radio
   Networks with Energy Harvesting for Internet of Everything}},
Journal = {{MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive radio, which will become a fundamental part of the Internet of
   Everything (IoE), has been identified as a promising solution for the
   spectrum scarcity. In a multi-SU and multi-PU cognitive radio network,
   selecting channels is a fundamental problem due to the channel
   competition among secondary users (SUs) and packet collision between SUs
   and primary users (PUs). In this paper, we adopt cooperative sensing
   method to avoid the packet collision between SUs and PUs and focus on
   how to collect the spectrum sensing data of SUs for cooperative sensing.
   In order to reduce the channel competition among SUs, we first consider
   the hybrid transmission model for single SU where a SU can
   opportunistically access both idle channels operating either the Overlay
   or the Underlay model and the busy channels by using the energy
   harvesting technology. Then we propose a competitive set based channel
   selection policy for multi-SU where all SUs competing for data
   transmission or energy harvesting in the same channel will forma
   competitive set. Extensive simulations show that the proposed
   cooperative sensing method and the channel selection policy outperform
   previous solutions in terms of false alarm, average throughput, average
   waiting time, and energy harvesting efficiency of SUs.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic circuit designers commonly start their design process with a
   schematic, namely an abstract representation of the physical circuit. In
   integrated photonics on the other hand, it is common for the design to
   begin at the physical component level, and create a layout by connecting
   components with interconnects. In this paper, we discuss how to create a
   schematic from the physical layout via netlist extraction, which enables
   circuit simulations. Post-layout extraction can also be used to predict
   how fabrication variability and non-uniformity will impact circuit
   performance. This is based on the component position information,
   compact models that are parameterized for dimensional variations, and
   manufacturing variability models such as a simulated wafer thickness
   map. This final step is critical in understanding how real-world silicon
   photonic circuits will behave. We present an example based on treating
   the ring resonator as a circuit. A silicon photonics design kit, as
   described here, is available for download at http://github.

   reduce the energy consumption of small cell networks. Considering the

   the radio frequency (RF) signal of the source node. The RF signal also
   carries information from the source to be forwarded via the relay to a
   destination in the presence of interference from unknown sources. We
   study the performance of three relaying protocols, the time switching
   relaying (TSR) protocol, the power splitting relaying (PSR) protocol and
   a proposed hybrid TSR-PSR protocol. Analytical expressions for the
   outage probability and throughput in the delay-sensitive transmission
   mode are derived for the three protocols. Using the derived expressions,
   we compare the throughput performances of these protocols. Our results
   demonstrate that the throughput of the hybrid protocol is generally

Abstract = {{With the deployment of small cell networks, low-cost backhaul schemes
   for small cell base stations (SBSs) have attracted great attentions.
   Self-backhaul using cellular communication technology is considered as a
   promising solution. Although some excellent works have been done on
   self-backhaul in small cell networks, most existing works do not
   consider the recent advances of full-duplex (FD) and massive
   multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) technologies. By jointly
   considering them, we propose a novel self-backhaul scheme for small cell
   networks in this paper, where the macro base station is equipped with
   massive MIMO antennas, and the SBSs have the FD communication
   capability. Then, we can achieve the simultaneous transmissions of the
   access link of users and the backhaul link of SBSs in the same frequency
   and then spectrum efficiency is improved. Furthermore, we formulate the
   power allocation problem of the MBS and SBSs as an optimization problem.
   Because the formulated power allocation problem is a non-convex problem,
   we transfer the original problem into a difference of convex program by
   using successive convex approximation method and variable substitution,
   and then solve it using a constrained concave convex procedure based
   iterative algorithm. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to
   verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technique for the
   fifth generation mobile communication due to its high spectrum
   efficiency. By applying superposition coding and successive interference
   cancellation techniques, multiple users can be multiplexed on the same
   subchannel in NOMA systems. Previous works focus on subchannel and power
   allocation to maximize the sum rate; however, the energy-efficient
   resource allocation problem has not been studied for NOMA systems. In
   this paper, we aim to optimize subchannel assignment and power
   allocation to maximize the energy efficiency for the downlink NOMA
   network. Assuming perfect knowledge of the channel state information at
   base station, we propose low-complexity suboptimal algorithms which
   include subchannel assignment and power allocation for subchannel users.
   In the power allocation scheme, difference of convex functions
   programming approach is exploited to transform and approximate the
   original optimal problem into a convex optimization problem. Simulation
   results show that our proposed algorithms yield much better improvements
   than orthogonal frequency division multiple in terms of sum rate and
   energy efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{In order to improve the energy efficiency of the optical wireless
   communications, a joint power allocation and relay selection scheme is
   proposed for a relay assisted non-line-of-sight optical wireless
   communication system employing coherent detection with a dual optical
   channel multiplexing technique. The proposed joint power allocation and
   relay selection scheme aims to improve energy efficiency of the optical
   wireless communication system by minimizing the total average transmit
   power, and provides the delay aware quality-of-service guarantee through
   maintaining a minimum required effective capacity over the atmospheric
   turbulence fading channels. The joint power allocation and relay
   selection problem is formulated as a non-convex and combinatorial
   optimization problem, and the solution of this optimization problem is
   obtained using a time-sharing relaxation technique. Subsequently, a
   fast-convergent algorithm is proposed for the joint power allocation and
   relay selection by considering the delay aware quality-of-service
   requirements of the services transmitted over the optical wireless
   communication channels. Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of
   the proposed joint power allocation and relay selection scheme in terms
   of the energy saving for different statistical delay constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Long Term Evolution (LTE) has been standardized by the 3GPP consortium
   since 2008 in 3GPP Release 8, with 3GPP Release 12 being the latest
   iteration of LTE Advanced (LTE-A), which was finalized in March 2015.
   High Efficiency Video Coding (H. 265) has been standardized by MPEG
   since 2012 and is the Video Compression technology targeted to deliver
   High-Definition (HD) and Ultra High-Definition (UHD) Video Content to
   users. With video traffic projected to represent the lion's share of
   mobile data traffic, providing users with high Quality of Experience
   (QoE) is key to designing 4G systems and future 5G systems. In this
   paper, we present a cross-layer scheduling framework which delivers
   frames to unicast video users by exploiting the encoding features of H.
   265. We extract information on frame references within the coded video
   bitstream to determine which frames have higher utility for the H. 265
   decoder located at the user's device and evaluate the performances of
   best-effort and video users in 4G networks using finite buffer traffic
   models. Our results demonstrate that there is significant potential to
   improve the QoE of all users compared to the baseline Proportional Fair
   method by adding media-awareness in the scheduling entity at the Medium
   Access Control (MAC) layer of a Radio Access Network (RAN).}},

   Information dissemination/sharing among vehicles is the fundamental goal

Abstract = {{Due to explosive demands of multimedia services from mobile users, the
   growing network traffic load becomes a severe challenge for mobile
   network operators (MNOs). To address this problem, content caching is
   regarded as an effective emerging technique to reduce the duplicated
   transmissions of the content downloads demanded by mobile users, while
   heterogeneous networks (HetNets) are regarded as an effective technique
   to increase the network throughput. Thus, this paper focuses on content
   caching in HetNets to offload the weighted network traffic, in which we
   consider the problem of minimizing the weighted expected sum of traffic
   load of accessing the requested contents. By transforming the irregular
   problem into a binary integer linear programming problem, we propose a
   novel suboptimal heuristic algorithm with polynomial-time complexity to
   solve the problem, instead of using the existing optimal
   branch-and-bound method with exponential-time complexity. Numerical
   results demonstrate that our proposed content caching framework can
   reduce the weighted expected sum of traffic load significantly.}},

   is formulated as a non-convex nonlinear programming problem which is

Abstract = {{Full duplex relaying, which allows relays to transmit and receive
   signals simultaneously, can improve the spectrum efficiency and extend
   the range of device-to-device (D2D) communications. Due to the limited
   battery of mobile devices, it is essential to design a power-efficient
   relay selection scheme which can reduce the power consumption of devices
   and extend their lifetime. In this paper, we consider multiple D2D user
   pairs utilize full duplex relays to communicate using directional
   antennas. We formulate the power-efficient relay selection problem as a
   combinatorial optimization problem to minimize the power consumption of
   the mobile devices. Using a matching approach, we transform the problem
   into a one-to-one weighted bipartite matching problem. We then propose a
   power-efficient relay selection algorithm for relay-assisted D2D
   networks called PRS-D2D based on the Hungarian method to obtain the
   optimal solution in polynomial time. Simulation results show that our
   proposed algorithm improves the total power consumption of mobile
   devices by up to 32\% comparing to an existing relay selection scheme in
   the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Network slicing enables mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) to
   lease network resources from a mobile network operator (MNO). The cloud
   radio access network (C-RAN) architecture reduces the capital and
   operational expenditures for the MNO and also facilitates MVNOs running
   virtual machines on the cloud server. In this paper, we propose a
   beamforming scheme that coordinates multiple remote radio heads (RRHs)
   in C-RAN to improve the quality of experience (QoE) of users by
   maximizing their aggregate weighted quality of service (QoS). We model
   the QoS of each mobile user by a sigmoidal function and formulate the
   beamforming design as a non-convex optimization problem. By introducing
   an interference threshold, we first develop an iterative algorithm to
   determine a suboptimal solution of the original problem. Based on
   simulation results, we then show that a suitable interference threshold
   can be obtained in an off-line manner such that the suboptimal solution
   is a close-to-optimal solution of the original non-convex problem.
   Simulation results also show that the proposed scheme can significantly
   improve the aggregate weighted QoS of the mobile users compared to the
   traditional design where the weighted system sum rate is maximized.}},

Abstract = {{The advances of network technology and mobile communication technology
   are making eHealth possible. In eHealth systems, physiological data and
   relevant context-aware data are acquired continuously and in real time.
   At the same time, such large-scale data results in huge challenges in
   the aspect of real-time big data processing since eHealth data appears
   in the form of data stream. Therefore, we propose a novel incremental
   learning algorithm, namely alpha-SVMSGD, which improves the SVMSGD
   (Support Vector Machine-Stochastic Gradient Descent) algorithm by
   updating the training data with the continuous data stream. Besides,
   this alpha-SVMSGD may handle the problem that original SVMSGD cannot
   further mine the useful information in unclassified data. In
   alpha-SVMSGD, the process of training data updating is completed by
   introducing the concept of forgetting mechanism, in which the forgetting
   factor alpha is introduced to weed out useless training data.
   alpha-SVMSGD is applied into ambient assisted living communications, and
   further incorporated into the data filtering layer of a local data
   processing architecture (LDPA) to reduce data redundancy. Simulation
   results confirm that the proposed algorithm is a promising data
   redundancy solution for classification without loss of accuracy in the

   candidate, but further study is required to understand its performance
   limitations. We examined the tradeoffs between number of arms, height,
   radius, and presence or absence of crossbars to bandwidth and radiation
   efficiency. Our principal findings include: 1. The bandwidth of the
   antenna is insensitive to increasing radius, and remains just shy of 2
   MHz. 2. Efficiency increases significantly with increasing radius while
   the presence of crossbars yields a marginal increase in efficiency. 3.
   At ULP heights, we are unable to effectively fill a Chu sphere. If we
   can relax the height restriction, the bandwidth can increase
   significantly and efficiency approaches 100\%.}},

Abstract = {{Performance bottlenecks related to a program's memory behavior are
   common, yet very hard to debug. Tools that attempt to aid software
   engineers in diagnosing these bugs are typically designed to handle
   specific use cases; they do not provide information to comprehensively
   explore memory problems and to find solutions. Detailed traces of memory
   accesses would enable developers to ask various questions about the
   program's memory behaviour, but these traces quickly become very large
   even for short executions. We present DINAMITE: a toolkit for Dynamic
   INstrumentation and Analysis for MassIve Trace Exploration. DINAMITE
   instruments every memory access with highly debug information and
   provides a suite of extensible analysis tools to aid programmers in
   pinpointing memory bottlenecks.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, measurements of full-scale freight train underbody
   aerodynamics relevant to top-of-rail spraying are presented. The
   velocity near the wheel was measured using hot wire anemometers mounted
   on the train. The pressure was measured using transducers mounted
   adjacent to the track. Velocity scaled linearly with locomotive speed
   and pressure scaled linearly with dynamic pressure, implying negligible
   Reynolds number effects. The mean velocity near the wheels was less than
   half of the locomotive speed when the vehicle moved at or greater than
   the ambient wind speed. The velocity upwind of the wheel was 30\%
   greater than downwind of the wheel. These mean velocities are consistent
   with computational fluid dynamics simulations of the flow field in the
   vicinity of the wheel. Turbulence intensity levels were measured to be
   0.08-0.16. The pressure at the track depends on the configuration of the
   leading car; the maximum pressure drop was 65\% greater when the hopper
   car preceded the locomotive compared to when the locomotive preceded the
   hopper car.}},

Abstract = {{Cache misses are problematic in real-time systems because they are
   unpredictable. Therefore, smaller codes that can fit in on-chip fast
   memories will help get rid of caches. However, reducing RISC
   applications code size is not an easy task because traditional RISC
   instruction sets have fixed length instructions compared to the higher
   density CISC instruction sets that use variable length instructions. A
   solution used in modern RISC processors is to combine mixed length
   instruction sets to achieve code densities comparable to if not higher
   than CISC without any performance degradation. To further enhance the
   code density of mixed length RISC instruction sets we add a number of
   8-bit instructions to a 16-bit RISC instruction set and use novel
   techniques such as static compression of immediate values to compensate
   for the limited number of bits available for instruction encoding. The
   addition of 8-bit instructions combined with the proposed novel
   techniques reduces RISC code size by as much as 30\% without degrading
   performance while using less than 5\% additional hardware. Total
   processor power is reduced by 10\%.}},

Abstract = {{Six-phase synchronous machines are utilized in special applications,

   advantages in transient simulation programs such as capability of
   interfacing with arbitrary networks without snubber circuits and reduced

   circuit phase-domain model (CCPD). This paper presents a VBR model of a
   six-phase synchronous machine that considers stator mutual inductances
   and main flux saturation. Performance of the proposed saturable VBR
   model is investigated in a hybrid ac-dc generation system. Simulation

Abstract = {{Self-Organizing Networks (SON) is an advancing technology in wireless
   communication systems, which employs various algorithms to improve the
   network performance and reduce the network maintenance cost. The SON is
   an integral part of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long
   Term Evolution (LTE) standard. The SON processing can be centralized,
   distributed or a hybrid of these two schemes. In this paper, we consider
   a centralized LTE SON and provide a mechanism to improve both the
   coverage and capacity of the LTE network by tuning two parameters at
   each base-station (eNB) a) transmit power and b) antenna electrical
   downtilt. Since the process of finding the optimal values for these
   parameters is highly complex owing to the large solution space, we
   propose to use the popular machine-learning technique of simulated
   annealing to solve this problem. We show that our mechanism results in
   more than 34\% increase in network coverage and 21\% increase in network
   capacity when compared to the scheme of using average values for eNB
   transmit power and antenna electrical downtilt. Also, our simulated
   annealing based solution is 4dB more power efficient than the
   aforementioned scheme.}},

   disturbance forces. With the simplifying assumption of the
   vertically-moving cylindrical platform and buoyant mass, a state-space
   model is obtained, and a linear quadratic Gaussian controller is
   designed based on the model. Simulation results demonstrate not only the
   efficiency of the proposed control method for mitigating the platform
   oscillation, but also for its potential benefit to capture wave energy.}},

Abstract = {{The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a self-report questionnaire
   consisting of 21 question items, has been the most extensively used for
   depression assessment. The problem of interest here is to identify a
   subset of questions in the BDI that are most predictive of depression
   and can reveal gender differences between depression profiles. We
   investigate feature selection techniques to select a subset of items in
   the BDI for depression identification and suggest a new simple
   decision-making rule that yields high classification accuracy. Distinct
   features in the BDI are identified for depression assessment in men and
   women. For males, the most useful features include mood, loss of libido,
   work inhibition, self-accusation, social withdrawal while
   indecisiveness, mood, work inhibition, distortion of body image, crying
   are most useful for depression identification in females.}},

Abstract = {{Load forecasting is essential in planning and operation of smart grid
   systems. Short term load forecasting (STLF) plays an important role from
   the generation perspectives. Existing methods of STLF are needed to

   propose a method of STLF to update the trained model without remodeling
   by using online support vector regression (SVR) algorithm. In online
   SVR, changes of model parameters due to new training samples are updated
   in finite number of steps so that it meets the SVR optimization
   criteria. Real world data set of residential buildings in an area of
   Surrey, British Columbia is used to verify the system's performance and

   positioning is achieved by adjusting the aerodynamic force of the wind

   instant, a proportional velocity feedback controller compensates the
   reference tracking error by setting the nacelle yaw angle and the blade
   pitch angle so that the net force is to achieve the desired velocity
   correction. The proposed control strategy is validated using a

Abstract = {{Cooperative driving improves vehicle safety and the driving experience
   by adapting the vehicle performance to the surrounding traffic.
   Communication of accurate and timely information obtained from multiple
   in-vehicle sensors, other vehicles and nearby infrastructure is
   essential to guarantee the robustness and reliable performance of the
   cooperative driving system. However, processing the information in
   cooperative systems is challenging because of the volume of the
   information, interaction of the vehicles, and increased sensitivity to
   reliable information due to potential liabilities and legal issues. In
   this research, we tackle the challenges associated with the reliability
   and accuracy of the vehicle position, velocity and attitude vector by
   fusing inertial navigation system (INS) and global positioning system
   (GPS) sensor data, resolving common GPS problems such as blockage and
   multipath. Being able to provide accurate and reliable sensor

   Timely diagnosis of BCC is an important factor in the prognosis of the

   Detection and recognition of cutaneous vasculature provide critical
   information on diagnosis accuracy and assessment precision. In this
   paper, we present an effective method to extract vascular information
   towards lesion diagnosis. Given a dermoscopy image, we first segment
   vascular structures of the lesion by decomposing the image using
   independent component analysis into melanin and hemoglobin components
   and feather applying shape filters at different scales. A vessel mask is
   generated as a result of global thresholding. A set of vascular features
   are then extracted from the final vessel image of the lesion and fed
   into a Random Forest classifier. The method demonstrates performance of
   90.3\% in terms of AUC in differentiating BCC from benign lesions.}},

Abstract = {{Inferring interactions between discrete brain regions has being
   increasingly recognized as important for studying brain in both normal
   and disease states. In addition to static brain network inference, the
   temporal dynamics of brain connectivity access the brain in the temporal
   dimension and provide a new perspective to the understanding of brain
   function. Most current brain network modeling approaches are based on
   assumptions that brain connections are purely static or purely dynamic.
   This may be unrealistic as the brain must strike a balance between
   stability and flexibility. In this paper, we propose making joint
   inference of time invariant connections and time varying coupling
   patterns by employing a multitask learning model followed by a least
   square approach to precisely estimate the connectivity coefficients.
   When applied to a real resting state fMRI study, the eigenconnectivity
   networks were extracted to obtain the representative patterns of both
   static and dynamic brain connectivity networks. The results demonstrated
   that the static and dynamic connectivity networks may represent
   complementary information on the brain connectivity patterns.}},

   smart sensors and machines communicate through amalgamating multivaried
   protocols and devices such as Zigbee, Bluetooth, Radio Frequency
   Identification (RFID) and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). IoT systems,
   requires sensing, gathering, storing, processing and transmitting of
   data from real time sensors as well as virtual online sensors. Thus,
   energy efficiency and robust data delivery to users are the key
   requirements. In this paper, we introduce active RFID tags based cluster
   head (CH) selection, data-awareness and energy harvesting in the IoT
   systems. The results show that the IoT based WSN heterogeneous systems
   are better equipped to deal with energy efficiency and data delivery
   problems. Simulation results support our proposed method and show
   significant improvement over state-of-the art techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Food is an inseparable part of people's lives. Food image recognition
   has been attracting increasing attention due to the advances of
   Internet, imaging techniques and social media. Approaches for food image
   recognition are mainly focused on two main directions: low-level
   approaches and mid-level approaches. Low-level approaches extract
   low-level local features, such as SIFT or SURF, following feature
   encoding techniques. Mid-level approaches extract higher-level image
   parts and have shown promising results in many recognition problems.
   Compared with other image recognition problems, food images are highly
   deformable with large infra-class variance and small between-class
   variance. In this paper, considering that mid-level approaches' superior
   performance and superpixels segmentation methods' ability to
   successfully segment food parts, we propose a superpixel-based food
   image recognition framework to mine mid-level superpixel food
   parts-to-class similarity. We evaluate the proposed framework on UEC
   Food dataset, and show promising results when compared with existing
   state-of-the-art methods.}},

   Traditional methods that rely on the use of first-principle models are

   methods offer an efficient way to learn models for quality prediction,
   in which the meaningful process information can be learned directly from
   large amounts of measured process data at different stages. In this

   for vector quantization (VQ) of two-dimensional RGB images. Unlike
   existing techniques, this method uses hexagonal blocks instead of the
   traditional rectangular ones, to partition the image. This results in
   higher image quality and lower perceptual artifacts. Experimentally, for
   similar compression rates, the use of hexagonal instead of rectangular
   blocks shows an improvement of 9.08\%, 7.61\%, 13.18\%, and 13.46\% in
   the MSE of the K-means, Linde-Buzo Gray(LBG), Kekre's Fast Codebook

Abstract = {{Parcellation of brain imaging data is desired for proper neurological
   interpretation in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (rs-fMRI) data. Some methods require specifying a number of parcels and
   using model selection to determine the number of parcels on a rs-fMRI
   dataset. However, this generalization does not lit with all subjects in
   a given dataset. A method has been proposed using parametric formulas
   for the distribution of modularity in random networks to determine the
   statistical significance between parcels. In this paper, we propose an
   agglomerative clustering algorithm using parametric formulas for the
   distribution of modularity in random networks, coupled with a false
   discovery rate (FDR) controller to parcellate rs-fMRI data. The proposed
   method combines FDR to reduce the number of false positives and
   incorporates spatial information to ensure the regions are spatially
   contiguous. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed FDR controlled
   method yields more accurate results when compared with existing methods.
   We also applied the proposed method to real a rs-fMRI dataset and found
   that it obtained higher reproducibility compared to the Ward
   hierarchical clustering method.}},

Abstract = {{As the global population ages, assisted living technologies for the
   elderly are becoming more popular. A person normally performs activities
   of daily living (ADLs) on a regular basis. A person's ability to perform
   recurring ADLs indicates the person's wellness. Anomalies in activity
   patterns of a person might indicate changes in the person's wellness. A
   method is proposed in this paper for detecting anomalies in activity
   patterns of a lone occupant using his/her electricity consumption data.
   The proposed method infers anomalies in activity patterns of an occupant
   from electricity consumption patterns instead of explicitly monitoring
   the underlying individual activities. The proposed method provides a
   score which is a quantitative assessment of anomalies in electricity
   consumption pattern of an occupant for a given day. A survey was
   conducted to obtain the hourly activities of three lone occupants for a
   month. From the survey, the level of suspicion values which are
   quantitative assessments of anomalies in activity patterns of the
   occupants were deduced. Using Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering with
   Euclidean distance measure, the scores and level of suspicion values
   were clustered respectively. A day was then classified as regular or
   irregular from an electricity consumption perspective (score) and an
   activity perspective (level of suspicion value) respectively. Our
   results show that anomalies in electricity consumption patterns
   correlate well with anomalies in the underlying activity patterns.}},

   injections (generation or load) in a distribution network, while
   respecting power system performance requirements. In the setting that we
   study, performance requirements are constraints in the form of interval
   ranges on the values that line flows can take, which are modelled by a
   convex poloytope. At its core, the proposed method relies on the
   solution of a linearly constrained least-squares optimization problem,
   which is formulated using sensitivity factors computed by linearizing
   the power flow equations around the operating point. Since this
   optimization problem admits a linear closedform solution, the polytope
   of permissible line flows is propagated through the solution, via set
   operations, to obtain the set of feasible nodal injections.}},

Abstract = {{As all kinds of transducers are being connected in different IoT
   (Internet of Things) applications, varied sensor data need to be
   collected and transmitted via network for further processing. To
   facilitate the process for signal or data treatment, there is the need
   to regulate a protocol for the local data processing for a smart
   transducer in terms of its computational capabilities. This paper
   reports the work on developing ISO/IEC/IEEE P21451-001 standard for
   signal and data treatment in smart transducer applications. The overall
   architecture for the standard and a two-layer implementation is
   described. The key algorithm, i.e. real-time segmentation and labeling
   (RTSAL) is illustrated with an example. The role of P21451-001 in the
   whole standard is highlighted and understood.}},

Abstract = {{Time history analysis is becoming the routine process to quantify the
   response of the structure under dynamic loads. In this paper, a novel
   two-step unconditionally stable explicit integration algorithm, named
   Unconditional Stable Two-Step Explicit Displacement Method (USTEDM), is
   proposed for vibration analysis of structure. USTEDM is unconditionally
   stable, requires low memory, produces no overshoot, and is third order
   accurate. The accuracy and efficiency of USTEDM are presented and
   compared with other commonly used integration algorithms. The result
   shows that the proposed algorithm has superior performance and can be
   used efficiently in solving vibration response of civil engineering

Abstract = {{Personal cloud services are emerging as a disruptive technology for
   tools and services that use digital media assets. As the shift to a
   bring-your-own-device and app workplace becomes commonplace, the
   opportunity exists to leverage these personal services to create
   enterprise scale approaches. However, a key limiting feature is the
   ability to provide private and secure assets, whether they are photos,
   videos, audio and text in a unified way layered on top of personal cloud
   services. We discuss an approach to support this shift and iIIustrate
   its feasibility using a prototype secure email service that is layered
   on top of a popular unsecured cloud service. One of the primary benefits
   of our approach is that companies can create secure enterprise services
   on top of a third party cloud used by individuals alleviating the need
   for a complex IT infrastructure for digital media assets. These
   solutions are particularly relevant for emerging markets.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the implementation of a heart motion compensation
   system on the da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical Inc.) with
   the da Vinci Research Kit, for the purpose of simulating minimally
   invasive coronary artery bypass surgery on the beating heart. A Novint
   Falcon device is used to simulate the motion of the coronary bypass
   site. The 3D position of the heart simulator is measured optically in
   real time using an NDI Optotrak Certus tracker. The NDI measurements are
   used to command the da Vinci patient side manipulators to track, from a
   fixed distance, the simulated heart surface. Visual stabilization is
   achieved by having a stereo endoscopic camera carried by another
   patient-side manipulator that is also tracking the heart surface. The
   system performance is evaluated and discussed. In a preliminary
   evaluation study, surgeons were asked to perform a bimanual
   teleoperation suturing task on the simulated heart, with the gold
   standard being a suturing task on a stationary surface. When motion
   compensation was enabled, the median completion time dropped from 1.24
   to 1.07 of the gold standard, the number of errors was reduced, and
   subjective measures show higher preference for the use of motion
   compensation in the da Vinci controllers.}},

Abstract = {{Diode rectifier circuits are often used as front-end stage in many
   electronic loads in ac power systems. Average-value modeling (AVM) has
   been indispensible for studying power electronic systems, wherein the
   complicated switched sub-circuit may be substituted by appropriate
   non-switching average sub-circuit with dependent/controllable sources
   and other circuit elements. For time-domain transient simulation, the
   rectifier AVMs are developed using analytical derivations in transformed
   qd coordinates, and such models do not cover wide range of operating
   conditions as well as being difficult to interface with external ac
   network which is represented in abc phase coordinates/variables. In this
   paper, a new parametric AVM of diode rectifier circuit for nodal
   analysis EMTP-Type solution is proposed. The new model is directly
   interfaced and solved simultaneously with the ac network. The proposed
   model is verified against the detailed model and the previously
   established analytical AVM, and shown to have an improved accuracy in
   wider range of operating conditions.}},

   rectifiers are designed to operate either as class-B or class-C
   synchronous rectifiers. In one design, a zero-threshold voltage device
   is shunted by a positive threshold device to provide rectification at
   very low RF input power levels. At low power, the zero-threshold device
   operates in the class-B mode, and once the RF input power is large
   enough, the second device starts to rectify in the class-C mode. A
   second design operates entirely in the class-C mode and provides good
   rectification for RF power levels above 0 dBm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the practically important problem of top-k queries,
   which is to find the top k largest categories and their corresponding
   sizes. In this paper, we propose a Top-k Query (TKQ) protocol and a
   technique that we call Segmented Perfect Hashing (SPH) for optimizing
   TKQ. Specifically, TKQ is based on the framed slotted Aloha protocol.
   Each tag responds to the reader with a Single-One Geometric (SOG) string
   using the ON-OFF Keying modulation. TKQ leverages the length of
   continuous leading 1s in the combined signal to estimate the
   corresponding category size. TKQ can quickly eliminate the sufficiently
   small categories, and only needs to focus on a limited number of
   large-size categories that require more accurate estimation. We conduct
   rigorous analysis to guarantee the predefined accuracy constraints. To
   further improve time-efficiency, we propose the SPH scheme, which
   improves the average frame utilization of TKQ from 36.8\% to nearly
   100\% by establishing a bijective mapping between tag categories and
   slots. To minimize the overall time cost, we optimize the key parameter
   that trades off between communication cost and computation cost.
   Experimental results show that our TKQ+SPH protocol not only achieves
   the required accuracy constraints, but also achieves a 2.6 similar to 7x
   faster speed than the existing protocols.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a stacked multiple coil design for simultaneous
   multi-parameter narrow-band sensing with RLC-type near-field coupled
   resonators. The resonant frequency and Q-factor of each RLC sensor is
   dependent on change of stored energy and loss in response to the
   parameter of interest. One challenge with these types of sensors is
   mutual coupling between coils and thus interdependence of parameters. In
   order to null mutual coupling between coils and reduce sensing area the
   coils are stacked in a designed overlapping configuration. The
   configuration enables the response of each sensor and thus sensed
   parameters to be independent. The swept frequency impedance response of
   an interrogator coil, inductively coupled to the sensors, remotely
   tracks the parameters of each sensor. EM simulation and experiments with
   a two-parameter (relative humidity and temperature) sensor shows the
   stacked overlapping structure accomplishes narrow-band multi-parameter
   sensing without substantial increase in size. The approach has
   application in flexible thin-film substrate printed sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work has shown how multi-ported RAMs can be built out of
   dual-ported RAMs. Such techniques combine two structures: a set of
   ``data banks{''} to hold the data, and a method for selecting the bank
   containing the last-written data, often called a live-value table (LVT).
   Most previous work has focused on the design of the LVT to reduce area
   and improve performance. In this paper, we instead reduce area by
   optimizing the design of the ``data banks{''} portion. The optimization
   is embedded into a memory compiler that solves a set cover problem. When
   the set cover problem is solved optimally, the data banks use minimum
   area. Our technique applies to multi-ported RAMs that have a structural
   pattern we describe as ``switched ports{''}. Switched ports are a
   generalization of true ports, where a certain number of write ports can
   be dynamically switched into a possibly different number of read ports
   using one common read/write control signal. Furthermore, a given
   application may have multiple sets, each set with a different read/write
   control. While previous work generates multi-port RAM solutions that
   contain only true ports, or only simple ports, we contend that using
   only these two models is too limiting and prevents optimizations from
   being applied. Experimental results on 10 random instances of multi-port
   RAMs show 17\% BRAM reduction on average compared to the best of other
   approaches. The compiler and a fully parameterized Verilog
   implementation is released as an open source library. The library has
   been extensively tested using Altera's EDA tools.}},

Abstract = {{Color pixel encoding optimizes the conversion of linear physical values
   of light into integer values. The efficiency of such encoding methods
   depends on a trade-off between the bit-depth used and the visible
   distortion introduced by quantization. This efficiency for different
   color pixel encoding approaches has been evaluated in literature,
   without considering the fact that before transmission to the end-user,
   color encoded content needs to be compressed using a video codec. Thus,
   to be efficient, a color pixel encoding scheme needs not only to achieve
   the lowest bit-depth, but also to allow for efficient video compression
   ratio. Yet, when compressing dark video sequences, the most efficient
   color pixel encoding scheme known as Y'DuDv requires much higher
   bit-rates, hence negating its high encoding efficiency. In this article,
   we propose a chroma scaling technique that adaptively restricts the
   bit-depth of the chroma channels for optimized encoding of High Dynamic
   Range content. Results show that the proposed scaling reduces Y'DuDv
   bit-rate requirements for dark content while preserving its high color
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope Corporation (CFHT) plans to repurpose
   its observatory on the summit of Maunakea and operate a (60 segment)
   11.25m aperture wide field spectroscopic survey telescope, the Maunakea
   Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE). The prime focus telescope will be equipped
   with dedicated instrumentation to take advantage of one of the best
   sites in the northern hemisphere and offer its users the ability to
   perform large surveys.
   Central themes of the development plan are reusing and upgrading
   wherever possible. MSE will reuse the CFHT site and build upon the
   existing observatory infrastructure, using the same building and
   telescope pier as CFHT, while minimizing environmental impact on the
   summit. MSE will require structural support upgrades to the building to
   meet the latest building seismic code requirements and accommodate a new
   larger telescope and upgraded enclosure. It will be necessary to replace
   the current dome since a larger slit opening is needed for a larger
   telescope. MSE will use a thermal management system to remove heat
   generated by loads from the building, flush excess heat from lower
   levels, and maintain the observing environment temperature.
   This paper describes the design approach for redeveloping the CFHT
   facility for MSE. Once the project is completed the new facility will be
   almost indistinguishable on the outside from the current CFHT
   observatory. Past experience and lessons learned from CFHT staff and the
   astronomical community will be used to create a modern, optimized, and
   transformative scientific data collecting machine.}},

Pages = {{7415-7422}},
Abstract = {{Numerous different delivery systems have been developed for local
   administration of drugs. However, their service lives generally depend
   on the payload depletion time and most of them are designed for one time
   use due to lack of drug replenishment abilities. To address this issue,
   a refillable magnetic porous polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) capsule is
   proposed for remotely controlled drug delivery applications. An inner
   cavity is built in the sponge scaffold to provide space for drug storage
   and the refilling is accomplished by injecting drugs with a syringe. The
   rapid and reversible deformation of the magnetic porous structure under
   a magnetic field offers a controlled pumping force to push drugs out of
   the capsule. In this work, low molecular weight (methylene blue, MB, 320
   g mol(-1)) and high molecular weight (bovine serum albumin, BSA, 67 000
   g mol(-1)) molecules were used as model compounds to test and verify the
   operational principle. This proof-of-concept study has demonstrated the
   capability of the refillable porous capsule in controlled drug delivery
   under external magnetic stimuli.}},

Title = {{An Indoor Ultrasonic Positioning System Based on TOA for Internet of
   Things}},
Journal = {{MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{With the development of Internet of Things, the position information of
   indoor objects becomes more important for most application scenarios.
   This paper presents an ultrasonic indoor positioning system, which can
   achieve centimeter-level precise positioning of objects moving indoors.
   Transmitting nodes, receiving nodes, and display control terminal are
   needed to constitute the entire system. The system is based on
   long-baseline positioning technology that uses code division
   multiplexing access mechanism. There is no limit to the number of
   receiving nodes as the system works in the up-transmit-down-receive
   mode. Positioning of a receiving node is found based on ultrasonic Time
   of Arrival ranging technology. To accurately determine the positioning,
   theremust be at least four or five transmitting nodes. The working
   radius will not be less than 5 meters when the height is larger than 3
   meters. The system uses wideband pseudorandom noise signal called Gold
   sequences for multiuser identification and slant rangemeasurement. The
   paper first gives a brief introduction of popular indoor ultrasonic
   positioningmethods and then describes the theory of proposed algorithm
   and provides the simulation results. To examine the correctness of the
   approach and its practicality, the practical implementation and
   experimental results are provided also in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Automated computer vision video analysis techniques were used to analyze
   video data during the operation of New York City's Summer Streets
   Program at a major signalized intersection. The main objectives of this
   study were to diagnose pedestrian and cyclist safety issues during the
   shared space operation and to demonstrate the feasibility of the
   automatic extraction of road user data (e.g., pedestrian, runner,
   rollerblader, or cyclist) required for microscopic behavior analysis.
   Road users' speeds and pedestrian gait parameters (step frequency and
   step length) were automatically extracted and analyzed. Results show
   that pedestrian walking speed was highest during the Summer Streets
   operation (1.49 +/- 0.54 m/s) because pedestrians had more street space
   to use and slowest during normal operations (1.30 +/- 0.22 m/s). Bike
   speeds were low during the Summer Streets event (3.62 +/- 0.97 m/s),
   likely because of interaction with pedestrians, but these speeds
   increased during normal traffic operations. Pedestrians and cyclists
   moving in groups tended to be slower and confirmed results found in
   previous studies. The safety analysis was conducted with traffic
   conflict techniques. It was observed that the lowest rate of conflicts
   between pedestrians and cyclists and between cyclists was found to be
   during Summer Streets operations. In addition, an analysis of spatial
   violations showed that some road users were not observing traffic rules
   in the transition period after Summer Streets ceased to operate.}},

Abstract = {{Matrix converters are becoming increasingly considered in AC-AC energy
   conversion applications where they can supply loads with variable
   voltages in a broad range of frequencies. For simulation of power
   systems, detailed models of these switching converters can be utilized.
   Despite providing high accuracy, the detailed models introduce a large
   number of discrete switching events in the simulation. Handling all the
   repeated switching slows down the simulation, creating a great challenge
   for system-level computer studies. To alleviate this computational
   burden, the so-called parametric average-value modeling (PAVM) technique
   has been developed to provide sufficiently accurate and fast models of
   power electronic converters. In the past, the PAVM has been extensively
   developed for DC-DC and AC-DC converters and systems with their
   applications. In this paper, the PAVM methodology is extended to model
   AC-AC matrix converters. Excellent accuracy and superior numerical
   performance of the proposed PAVM of matrix converter are verified
   against the detailed model.}},

   based on redesigning the existing LED converter controller to
   absorb/cancel a specific harmonic current injected by other devices.
   This can be further exploited in conjunction with the energy management
   system (EMS) and advanced control network, where a smart meter can
   inform the LED converters of the harmonic currents to be canceled. A
   maximum capability of injecting individual harmonics by the LED
   converter is estimated for the 3rd, 5th, and 7th significant harmonics
   currents. Simulation results are demonstrated to verify the

Abstract = {{This paper covers two proof of principle trials in an ongoing project to
   develop a fast, portable, and low-cost optical probe that uses Stokes
   polarimetry to evaluate skin lesions. Polarization is a property of
   light waves that describes the orientation and shape of their
   oscillations. The polarization state can be described using Stokes
   parameters, and several measurements derived from these parameters such
   as the degree of polarization, the azimuth and ellipticity angles of the
   polarization ellipse, and the coordinates on a Poincare sphere. The
   probe shines low-intensity polarization-controlled laser light at a
   lesion, and analyzes the backscattered light in order to detect how the
   light's polarization has been changed due to the light-tissue
   interaction. Testing with skin phantoms has demonstrated a relationship
   between phantom roughness and the degree of polarization. Preliminary
   testing on an in-vivo lesion showed that lesion sites demonstrated a
   lower degree of polarization as compared to normal skin. These results
   indicate our progress towards the development of a powerful and
   practical tool to assist skin lesion evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{The robot path planning for forming complex parts is one of the key
   techniques in coaxial laser cladding powder. In this paper, a method of
   automatic robot path generation from CAD (computer aided design) is
   proposed. The size information and topological information of the CAD
   model are extracted. The redundant vertexes are removed. The new
   vertexes are ordered and traversed by binary tree algorithm model. The
   topological relations between vertexes, edges and faces are established.
   The CAD model and the robot path are displayed with OpenGL. The
   comparison and analysis between contour planning and hyperbolic curve
   planning are completed. The simulation shows the feasibility and
   validity of the path generation based on CAD. A new way of automatic
   robot path generation from CAD model is given and the efficiency of the
   robot cladding is improved.}},

Abstract = {{The state-space model-based control design for a two-area interconnected
   AC electric power system using the linear quadratic gaussian (LQG)
   controller is realized in this paper. In industry, the classical
   integer-order proportional-integral (PI) and
   proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers have been broadly
   adopted for automatic generation control (AGC). The conventional PI and
   PID controllers leverage area control error (ACE) measurements to
   eliminate steady-state errors in frequency and tie-line interchange
   active-power flow. This paper presents a comparison amongst the dynamic
   response of the conventional PI controller and observer-based servo
   controllers designed using pole placement as well as LQG techniques. The
   overarching goal of this work is to improve the dynamic response of AGC
   systems through an optimal control method, namely, LQG. This paper
   investigates AGC systems for interconnected power systems and shows that
   LQG controllers perform better than both the classical PI controller as
   well as the observer-based one designed using pole placement.}},

Title = {{Effects of organic liquids on coking properties of a higher-inert

Abstract = {{The effect of organic liquids (white spirit, perchloroethylene and
   methylene bromide) typically used in float/sink gravity separations
   (specific gravity 1.4-1.8) on the fundamental properties of a
   higher-inert Western Canadian metallurgical coal of mvb rank (Romax
   1.22) and its resultant coking ability were examined. Over a 6-month
   period, untreated (control) and treated coal were characterized using a
   wide range of analyses including elemental chemistry, FTIR spectroscopy,
   alkali extraction via light transmittance test and thermal rheology,
   specifically fluidity, Dilatation, FSI and Caking Index G. Exposure to
   organic liquids was found to have a minor effect on coal chemistry
   (Ultimate) and oxidation level (Alkali Extraction via Light Transmission
   Test and FTIR-Spectroscopy). Trends of H/C, O/C, Light Transmittance and
   FTIR absorbance spectra versus storage time, following initial 1 h
   exposure to the organic liquids of varying specific gravities, revealed
   only minor changes, within the scatter/accuracy of the measurements.
   However, several coal plastic properties were decreased significantly
   including Gieseler Maximum Fluidity, Dilatation and G Caking Index. Of
   these, most affected was Maximum Fluidity which underwent an immediate
   and dramatic decrease of over 80\% following organic liquids treatment.
   Other rheology indicators including FSI and Sapozhnikov were
   significantly less sensitive in detecting initial stages of degradation
   in plastic properties. The coking ability of both the untreated and
   treated coal in perchloroethylene (PCE) organic liquid, s.g. 1.6, after
   storage for 1 and 6 months was assessed through carbonization trials in
   both a small-scale sole-heated oven (12.5 kg capacity) and in a
   pilot-scale movable wall oven (350 kg capacity) at CanmetENERGY
   Carbonization facility, Ottawa, Canada. The treated samples had
   appreciably poorer quality ambient (ASTM, IRSID, JIS tumbler tests) and
   hot (CSR, CRI) coke strength and modified coke structure. Coke ASTM
   strength for untreated and treated coal at time 1 month was respectively
   decreased from 62 down to 57 for Stability and from 72 to 67 for
   Hardness. Similarly, Coke CSR and CRI for untreated and treated coal at
   time 1 month was respectively decreased from 74 down to 58 and increased
   from 21 to 29. The treated sample resulted in a lower coke yield, 71\%,
   in comparison with 78\% for the untreated sample, produced coke of
   smaller mean size, 46 mm, than the untreated sample, 53 mm, and
   generated an appreciably higher fraction of fines ( - 12.5 mm), 21\%,
   than untreated sample, 4\%. The coke textures from the untreated coal
   consist of higher carbon forms, mosaic and flow in medium size, compared
   to those from s.g. 1.6 treated coal of lower carbon forms, very fine and
   fine mosaic, which renders the coke more reactive to CO2 gasification
   during CSR test. The higher effective coking rank, 1.2, and Coke Mosaic
   Size Index, 2.4, of untreated sample relative to that of treated one,
   1.1 and 2.2, respectively, supports the better coke quality of the
   untreated sample. Extension of storage time to 6 months resulted in
   negligible changes in coke quality showing that the greatest changes
   occurred within the first month following exposure to organic liquids.
   Comparison of 1 month untreated and PCE treated mid coking rank Western
   Canadian (Romax 1.22) and Australian (Romax 1.17) coals show both to
   undergo comparable decrease in fluidity (50-60\%) post treatment with
   PCE although only the Western Canadian coal leads to lower dilatation.
   Coke yield is also decreased for the Western Canadian coal and
   essentially maintained for the Australian coal. Both CSR and CRI are
   affected negatively and more so for the Western Canadian coal, 16 point
   drop in CSR and 8 point increase in CRI, relative to the Australian
   coal, 3 point drop in CSR and 4 point increase in CRI. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{A newly designed continuous-flow 915 MHz microwave wastewater treatment
   system was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the microwave
   enhanced advanced oxidation process (MW/H2O2-AOP) for treating dairy
   manure. After the treatment, about 84\% of total phosphorus and 45\% of
   total chemical oxygen demand were solubilized with the highest H2O2
   dosage (0.4\% H2O2 per \%TS). The reaction kinetics of soluble chemical
   oxygen demand revealed activation energy to be in the range of 5-22 kJ
   mole(-1). The energy required by the processes was approximately 0.16
   kWh per liter of dairy manure heated. A higher H2O2 dosage used in the
   system had a better process performance in terms of solids
   solubilization, reaction kinetics, and energy consumption. Cost-benefit
   analysis for a farm-scale MW/H2O2-AOP treatment system was also
   presented. The results obtained from this study would provide the basic
   knowledge for designing an effective farm-scale dairy manure treatment
   system.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetic interplay between helium (He) segregation, He cluster

   (alpha-Fe) has been investigated using molecular dynamics simulations.
   He atoms that segregate to the migrating boundary are found to be
   trapped in vacant substitutional sites emitted by the migrating
   boundary. He atoms that form clusters in the bulk restrain the boundary
   migration via a pinning mechanism. The pinning pressure of He clusters
   is proportional to the density and the squared radius of each cluster. A
   cluster pinning model has been developed by taking into account the
   two-fold effect of clusters on the boundary migration: (1) reducing the
   boundary mobility and (2) acting as pinning objects that delay or even
   completely halt the boundary migration. The model is found to be in
   agreement with the simulation results.}},

   prostheses and orthoses that are related to rehabilitation robotics.
   Finally, Sect. 64.5 provides an overview of recent work in diagnosis and
   monitoring for rehabilitation as well as other health-care issues. The
   reader is referred to Chap. 73 for cognitive rehabilitation robotics and
   to Chap. 65 for robotic smart home technologies, which are often
   considered assistive technologies for persons with disabilities. At the
   conclusion of the present chapter, the reader will be familiar with the
   history of rehabilitation robotics and its primary accomplishments, and

Year = {{2016}},
Pages = {{1835-1874}},
Abstract = {{Over the last two decades, the foundations for physical human-robot
   interaction (pHRI) have evolved from successful developments in
   mechatronics, control, and planning, leading toward safer lightweight
   robot designs and interaction control schemes that advance beyond the
   current capacities of existing high-payload and highprecision
   position-controlled industrial robots. Based on their ability to sense
   physical interaction, render compliant behavior along the robot
   structure, plan motions that respect human preferences, and generate
   interaction plans for collaboration and coaction with humans, these
   novel robots have opened up novel and unforeseen application domains,
   and have advanced the field of human safety in robotics.
   This chapter gives an overview on the state of the art in pHRI. First,
   the advances in human safety are outlined, addressing topics in human
   injury analysis in robotics and safety standards for pHRI. Then, the
   foundations of human-friendly robot design, including the development of
   lightweight and intrinsically flexible force/torque-controlled machines
   together with the required perception abilities for interaction are
   introduced. Subsequently, motion-planning techniques for human
   environments, including the domains of biomechanically safe,
   risk-metric-based, human-aware planning are covered. Finally, the rather
   recent problem of interaction planning is summarized, including the
   issues of collaborative action planning, the definition of the
   interaction planning problem, and an introduction to robot reflexes and
   reactive control architecture for pHRI.}},

Abstract = {{LLC resonant converters have gained popularity in a variety of
   applications due to their natural ability to provide soft switching
   conditions. Although LLC features good efficiency, conductive losses in
   the output rectifier remains a barrier to achieve enhanced efficiency,
   specially for high output current applications. This paper introduces a
   new strategy referred to as Coordinate Modulation, which is designed to
   drive the synchronous rectification MOSFETs. The main challenge to
   successfully drive synchronous rectifier is to detect/find the rectifier
   conduction angles with a cost-effective strategy. This paper proposes
   and analyzes a robust and simple detection method in the v(inv) -
   nv(sec) coordinate plane. The plane allows a remarkable ability to
   detect conduction angles with two lines, producing proper pulses to
   drive synchronous rectifier. In order to validate the theoretical
   analysis, a 1.2KW prototype LLC converter is implemented and the
   experimental results using the Coordinate Modulation are presented. At
   the nominal output power, the converter's efficiency was measured at
   97.1\%. In comparison with a conventional LLC converter, the proposed
   modulation method increases the efficiency by 3\%.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, high efficiency LLC resonant converters have gained popularity
   to implement battery chargers and employ traditional wire-wound
   transformers. Due to the height of traditional cores, the form factor of
   LLC chargers is often plump and bulky. In order to implement slim
   profile chargers for EVs and portable electronic applications, planar
   transformers can be used featuring low height, reproducibility, and low
   thermal resistance. Despite those advantages, planar magnetics suffer
   from very high parasitic capacitance resulting in severe regulation
   problems for LLC chargers that require wide voltage regulation. This
   paper analyzes LLC regulation issues with planar magnetics and proposes
   a novel strategy to provide wide regulation by reducing the effects of
   intra-winding capacitance. The proposed strategy employs a simplified
   capacitance network and achieves low parasitics to successfully design
   LLC chargers with wide regulation. Experimental results of a 1.2kW LLC
   converter confirms that the proposed winding layout not only provides
   better output voltage regulation in light load conditions, but also
   increases the overall efficiency of the power conerter.}},

Abstract = {{In order to support different types of rechargeable batteries (e.g.
   Li-Ion, Lead-Acid, NiMh), the design of universal battery chargers must
   focus on wide conversion efficiency instead of traditional peak
   efficiency design. Wide efficiency is the ability to maintain high
   performance within the nominal output power while supporting the
   charging cycle voltage of different battery technologies. The objective
   of this paper is to tackle this new wide efficiency technical challenge
   and provide a design methodology that focuses on multiple operating
   points rather than obtaining peak efficiency at one operating point. The
   universal battery charger is expected to provide a demanding output
   voltage range between nominal and 1.5 times nominal and sustaining
   maximum power delivery with high efficiency. The proposed LLC converter
   design procedure successfully selects the resonant tank elements and
   operating frequencies to maximize efficiency for the maximum power
   region. The design procedure employs analytical equations and a Tabu
   Search algorithm (TS) for a 96V DC, 960W universal battery charger
   implementation. The experimental results exhibit the excellent
   performance of the designed converter, which has an average efficiency
   of 96.1\% within the nominal output power delivery range (between 96V DC
   and 144V DC output voltage range) with extreme regulation capability.}},

Abstract = {{Kidney transplantation is standard of care for end-stage renal failure.
   Monitoring graft health after transplantation to ensure graft longevity
   is important and usually carried out through the use of biopsy.
   Ultrasound elastography has the potential to allow regular non-invasive
   monitoring of graft health via the level of fibrosis. Results of kidney
   elastography research to date have been variable.
   It is hypothesized that the changes in blood pressure are a confounding
   factor in elasticity measurements and may explain the varied results.
   Using a controlled set-up on porcine kidneys ex-vivo, the effects of
   changes in pressure with flow from a peristaltic pump were examined
   (n=5). Each kidney was measured from 0 mmHg to 130 mmHg. It was found
   that the measured elasticity of the kidney was dependent on the input
   pressure of the pump. Increasing the input pressure resulted in an
   increase in the measured elasticity, from an average 21 +/- 3 kPa at 0
   mmHg to approximately 34 +/- 9 kPa at 130 mmHg. These results suggest
   that the phase of the cardiac cycle be considered in kidney elastography
   using electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring.}},

   can be used to better understand the influences on that development. In
   many cases, the success, failure, or final path of a new innovation may
   not rest upon its technical merits but on the non-technical influences

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is a common, localized joint disease that
   causes pain, stiffness and reduced mobility. Osteoarthritis is
   particularly common in the knees. The effects of osteoarthritis on the
   rheology of synovial fluid in the knees are not fully understood and
   consequently require further study.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of
   protein content on synovial fluid shear rheology. A secondary study
   outcome will include study of the temperature dependence of synovial
   fluid behaviour.
   METHODS: 38 osteoarthritic synovial fluid samples were studied under
   shear flow. Shear properties were correlated with protein concentration.
   Viscosupplement was used as a comparison and to verify measurement
   reliability. The effects of temperature were investigated at 20, 29 and
   37 degrees C.
   RESULTS: Shear rheological properties were found to vary widely between
   samples, however all samples demonstrated clear non-Newtonian shear
   thinning behaviour. In general viscoelastic properties were lower in
   osteoarthritic samples than previously studied healthy synovial fluid. A
   moderate correlation was observed between synovial fluid dynamic moduli
   at a frequency of 2.5 Hz and protein concentration. Temperature was
   found to affect the rheology of osteoarthritic synovial fluid and was
   fitted with the Arrhenius model.
   CONCLUSIONS: Increased protein concentration has been correlated with
   decreased shear rheological parameters. Temperature dependence of
   synovial fluid was also demonstrated and modelled for use in Part 2 of
   this article.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is a common, localized joint disease that
   causes pain, stiffness and reduced mobility. The effects of
   osteoarthritis on the extensional rheology of synovial fluid in the
   knees are not fully understood and consequently require further study.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work is to study the extensional rheology
   of osteoarthritic synovial fluid and to investigate a possible
   correlation between synovial fluid protein concentration and extensional
   rheology. The study will also investigate possible correlations with the
   shear rheology.
   METHODS: 21 osteoarthritic synovial fluid samples were studied under
   extensional flow with a capillary breakup extensional rheometer.
   Extensional rheological properties were correlated with protein
   concentration and with shear rheological properties measured in a prior
   study. Viscosupplement was also studied under extensional flow for
   comparison.
   RESULTS: Extensional rheological properties were found to vary widely
   between samples, but in general were found to agree with previous
   studies. No statistically significant correlation was identified between
   extensional rheological properties and protein concentration. Positive
   correlations were identified between zero shear viscosity and terminal
   extensional viscosity (R-squared = 0.73), zero shear viscosity and
   extensional relaxation time (R-squared = 0.84), and shear relaxation
   time and extensional relaxation time (R-squared = 0.75).
   CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate CaBER operating parameters for study of
   osteoarthritic synovial fluid were identified. No statistically
   significant correlation was found to exist between protein concentration
   and extensional rheological parameters. Positive correlations were
   identified between several shear and extensional rheological parameters.
   The reported values for extensional viscosity and relaxation times for
   synovial fluid were found to be within one order of magnitude with a
   recent study of post mortem synovial fluid.}},

Title = {{Electrodeposition of manganese metal: role of quaternary ammonium salts
   on current efficiency, morphology and polarisation behaviour}},
Journal = {{CANADIAN METALLURGICAL QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{The electrodeposition of manganese metal from aqueous solutions is
   problematic due to its high electroreduction potential demanding unique
   process challenges. In the present work, electrolytic manganese metals
   (EMMs) of high quality are deposited from sulphate solutions in the
   presence of quaternary amines: tetra ethyl ammonium bromide (TEABr),
   tetra propyl ammonium bromide and tetra butyl ammonium bromide. The
   concentrations of these additives were varied over a relatively broad
   range to evaluate their effect on current efficiency (CE), specific
   energy consumption, polarisation behaviour of the cathode and deposit
   morphology of the electrodeposited manganese metal. A maximum CE of more
   than 68\% was achieved in the presence of 100mg.L-1 TEABr in the
   electrolytic bath at a current density of 500A.m(-2). X-ray diffraction
   studies revealed that (330, 411) planes were the most preferred planes
   of crystal growth during manganese electrodeposition resembling
   alpha-manganese regardless of the type of quaternary amines used. A
   smooth and compact deposit was obtained with TEABr that was also
   supported by the scanning electron micrographs showing uniform deposit
   morphologies. The presence of these quaternary amines in the electrolyte
   causes polarisation of the cathode during electrodeposition. The degree
   of polarisation increases with an increase in the bulkiness of the alkyl
   group on the quaternary nitrogen atom of the additive. The quaternary
   amine TEABr was found to be the most suitable additive for producing the
   desired quality of EMM with better current yield. L'electrodeposition du
   manganese a partir de solutions aqueuses est un probleme en raison du
   potentiel eleve de reduction electrolytique creant des defis uniques de
   procede. Dans ce travail, du manganese electrolytique de haute qualite
   est depose a partir de solutions de sulfate en presence d'amines
   quaternaires: bromure d'ammonium tetra ethyle (TEABr), bromure
   d'ammonium tetra propyle (TPABr) et bromure d'ammonium tetra butyle
   (TBABr). On a varie la concentration de ces additifs sur une gamme
   relativement etendue afin d'evaluer leur effet sur le rendement du
   courant, sur la consommation d'energie massique, sur le comportement de
   polarisation de la cathode et sur la morphologie du depot de manganese
   obtenu par galvanoplastie. On a obtenu un rendement maximum de courant
   de plus de 68\% en presence de 100 mgL(-1) de TEABr dans le bain
   electrolytique avec une densite de courant de 500 Am-2. Les etudes de
   diffraction des rayons X ont revele que les plans (330, 411) etaient les
   plans preferes de la croissance de cristal lors de l'electrodeposition
   du manganese, ressemblant au manganese alpha, peu importe le type
   d'amines quaternaires utilise. On a obtenu un depot lisse et compact
   avec le TEABr, tel que demontre par les photomicrographies du microscope
   electronique, montrant des morphologies uniformes du depot. La presence
   de ces amines quaternaires dans l'electrolyte conduit a la polarisation
   de la cathode lors de l'electrodeposition. Le degre de polarisation
   augmente avec l'augmentation de l'espace occupee par le groupe alkyle
   sur l'atome quaternaire d'azote de l'additif. On a trouve que l'amine
   quaternaire TEABr etait l'additif le plus approprie pour la production
   de la qualite desiree de manganese electrolytique, avec un meilleur taux
   de rendement du courant.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust Q-learning method for path planning in a
   dynamic environment. The method consists of three steps: at first, a
   regime-switching Markov decision process (RSMDP) is formed to present
   the dynamic environment; and second, a probabilistic roadmap (PRM) is
   constructed, integrated with the RSMDP, and stored as a graph whose
   nodes correspond to a collision-free world state for the robot; finally,
   an online Q-learning method with dynamic step size, which facilitates
   robust convergence of the Q-value iteration, is integrated with the PRM
   to determine an optimal path for reaching the goal. In this manner, the
   robot is able to use past experience for improving its performance in
   avoiding not only static obstacles but also moving obstacles, without
   knowing the nature of the obstacle motion. The use of regime switching
   in the avoidance of obstacles with unknown motion is particularly
   innovative. The developed approach is applied to a homecare robot in
   computer simulation. The results show that the online path planner with
   Q-learning is able to rapidly and successfully converge to the correct
   path.}},

Abstract = {{Human adaptive mechatronics is related to human-machine system design
   and targeted to enhance the overall human-machine performance through
   the interactive communication and decision making between humans and

   human operator model when the operator is in the loop to conduct some
   control task. Manual control systems have laid a solid foundation for
   the process of human operator modeling. In this chapter, a quasi-linear
   model and crossover model are reviewed first. A nonparametric frequency
   response model and parametric transfer function model are obtained in an
   experiment of compensatory tracking. This can be regarded as a frequency
   domain approach. Modern control theory can be adopted to carry out
   modeling in the time domain. The optimal control model and its
   modification are discussed in detail. The identifiability problem is
   also treated. In a disturbance rejection experiment, an LQG controller
   cascaded with a deteriorating filter is developed to facilitate the
   system identification.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter presents a theory of concurrent mechatronic design and the
   development steps of an evolutionary mechatronic design tool. The aim is
   to synthesize the structure of a mechatronic design solution from a very
   basic and high-level definition of the problem as given by an expert
   designer. The automated design tool is generated by integrating a bond
   graph-based modeling tool as an integrated modeling environment for
   mixed mechatronic systems, together with genetic programming as a
   powerful topology exploration and optimization tool. Advanced features
   of the tool are presented by using a two-loop design model as well as by
   incorporating a niching optimization scheme. An ultimate goal of this
   approach is to automate the intelligence that is provided by a human
   expert designer in evolving an optimal design for an engineering system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper covers the characterization of the acoustic noise and the
   unsteady flow field of a high speed centrifugal compressor NASA CC3. In
   order to accurately predict the noise, all analyses are carried out
   through the use of Large Eddy Simulation and Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings
   model for noise prediction. The relative effect of hub cavity on flow
   characteristics and sound levels is investigated, for a compressor stage
   with a total pressure ratio equal to 4, working from surge to near choke
   condition. In comparison with the experimental results from literature,
   the predicted compressor performance and flow field are predicted well.
   The hub cavity flow effect on the compressor aeroacoustic generated
   noise is shown in the paper. The unsteady static pressure and sound
   pressure levels are compared not only at different location but also for
   design and off design operating points. The internal flow results inside
   the hub cavity are presented at surge, design and near choke points. The
   conclusion is that the cavity effect of the centrifugal compressor
   cannot be ignored in the numerical prediction of aerodynamic generated
   noise. The impeller back plate of the rotor experiences a strong
   pressure fluctuation, which is maxima at the impeller outer radius for
   all operating point, but higher pressure values at the surge point.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an uncertainty modeling and robust controller design
   method for miniaturized 3 degrees-of-freedom OISs to deal with its
   product variabilities. A mathematical model of OISs with product
   variabilities is developed based on finite element analysis of
   uncertainties specific for this device. mu-synthesis technique is
   applied to the uncertainty model to design a robust controller, in order
   to guarantee robust stability of the closed-loop system and optimize
   tracking performance against product variabilities. The performance of
   the mu-synthesis controller is compared with conventional nominal
   controllers using simulations. The mu-synthesis controller successfully
   stabilizes the closed-loop system for the entire uncertainty region and
   suppresses hand-shake disturbances more than 30\% better then baseline
   controllers. This improvement can lead to significant enhancement of
   image blur in mobile phone cameras equipped with this OIS.}},

Pages = {{3417-3423}},
Abstract = {{Electrolyzers use electricity to convert water into hydrogen fuels that
   can be stored for prolonged time periods. The large-scale deployment of
   electrolyzers for energy storage is hampered by catalyst efficiencies as
   well as high capital costs. Herein we report a rapid prototyping
   methodology to accelerate the development of complex flow plate
   architectures as a means of lowering electrolyzer capital costs. This
   process involves the electroplating of nickel onto 3D-printed plastic
   flow cells, which enable the rapid production of experimental flow
   plates with different flow channel geometries. The test cells containing
   these metal-coated plastic components matched the performance of
   conventional metal electrodes. The ability to electroplate 3D-printed
   parts offers the opportunity to rapidly prototype flow-field geometries
   to more rapidly evaluate fluid and gas flow through the electrolyzer.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter is devoted to the stability analysis for the four types of
   time-dependent switched systems. We first summarize the mainly used
   multiple Lyapunov-like functions (MLFs) approaches, sort out several
   typical MLFs and review their characteristics. Then, the corresponding
   methodologies by different MLFs such as switched Lyapunov function, MLFs
   with mu-times increase at switching instants are developed to study the
   stability conditions for the underlying system with arbitrary switching,
   dwell time (DT) switching, average dwell time (ADT) switching,
   persistent dwell time (PDT) switching and their mode-dependent forms,
   respectively. The generally analytic results in discrete-time
   contextwill be concretely formulated in terms of linear matrix
   equalities (LMIs). Numerical examples are provided to verify the
   obtained criteria and to compare the four kinds of time-dependent
   switched systems. The results obtained in this chapter will lay a

   problem of designing H-infinity state-feedback controllers is
   investigated for switched linear discrete-time systems with arbitrary

   parameter-independent (robust) and parameter-dependent H-infinity
   controllers are proposed and the existence conditions of the desired

   underlying systems to solve the H-infinity controller, and the obtained
   conditions are dependent on the admissible increasing level mu of
   Lyapunov-like function values at switching instants. Finally, in a
   network-based environment, the quasi-time-dependent (QTD) H-infinity
   control problem is investigated for a class of discrete-time switched
   linear systems with modal persistent dwell time (MPDT) switching. One
   redundant channel is introduced in the data transmission from sensor to

   the single channel case. Several examples are used to demonstrate the

Abstract = {{This chapter first studies the problem of robust H-infinity filtering
   for switched linear discrete-time systems with arbitrary switching and

   parameter-dependent stability result, a robust switched linear filter is
   designed such that the corresponding filtering error system achieves
   robust asymptotic stability and guarantees a prescribed H-infinity
   performance index for all admissible uncertainties. The existence
   condition of such filters is derived and formulated in terms of a set of
   linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) by the introduction of slack variables
   to eliminate the cross coupling of system matrices and Lyapunovmatrices
   among different subsystems. Then, an mu-dependent approach proposed in
   Chap. 2 is used to investigate the exponential H-infinity filtering
   problem for discrete-time uncertain switched systems with average dwell
   time (ADT) switching, and a mode-dependent full-order filter is designed
   to guarantee that the resulting filtering error system is robustly
   exponentially stable and has an exponential H-infinity performance.
   Moreover, a class of discrete-time switched linear parameter varying
   (LPV) systems under ADT switching is considered to investigate the
   H-infinity filtering problem, and a mode-dependent full-order
   parameterised filter is then designed and the corresponding existence
   conditions of such filters are derived via LMIs formulation. Finally,
   the non-weighted H-infinity filtering problem is studied for a class of
   switched linear systems with persistent dwell-time (PDT) switching in
   discrete-time domain. A proper Lyapunov function suitable to the PDT
   switching is constructed, which is not only mode-dependent but also
   quasi-time-dependent (QTD). Then, a QTD filter is designed such that the
   resulting filtering error system is globally uniformly asymptotically
   stable and has a guaranteed H-infinity noise attenuation performance.

Abstract = {{This chapter first investigates the stability problem of a class of
   discrete-time linear switched systems with cyclic switching and state
   delays, and a numerical searching algorithm is explored to compute the
   feasible values of dwell time of the subsystems. Then, the problem of
   H-infinity output feedback control for discrete-time switched linear
   systems with time delays is investigated. The time delay is assumed to
   be time-varying and has minimum and maximum bounds, which covers the
   constant delay and mode-dependent constant delay as two special cases.
   By constructing a switched quadratic Lyapunov function for the
   underlying system, both static and dynamic H-infinity output feedback
   controllers are designed respectively such that the corresponding
   closed-loop switched system under arbitrary switching signals is
   asymptotically stable and guarantees a prescribed H-infinity noise
   attenuation level bound. Moreover, under the arbitrary switching, the
   problem of robust l(2)-l(infinity) filtering is studied for
   discrete-time switched linear systems with polytopic uncertainties and
   time-varying delays. The robust switched linear filters are designed
   based on the mode-dependent idea and parameter-dependent stability
   approach, and the existence conditions of such filters, dependent on the
   upper and lower bound of time-varying delays, are formulated in terms of
   a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, the state estimation
   problem is studied for a class of discrete-time switching neural
   networks (NNs) with persistent dwell time (PDT) switching regularities
   and mode-dependent time-varying delays in H-infinity sense. The random
   packet dropouts, which are governed by a Bernoulli distributed white
   sequence, are considered to exist together for the estimator design of
   underlying switching NNs. The desired mode-dependent estimators are
   designed such that the resulting estimation error system is
   exponentially mean-square stable and achieves a prescribed H-infinity
   level of disturbance attenuation. The effectiveness and the superiority
   of the developed results are demonstrated through numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{Physiologically, both chronic and cycling low oxygen level, or hypoxia,
   can alter tumour cell behaviour and reduce effectiveness of anticancer
   treatment. In order to create transiently hypoxic environments around
   tumour cells during drug screening, short diffusion distances between
   the control gases and the culture media are required in order to
   reproduce the timescales of a few cycles per hour that have been
   observed in animal studies. We use a gas-permeable three-layer
   microfluidic device to achieve spatial and temporal oxygen control with
   equilibration time less than 10 minutes. We integrate thin optical
   oxygen sensing films composed of polystyrene with an embedded
   luminescent oxygen-sensitive dye in order to monitor oxygen levels
   within the system. We show that the microfluidic oxygen control afforded
   by this design is sufficient to achieve oxygen concentrations below the
   sensor limit of detection of 0.08\% in the fluidic cell culture
   environment. This platform allows us to generate complex, time-varying
   oxygen profiles. The sensors are biocompatible and engineered tumour
   spheroids cultured in this platform show good viability and cell
   proliferation over the course of several days with in situ oxygen

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a family of single switch soft switching PWM
   converters where only one magnetic element is employed. The proposed
   converters within the family have the ability to provide soft switching
   conditions for all semiconductor elements. As a result, the problems
   related to the reverse recovery of diodes are excluded. The lossless
   passive snubber circuit in this family can be applied to a wide variety
   of switching power converters. Among the converters within the family,
   the theoretical analysis is provided for the buck converter, since the
   basic performance of the lossless snubber circuit is the same for the
   converters. To validate the theoretical analysis, a 120W prototype buck
   converter is implemented experimentally. The experimental results show
   that the proposed converter improves the converter's efficiency by over
   2\% compared to a conventional buck converter.}},

Abstract = {{In world-class athletic competitions the margin of victory is often
   exceedingly small and in a range that maybe influenced by aerodynamic
   drag (F-d). Vortex generators (VG) are small triangular or vane shaped
   protuberances that have been used successfully in automotive and
   aerospace applications to stir the boundary layer and delay flow
   separation over a wing or body surface. To determine if VG would reduce
   the Fd of a sprinter or marathon runner, a series of F-d measurements
   were conducted on circular cylinders, mannequin limb segments and
   full-scale mannequins in wind tunnels at the University of British
   Columbia and University of Washington. A large variety of VG shapes,
   sizes and patterns were developed using computer-aided design and rapid
   prototype printers. In total, the test program involved 1,540 discrete
   multi-velocity test runs requiring 56 days of wind tunnel time. The test
   program successfully identified specific arrangements of VG that, in
   combination with well-fitted garments, would reduce the F-d associated
   with running apparel by up to 6.8\%, compared to the previous generation
   of advanced race apparel. Specific body maps based on race distance and
   gender were created to optimize the application of VG to different types
   of running apparel. Unlike previous apparel based drag reduction
   strategies that utilized multiple textured fabrics to reduce F-d, the VG
   based F-d reduction strategy provided three key advantages: (i) it
   became effective at a very low velocity and so can be used on apparel
   designed for either higher velocity (sprint) or lower velocity
   (marathon) running activities; (ii) it did not undergo a post-flow
   transition increase in F-d; and (iii) only a few rows of VG were
   normally required so that the weight and complexity of manufacturing the
   apparel were reduced. Mathematical modelling of sprint, middle distance
   and marathon performances at a world-class level suggest that
   aerodynamic apparel with VG could provide time savings of 0.013 seconds
   in 100 m, 0.50 seconds in 1500 m and 10.9 seconds in the marathon for
   male athletes wearing apparel with VG versus those wearing 2012 Olympic
   apparel without VG. The results of this study suggest that appropriate
   sizes and patterns of VG can provide a significant reduction in the F-d
   of running apparel. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge is one of an organization's most important assets, hence
   organizations should strive to capture and reuse the knowledge of their
   workers in order to have continuous improvements. The construction
   industry is often associated with low levels of productivity, one of the
   reasons for which is due to poor knowledge management since mistakes
   made in one project are often repeated again in future projects.
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a technology that has caused a
   paradigm shift in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC)
   industry. Social media platforms are another recent invention that have
   diverse applications in every field. The main objective of this paper is
   to assess the usefulness of a BIM-based social platform for knowledge
   management, in particular tacit knowledge, in the construction industry.
   A case study demonstrating the use of such a platform, called Green 2.0,
   has been presented in this paper. The case study, relating to the
   construction of high performance, low cost housing, provides a proof of
   concept and shows that such platforms can provide an informal and
   engaging method for project-related discussions, in addition to
   providing advantageous visualizations to project stakeholders. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the costs and benefits
   of the two main construction methods in the prefabricated homes
   category: panelized and modular. The main goal is to provide a framework
   of the implications and tradeoffs of both construction methods for
   single family homes, as well as determine which is more cost effective.
   The methodology consists of a qualitative analysis that includes the
   overview of the benefits of each construction method over the other, and
   quantitative analysis which compares the cost of the finished homes per
   square foot to determine which one is more cost effective. Both analyses
   are conducted by evaluating two case studies of single family homes with
   similar characteristics, one built with panels and the other with
   modules. The benefits identified for panelized homes have to do with
   transportation, equipment and machinery, and insulation technology; on
   the other hand, the benefits for modular homes are related to quality
   control, on-site work and trades. The quantitative results showed that
   the modular construction method is only marginally more cost effective
   than the panelized construction method under the given circumstances. As
   a second part of the quantitative analysis, the panel case study was
   calculated as if it would be built with modules, and the results of both
   analyses were consistent, but both with the same limitations. Through
   the proposed method, it is possible to evaluate the cost effectiveness
   of the two construction methods for single family prefabricated home
   projects which could serve as a valuable tool for decision making. (C)

Abstract = {{While there is increasing desire to improve the energy performance and

   housing. This research involved the construction of a prototype house
   intended to achieve both high performance and low cost. This paper
   reports on an assessment of the environmental performance of the
   prototype using life cycle assessment techniques. A life cycle
   assessment was conducted for the innovative magnesium oxide structural
   insulated panels used for the prototype's envelope system in comparison
   with traditional structural insulated panels and a stick-frame envelope
   The results show that the impact of transporting materials from China
   has a negative impact on the life cycle analysis results of the
   magnesium oxide panels relative to the wood-based alternatives, which
   could be largely alleviated through domestic sourcing of the main
   materials. The life cycle analysis was also performed on the lighting
   and heating designs for the prototype home, which showed that these
   systems performed very well relative to more conventional alternatives.

Abstract = {{Assessing the quality of construction for compliance with the design
   intent has been a challenging task in the AEC (Architecture,
   Engineering, and Construction) industry. As modern design methods using
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) techniques have been increasingly
   adopted by the AEC industry, construction quality assessment using BIM
   has become a challenging new task for practitioners. In the past few
   years, 3D as-built models for construction quality assessment have been
   developed using data acquisition techniques like 3D laser scanning and
   photogrammetry. However, certain limitations like non-affordability,
   requiring expertise to operate, and dependence on time-consuming
   processes are restricting their usage for construction quality control
   purposes. The main objective of this work is to study the applicability
   of using a new, affordable, easy to use, and faster modeling technology
   (Project Tango) to produce 3D as-built models for facilitating the
   construction quality control process. For this purpose, a construction
   project was chosen as a case study and three different scenarios
   (including interior and exterior environments) were modelled using
   Project Tango. A post-processing method was developed to prepare the
   scanned as-built models for comparison with the design BIM. The accuracy
   level of these as-built models were also evaluated using dimension
   accuracy analysis. The prepared as-built models and the design BIM were
   then integrated and adjusted in the Autodesk Navisworks environment to
   perform the quality control assessment. This assessment process includes
   object completeness testing and spatial deviation analyses. This
   research thus highlights both the advantages and limitations of Project
   Tango and shows that such technologies have a great potential for
   construction quality assessments.}},

Abstract = {{In improving energy efficiency of buildings, windows play a significant
   role as they largely influence the energy load. Although there are many
   studies about the energy efficient window design, a rigorous study is
   missing which analyzes the mutual impact of windows' size, position and
   orientation on the energy load. This study aims to address this gap
   through a case study on a single family house. For this aim, 65
   different design scenarios are created which vary by window size,
   position and orientation. Building information models (BIMs) are created
   for each scenario via Autodesk Revit (R), and are used for the
   calculation of the total energy load conducted by Autodesk Green
   Building Studio (R). In the first analysis stage, window-to-wall ratio
   (WWR) and the windows' position are studied to assess their effect on
   the energy load. The preliminary results at this stage indicate that the
   total energy load increases when the WWR grows, and the windows'
   position has the biggest impact on the load when the WWR is 20. Using
   these results, in the next stage, the position of windows in different
   orientation is studied to assess how the energy load changes by windows'
   position in each orientation. The results show that the building
   requires the lowest load when the windows are located in the middle
   height in all orientations, and the east windows' positioning affects
   the total energy load the most.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing the radiation dose in computed tomography (CT) requires
   reducing the number or the energy of the photons that pass through the
   patient's body. An image reconstructed from such noisy or undersampled
   measurements will contain much noise and artifacts that can
   significantly reduce the diagnostic value of the image. Effective
   sinogram denoising or interpolation can reduce these noise and
   artifacts. In this paper, we present a novel approach to sinogram
   smoothing and interpolation. The proposed method iteratively estimates
   the local slope and curvature of the sinogam and forces the sinogram to
   follow the estimated slope and curvature. This is performed by
   projection onto the set of constraints that define the slope and the
   curvature. The constraints on the slope and curvature correspond to very
   simple convex sets. Projection onto these sets have simple analytical
   solutions. Moreover, these operations are highly parallelizable because
   the equations defining the slope and curvature constraints for all the
   points in a sinogram can be summarized as five convex sets, regardless
   of the length of the sinogram. We apply the proposed method on simulated
   and real data and examine its effect on the quality of the reconstructed
   image. Our results show that the proposed method is highly effective and
   can lead to a substantial improvement in the quality of the images
   reconstructed from noisy sinogram measurements. A comparison with the
   K-SVD denoising algorithm shows that the proposed algorithm achieves
   better results. We suggest that the proposed method can be a useful tool
   for low-dose CT.}},

Abstract = {{Sparse representation of signals in learned overcomplete dictionaries
   has proven to be a powerful tool with applications in denoising,
   restoration, compression, reconstruction, and more. Recent research has
   shown that learned overcomplete dictionaries can lead to better results
   than analytical dictionaries such as wavelets in almost all image
   processing applications. However, a major disadvantage of these
   dictionaries is that their learning and usage is very computationally
   intensive. In particular, finding the sparse representation of a signal
   in these dictionaries requires solving an optimization problem that
   leads to very long computational times, especially in 3D image
   processing. Moreover, the sparse representation found by greedy
   algorithms is usually sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel
   two-level dictionary structure that improves the performance and the
   speed of standard greedy sparse coding methods. The first (i.e., the
   top) level in our dictionary is a fixed orthonormal basis, whereas the
   second level includes the atoms that are learned from the training data.
   We explain how such a dictionary can be learned from the training data
   and how the sparse representation of a new signal in this dictionary can
   be computed. As an application, we use the proposed dictionary structure
   for removing the noise and artifacts in 3D computed tomography (CT)
   images. Our experiments with real CT images show that the proposed
   method achieves results that are comparable with standard
   dictionary-based methods while substantially reducing the computational
   time.}},

Abstract = {{Cerebellar dysfunction can lead to a wide range of movement disorders.
   Studying the cerebellar atrophy pattern associated with different
   cerebellar disease types can potentially help in diagnosis, prognosis,
   and treatment planning. In this paper, we present a landmark based shape
   analysis pipeline to classify healthy control and different ataxia types
   and to visualize the characteristic cerebellar atrophy patterns
   associated with different types. A highly informative feature
   representation of the cerebellar structure is constructed by extracting
   dense homologous landmarks on the boundary surfaces of cerebellar
   sub-structures. A diagnosis group classifier based on this
   representation is built using partial least square dimension reduction
   and regularized linear discriminant analysis. The characteristic atrophy
   pattern for an ataxia type is visualized by sampling along the
   discriminant direction between healthy controls and the ataxia type.
   Experimental results show that the proposed method can successfully
   classify healthy controls and different ataxia types. The visualized
   cerebellar atrophy patterns were consistent with the regional volume
   decreases observed in previous studies, but the proposed method provides
   intuitive and detailed understanding about changes of overall size and
   shape of the cerebellum, as well as that of individual lobules.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we study the behavior of a full-duplex (FD) and
   amplify-and-forward (AF) relay with multiple antennas, where hardware
   impairments of the FD transceivers are taken into account. Due to the
   inter-dependency of the transmit relay power on each antenna and the
   residual self-interference intensity in an AF-FD relay, we observe a
   distortion loop which degrades the system performance. An optimization
   problem is formulated to maximize the end-to-end communication rate,
   under relay and source transmit power constraints. Due to the resulting
   problem complexity, we propose a gradient-projection-based algorithm to
   approach an optimum solution. An iterative relay transmit covariance
   shaping algorithm is also proposed, following the quadratic
   approximation of the relay function in each iteration. The
   aforementioned algorithm provides a convex optimization framework to
   approach an optimal solution with small number of optimization
   iterations. The performance of the proposed designs are then compared to
   a similar setup with a decode-and-forward (DF) process, where the
   distortion loop effect is eliminated due to decoding, via numerical
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years high-level synthesis (HLS) has seen considerable
   attention as it promises to increase designer productivity and make
   custom hardware implementation accessible to software developers. A
   challenge facing those developing HLS technologies is how to allow users
   to understand, debug and optimize their final hardware systems.
   Recently, several techniques have been developed to provide in-system
   debugging capabilities for HLS circuits. These techniques instrument the
   user's design with some debugging circuitry to provide observability
   into the circuit during execution. Due to resource constraints, it is
   usually infeasible to view all variable values for the entire circuit
   execution. Rather, instrumentation usually captures only some variable
   values and for only a portion of the circuit execution.
   In this paper we present a metric for measuring the observability into
   an executing HLS circuit. This metric reflects the portion of variable
   accesses that are available to the user, the duration of execution for
   which these values are available, as well as accommodating variations in
   importance between source code variables. This metric can be used to
   understand how different circuit observation networks can provide the
   user with different levels of observability into the HLS circuit
   execution.
   As a demonstration of the applicability of the metric, we first study
   differences between recent debugging approaches for HLS circuits, and
   quantify the level of observability provided by such architectures. We
   then explore different schemes to select which variables are accessible
   in the observation network, and measure impact on variable availability
   and length of captured execution trace.}},

Abstract = {{Silent data corruptions (SDCs) are one of the most critical issues in
   modern HPC systems, as they are ``silent{''} by definition and raise no
   warnings to users and application developers that a calculation has been
   corrupted. A significant amount of effort has been made to characterize,
   detect, and tolerate SDCs. However, current approaches do not share the
   same understanding of SDC, hence it is not only difficult to evaluate
   their effectiveness, but also to compare with each other. This position
   paper argues that SDCs should be discussed at each layer of the system
   and are confined within the goal of the approach. We provide a
   preliminary result to differentiate data corruptions across system
   layers, and show that application-specific correctness checks can
   tolerate about 50\% of the errors that appear in the application output.}},

Abstract = {{Respiratory motion limits the use of focused ultrasound surgery and
   conformal radiation therapies for livers. Population motion models have
   shown their ability to predict unobservable motion from tracking
   results. These models require establishment of inter-subject
   correspondences, which is non-trivial. In this study we compare the use
   of a landmark-based method with a shape-based approach for this task.
   The influence of the inter-subject correspondences on the motion model
   predictions was assessed in leave-onesubject-out tests. For simulated 3D
   (2D) tracking results, the landmark-based motion models reduced the
   right liver lobe 95\% motion from 12.4 (11.9) mm to 4.6 (4.5) mm on
   average. The shape-based models improved this further to 3.7 (3.8) mm
   and reduced the mean error by 13\% (9\%). While the landmarks were only
   defined for the right liver lobe, the shape-based approach enabled the
   motion prediction of the whole liver with a 95\% error of less than 4.8
   mm.}},

Abstract = {{Buck-derived topologies are a popular alternative for the inverter stage
   of distributed generation systems. The lack of a grid connection places
   high reliability demands on the inverter controller. Dual-loop linear
   schemes are traditionally employed for the control of single-phase
   full-bridge inverters because of their simple implementation. However,
   the voltage loop dynamics are usually sluggish due to the requirement of
   making the outer loop's bandwidth much lower than the inner loop one. On
   the other hand, state-plane-based controllers offer fast and stable
   response against large signal disturbances, but constant switching
   frequency can only be achieved at the expense of a high computational
   cost. This work introduces a hybrid dual-loop control technique for
   inverters that combines the advantages of linear and state-plane-based
   controllers. The proposed dual loop scheme features a geometric-based
   voltage outer loop that provides fast and robust performance. The outer
   loop controller is complemented with a linear inner loop that ensures
   constant switching frequency and simple implementation. The derivation
   of the geometric controller is performed in the normalized state plane.
   Simulation and experimental results are provided in order to validate
   the proposed control scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Constant-Power Loads (CPLs) can cause unstable behavior within
   microgrids, which can be observed as voltage drops or oscillations in
   the dc bus during load transients. Traditionally, the converters feeding
   the CPLs of a microgrid are compensated using linear controllers, which
   can only provide a limited dynamic response. This work proposes to
   substitute the slow controller ruling one of the converters in the
   microgrid by a much faster alternative, a Circular Switching Surfaces
   boundary controller. The solution introduced in this work provides major
   improvements in the overall dynamic performance of the system, achieving
   lower voltage drops and faster transient responses against CPL sudden
   changes. Simulations of a microgrid with three converters feeding a CPL
   are provided. Experimental results will be included in the final version
   of the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Voltage source inverters (VSI) connected to intermittent renewable
   sources may have periods of low active power production. When the power
   generated at the source is below the power rating of the inverter, the
   remaining unused rating of the inverter can be used to compensate the
   harmonic distortion in the grid. This paper presents the realization of
   a VSI with Active Power Filter capabilities, which is able to control
   the compensation of individual load harmonics up to the 17th as a
   function of the variation of the unused rating of a VSI. In order to
   select the number and magnitude of harmonic to mitigate, the paper
   analyses the utilization rating of the VSI in light of the power theory
   used in the latest IEEE standards. This analysis results in the
   derivation of a novel ``power sphere{''} concept that is helpful to
   establish the magnitude of harmonic compensation needed to fully utilize
   the unused rating of a VSI at a given time. The performance of the
   selective compensation of individual harmonics in a VSI is validated in
   simulations and in a 3-phase 1kW DSC-controlled experimental platform.}},

Abstract = {{Optimization techniques have become powerful tools in the design of
   power electronics converters. In this paper an optimization technique is
   proposed to design a multilevel converter. Unlike the majority of
   previous converter optimization, this technique considers multiple
   characteristics to be optimized. Efficiency, inductance, loss
   distribution and component cost are optimized through a weighted
   objective function. The technique selects between the NPC and the ANPC
   topologies as each presents key advantages at specific conditions. A
   model to calculate the switching and conduction losses and the loss
   distribution for each topology was derived. The semiconductor technology
   is not restrained to a single type. Instead IGBTs, MOSFETs, and diodes
   are considered along with the switching frequency. The optimization is
   carried out for both inverter and rectifier operation, both with three
   loading conditions. As expected, some key characteristics of the
   topology and semiconductor become pronounced as conditions vary,
   resulting significantly different optimal designs.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen production is an interesting alternative of storing energy.
   Electrolyzers produce hydrogen through water electrolysis; the resulting
   hydrogen is later used to generate electricity by using fuel cells, that
   reverse the process. Electrolyzers use rectifiers to convert the grid a
   c voltage into d c voltage for supplying the electrolyzer cells.
   Previous research used a rectification process based on conventional
   rectifiers (diode-or thyristor-based) which draw non-sinusoidal current
   from the main grid. This requires increased filtering to prevent power
   quality problems and equipment malfunctioning/ failure. In addition,
   previous literature assumed simplified models for the power electronics
   converters and lacked a detailed control system. The Vienna rectifier is
   a non-regenerative converter that produces sinusoidal currents with low
   losses due to the reduced number of active switches. This manuscript
   proposes using the Vienna rectifier as an interface to connect
   electrolyzers to the ac grid. The dc voltage applied to the electrolyzer
   is regulated by using another dc-dc converter, which is selected to be a
   synchronous buck converter for simplicity and maximum efficiency. In
   this paper, the models of the Vienna rectifier, synchronous buck
   converter, and the electrolyzer are developed along with their
   respective controls. The control system has the ability to function in
   two operation modes for the overall reference: hydrogen production and
   power demand. The first one is adequate for grid-connected operation and
   the later for off-grid operation. Simulation results are given to show
   the validity of the proposed procedures.}},

Abstract = {{The advancements in DC microgrid architectures show a trend towards the
   use of multiple converters from distributed sources (photovoltaic, wind,
   battery) connected to different loads (passive and active) coexisting in
   a weak network. Since these topologies lack the large inertia of big AC
   generators, the stability of the microgrid can be compromised by the
   presence of tightly regulated active loads that can behave as constant
   power loads (CPLs). These loads present a characteristic negative
   incremental resistance, in contrast to the positive resistance of the
   passive loads. Detecting the nature of the loads as seen by the source
   converters, as well as the magnitude, can lead to improvements in the
   stability of the system, as indicated by the Middlebrook criterion. In
   this work, a novel incremental impedance measurement technique based on
   a Lock-In Amplifier (LIA) is presented. The LIA uses a perturbation of a
   known frequency to extract the equivalent incremental impedance of the
   load circuit very accurately. The characteristics of this method enable
   embedded implementation in real-time in the power converter, providing
   an extra tool to improve the stability of the converters in the
   microgrid. The proposed embedded instrument allows the incremental
   impedance of the network to be accurately measured, as seen by the
   source converter, with reduced complexity and sensor requirements.
   Simulations of the proposed measurement technique are presented in order
   to illustrate its behavior. Experimental results for different kinds of
   loads and transients are presented to validate the proposed strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Low power wind turbines (LPWT) are an interesting option for distributed
   generation. Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) procedures for LPWT are
   either based on look-up tables or use an algorithm. This paper proposes
   an MPPT algorithm for wind energy analogous to that of the incremental
   inductance for solar energy. The Vienna rectifier is an efficient
   non-regenerative power converter with only three switching devices and
   its use for LPWT can be advantageous. The permanent magnet synchronous
   generator (PMSG) is a common option for LPWT because of its efficiency.
   This manuscript explains the sensorless vector control of PMSG using the
   Vienna rectifier, which results to be analogous to that of the
   traditional full bridge converter for unity power factor. In addition,
   the unbalanced voltage in the Vienna rectifier capacitors is derived
   from the modulation indexes without requiring an additional sensor.
   Hence, the resulting LPWT has low losses by virtue of the Vienna
   rectifier, and lower cost and higher reliability by virtue of the
   sensorless vector control and unbalance voltage estimation. Simulation
   results validate the proposals of the paper.}},

Abstract = {{LLC resonant converters are widely used in distribution systems for
   energy conversion. Having a detailed simulation model of the power
   MOSFETs in an LLC resonant converter can significantly improve the dead
   time calculation and subsequently improve the DC-DC converter's
   efficiency. In this paper, a new model for power MOSFET employed in an
   LLC resonant converter will be presented to predict the transient time
   for the MOSFET drain-to-source voltage. This non-ideal model of power
   MOSFETs in an LLC converter can be very useful for applications
   requiring fast and efficient energy transfer such as charging batteries
   from PV cells or wind farms. Renewable sources of energy have variable
   input depending on natural conditions and variable output to a battery,
   and a model is required to provide adaptive dead time. The aim of
   developing this model is to provide the ability to better approximate
   dead time to maximize efficiency at different operating points. The
   simulation model includes the MOSFET on-state resistance, the variable
   output capacitance, and the diode forward voltage. The approach used in
   this paper is to model the variable output capacitance and to simulate
   the effects of this parasitic element on the behavior of the
   drain-to-source voltage during the transient. A new set of equations
   will be proposed for the output capacitance based on the data sheet of a
   power MOSFET. The experimental results obtained from a 1.2 kW LLC
   resonant converter at different operating points, prove the accuracy of
   this simulation model.}},

Abstract = {{The control design of boost-derived active rectifiers searches to
   achieve fast dynamic performance on the DC bus voltage and low total
   harmonic distortion at the input current. Due to the nature of the
   topology, attempts to increase the bandwidth of the voltage loop can
   cause distortion in the input current. As a result, the voltage control
   loop usually shows sluggish dynamics. Several linear, PWM-based control
   approaches have tackled this issue in the past improving the dynamic
   performance to a limited extent. On the other hand, boundary controllers
   provide excellent performances at the expense of high implementation
   complexity and input current distortion. This work proposes a PWM-based
   geometric voltage compensator to achieve fast dynamic performance while
   the input current distortion is maintained low. The average nature of
   the technique makes the implementation straightforward and compatible
   with existing current control methods. The analysis is performed in a
   normalized geometric domain providing generality and theoretical insight
   into the topology's behaviour. The theoretical findings are supported by
   simulation and experimental results highlighting the direct contribution

Abstract = {{In this article, we investigate the average transmission delay
   performance for the distributed multiple access cooperative
   communication systems with splitting opportunistic relay selection in
   the presence of strong co-channel interference (CCI). We consider a
   distributed wireless network with random access and analyze the impact
   of imperfect channel state information (CSI) due to CCI on latency. In
   general, the splitting relay selection algorithm is provably fast and
   scalable in distributed wireless networks. Exact closed-form performance
   expression is derived for the end-to-end average delay with the range of
   both transmission phase and relay selection phase. Numerical and
   simulation results are all provided to show that when the CSI is
   outdated or error estimation, the splitting opportunistic relay system
   has a performance degradation compared to the perfect CSI situation,
   while it is better than other opportunistic relay selection schemes with
   outdated or error CSI. Furthermore, the explanation for this performance
   loss is provided along with theoretical results to support the
