Abstract = {{Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE) is a closure model for
   turbulence-chemistry interactions. This model uses the first-order CMC
   hypothesis to close the chemical reaction source terms. The conditional
   scalar field is estimated by solving an integral equation using inverse
   methods. It was originally developed and has been used extensively in
   non-premixed combustion. This work is the first application of this
   combustion model for a premixed flame. CSE is coupled with a Trajectory
   Generated Low-Dimensional Manifold (TGLDM) model for chemistry. The
   CSE-TGLDM combustion model is used in a RANS code to simulate a
   turbulent premixed Bunsen burner. Along with this combustion model, a
   similar model which relies on the flamelet assumption is also used for
   comparison. The results of these two approaches in the prediction of the
   velocity field, temperature and species mass fractions are compared
   together. Although the flamelet model is less computationally expensive,
   the CSE combustion model is more general and does not have the limiting
   assumption underlying the flamelet model.}},

Title = {{Hybrid multi-technology routing in heterogeneous vehicular networks}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Pages = {{1-19}},
Abstract = {{Recent developments of wireless communication systems have resulted in
   the availability of heterogeneous access networks at any geographic
   area. To make use of this heterogeneous environment for vehicular users
   to access the Internet, in this article we propose a hybrid
   multi-technology routing (HMTR) protocol for multihop vehicular
   networks. HMTR takes into account different combinations of wireless
   technologies in intermediate hops and is generally formed of a
   combination of topology-based and position-based routing schemes for
   packet forwarding. For a given packet, HMTR uses the position-based
   routing approach over highly variable links whose lifetimes are shorter
   than the packet expiry time. On the other hand, it employs the
   topology-based routing approach over more stable links that are expected
   to stay valid before the expiry time of the packet. Among the candidate
   routes, any route which does not meet the user requirements in terms of
   budget or quality of service metrics such as delay and bandwidth is
   ruled out first. Then, among the remained candidates those with adequate
   levels of connectivity are assessed for their appropriateness in terms
   of network utilizations, which are of the network's concern and
   connection costs, which are of users' concern. Simulation results show
   that HMTR enables us to achieve the best possible performance in terms
   of delivery ratio and delivery delay for a given budget, whereas in pure
   position-based or pure topology-based routing schemes sacrificing the
   performance or budget may be inevitable in many scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Batch experiment was carried out in a simulated thermophilic aerobic
   digester to investigate the digestion process of one-stage autothermal
   thermophilic aerobic digester and to explore the sludge stabilization
   mechanism. Volatile solids removal was 38.4\% at 408 h and 45.0\% at 552
   h. Chemical oxidation demand, total nitrogen, and ammonia nitrogen in
   supernatant increased rapidly up to 168 h, and all of them fluctuated
   moderately after 360 h. Volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulated rapidly up
   to 24 to 168 h, then declined sharply, reaching a low concentration
   after 312 h. Propionic, iso-valeric, and isobutyric acids, in addition
   to acetic acids, were also the major components of VFA. As the
   biochemical metabolic process was inhibited under oxygen-deficiency
   condition, the digestion system can produce acetic, propionic, butyric
   acids and other VFA constituents to meet the demand for NAD(+) and
   maximize ATP generation. The ORP affected the VFA production and
   depletion as well as sulfate levels. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Recent literature on synthesis gas conversion to higher alcohols over
   Mo-based catalysts is reviewed. Density functional theory calculations
   show that Mo-CO adsorption is weakened by C, P, or S ligands and this
   facilitates CO dissociation, either directly on Mo2C, or by H-assisted
   dissociation on MoS2, Mo2C, and MoP. Consequently, Mo-based catalysts
   have high hydrocarbon selectivity unless they are promoted with alkali
   metals and/or Group VIII metals. Promoted MoS2 and MoP have alcohol
   selectivities of similar to 80 C atom \% (CO2-free basis) at typical
   operating conditions (5-8 MPa, H-2/CO = 2-1, 537-603 K), whereas on
   promoted Mo2C, alcohol selectivities are similar to 60\%. The kinetics
   of the synthesis gas conversion reactions over Mo-based catalysts have
   mostly been described by empirical power law models and the alcohol and
   hydrocarbon product distributions are consistent with a CO insertion
   mechanism for chain growth.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel haptic technique for emulating hard
   surfaces with high realism; such a technique has significant potential
   utility in certain orthopedic surgery applications such as joint
   replacement surgery where the goal is to prevent incursions beyond a
   virtual surface during bone cutting operations. The Dynamic Physical
   Constraint (DPC) concept uses a unidirectional physical constraint that
   is actively positioned to limit movement between two manipulator links;
   the concept is applicable to providing virtual constraints in both 2D
   and 3D workspaces. Simulation results demonstrate the potential
   feasibility of the concept, and a prototype device was built for
   testing. The DPC device provides a convincing sensation of a real, hard
   virtual surface which can be smoothly tracked when the end effector is
   in contact with the surface. Incursion across the surface with the
   prototype was well submillimetric and within the accuracy constraints
   required for joint replacement applications.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of silver ions, galena, and pyrite on the kinetics of
   chalcopyrite leaching have been studied. In addition, the effects of
   galena and pyrite pretreated with silver ions have been investigated. It
   has been found that the addition of silver ions, pyrite, and pyrite
   pretreated with silver ions accelerates the rate of chalcopyrite
   leaching significantly. The addition of galena has minimal effect on the
   kinetics of chalcopyrite leaching. Considering the high cost of silver,
   the possibility of recycling these catalysts was also examined. The
   results indicate that direct recycling of silver ions as a catalyst is
   not feasible; however, silver-enhanced pyrite can be efficiently
   recycled to subsequent leaching tests. Secondary Electron Microscopy and
   Electron Diffraction X-ray techniques were applied to study the
   morphology and elemental composition of residues after completion of
   leaching experiments. In this study, formation of a porous sulfur layer
   around chalcopyrite was observed in both the presence and absence of
   catalysts indicating that acceleration of the rate of chalcopyrite
   leaching in the presence of catalysts is not due to the alteration of
   morphology of sulfur around chalcopyrite. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Physical, chemical, and microscopic characterization of industrially
   electrowon zinc was performed with a focus on cataloguing morphological
   differences between sticky and non-sticky zinc deposits. Preferred
   crystal deposition plane orientations were analyzed by XRD. The crystal
   orientations for the sticky samples reveal small angle growth (similar
   to 25 degrees) to the cathode surface. In non-sticky samples, the
   crystals were oriented at an average of similar to 44 degrees to the
   cathode surface. Deposit microstructures were studied by SEM and optical
   microscopy. These revealed flat or basal zinc platelets with a number of
   pores for the sticky deposits whereas the non-sticky deposits were
   compact, sharp-edged and featured continuous grains with angular crystal
   plane depositions. No differences in deposit impurity contents were
   observed by elemental (ICP) and EDX analyses. Microhardness studies of
   the deposit cross-sections revealed that the sticky samples were, on
   average, softer than the non-sticky samples particularly at locations
   closer to the Al cathode. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Handling and updating uncertain information in bow-tie analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF LOSS PREVENTION IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Bow-tie analysis is a fairly new concept in risk assessment that can
   describe the relationships among different risk control parameters, such
   as causes, hazards and consequences to mitigate the likelihood of
   occurrence of unwanted events in an industrial system. It also
   facilitates the performance of quantitative risk analysis for an
   unwanted event providing a detailed investigation starting from basic
   causes to final consequences. The credibility of quantitative evaluation
   of the bow-tie is still a major concern since uncertainty, due to
   limited or missing data, often restricts the performance of analysis.
   The utilization of expert knowledge often provides an alternative for
   such a situation. However, it comes at the cost of possible
   uncertainties related to incompleteness (partial ignorance), imprecision
   (subjectivity), and lack of consensus (if multiple expert judgments are
   used). Further, if the bow-tie analysis is not flexible enough to
   incorporate new knowledge or evidence, it may undermine the purpose of
   risk assessment.
   Fuzzy set and evidence theory are capable of characterizing the
   uncertainty associated with expert knowledge. To minimize the overall
   uncertainty, fusing the knowledge of multiple experts and updating prior
   knowledge with new evidence are equally important in addition to
   addressing the uncertainties in the knowledge. This paper proposes a
   methodology to characterize the uncertainties, aggregate knowledge and
   update prior knowledge or evidence, if new data become available for the
   bow-tie analysis. A case study comprising a bow-tie for a typical
   offshore process facility has also been developed to describe the
   utility of this methodology in an industrial environment. (C) 2011

Pages = {{977-982}},
Abstract = {{A fluidized bed photoreactor with titanium dioxide-immobilized spherical
   activated carbon particles was examined. The light intensity profile was
   modeled using the Lambert-Beer rule for the modeling of the radial
   distribution of liquid-phase phenol concentration in the fluidized bed
   photoreactor, when considering the reactor composed of numerous
   differential annular drums and no mass transfer between drums. The model
   could be well matched with the experimental data which indicated the
   liquid flow rate of 13.8 L/min was the optimum in the balance of flow
   rate-related light penetration and photocatalyst concentration. By
   integration of liquid-phase phenol concentration along the radius,
   photocatalytic oxidation performance of the photoreactor was evaluated
   in comparison with the experimental data and model prediction. The
   results showed that the errors were less than 30\% for most of the
   predictions. It is suggested that mass transfer and flow rate difference
   along the radial direction should be considered to obtain more precise
   prediction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an extension to an algorithm called HYST to develop
   the hysteresis characteristics of a nail connection. The paper also
   discusses the implementation of the algorithm in a finite-element model
   of a wood shear wall, called WALL2D, to study the hysteretic wall
   response. The HYST algorithm is a protocol-independent and
   mechanics-based procedure that considers the nail shank as steel beam
   elements and the wood embedment medium as compression-only spring
   elements smeared along the nail shank. By accounting for the stiffness
   degradation of the wood embedment medium under cyclic loading, HYST can
   fully address strength/stiffness degradation and the pinching effect in
   the hysteresis of typical nail connections. HYST was verified by the
   load-slip hystereses from nail connections tested with two different
   loading protocols. The WALL2D application model consists of linear
   elastic beam elements for framing members, orthotropic plate elements
   for sheathing panels, linear springs for framing connections, and
   oriented nonlinear springs for panel-frame nail connections. The
   hysteretic behavior of the nonlinear springs is represented by the HYST
   algorithm. The wall model was verified by reversed cyclic test results
   of two types of shear walls. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000438.

Abstract = {{Red blood cells parasitized by Plasmodium falciparum can be
   distinguished from uninfected cells and characterized on the basis of
   reduced deformability. To enable improved and simplified analysis, we
   developed a microfluidic device to measure red blood cell deformability
   using precisely controlled pressure. Individual red blood cells are
   deformed through multiple funnel-shaped constrictions with openings
   ranging from 5 down to 1 mm. Precisely controlled pressures are
   generated on-chip using a microfluidic circuit that attenuates an
   externally applied pressure by a factor of 100. The pressures required
   to squeeze each cell through the constriction are used as a readout to
   determine the intrinsic stiffness of each cell. Using this method,
   parasitized cells from ring through schizont stages were shown to be 1.5
   to 200 times stiffer than uninfected cells. The measured deformability
   values of uninfected and parasitized cells showed clearly distinct
   distributions, demonstrating the potential of using this technique to
   study the pathophysiology of this disease, and the effect of potential
   drugs.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc can be removed from natural acid rock drainage by clinoptilolite, a
   natural sorbent, in a slurry bubble column. Afterwards, the
   clinoptilolite can be regenerated. This paper investigates the
   regeneration of clinoptilolite after it has been used for zinc removal
   and assesses the effects of regeneration time, regenerant concentration,
   pH, solution/sorbent ratio, water quality and uptake capacity of the
   regenerated clinoptilolite. Satisfactory treatment was achieved using 20
   g L-1 NaCl solution in distilled water, adjusted to a pH of 3. Good
   regeneration was achieved for 1 h agitation in the slurry bubble column,
   with a regenerant/sorbent ratio of 10 g g(-1). Tests with the
   regenerated clinoptilolite revealed promising Zn removal capacity. (C)

Volume = {{167}},
Pages = {{18-29}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The capillary flow of a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) melt was
   studied both experimentally and numerically. The excess pressure drop
   due to entry (entrance pressure drop), the compressibility, the effect
   of pressure and temperature on viscosity, and the slip effects on the
   capillary data analysis have been examined. Using a series of capillary
   dies having different diameters, D, and length-to-diameter LID ratios, a
   full theological characterization has been carried out, and the
   experimental data have been fitted both with a viscous model (Cross) and
   a viscoelastic one (the Kaye-Bernstein, Kearsley, Zapas/Papanastasiou,
   Scriven, Macosko or K-BKZ/PSM model). Particular emphasis has been
   placed on the effects of wall slip (significant for HDPE). For the
   viscous model, the viscosity is a function of both temperature and
   pressure. For the viscoelastic K-BKZ model, the time-temperature
   shifting concept has been used for the non-isothermal calculations,
   while the time-pressure shifting concept has been used to shift the
   relaxation moduli for the pressure-dependence effect. It was found that
   only the viscoelastic simulations were capable of reproducing the
   experimental data well. On the other hand, viscous modeling
   underestimates the pressures drops, especially at the higher apparent
   shear rates and L/D ratios. It is concluded that wall slip effects are
   significant for HDPE flow, whereas viscous heating is not. (C) 2011

Title = {{Incomplete fluid-fluid displacement of yield stress fluids in

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{167}},
Pages = {{59-74}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We present results of a primarily experimental study of buoyant miscible
   displacement flows of a yield stress fluid by a higher density Newtonian
   fluid along a long pipe, inclined at angles close to horizontal. We
   focus on the industrially interesting case where the yield stress is
   significantly larger than a typical viscous stress in the displacing
   fluid, but where buoyancy forces may be significant. We identify two
   distinct flow regimes: a central-type displacement regime and a
   slump-type regime for higher density ratios. In the central-type
   displacement flows, we find non-uniform static residual layers all
   around the pipe wall with long-wave variation along the pipe. In the
   slump-type displacement we generally detect two propagating displacement
   fronts. A fast front propagates in a thin layer near the bottom of the
   pipe. A much slower second front follows, displacing a thicker layer of
   the pipe but sometimes stopping altogether when buoyancy effects are
   reduced by spreading of the front. In the thin lower layer the flow rate
   is focused which results in large effective Reynolds numbers, moving
   into transitional regimes. These flows are frequently unsteady and the
   displacing fluid can channel through the yield stress fluid in an
   erratic fashion. We show that the two regimes are delineated by the
   value of the Archimedes numbers (equivalently, the Reynolds number
   divided by the densimetric Froude number), a parameter which is
   independent of the imposed flow rate. We present the phenomenology of
   the two flow regimes. In simplified configurations, we compare
   computational and analytical predictions of the flow behaviour (e.g.
   static layer thickness, axial velocity) with our experimental
   observations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{AJAX-based Web 2.0 applications rely on stateful asynchronous
   client/server communication, and client-side runtime manipulation of the
   DOM tree. This not only makes them fundamentally different from
   traditional web applications, but also more error-prone and harder to
   test. We propose a method for testing AJAX applications automatically,
   based on a crawler to infer a state-flow graph for all (client-side)
   user interface states. We identify AJAX-specific faults that can occur
   in such states (related to, e.g., DOM validity, error messages,
   discoverability, back-button compatibility) as well as DOM-tree
   invariants that can serve as oracles to detect such faults. Our
   approach, called ATUSA, is implemented in a tool offering generic
   invariant checking components, a plugin-mechanism to add
   application-specific state validators, and generation of a test suite
   covering the paths obtained during crawling. We describe three case
   studies, consisting of six subjects, evaluating the type of invariants
   that can be obtained for AJAX applications as well as the fault
   revealing capabilities, scalability, required manual effort, and level
   of automation of our testing approach.}},

Abstract = {{Simulcasting involves transmitting the same signal simultaneously over
   several antennas on the same carrier frequency. We derive the optimal
   grouping condition for simulcasting over a massively distributed antenna
   system (DAS) employing orthogonal space-time block coding (STBC), where
   the order of the STBC coding matrix n(o) is smaller than the number of
   remote antenna units (RAUs). While the optimum grouping minimizes the
   average bit error rate (BER) in the coverage area, we further propose
   two heuristic grouping rules and derive the corresponding
   stream-balanced grouping schemes in three DAS topologies, namely,
   linear, hexagonal and square lattice, to achieve low average BER across
   the area covered by the DAS. Simulation results for the different
   topologies confirm the superiority of the proposed grouping schemes
   compared with the other grouping methods. Also, when either n(o) or the
   RAU density increases, the average BER decreases.}},

   diffusion layer (unteflonated and teflonated with 30\%wt PTFE,

   20\%wt PTFE, were investigated in 6 M KOH without and with O-2,
   respectively. Four sources of MnO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, Tronox, Riedel and
   Merck Inc.) were comparatively studied by electrochemical methods
   accompanied by XRD characterization. Cyclic voltammetry scans of GDE in
   N-2-purged electrolyte were used to estimate the Tafel slopes for Mn(IV)
   reduction and to identify active Mn(IV) sites that play an important
   catalytic role. Two oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanisms were
   identified by porous rotating disk electrode (PRDE) polarization as a
   function of electrode potential. At high potentials (above -300 mV vs.
   MOE) the O-2/HO2- step is mainly catalyzed by the quasi-unreduced MnO2
   surface and active sites on the carbon support, while at potentials more
   negative than -300 mV, the redox catalysis by Mn(III) prevails. The main
   catalytic sites for the second step HO2-/OH-, are Mn(III) sites. The
   hydrophobic property of the porous electrode is important due to the
   effect on peroxide desorption/readsorption on the electrode surface.

Abstract = {{In this paper, Nb-doped TiO2 with anatase and rutile phases was
   synthesized by the acid-catalyzed sol-gel method, and used as catalyst
   supports for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Energy dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (EDX), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) were used to
   characterize the support materials in terms of material structures,
   morphology, composition, and surface area. XRD analysis showed that both
   the high concentration of hydrochloric acid present in the synthesis and
   the presence of Pt in the support could favor the formation of
   conductive rutile phased TiO2, resulting in the improvement of
   electronic conduction of the Nb-doped TiO2 support, which was confirmed
   by measured conductivities. For electrochemical characterization and ORR
   catalyst activity validation, Pt particles were deposited on the
   supports synthesized in this paper to form several catalysts, which were
   tested for electrochemical Pt surface area, ORR mass activity and
   specific activity. A monotonic increase in Pt ORR mass activity with
   increasing catalyst support's conductivity suggested that the support
   conductivity plays an important role in enhancing catalyst mass
   activity. The results showed that these non-carbon supported catalysts
   are promising as PEM fuel cell cathode catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{A central aspect of the linear vibration theory of rotating disks
   involves the concept of critical speeds. At such rotation speeds an
   axisymmetric disk can support a standing wave as recorded by a
   stationary observer. In such situations an applied space fixed constant
   force can give rise to a resonance in the disk. Such a response is of
   concern in industrial applications as diverse as circular saw blades and
   computer floppy disks. In such situations the magnitude of response may
   exceed the limits of linear theory. The present paper is concerned with
   the effects of large displacements upon the disk response in the
   neighborhood of such critical speeds. The effects of geometric
   nonlinearities and the influence of rigid body tilting and translation
   (caused by the boundary conditions) are considered. The equations of
   motion are based on Von Karman plate theory. The eigenfunctions of two
   self-adjoint eigenvalue problems, corresponding to the stress function
   and the transverse displacement, are determined and used as
   approximation functions in a numerically efficient Galerkin formulation.
   The coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations of motion are
   solved using the Runge-Kutta method. Numerical results are presented for
   disks that are free to translate and rotate at their inner boundary and
   are constrained from lateral motion by space fixed linear springs. The
   effects of vibration magnitude on system response in the sub and
   super-critical speed regions are computed and the effects of large
   displacements on critical speed behavior and forced response are
   investigated. Experiments are conducted to verify the accuracy of the
   numerical results obtained in this paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The human immune system is a network of cells, tissues, and organs that
   defends the body against pathogens. The system is highly distributed and
   cooperative, which works in a coordinated manner to eliminate pathogens.
   This paper presents a framework based on an artificial immune system
   (AIS) for a cooperative multi-robot system (MRS) that is fully
   autonomous and fault tolerant. The present MRS consists of a team of
   mobile robots that communicate, coordinate and cooperate with each other
   to achieve a global goal, while resolving conflicts and accommodating
   full and partial failures in the robots. In this framework, the system
   autonomously chooses the appropriate number of robots required for
   carrying out the global task in an unknown and unpredictable
   environment. The developed approach of coordination and cooperation
   among robots is based on Jerne's idiotypic network theory and the
   structure of an antibody in the human immune system. The feasibility of
   the scheme is demonstrated by implementing the approach on a team of
   mobile robots that cooperatively transport an object to a goal location.}},

Abstract = {{The results of 26 plate load tests carried out at the Bakhtiary dam site
   were analyzed to define and characterise the mechanisms governing the
   rock mass deformation during the tests. Tests were categorized into
   groups based on the relative direction of loading to the orientation of
   major discontinuity sets running through the rock mass. Five mechanisms
   were distinguished as the main modes controlling deformations of the
   rock mass during the tests. These mechanisms were based on analysis of
   the shape of stress-deformation curves, total and plastic deformation,
   anisotropy and deformation hysteresis. This study shows that part of the
   scatter commonly observed in the moduli calculated from plate load tests
   can be attributed to the different deformation mechanisms that are
   mobilized during the tests. Incompatibility of the theoretical
   assumptions, made for the interpretation of the test results, with
   actual deformation mechanisms is shown to be another factor causing
   scatter in the calculated moduli. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this article, the effect of electrophoresis on the transport of a
   sample (like biomolecules) in active microreactors is numerically
   investigated. Navier-Stokes equations are solved along with the
   equations of electrostatics, species mass transport in the buffer, and
   chemical reaction kinetics at reactive surfaces. Unlike previous
   studies, in which the effect of the charge of the sample molecules on
   the electric field has been neglected (i.e., the assumption of
   electroneutrality), here the space charge density is assumed to be
   nonzero and a function of biomolecule concentration. As a result, the
   governing equations become fully coupled. The validity of the assumption
   is examined against experimental results. Then, the effect of
   electroneutrality on the efficiency of the microreactor device is
   analyzed for the parallel plate open channel geometry, commonly used in
   biomolecule separation. It is shown that the electroneutrality
   assumption can drastically influence the final adsorbed concentration
   depending on the device configuration. Average adsorbed surface
   concentration and capture efficiency are compared as measures of the
   performance of the device for a wide range of physiochemical parameters.
   The sensitivity of the simulation with respect to the ionic
   concentration of the buffer is investigated. It is also discussed how
   the electric field and nonzero space charge density alter the bulk
   concentration profile and the velocity field inside the microreactor.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, an electrohydrodynamic approach is used to study the
   microdroplet actuation in contemporary digital microfluidic biochips.
   The model is employed to analyze the microdroplet motion, and
   investigate the effects of the key parameters on the devices
   performance. The modeling results are compared to the experimental
   observations, and it is shown that the model provides an accurate
   representation of digital microfluidic transport. An extensive
   parametric variation is used to derive the maximum actuation switching
   frequency for ranges of the microdroplet size, gap spacing between the
   top and bottom plates and electrode pitch size. As a result, scalability
   of the devices is investigated, and it is shown that the microdroplet
   transfer rates change inversely with the system size, and microdroplet
   average velocity is nearly the same for different system scales. As a
   result of this study, an adjustable force-based actuation switching
   frequency implementation is proposed, and it is shown that faster
   microdroplet motion is obtained by in situ adjusting of the switching
   frequency. Finally, it has been observed that fastest microdroplet
   motion, despite similar studies conducted in the literature, is not
   achieved via actuating the next electrode as soon as the microdroplet
   touches it. Indeed, the switching frequency spectrum is dependent on the
   physical and geometrical properties of the system.}},

Volume = {{215-16}},

Abstract = {{Fluidization characteristics of fly ash were investigated in a fluidized
   bed subjected to mechanical vibrations. In the presence of mechanical
   vibrations, the minimum fluidization velocity decreased from 4.0 to 1.0
   mm/s, and the pressure drop increased slightly. The charge-to-mass
   ratios of fly ash along the fluidized column revealed that charging
   behavior of fly ash in the freeboard region significantly differed from
   that in the dense bed region. In the dense bed region, the net charges
   of fly ash were slightly negative or almost neutral, whereas fly ash in
   the freeboard region tended to carry positive charges. Loss-on-ignition
   (LOI) of fly ash was examined in different regions of the fluidized bed,
   and the results showed that LOI varied considerably inside the column,
   generally being lower in the freeboard than in the dense bed since finer
   particles were entrained into the freeboard. In the dense bed,
   particle-wall collisions resulted in positively charged carbon and
   negatively charged ash particles, whereas carbon particles in the
   freeboard region tended to carry negative charges. The findings
   demonstrate the potential for separating unburned carbon from fly ash by
   utilizing a vibro-fluidized bed as a tribocharger. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Title = {{Sustainable road safety: A new (?) neighbourhood road pattern that saves
   VRU lives}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{140-148}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Both the UN (2007) and World Health Organizations (2004) have declared
   the enormous social and economic burden imposed on society by injuries
   due to road collisions as a major global problem. While the road safety
   problem is not new, this prominent global declaration sends an important
   signal of frustration regarding progress to date on reducing road
   collisions. It is clear that governments, communities, businesses and
   the public must discover ways of reducing this burden, especially as it
   relates to vulnerable road users (VRUs), typically meaning pedestrian
   and bicyclist road users. Recent comparisons of global VRU collisions
   statistics suggest that, in addition to mixed land use density, the
   layout of neighbourhood roads plays a vital role in the encouragement of
   walkable, safe and quiet, yet accessible and sustainable communities.
   The purpose of this paper was to:
   (1) Review the literature concerning sustainable neighbourhood land use
   and transportation network patterns, increased VRU volumes, and road
   safety;
   (2) Present empirical research results on road safety related to VRU
   volumes; and
   (3) Present emerging research regarding more sustainable land use and
   transportation patterns, increased VRU volumes, and road safety.
   The Dutch Sustainable Road Safety (SRS) Program has produced a number of
   innovative land use and transportation initiatives for vehicular road
   users as well as non-vehicular VRUs. Following from the Dutch
   initiatives, these new 3-way offset, and fused grid neighbourhood
   patterns appear to not only have positive effects in encouraging mode
   split (i.e. increasing walking and bicycling, and transit), slowing
   traffic, and reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions; but also, to
   hold potential to improve road safety.
   To test the road safety hypothesis, UBCO researchers evaluated the level
   of road safety relative to five neighbourhood patterns - grid,
   culs-de-sac, and Dutch Sustainable Road Safety (SRS) (or limited
   access), 3-way offset, and fused grid networks. Analysis using standard
   transportation planning methodology revealed that they would maintain
   both mobility and accessibility. Analysis using standard road safety
   analysis methodology further revealed that these 3-way offset, and fused
   grid patterns would significantly improve road safety levels by as much
   as 60\% compared to prevalent patterns (i.e. grid and culs-de-sac).
   It is important to note that these results ignore the road safety
   effects of providing convenient off-road trails along trip desire lines
   to shift mode choice from auto to non-auto VRU modes. Subject to further
   research, it is intuitive that shifting trips from auto to
   pedestrian/bike modes will lead to reduced auto collisions. Hence, these
   initial results should be considered as conservative estimates, subject
   to further research. In before and after studies to date, researchers
   have shown that increasing bicycle use does not lead to a commensurate
   increase in bicycle collisions, but no predictive relationship has been
   found in the literature. Therefore, the next steps in this research are
   to develop collision prediction models that provide insight on VRU mode
   split and overall road safety. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Structural characteristics of Fe3+ oxide/silica co-precipitates were
   investigated. The association between these materials is relevant to
   practically all natural aqueous systems due to the prevalence of iron
   and silicon in the Earth's crust. Crystallographic information is very
   difficult to obtain from these precipitates due to the nanocrystalline
   nature of ferrihydrite and the amorphous structure of precipitated
   silica. Several previously undetermined key insights were gained into
   the structure of iron oxide/silica co-precipitates through this
   examination. The distribution of iron and silicon throughout
   co-precipitate particles is illustrated along with the influence of
   their association. Evidence to the governing factor behind differences
   in apparent crystallinity is also presented. This information culminates
   in the formulation of a precipitation pathway, displaying the formation
   of the co-precipitates.}},

Abstract = {{Inadequate communication and non-availability of information have been
   widely observed in construction projects, causing low productivity and
   tool times of around 50\% in high-rise building construction projects.
   The use of information technology to overcome communication barriers has
   been extremely limited at the construction site level, as construction
   companies typically hesitate to adopt new technologies. However, workers
   have expressed their willingness and ability to use new technologies at
   the construction site level. By considering the views of all the
   relevant construction stakeholders - workers, managers and technology
   developers - a novel information technology based communication concept
   called the Information Booth was developed and was pilot tested in an
   actual construction project environment, improving the tool time,
   productivity and worker satisfaction. The Information Booth then evolved
   into the i-Booth (c) with many additional features, including virtual
   supervision with a real-time information synchronizing system and camera
   system. This paper describes the possible applications of information
   technologies in the construction industry with the introduction of the

Abstract = {{The influence of submerged arc welding (SAW) process parameters on the

   in the present work. Steel plates of 17 mm thickness were submerged arc
   welded using welding currents of 700-850 A and welding speeds of
   5.3-15.3 mm s(-1). The morphologies and volume fractions of the various
   ferrites in the WM were studied using optical microscopy and the
   morphologies and chemical compositions of the WM inclusions were
   examined using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive Xray
   spectrometry. The results showed that the WM grain structure coarsened
   but the grain width of prior austenite grains decreased with increasing
   heat input. Also, the proportion of acicular ferrite (AF) in the WM
   increased initially, while the volume fractions of grain boundary
   ferrite and Widmanstatten ferrite decreased with increasing welding
   current. However, with further increasing the welding current above 800
   A, less AF was produced. The weld nugget area decreased with increasing
   welding speed at all currents, but did not affect the amount of AF
   produced.}},

Abstract = {{Properties of apatites, such as bioactivity, biocompatibility,

   nanopowders with different Mg contents were prepared via sol-gel method.
   In vitro bioactivity evaluation of powders was performed by soaking the
   powders in simulated body fluid (SBF). Results indicated that Mg ions
   entered into the fluorapatite lattice and occupied Ca(2+) sites, and the
   obtained powders had crystallite size about 30-100 nm. With increasing
   the Mg-substitution, the solubility of powders and the adsorption of
   Ca(2+) ions onto the powders surfaces increased simultaneously. It was
   concluded that Mg-substitution improves the bioactivity of FA. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The use of superelastic shape memory alloys (SMAs) as a reinforcing
   material in concrete structures is gradually gaining interest among
   researchers. Because of SMAs' different mechanical properties compared
   to regular steel, use of SMA as reinforcement in concrete may change
   responses of structures under seismic loads. In this study, the effect
   of SMA as reinforcement in concrete structures is analytically
   investigated for three different storeys (3, 6 and 8) reinforced
   concrete (RC) buildings. For each building, three different
   reinforcement detailing are considered: (i) steel reinforcement (Steel)
   only, (ii) SMA rebar used in the plastic hinge region of the beams and
   steel rebar in other regions (Steel-SMA), and (iii), beams fully
   reinforced with SMA rebar (SMA) and steel rebar in other regions. For
   each case, columns were reinforced with steel rebar. Nonlinear static
   pushover analyses were performed to determine the overstrength and
   ductility of Steel, Steel-SMA and SMA RC buildings. Furthermore,
   nonlinear dynamic time history analyses were also performed using an
   ensemble of ten earthquake records to determine the seismic demand and
   capacity ratio in terms of base shear and drift for each type of RC
   building. Results obtained from the analyses confirm the seismic
   performance of low and medium rise frames while utilizing SMA as
   reinforcement. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As there are many correlations linking the liquid limit directly or
   indirectly with various engineering properties of the soil, the accurate
   determination of the liquid limit is quite essential. Generally, two
   methods, i.e. Casagrande's and fall cone are adopted to determine the
   liquid limit of soil. Research was carried out to study the influence of
   the properties of bentonite and the presence of the salt solution on the
   liquid limit values of soil-bentonite mixtures determined by the
   Casagrande's and fall cone methods. The results showed that irrespective
   of the presence of the type of bentonite or salt solution, a higher
   value of the liquid limit was obtained by the Casagrande's method as
   compared to the fall cone method. However, the difference between the
   two methods decreased with the decrease in the liquid limit, clay
   fraction, specific surface area and free swelling capacity of the
   bentonite present in the mixture. Similarly, the difference in the
   liquid limit values obtained by both these methods is reduced with an
   increase in the salt concentration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the size effects in the dynamic torsional

   torsional vibrations and the propagation speed of torsional waves. To
   this end, dispersion relations of torsional waves are obtained from the
   proposed nonlocal model and compared to classical models. It is seen

Abstract = {{Studying brain connectivity has provided new in-sights to the
   understanding of brain function. While connectivity measures are
   conventionally computed from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals
   directly, the presence of volume conduction represents a serious
   confound affecting interpretation of results. A common solution is to
   use a two-stage approach which involves estimating underlying brain
   sources from scalp EEG recordings and subsequently estimating the
   connectivity between the inferred sources. Recently, a state-space
   framework which jointly models the instantaneous mixing effects of
   volume conduction and the causal relationships between underlying brain
   sources is proposed. In this paper, we extend the state-space framework
   and model the source activity by a generalized multivariate
   autoregressive(mAR) process with possibly non-Gaussian noise. A maximum
   likelihood estimation approach is developed which allows simultaneous
   estimation of both the mixing matrix and AR model parameters directly
   from scalp EEG. The proposed technique was verified with simulated EEG
   data generated using the single-shell spherical head model and
   demonstrated improved estimation accuracies compared to conventional
   two-stage connectivity estimation approaches. Furthermore, the proposed
   technique was applied to EEG data collected from normal and Parkinson's
   subjects performing a right-handed force-tracking task with differing
   amounts of visual feedback. The partial directed coherence (PDC) between
   sources showed significant differences between groups and conditions.
   These results suggest that the proposed technique is a powerful method
   to extract connectivity information from EEG recordings.}},

Abstract = {{The origin of visible light absorption and photocatalytic activity of
   nonmetal doped anatase TiO2 were investigated in details in this work
   based on density functional theory calculations. Our results indicate
   that the electronegativity is of great significance in the band
   structures, which determines the relative positions of impurity states
   induced by the doping species, and further influences the optical
   absorption and photocatalytic activities of doped TiO2. The effect of
   charge balance on the electronic structure was also discussed, and it
   was found that the charge-balance structures may be more efficient for
   visible light photocatalytic activities. In addition, the edge positions
   of conduction band and valence band, which determine the ability of a
   semiconductor to transfer photoexcited electrons to species adsorbed on
   its surface, were predicted as well. The results may provide a reference

Abstract = {{Mining is a water intensive activity, and reducing water consumption is
   a key requirement in moving toward a more sustainable mining industry.
   This paper identifies mine water reduction, reuse and recycle options,
   and demonstrates cases where these options have been implemented around
   the world. A mine water system model is developed and used to show
   potential water saving strategies through six scenarios. Apart from the
   base case, these scenarios include the introduction of evaporation
   reduction strategies, paste tailings disposal, filtered tailings
   disposal, ore pre-sorting and a combination of the most effective
   options. The results of the modeling show how an open-pit copper mine
   with a traditional layout can move from having an average water
   withdrawal of 0.76 m(3)/t of ore processed to 0.20 m(3)/t of ore
   processed or lower. A key result of the modeling is the discovery that a
   combination of ore pre-concentration and filtered tailings disposal can
   reduce water consumption by 74\% or more. This finding demonstrates an
   opportunity to significantly lower water consumption on mine sites. (C)

Pages = {{C8-C14}},
Abstract = {{Most of the electrochemistry of chalcopyrite reported in the literature
   has been done using either massive samples of the mineral or carbon
   paste electrodes. Despite its importance, reports of the electrochemical
   behavior of this mineral carried on individual microparticles are
   scarce. In this work the microelectrochemistry of chalcopyrite is
   studied in sulfuric acid solutions, focusing the study on its behavior
   at transpassive potentials. It is shown that microparticles with sizes
   typically found in chalcopyrite concentrates (20 to 100 mu m) can be
   leached to completion in less than 4 minutes at room conditions under
   the influence of 1.2 V (SCE). According to EDX analysis, atomic
   absorption spectroscopy and ICP, around 88\% of the sulfur in the
   mineral is transformed into a compact layer of amorphous plastic sulfur,
   while the rest is transformed to sulphate. The plastic sulfur gradually
   equilibrates to more stable Sg-rings orthorhombic phase. This nearly
   instantaneous dissolution of chalcopyrite opens the window to the
   development of new technologies. (C) 2011 The Electrochemical Society.

Abstract = {{The reconstruction of magnetic resonance (MR) images from the partial
   samples of their k-space data using compressed sensing (CS)-based
   methods has generated a lot of interest in recent years. To reconstruct
   the MR images, these techniques exploit the sparsity of the image in a
   transform domain (wavelets, total variation, etc.). In a recent work, it
   has been shown that it is also possible to reconstruct MR images by
   exploiting their rank deficiency. In this work, it will be shown that,
   instead of exploiting the sparsity of the image or rank deficiency
   alone, better reconstruction results can be achieved by combining
   transform domain sparsity with rank deficiency.
   To reconstruct an MR image using its transform domain sparsity and its
   rank deficiency, this work proposes a combined l(1)-norm (of the
   transform coefficients) and nuclear norm (of the MR image matrix)
   minimization problem. Since such an optimization problem has not been
   encountered before, this work proposes and derives a first-order
   algorithm to solve it.
   The reconstruction results show that the proposed approach yields
   significant improvements, in terms of both visual quality as well as the
   signal to noise ratio, over previous works that reconstruct MR images
   either by exploiting rank deficiency or by the standard CS-based
   technique popularly known as the `Sparse MRI.' (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Journal = {{MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A number of recent studies have indicated that the extent of the
   elastoplastic stage in nanocrystalline polycrystals, with grain sizes
   smaller than several hundred nanometres, is appreciably larger than that
   for coarse-grained polycrystals (i.e. grain sizes larger than
   approximate to 1 mu m). The so-called tangent modulus approach has,
   accordingly, been used in order to identify the extent of this stage and
   to define the stress at which all the grains of a polycrystal become
   plastic. In this work, the applicability of this methodology to
   single-phase polycrystals, where deformation is accommodated by
   dislocation slip, is examined in the context of a grain size dependent
   elastoplastic self-consistent model. Assuming the size distribution is
   the primary cause of inhomogeneous yielding among the grains of a
   polycrystal, the stress-strain behaviour of a number of lognormal, fcc
   polycrystals with varying mean grain sizes and standard deviations is
   simulated. The true yield strength of the polycrystals is determined by
   monitoring the evolution of the volume fraction of yielded grains as a
   function of imposed deformation. It is found that yielding is
   essentially complete when the tangent modulus (i.e. the work hardening
   rate) of the polycrystal drops below similar to E/20, with E being
   Young's modulus. A simple statistical model for the simulation of the
   elastoplastic response of polycrystals is introduced. Using this model,
   the offset strain corresponding to the onset of macro-plasticity in
   copper polycrystals having different grain size distributions is
   determined.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a novel method for bone segmentation from
   three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound images that derives
   intensity-invariant 3-D local image phase measures that are then
   employed for extracting ridge-like features similar to those that occur
   at soft tissue/bone interfaces. The main contributions in this article
   include: (1) the extension of our previously proposed
   phase-symmetry-based bone surface extraction from two-dimensional (2-D)
   to 3-D images using 3-D Log-Gabor filters; (2) the design of a new
   framework for accuracy evaluation based on using computed tomography as
   a gold standard that allows the assessment of surface localization
   accuracy across the entire 3-D surface; (3) the quantitative validation
   of accuracy of our 3-D phase-processing approach on both intact and
   fractured bone surfaces using phantoms and ex vivo 3-D ultrasound scans;
   and (4) the qualitative validation obtained by scanning emergency room
   patients with distal radius and pelvis fractures. We show a 41\%
   improvement in surface localization error over the previous 2-D phase
   symmetry method. The results demonstrate clearly visible segmentations
   of bone surfaces with a localization accuracy of <0.6 mm and mean errors
   in estimating fracture displacements below 0.6 mm. The results show that
   the proposed method is successful even for situations when the bone
   surface response is weak due to shadowing from muscle and fascia
   interfaces above the bone, which is a situation where the 2-D method
   fails. (E-mail: rafeef@ece.ubc.ca) (C) 2012 World Federation for

Abstract = {{The results from a duration-of-load and creep testing program on a thick
   strand-based composite product, using wood from forests attacked by the
   mountain pine beetle, are presented. The constant loading of
   experimental beams lasted for 1 year. The long-term deflection was
   monitored and recorded at a pre-set frequency. Time-to-failure data were
   also obtained for all the broken specimens. Ramp load test was carried
   out at different rates of loading to investigate its influence on
   short-term strength. Finally, the fatigue test was conducted with a
   triangular cyclic load history, and the strain history was obtained to
   elucidate the low-cycle fatigue behavior of the composite.}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the creep and duration-of-load (DOL) effects in

   proposed linking the accumulated damage to creep deformation. Results
   from long-term constant load tests have been interpreted by means of
   this creep-rupture model, which is capable of representing the
   time-dependent deflection and time-to-failure data at different stress
   levels. The predictions of the model have been verified using results
   from ramp load test at different rates of loading. The creep-rupture
   model incorporates the short-term strength of the material, the load
   history and predicts the deflection history as well as the
   time-to-failure. As it is a probabilistic model, it allows its
   incorporation into a time-reliability study of wood composites'

Abstract = {{In the present work, stable fluidization of sawdust was achieved in a
   bench fluidized bed with an inclined orifice distributor without inert
   bed materials. A solids circulation pattern was established in the bed
   without the presence of slugging and channeling. The effects of
   treatment severity and weight loss on the solid product properties were
   identified. The decomposition of hemicelluloses was found to be
   responsible for the significant changes of chemical, physical and
   mechanical properties of the torrefied sawdust, including energy
   content, particle size distribution and moisture absorption capacity.
   The hydrophobicity of the torrefied sawdust was improved over the raw
   sawdust with a reduction of around 40 wt.\% in saturated water uptake
   rate, and enhanced with increasing the treatment severity due to the
   decomposition of hemicelluloses which are rich in hydroxyl groups. The
   results in this study provided the basis for torrefaction in fluidized
   bed reactors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical corrosion behavior of Alloy 800 (UNS N08800) in sulfate
   solution was compared in the presence and absence of potassium phosphate
   monobasic/sodium hydroxide (KH(2)PO(4)/NaOH) buffering reagent. Cathodic
   polarization, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy were used to characterize the behavior of hydrogen peroxide
   (H(2)O(2)) reduction in buffered and unbuffered solutions. Open-circuit
   potential measurements, polarization resistance, electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy, and potentiodynamic polarization were utilized
   to evaluate the corrosion behavior of Alloy 800 as affected by the
   buffer reagent. Results showed that reduction of H(2)O(2) takes place at
   higher potentials and with lower charge-transfer resistance in buffered
   solutions. The Alloy 800 passive layer thickened in the presence of the
   buffering reagent and showed lower corrosion rate. The overall anodic
   potentiodynamic behavior was similar in both the buffered and unbuffered
   solutions. Because of its buffering properties, the effect of the
   thiosulfate ion on corrosion behavior was also studied. It was shown
   that the addition of thiosulfate caused rapid dissolution of the passive
   film starting at -200 mV vs. silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl).}},

Abstract = {{A series of measurements was carried out on specimens of submerged arc
   welded plates of ASTM A709 Grade 50 steel to determine how variation in

   reinforcement, bead width, penetration depth, contact angle, heat
   affected zone (HAZ) size, deposition area, penetration area and total
   molten area. The level of dilution and different melting efficiencies
   were calculated and their variation with heat input was analyzed based
   on the acquired measurements. The cooling time from 800 to 500 degrees C
   was also related to various weld bead characteristics (e.g., total
   nugget area, heat transfer boundary lengths, bead width-to-depth ratio,
   and nugget parameter). The bead reinforcement, bead width, penetration
   depth, HAZ size, deposition area and penetration area increased with
   increasing heat input, but the bead contact angle decreased with it. The
   electrode melting efficiency increased initially and then decreased with
   increasing heat input, but the plate melting efficiency and percentage
   dilution changed only slightly with it. Cooling time exhibited a very
   good linear relationship with the total nugget area, heat transfer
   boundary length, and nugget parameter. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Undesired harmonics have severe impacts on performance of electronic

   combining two phase-shifted versions of the signal is introduced. As a
   proof-of-concept, a wideband (0.07 to 7.5 GHz) low-noise amplifier (LNA)
   with 3rd-harmonic cancellation technique is designed and laid out in a
   0.13-mu m CMOS process. In this design, phase-shifter circuits are
   implemented using passive lumped components. Post-layout simulation
   results show that the LNA achieves a noise figure (NF) of 2.3 dB, S-21
   of 17.9 dB while consuming 15.6 mW from a 1.2 V supply and significantly

Abstract = {{The distributed antenna system (DAS) concept promises to enhance the
   capacity and diversity of next-generation wireless communication
   networks, due to the inherently added micro and macro diversity. Today,
   DAS is widely employed in cutting edge cellular communication to cover
   dead spots. The complexity of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
   (OFDM) makes it challenging to build efficient and cost effective DAS
   systems. Orthogonal Wavelet Division Multiplexing (OWDM) is a system
   that has been proposed as an alternative to OFDM. In this paper we
   present a novel Sequential Output based Parallel Processing (SBPP)
   architecture for DAS using OWDM scheme. The experimental evaluation was
   done on a virtual test bed that includes one central processor with
   multiple antenna nodes and multiple mobile stations. The novel
   architecture shows a new approach that could provide a more flexible
   replacement for OFDM with reduced Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and
   Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI), while still maintaining the same
   channel capacity characteristics as OFDM. The architecture also
   demonstrates an efficient resource optimization technique based on
   LTE-driven data rate requirements for multimedia applications.}},

Abstract = {{A decision maker records measurements of a finite-state Markov chain
   corrupted by noise. The goal is to decide when the Markov chain hits a
   specific target state. The decision maker can choose from a finite set
   of sampling intervals to pick the next time to look at the Markov chain.
   The aim is to optimize an objective comprising of false alarm, delay
   cost and cumulative measurement sampling cost. The paper shows that
   under reasonable conditions, the optimal strategy has the following
   intuitive structure: when the Bayesian estimate (posterior distribution)
   of the Markov chain is away from the target state, look less frequently;
   while if the posterior is close to the target state, look more
   frequently. Bounds are derived for the optimal strategy. Also the
   achievable optimal cost of the sequential detector as a function of
   transition dynamics and observation distribution is analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Peer-to-peer assessment, with student teams evaluating the work of other
   teams, has the potential to greatly enrich student learning and the
   classroom environment, as well as compliment instructor-based
   assessments. This paper examines four peer-to-peer assessment techniques
   used in large engineering design courses. These techniques have been
   identified, and, through several iterations, developed to work well in
   the design engineering classroom setting. The four techniques include:
   evaluation of designs through a Poster Gallery Walk; Design Tournaments
   where candidate designs are successively eliminated through multiple
   rounds of review; ``Hot Seat{''} Debates based on a ranking of student
   designs along a common performance metric; and ``Design Manager Role
   Playing{''} where teams authorize or reject designs created by their
   peers. Based on survey responses, student impressions of the activities
   are mixed, but more students than not report that they feel the
   activities are effective in improving understanding of the course
   content and in developing critical analysis and evaluation skills.
   Activities in which students were given time to examine a small number
   of peer designs in depth, as opposed to a quick assessment of a large
   number of designs, were more positively regarded. The student
   assessments were generally found to correlate well with instructor and
   teaching assistant assessments (up to r = 0.67), similar to as has been
   reported elsewhere in the literature. By carefully phrasing the
   peer-to-peer assessment activities, and then evaluating the quality of
   the student assessments, it is believed the activities can be used to
   demonstrate, in part, several desired attributes for outcomes-based
   accreditation (such as problem analysis, investigation, design, and
   communication, for example).}},

Abstract = {{Instructors frequently ask themselves ``What are the best ways for an
   instructor to support student learning? How can we assist students in
   engaging in deep learning? How can we help them bridge the divide
   between theory and practice?
   This paper discusses efforts to address these issues in a course on
   Kinematics and Dynamics of Machinery. Kinematics and Dynamics of
   Machinery is a core course in the mechanical engineering curriculum. One
   of the challenges in this course is to make students fully appreciate
   mechanism design by integrating the principles of kinematics and
   dynamics in real world design practice. To assist with this goal,
   students were encouraged, early in the term, to discover real life
   examples of mechanisms with an aim to promote curiosity and foster
   interest in learning. Throughout the term, a design project was
   introduced which required students not only to apply fundamentals of
   kinematics and dynamics, but also to exercise skills in teamwork,
   collaborative learning and communication. A student survey was conducted
   at the end of the course and the efficacy of the approach was assessed.}},

Abstract = {{Utilization of radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to localize
   objects in real time requires the collection of the identities (IDs) of
   the tags within a short time. This paper presents a novel orthogonal
   group identification (Ogrid) method that addresses the above
   requirement. When queried, multiple tags with mutually orthogonal IDs
   respond, such that these tag IDs can be separated at the reader without
   using spread spectrum technique. Ogrid yields a small and fixed
   identification delays for any given tag ID size B. Ogrid is especially
   suitable for dense networks where the tag ID sizes are relatively short.
   In the case of B = 16 bits, which supports at most 65536 tags, Ogrid
   incurs a fixed identification delay of about 4 seconds regardless of the
   number of tags present, whereas several existing protocols incur average
   delays of 20 and 100 seconds to identify 10,000 and 50,000 tags,
   respectively. Results for a dynamic system with tag arrivals and
   departures further demonstrate the consistently low identification delay
   of Ogrid.}},

Abstract = {{The use of multiple antennas in a spatial multiplexing multiple-input
   multiple-output (SM-MIMO) system can increase the capacity linearly with
   the number of antennas, M. However, the radio-frequency (RF) chain
   associated with each antenna increases the system hardware cost
   considerably. Antenna selection is a signal processing technique that
   helps to reduce the system complexity and cost of the RF front-end. This
   paper describes the novel concept of transmit antenna selection method
   for the massively distributed antenna system, which is conceived as a
   technique to increase the data-rate beyond the Long Term Evolution (LTE)
   and LTE Advanced (LTEA) technologies. In this work, convex optimization
   is used to determine the optimum antennas for the massively distributed
   MIMO, to achieve the best compromise between the achievable capacity and
   system complexity. Specifically, the interior-point algorithm from
   optimization theory is utilized. For the case of an extremely large
   antenna array, we observe from the simulations that antenna selection is
   dependent only upon the large scale fading (LSF). So complexity of the
   antenna selection algorithm reduces to O(M) if the bucket sorting
   algorithm is employed. Simulation results confirm that our proposed
   method works well in a massively distributed antenna system, and its
   performance is close to the optimal antenna selection algorithm.}},

   Discharge currents were collected immediately after growth. The optical
   properties were studied with a Spectroscopic Ellipsometer, over a wide

   films for which the discharge current followed the known ``similar to
   -1{''} power dependence (characteristic of films that can sustain
   electric fields of MV/cm) have different optical properties as compared
   to films for which the discharge current is not represented by that
   function.
   Etching studies of the e-beam deposited Ta2O5 films, combined with
   reflectance measurements after each etch step, resulted in a shift in
   the reflectance spectrum as a function of film thickness, d. This
   empirical f versus d dependence (where f is the frequency corresponding
   to the reflectance minimum for each d) was used to calculate the
   energies of the 4d doublet of Ta+5 in Ta2O5.}},

Abstract = {{Slope monitoring plays an important role in the risk management of large
   open pit slopes. Geodetic prisms are often relied upon to delineate the
   boundaries of potential slope hazards; however the data can be limited
   by its point-measurement nature. Localized displacements at each prism
   may be misinterpreted when extended to the behavior of the entire slope,
   and important displacements between prisms may be overlooked. New
   technologies like ground-based radar can provide high resolution full
   area coverage of a slope in combination with near real-time acquisition
   and millimetre precision. As a line-of-sight instrument, however, these
   tools only provide data on displacement magnitudes and rates, but not
   directions, hence limiting their use in gaining understanding of the 3-D
   kinematics and behavior of the moving slope. Two ground-based synthetic
   aperture radar systems were simultaneously deployed at a mine site and
   continuous, line-of-sight displacement of an open pit slope was
   collected in ``stereo{''}. The displacement vectors were combined to
   create a pseudo 3-D displacement map of the slope. The data collected
   demonstrates that an improved understanding of the 3-D kinematics of a
   large rock slope can be achieved using advanced state-of-the-art
   monitoring techniques.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate and characterize haptic interaction in
   human-to-human handovers and identify key features that facilitate safe
   and efficient object transfer. Eighteen participants worked in pairs and
   transferred weighted objects to each other while we measured their grip
   forces and load forces. Our data show that during object transfer, both
   the giver and receiver employ a similar strategy for controlling their
   grip forces in response to changes in load forces. In addition, an
   implicit social contract appears to exist in which the giver is
   responsible for ensuring object safety in the handover and the receiver
   is responsible for maintaining the efficiency of the handover. Compared
   with prior studies, our analysis of experimental data show that there
   are important differences between the strategies used by humans for both
   picking up/placing objects on table and that used for handing over
   objects, indicating the need for specific robot handover strategies as
   well. The results of this study will be used to develop a controller for
   enabling robots to perform object handovers with humans safely,
   efficiently, and intuitively.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding subsurface shape, topography and roughness of icebergs and
   ice islands (large tabular icebergs) in the Canadian High Arctic is
   limited by a paucity of underwater ice terrain data. This information is
   critical for calibrating operational iceberg drift and deterioration
   models that aim to mitigate hazards to shipping and the offshore
   petroleum industry. Observations beneath icebergs and ice islands have
   been limited in part by the associated risks operating in close
   proximity to unstable targets and an inability to map the underside of
   the ice. In this work, we use a combination of three-dimensional digital
   terrain mapping sonar systems, including an interferometric sonar
   mounted on a small Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), to map portions
   of the sidewalls and the underside of Petermann Ice Island (PII)
   fragments in Lancaster Sound and Baffin Bay. The complete perimeter of a
   small free -drifting ice island fragment named Berghaus (0.13 km(2); up
   to 131 m thick), was mapped with surface vessel multib earn sonar and
   volume and mass estimated. Portions of the sidewalls of the free
   -drifting PII-Ba (15 km2; up to 106 m thick) and the grounded fragment
   PII-B (90 km(2); up to 102 m thick) were also mapped with surface vessel
   sonar. Subsurface roughness is compared between the three ice islands
   and shows relatively smooth surfaces at the scales analyzed (20 cm to 5
   m). PII-Ba was surveyed with a remotely operated vehicle (ROY) that
   revealed widespread `scallop' concavities on the order of 5-10 cm down
   the full depth of the sidewall. A small AUV, UBC-Gavia, was used to map
   a roughly 700 m x 500 m portion of the underside of PII-B and combined
   with a surface vessel sidewall survey produced a 3D terrain map of the
   underwater portion of the ice island. A highly eroded ice wall is
   revealed, showing a pronounced ice skirt indicative of intense surface
   wave erosion. The draft of the ice island increased from 30 m at the
   edge to 50 m at the furthest extent of the survey beneath the ice island
   with a relative uniform basal topography. While only a partial survey
   could be completed due to the vast size of the ice island, this work
   demonstrates a unique application of AUVs to contribute to improved
   understanding of the roughly 9/10ths of the ice that lies below the
   ocean surface. The ultimate goal of this project, to understand ice
   island drift and in situ melt and deterioration processes will require
   knowledge of the original glacier topography (pre-calving) and a
   re-survey of the ice islands over time, along with measurements of the
   external forcing on the fragments. Here we focus on the digital terrain
   mapping data which will provide the baseline for further studies and
   help improve operational iceberg drift and deterioration model
   parameterization of underwater shape, topography and surface roughness.}},

Abstract = {{Investigation of the horizontal and vertical variability of temperature
   and conductivity beneath the ice cover of a midsize (5 km(2)) temperate
   lake has shown the existence of a submerged cyclonic eddy. Eddies
   potentially play a role in under-ice mixing dynamics that have
   previously not been studied. Measurements of this feature were made with
   a Conductivity-Temperature Depth (CTD) sensor mounted on an autonomous
   underwater vehicle (AUV) deployed through the ice-cover. This eddy was
   relatively stable in size, location and density structure throughout the
   6-day observation period. The density gradients calculated from the
   measured temperature and conductivity field are in cyclogeostrophic
   balance. These observations support the growing body of work emphasizing
   the importance of Coriolis forces in smaller ice-covered lakes. In this
   paper we focus on the conductivity, which varied across the eddy and
   provide a closer examination of the salt excluded from the ice and the
   background conductivity in the surrounding waters. These conductivity
   data hint that salt exclusion may have played a role in forming the
   eddy.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate real-time registration of intra-operative ultrasound (US) to
   computed tomography (CT) remains a challenging problem. In orthopedic
   applications, a recent promising approach proposed the use of Gaussian
   mixture modeling for bone surface registration. Though relatively
   successful, the method relied on naive and error prone subsampling of
   the surfaces registered to reduce computational cost and also heavily
   relied on heuristically-set parameters for bone surface generation. In
   this paper, we present an improved approach employing a novel point
   simplification method that redistributes surface points to better
   represent the surface achieving near real-time registration with higher
   accuracy and robustness. We also present a framework for automating the
   parameter selection in the bone surface extraction step. For validation,
   we present extensive quantitative tests on phantom and clinical data
   obtained by scanning patients with pelvic ring fractures in the
   operating room. We show an 89\% average improvement in target
   registration error over the recent GMM registration based method.}},

Abstract = {{In this article an ultrasound elastography technology is reported which
   provides quantitative images of tissue elasticity from deep soft tissue.
   The technique is analogous to Magnetic Resonance Elastography in the use
   of external mechanical vibrations which can penetrate deep tissue.
   Multifrequency steady-state mechanical vibrations are applied to the
   tissue at the skin and tissue displacements are measured by a
   conventional ultrasound system. Absolute values of tissue elasticity are
   computed in real-time for each frequency and displayed to the physician.
   The quantitative elasticity images produced by the technology are
   validated with magnetic resonance elastography images as the gold
   standard on standard elasticity phantoms. Preliminary in-vivo data from
   healthy volunteers are presented which show the potential of the
   technology for clinical use. The system is currently being used in
   different clinical studies to image kidney fibrosis, liver fibrosis, and
   prostate cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Electrospun nanofibres have attracted much attention in wound care owing
   to their unique properties such as high surface area and porosity. Many
   current studies on nanofibres have demonstrated their feasibility over
   existing forms. However, the mainly supportive role of nanofibres in
   wound healing prevented them to become more useful in large area or
   chronic wounds, which are major medical challenges. In order for wound
   dressings to help regulate processes involved in wound healing,
   functional elements such as drugs can be incorporated into nanofibres.
   This study focuses on how to control drug release from nanofibres such
   that the optimal dosage can be achieved at the right timing to enhance
   therapeutic effects, using a hydrophilic model drug as an example.
   Electrospun PVA was chosen as the drug carrier, and was modified via
   crosslinking treatments to vary the fibre degradation rate. In addition,
   hydrophobic PCL layers were also added to the drug-carrying PVA to
   further limit drug release. Through these comparisons, the effects of
   fibre degradation and hydrophilicity of drug release control can be
   demonstrated. The results obtained in this study can be used as a guide
   for improving nanofibre drug carriers to achieve desirable release
   behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{A silicon racetrack resonator modulator, based on phase-match control,
   is proposed. The device is comprised of a straight waveguide
   evanescently coupled to a ring resonator in the shape of a racetrack. A
   PN junction, formed in the straight waveguide, is used to control the
   degree of phase-match in the coupler. Consequently, the coupling, and
   hence the power transmission, is controlled by the voltage across the PN
   junction. The predicted free spectral range and switching voltage are,
   respectively, 0.4 nm and 7.5 Volt, while the device dimensions are
   approximately 0.7 mm by 0.15 mm. The device behavior is analyzed using
   two different analytic approaches for the coupling, the results of which
   are compared to numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Development of large-scale photonic integrated circuits requires an
   accurate, simple, and space-efficient method for characterizing the
   optical losses of integrated optical components. Here we present a
   ring-resonator-based technique for transmission-loss measurement of
   integrated optical components. Y-branch splitters are used to
   demonstrate the concept. This measurement techique is based on
   characterizing the spectral response of a waveguide ring resonator with
   a number of Y-branches inserted inside the cavity. The measurement
   accuracy is intrinsically limited by the optical loss of the ring
   waveguide and is independent of fiber-to-waveguide coupling losses. The
   devices were fabricated using a CMOS-compatible silicon-on-insulator
   technology. Our results show that the proposed technique is promising
   for high-accuracy, high-efficiency characterization of optical losses.
   Limitations of and potential improvements to the technique are also

Abstract = {{Large, real-world graphs are famously difficult to process efficiently.
   Not only they have a large memory footprint but most graph processing
   algorithms entail memory access patterns with poor locality,
   data-dependent parallelism, and a low compute-to-memory access ratio.
   Additionally, most real-world graphs have a low diameter and a highly
   heterogeneous node degree distribution. Partitioning these graphs and
   simultaneously achieve access locality and load-balancing is difficult
   if not impossible.
   This paper demonstrates the feasibility of graph processing on
   heterogeneous (i.e., including both CPUs and GPUs) platforms as a
   cost-effective approach towards addressing the graph processing
   challenges above. To this end, this work (i) presents and evaluates a
   performance model that estimates the achievable performance on
   heterogeneous platforms; (ii) introduces TOTEM - a processing engine
   based on the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model that offers a
   convenient environment to simplify the implementation of graph
   algorithms on heterogeneous platforms; and, (iii) demonstrates TOTEM'S
   efficiency by implementing and evaluating two graph algorithms (PageRank
   and breadth-first search). TOTEM achieves speedups close to the model's
   prediction, and applies a number of optimizations that enable linear
   speedups with respect to the share of the graph offloaded for processing
   to accelerators.}},

   The model is examined for two different hydrophobic loadings. A new
   algorithm for displacing the fluid inside the porous medium is
   developed. The algorithm uses an effective pressure as a combination of
   capillary pressure and hydrodynamic pressure. The capillary pressure is
   a function of pore size distribution and the wettability characteristics
   of the medium while the hydrodynamic pressure is correlated to the local
   saturation of the pores. Thus, the algorithm automatically switches
   between the capillary driven and the viscous displacement mechanisms

Abstract = {{High-Pressure Direct-Injection (HPDI) combustion of Natural Gas can
   reduce the gaseous and Particulate Matter (PM) emissions compared to a
   conventional diesel engine. Upcoming EPA and EURO emission limits may
   restrict particle number as well as particle mass. In preparation for
   these upcoming limits, the PM mass, size and composition was studied
   from a heavy-duty Cummins ISX engine converted to HPDI operation. To
   characterize the PM emissions, tests were based around a mid-speed,
   high-load operating point. Injection timing, equivalence ratio, gas
   supply pressure, EGR \% and diesel injection mass were isolated and
   varied. PM emissions were characterized by the mobility size
   distribution, light scattering and filter loading. In addition a novel
   thermodenuder was used to determine the PM volatile fraction. It was
   found that EQR and EGR have the greatest effect on PM mass emissions and
   the correlations between these parameters are evaluated. The mean
   particles size and number concentrations are again most effected by EGR
   and EQR with smaller effects from the GRP and diesel pilot. The size
   distributions of the parameter variations are similar and there are no
   nucleation mode ultrafine particles observed. The volatile fraction is
   fairly constant across the parameter variations and is found to be
   around 18\% of the mass and 11\% by number of particles at this high
   load condition.}},

Abstract = {{A phenomenological model (called here ``Slice Model{''}) has been
   developed to simulate non-premixed gas jet flames including soot
   formation in the domain. The Slice Model is based on the self-similarity
   solution of gas jets and forced to satisfy momentum, mass and energy
   balances in every cross section. The Slice Model can predict the
   velocity, mass fraction and temperature field of non-reacting and
   reacting jets over a wide range of changes in the jet parameters. A
   sub-model for soot formation based on Hiroyasu' model is applied to
   predict soot formation in non-premixed flames. Cantera, an open-source
   chemical kinetics software, is integrated with the Slice Model to
   predict the temperature distribution (based on equilibrium composition)
   of reacting jets. The soot formation prediction of the Slice Model is
   compared with experimental data in the literature. For velocity, soot
   mass fraction and temperature, agreement with experiment is about as
   good as it is for the much more computationally intensive RANS CFD
   simulations. On this basis, the Slice Model is promising as the core of
   a non-premixed natural gas engine simulation package under development.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes alternatives to carbon-based fuels, including
   `clean' electric locomotive technology. Electrification of the North
   American railway network leaves many questions to be researched, such
   as: sufficient power capacity, `clean' sources, distribution costs,
   infrastructure costs, logistics issues, legislative barriers, and
   resulting changes to business practises. A comprehensive review of
   incentives, logistics, and barriers was done to shed some light on
   emerging research needs to fill knowledge gaps in time to sustain
   industry competitiveness, and to meet the demands of a more sustainable
   future for North American freight, commuter, and tourism rail.
   Given prohibitively high costs and logistics of rail electrification,
   North American researchers have started focusing on ultra-capacitors and
   batteries. Previous research suggests that a hybrid capacitor/battery
   equipped locomotive would work, all within the existing envelope of
   locomotive chassis, and with much lower infrastructure costs. The
   transition in NA would be faster, at a much lower cost, including high
   speed passenger rail. However, no one has yet done the necessary
   research to verify this hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Most of architects prefer to integrate steel columns with partition
   walls in order to provide as much unobstructed open space as possible.
   In the case of wall intersections or corners, the required column size
   based on load demands may be larger than the wall assembly. As a result,
   architects have to deal with irregular corners which, in schools and
   correctional facilities, are prohibited due to their potential hazard to
   the occupancies. To resolve the issue, composite crisscross
   concrete-filled steel tubular columns (CCCSTCs) have been proposed to
   better integrate with wall layouts. Concrete is used to fill the steel
   column in order to increase the axial and buckling capacities. Four
   half-scaled specimens of such columns have been constructed and tested.
   Three of the four specimens were geometrically and structurally
   identical, but had a varying axial compressive load. When subjected to
   cyclic loads, all three specimens failed by rupture of the steel tube
   column at the column-beam connection. The fourth specimen was designed
   to ensure strong-column weak-beam behaviour, which has been verified by
   the test result. Numerical component models of the specimens were
   created and calibrated using the experimerital hysteresis curves.
   Numerical system models incorporating the calibrated component models
   were then constructed to perform nonlinear dynamic analysis and to
   simulate CCCSTCs as the earthquake force resisting system. The
   simulations indicated that inter-storey drift ratio decreased with
   increasing axial compression ratio. Earthquake displacement demands were
   reduced for a system designed using a strong-column weak-beam approach.}},

Abstract = {{Consolidated information from multiple sources (patient monitors,

   hypotheses were tested, that integrated information displays (a) improve
   nurses' satisfaction and (b) lower perceived mental workload. Methods.
   In a counter-balanced, repeated measures design (integrated vs.
   traditional display) 12 ICU nurses performed realistic tasks using both
   display types. Results. Nurses' user interaction satisfaction was higher
   with the integrated display and it received more positive comments.
   Nurses' mean perceived mental workload scores were also lower, having
   significant differences in effort and frustration dimensions. A lower
   mental workload may reduce errors and improve treatment times.
   Integrated information displays have great promise, but technological
   factors such as bidirectional device communication must be addressed if
   these displays are to achieve their potential for improving patient
   safety.}},

Abstract = {{Field experiments were conducted to assess the influence of plant growth
   and amendment addition on phytostabilisation of copper (Cu), lead (Pb),
   manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) along highway soil in southwest British
   Columbia, Canada. The plant species tested were Lolium perenne L
   (perennial rye grass), Festuca rubra L. (creeping red fescue) and Poa
   pratensis L. (Kentucky blue grass) and the amendments, lime and
   phosphate. The treatment efficiencies were assessed during different
   seasons as a completely randomized factorial experiment in split plot
   design. The research tasks involved: (1) quantifying the seasonal extent
   of metal accumulation in soil and assessing the seasonal impact on metal
   speciation for different soil amendments and plant species; (2)
   determining seasonal accumulation differences between sampling periods
   in plant parts; and (3) assessing the influence of root-soil
   interactions on metal dynamics. The amendments decreased the
   exchangeable fraction and plant uptake of all four metals. The lowest
   mobile fractions (exchangeable and carbonate bound) were found in soils
   growing Festuca for Cu, Lolium for Mn and a Lolium/Poa/Festuca
   combination for Pb and Zn. Metal accumulation and metal dynamics in the
   rhizosphere soil are compared with those of the bulk soil. The final
   outcome was the development of a remediation strategy for all four
   metals involving suitable plants and amendments and incorporating
   seasonal and rhizosphere influences.}},

   quantitative macroscopic and molecular level analysis of the methane
   hydrate decomposition process with an emphasis on elucidating
   microscopic details and how they affect the predicted rate of methane
   hydrate decomposition in natural methane hydrate reservoirs. A
   quantitative criterion is used to characterize the decomposition of the

   methanol is investigated under relatively moderate reaction conditions
   (240-270 degrees C/10 MPa) with residence time of 15-45 min and methanol
   to oil weight ratio of 1:1, 1.5:1 or 2:1. The effects of reaction
   conditions on the biodiesel yield were studied using design of
   experiments (DOE). The results showed that reaction time, temperature,
   and their interaction were the most significant factors on the yield.
   The highest biodiesel yield of 102\% was achieved at 270 degrees C, 10
   MPa, and methanol/oil weight ratio of 2 for 45 min reaction time. The
   GC-MS analysis of the reaction products showed that the by-product,
   glycerol, further reacted with methanol, generating methyl ethers of
   glycerol. Further confirmation of this side reaction was obtained by
   reacting glycerol and methanol at 270 degrees C/10 MPa for 15, 30, and
   45 min. The experimental results showed these reactions could positively
   affect the overall biodiesel yield by providing oxygenated compounds
   such as 3-methoxy-1,2-propanediol, dimethoxymethane, and
   2,2-dimethoxypropane as well as methyl palmitate and methyl oleate. (C)

Abstract = {{We study displacement and strain measurement error of dual transducers
   (two linear arrays, aligned orthogonally and coplanar). Displacements
   along the beam of each transducer are used to obtain measurements in
   two-dimensions. Simulations (5 MHz) and experiments (10 MHz) are
   compared to measurements with a single linear array, with and without
   angular compounding. Translation simulations demonstrate factors of 1.07
   larger and 8.0 smaller biases in the axial and lateral directions
   respectively, for dual transducers compared to angular compounding. As
   the angle between dual transducers decreases from 90 degrees to 40
   degrees, for 1\% compression simulations, the lateral RMS error ranges
   from 2.1 to 3.9 mu m compared to 9 mu m with angular compounding.
   Simulation of dual transducer misalignment of 1 mm and 2 degrees result
   in errors of less than 9 mu m. Experiments demonstrate factors of 3.0
   and 5.2 lower biases for dual transducers in the axial and lateral
   directions respectively compared to angular compounding. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{This study predicts the shear strength of steel fiber reinforced
   concrete (SFRC) beams based on existing experimental results. A large
   database containing 222 shear strength tests of SFRC beams without
   stirrups was divided into six different groups based on their span-depth
   ratio (a/d >= 3 or a/d < 3), concrete compressive strength (f(c)' >= 50
   or.f(c)' < 50) and steel fiber shapes (hooked, crimped and plain) and
   was used to develop separate equations for predicting their respective
   shear strength. The proposed equations were obtained by performing both
   linear and non-linear regression analysis on each database. A
   statistical analysis was then performed to compare the proposed
   equations to those of the previously developed equations by other
   researchers for predicting the shear strength of SFRC beams. Overall, it
   was observed that the linear regression equations developed from this
   research for SFRC database could accurately predict the shear strength
   compared to the other previously proposed models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
